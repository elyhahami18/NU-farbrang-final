<b>The Law of the Stringency of the Prohibition of Idolatrous Wine and Who Prohibits it with their Touch (Paragraph 123):</b><br>It is forbidden to derive benefit from wine that was poured in front of idolatry, as it is written (Deuteronomy 32:38), "They ate the fat of their sacrifices, they drank the wine of their libation." So it is compared to the sacrifices of idolatry. But their standard (<i>stam</i> wine is permitted by the Torah, even to drink. However the Sages decreed to forbid drinking [it], on account of [it leading to marrying] their daughters. And so that they not err and say that even actual idolatrous wine is only forbidden to drink, that is why they decreed that their standard wine be forbidden with regard to benefit. And this decree is from the 18 things that even if Eliyahu came, it would not help to permit this prohibition, since all of the Jewish people has already accepted [it] upon themselves. And even though this prohibition of their standard wine is light in the eyes of people and they compare it to other rabbinic prohibitions; in fact, the prohibition is very stringent. And one who drinks their standard wine uproots his soul from the place within which its holiness is rooted, in the guarded wine and in his grapes, and he has no share in the world to come. And the kabbalists spoke at length about this punishment, and a distinct book, called Guarded Wine, was written about it. And the hair on the flesh of the person who reads this book will bristle from the greatness of the punishment! And they wrote that it is a tradition in their hands that one who drinks their standard wine will certainly stumble to have sexual relations with an Aramean (gentile), just like the Sages decreed [the prohibition about] their wine on account of their daughters. (And so is it found in the Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot.) And in the Sefer Zichronot of the pious Rabbi Shmuel Abuhov, he also writes at length about its punishment. Hence every person should be very careful about this for his soul, so he will merit the meals of Leviathan and the guarded wine. But if he stumbles and drinks idolatrous wine, he should fast at least five fasts corresponding to  the five times that [grape] vine is in the Torah (besides [in] Deuteronomy), confess and not drink [it] anymore. (The end of Paragraph 123.)
