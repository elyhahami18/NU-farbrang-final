Peninei Halakhah, Shemitah and Yovel

Introduction

1. I thank Hashem who has given me the privilege to learn and teach Torah and now has enabled me to finish writing the laws of Shemita and the main laws of Yovel. These two topics contain within them the prime values of the Torah, in sync with the fundamental Jewish concept of revealing the hidden layers of Godliness in all realms.
