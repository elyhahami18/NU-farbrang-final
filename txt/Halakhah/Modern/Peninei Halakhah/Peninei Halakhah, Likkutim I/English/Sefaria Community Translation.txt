The Laws of the Synagogue: Location
Since a synagogue is considered a "small sanctuary," a place where God's presence dwells, our sages determined that its location should be on the highest point in the city. This elevation symbolizes its status as the most revered and significant building for all to see.  If multiple synagogues are built, each should be placed on the highest point within its immediate vicinity.
It is forbidden for any other building to surpass the synagogue in height.  Our sages teach, "Any city whose rooftops are higher than the synagogue will eventually be destroyed," as it is said, "To exalt the House of our God and to build its ruins" (Ezra 9:9).
The eternal nature of the Jewish people stems from our unwavering prioritization of spiritual and timeless values. Throughout history, our people have endured immense suffering to sanctify God's name rather than abandon our faith. This unwavering commitment to eternal belief is the key to our own eternal existence, allowing us to withstand the tumultuous tides of history.  While countless nations have risen and fallen, the Jewish people endure. 
This very faith should be reflected in the location and construction of the synagogue, which should stand as the tallest structure. While our homes provide shelter, sustenance, and rest, serving primarily our material needs, the synagogue connects us with eternal values.  Therefore, our sages cautioned that a city where rooftops surpass the synagogue in height will ultimately face destruction.  Such a place, where materialistic pursuits overshadow spiritual aspirations, lacks the enduring strength of the spirit and is destined for ruin. 
However, in our time, a significant challenge has arisen. With advancements in technology and science, the human population has surged, leading many to urban centers.  Accommodating this growth necessitates the construction of high-rise buildings, which inevitably surpass synagogues in height.  This raises the question: Is this practice permissible?
The Meiri, a prominent medieval scholar, wrote in his commentary on Tractate Megillah that the prohibition against constructing buildings taller than a synagogue applies specifically when these structures are built for vanity and prestige.  Such buildings undermine the honor of the synagogue.  However, if the purpose of constructing tall buildings is to house a growing population, there is no disrespect towards the synagogue, and this practice is permissible. The Meiri's interpretation seems to align with the views of other prominent commentators like the Arukh, Ran, and Rambam. Several later authorities also cite the Meiri's ruling as halakha (Jewish law). Therefore, constructing a building taller than a synagogue is not prohibited today if its purpose is to provide housing or workspaces. 
Nevertheless, we remain obligated to honor the synagogue to the best of our ability.  Firstly, we should strive to construct synagogues on the highest available ground within their vicinity.  Secondly, we should design them with the utmost dignity and grandeur, reflecting their paramount importance to us – surpassing community centers, social clubs, and even our own homes.

Anyone who has paid attention to it has certainly noticed that there are differences in the way that a mezuzah is affixed. There are places where the mezuzah is affixed upright, vertically, and there are [other] places where the mezuzah is affixed diagonally.
The difference in customs is rooted in the understanding of a discussion in the Talmud (Menachot 33a). According to the opinion of Rashi, Rambam, and most of the decisors, the mezuzah must be affixed upright, its top upwards and its bottom downwards at a fully straight angle; and if one placed it horizontally, he has not fulfilled the obligation. And this is that which the sages said, "If he made it like a bolt, it is invalid." However, according to the opinion of Rabbenu Tam, the understanding is the opposite, and one needs to specifically affix the mezuzah lying down, meaning horizontally. And if he affixed it vertically, meaning upright, he has not fulfilled the obligation. 
In practice, the Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh Deah 266:6) decided like the opinion of most decisors, that the mezuzah needs to be upright. And that is the practice of the Sepharadim.
But Ashkenazim and Moroccan Jews follow the practice of affixing the mezuzah diagonally, with its top leaning inwards towards the house and its bottom leaning outwards. And their reason is that since the opinion of Rabbenu Tam about an upright mezuzah is that one has not fulfilled the obligation, it is desirable, ab initio, also to take his opinion into account and to affix the mezuzah diagonally, such that one fulfills the obligation according to both approaches. As on the one hand, it is not upright, but on the other, it is not lying down horizontally. 
And it should be noted that since according to the opinion of most decisors, the mezuzah needs to be upright — even according to the Ashkenazi custom, we do not affix the mezuzah completely diagonally but rather in such a way that it is more upright than it is lying down. And it should be understood that even according to the Ashkenazi custom, in a situation where it is impossible to affix it diagonally, it should be affixed upright like the opinion of the Shulchan Arukh.
