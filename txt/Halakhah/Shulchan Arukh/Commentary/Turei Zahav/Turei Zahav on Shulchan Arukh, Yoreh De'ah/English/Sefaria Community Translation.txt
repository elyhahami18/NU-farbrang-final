1. The Rash"al, Chapter 25, Siman 100 holds differently on this and on what the Rambam and the Mordechai wrote; (the Rash"al's) opinion is to be strict regarding benefit. And all we have are the words of the Rishonim and Achronim.
2. In the Tur it is written [as] "...but Kosher meat in impure milk or the opposite...and wild animal meat, etc." - these prohibitions are rabbinical and it is permitted to cook them. The Beis Yosef concludes that if one Min (kind) is tamei, this is forbidden to be eaten according to Torah law. And why was a decree of Meat and Milk applied to it with regard to eating. The Drisha and my teacher and father in law, of blessed memory, reconcile that there is a practical difference that this decree was made to apply the din of "Piece itself becomes Unkosher" to it. That's the logic of Rabbeinu Efraim in Siman 92. That we only say this regarding Meat and Milk. The rabbis are not correct in this, their honor intact, that the primary reason that Rabbeinu Efraim was stringent regarding Meat and Milk is that each one itself is allowed. It is only prohibited when it's mixed and becomes one body. Like the Beis Yosef brings in the name of Tosefos in Siman 82. It is not relevant in a case where one of the them is impure because anyways there is a Torah prohibition on it. If so, it should be like any other prohibition. You can't say that the Rabbis enacted a decree on this to apply the law of "piece that becomes unkosher" because of other Meat and Milk from the Torah. For if so, the decree should have applied even regarding cooking and benefit since anyways there is a Torah prohibition against eating. They are stringent regard mixtures here too they should have been strigent in this. From these things, there is a difficulty even what my teacher and father in law, of blessed memory, wrote. That there is practical difference in the case of "a piece fitting to be honoured" as mentioned in Shulchan Aruch Siman 101. If it is prohibited because it receices the flavour, it is nullified excpet regard Meat and Milk. Even this is not at all right because the stringency of Meat and Milk there is a practical difference from the reason of "a piece that becomes unkosher", as explained by the Beis Yosef, there in the name of the Toras HaBais (Rashba) and the "..." and the Sefer HaTerumah. Since that the Meat and Milk become cooked, it becomes one body of prohibition. In contract to other prohibitions...

3. In the Beis Yosef it is written, that in any case one should not eat fish with milk because of the danger [associated with it]. And this is done to limit the danger. And it was needed to be said "with meat" as that was mentioned in Orach Chaim Siman 173, and such was also written in the Darchei Moshe, in that the Beis Yosef intervenes meat and milk here with the old ways, as it was in the Beis Yosef['s time] and this is not correct.

For example, forbidden fat...: With the vowel tzereh [clarifying the word as "forbidden fat" instead of "milk"] because it is mixed with meat, it is a type with not its type.
2. A Non-Jew Should Taste It.  It is written in the Drisha that since a Jew is forbidden to taste it, it follows that when buying a peice of meat that might not be salted it would be forbidden to lick it to taste for whether it was salted or not.  However we see in Siman 42 concerning a gallbladder that it is recommended to to lick it to taste for blood.  Therefore, we must say that licking to taste doesnt constitute a problem if we are dealing with a doubtful situation.  Therefore, by a gallbladder it would be permitted to lick for taste as written in the Beit Yosef quoting the Mordechai. The issue that arises here from the mixutre of forbidden fats and kosher meat is different in that there needs to be an actual consumption of the mixture to ascertain whether there is flavor of the prohitted item, therefore we require the tasting of a non-jew.  Bolstering this distinction, we see in the laws of Fasting O''C 567 that licking to taste is permitted as long as there isnt a full on comsuption.  When the S'A says to have a non-jew taste, the assumption is that it is even the usage of a non- 'Kfeila (professional chef)' based on the Beit Yosef's understanding of the expression used by the Raavad, in the laws of forbidden foods, of 'non-jew' to the exclusion of 'Kfeila'.  If so, it must be that the mechanism of usability of the non-jewish non-chef as a taste barometer is the concept of 'Mesiach Le'fi Tumo' - 'story telling' or 'innocently', that is: without being prompted with the knowledge that his answer will dictate the permissibility or prohibtion of the questionable mixture at hand. See the Beit Yosef in the name of the Rashba.  The Ra'ah asks in the Bedek Habayit: "Mesiach Le'fi Tumo' is only applied when dealing with the integrity status of a women in captivity as it serves a clarification of events. The Terumat Hadeshen shares this quandry in Siman 79, to which he answers that the whether 'the taste of something being its essence - Taam Kikar' is not a biblical prohibition, therefore, in categories of rabbinic prohibitions 'Mesiach le'fi tumo' would suffice to clarify the doubt at hand.  The Beit Yosef writes in the name of the Torat Habayit Extended Version that he agrees with Rabbeinu Tam (who holds that Taam Kikar is Biblical) which could be limited to that case law in discussion, but would disagree to the biblical nature of Taam K'Ikar and rather follows the opinions of Rashi and Rambam that it is of a Rabbinic nature.  Perhaps this line of thought is what the Beit Yosef is following when he allows relying on Rambam and Rashba for trusting a non-jewish non-chef speaking innocently.  However, this point of contention is already discussed in the decisions of the Ra'i siman 130 regarding establishing the status of a first born animal. The Ra'i quotes the Rosh that a non-jew inncently relating that the animal in question is a first born is believed as long as the statement doesn't increase the value of the animal.  On this the Ra'i asks that we should only limit the trustworthiness of a non-jew to cases of women, as mentioned above.  To this he answers that according to the Rashba and the Rosh as found in the chapter of "HaGozel",  the inability to apply 'Mesiach Lefi Tumo' to Biblical probitions is for required testimony, unlike the clarification nature of testimony in 'Issur V'Heter', as we do find that a single witness is believed to permit the prohibited and therefore 'Mesiach Lefi Tumo' is sufficient.  This also fits well as we see that a non-jewish professional chef is believed even if asked directly, which would be prohibited if applied the biblical nature of testimony to 'Issur V'Heter' and not clarification nature of the testimony.  However, at the end of the day the S'A 316 decided that we don't rely on innocent storytelling in establishing the first-born status of an animal and that 'Mesiah Lefi Tumo' is insufficient when the issue at hand is Biblical.     The Tur writes: "So does my father the Rosh write: 'It is required...'"  The B'Y understands the Tur's quote of the Rosh is unclear whether 'Kfeila' is needed or not.  This is difficult to understand as the Rosh himself is very careful with his words and since he specifically mentions 'Professional Chef' we can exclude a non-jewish non-chef.  What would follow according to the Rosh is that if the non-jew knew we were relying on his statement for something other than 'Issur V'Heter' it is considered 'Lefi Tumo' unlike other cases (testimony of a woman) which 'Lefi Tumo' doesn't help. 
 <b>If one type [of food] was mixed with its own type:</b> The conclusion of the decisors is that a type that was mixed with its own type is nullified from the Torah with just a majority, as it is stated (Exodus 23:2), "to follow the majority." However rabbinically, they required sixty [times as much as what is not kosher]. Hence when there is a doubt, such as that which spilled out, we are lenient and say that there was sixty there. However with a type of food in something that is not its own type, it requires sixty from the Torah, since we [otherwise] feel the taste of that which is forbidden in that which is permissible. Hence when there is a doubt, we are stringent.




As a preface to we will explain the difference between the Beit Yosef and the Rama in understanding the Tur.  This is the verbiage of the Tur: "...And if the amount of the Issur is known, e.g., A new spoon that is used to stir one olive's worth of milk and is subsequently used to stir a meat dish within 24 hours, then 60 times the volume of only the one olive's worth that was absorbed is needed to nullify the prohibited mixture.  However, an old spoon used many times to stir an indeterminate volume requires a nullification of 60 times the volume of the whole spoon."

Siman 99

<b>"Forbidden bones join in (with the permitted food)."</b><br><br>This is because the forbidden bones, although not fit for consumption themselves, still absorb the forbidden taste through cooking. Thus, they are considered to join in and nullify the forbidden food since the forbidden flavor spreads into them. Furthermore, these bones also contain moisture that could confuse the forbidden taste absorbed from the forbidden meat.<br><br><b>The question of the Magen Avraham</b> (<i>M"A</i>) on the <b>Rema</b> (<i>R. Moses Isserles</i>), who stated in <b>Talmud Torah</b> that even clay vessels require 60 times their volume against the forbidden substance, is that the bones should be considered like the clay vessels in this context. The question is why forbidden bones are not treated like a piece of meat that is attached to the forbidden meat, which is treated as having a nullification of 60 times its volume.<br><br><b>The response</b> is that the bone is comparable to a utensil. According to the ruling in <b>Shulchan Arukh</b>, a utensil does not require a 60 times volume nullification if it is a metal utensil, according to the opinions of the <b>Mordechai</b>. Since the bone can be separated from the forbidden meat, and we follow the ruling that utensils of bone can be purged through immersion (<i>hag’alah</i>), the bone should be treated similarly, and it is considered to join with the permitted food.<br><br>Therefore, in this case, the bone does not require 60 times its volume in the mixture and is considered to join with the permitted food.<br><br><i>This explanation clarifies the stance that although forbidden bones themselves are not edible, they still participate in the nullification of the forbidden taste they have absorbed, similar to how utensils can be purified through specific methods.</i>

"We do not say on the 29th of Adar" etc. The reason given (Terumat HaDeshen siman 292) is that all cases which depend on a number of days qualify for us to say part of the last day is equivalent to a full last day. This is not the case by mourning [one's parents] which in all cases requires [a full] twelve months. If one were to say, "part of it is like all of it," one would only be required to mourn a small part of the last month, and this is obviously not correct.
