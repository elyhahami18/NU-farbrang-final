The Taz writes that there is also no issue of forbidding eating the limb of a live animal. Also there is no issue of slaughtering it and it's mother [on the same day] and it is permissible to slaughter it on the same day as its mother and father.

 The Tur writes that there is no difference whether they are milking for themselves or for the benefit of a Jew (and this is the consensus of the poskim).

For ornamentation. And there is another version: for an idol worshipper. Both are words of the Living God, for since the verse emphasizes the act of creation, there is no difference [between these interpretations], according to the Shakh. And the Taz writes: "One might ask, why do we need the form of four faces together—after all, even the form of a human alone is forbidden." The Ra'an explained that one might think that by combining other forms with the human form, it would be permitted, but the teaching comes to show us that it is still forbidden. However, there is a difficulty: if so, then if one made a form of a human with one or two of these four faces, it should also be permitted, since it is neither the form of a human alone nor of four faces. But it does not seem reasonable to permit such a thing, for if this were allowed, surely the commentators would not have kept silent about informing us that it is permitted. Rather, it seems that the practical distinction is in a case where parts were removed, so that only fixing the human form alone would not help, and one would need to reduce the form of all the faces, end quote. (And in Nequdat HaKesef it is written that the words of the Ra’an are cited in Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 24b and by Ramak, as brought by the Kesef Mishneh).


Sunk. Even in the heavens they are "sunk." The Shakh writes: "It appears that all the forms that we forbid are only forbidden if they are complete forms—for example, a human form with two eyes, a full nose, the entire body, and similar characteristics. But half a figure, as some artists sometimes depict one side of the form, is not forbidden." End quote. The Taz writes in the name of the Ramban that anything forbidden by the Torah under "You shall not make with Me," such as the four faces in the dwelling place of the Divine Presence, the images of angels, the sun, the moon, etc., applies equally to both engraved (sunk) and raised (protruding) forms, and all are forbidden. In terms of the law, although the wording of the author does not imply this stringency, one should not be lenient at all in opposition to the Ramban; likewise, the Tur concludes this way, as does the Ran. End quote.
