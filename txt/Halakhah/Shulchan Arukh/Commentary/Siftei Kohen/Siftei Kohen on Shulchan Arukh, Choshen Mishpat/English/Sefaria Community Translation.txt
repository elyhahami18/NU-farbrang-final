In my humble opinion, the Rama’s words are imprecise, and from what he wrote that “so long as the agent is a thug”, it seems that he understood what the Bet Yosef wrote in the name of Tosafot that this only applies if he is a thug and a quarreler, that he joins fights that are not his, meaning that the agent is a thug. And in my humble opinion, this is incorrect. For either way one looks at it: If what the agent claims is true, why should it matter if he is a thug and a quarreler? And if, because of him being a thug and quarrelling, his claim would be false, or he causes someone to win illegally, why make the case that he joins fights that are not his? We can know this to be the case that it is obvious that an agent cannot make false claims, and this is not only dependant on the agent, for obviously even the plaintiff himself cannot make false claims, as the Mordechai writes in the Chapter Hamafkid of the Responsa Maharam who was asked by them if the agent representing the court can make any claim he can, to deceive even regarding something he knows is false, [and he answered] that God-forbid he should do such a thing, to be a sinner, regarding a matter that is not his, or even for himself, he is not allowed to lie.  This is obvious. Rather, the intention of Tosafot is to say that sometimes the lender does not want to go to court with the borrower, since the borrower is unyielding and a quarreller, and he does not wish to fight with him. If so, that is the case of the agent who has not done well, to get involved in fights that are not his, for what is it to him, let the lender himself sue. But when the case is that he toiled to bring his fellow his money, which his fellow was unable to toil to do, he has done a mitzvah, for his fellow could not toil like he could. And this is implied by Tosafot’s language there, that they write that “he who comes as an agent, when he does it because he is unyielding and a quarreler…” And similarly it is implied in the Kesef Mishnah that the intention of Tosafot is that the borrower is the unyielding one, see there. And according to this, it seems that the Raavad and the Tur and the Mechaber do not argue with Tosafot, that on the contrary, they are of the same mind, that any agent who does  it because the sender could not, such being a difficult thing for the sender but not the agent, or that the sender is in another city, and such similar things, it is a mitzvah to do it. But if they are in the same city, and the sender could do it, but doesn’t because against his will the borrower was unyielding and a quarreler. If so, he should not get involved in fights not his. And also the words of the Bet Yosef seem this way, see there what he wrote, “And it seems to me that both of them are there…”
