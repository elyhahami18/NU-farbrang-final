Regarding the depiction of the sun. [See Ba'er Hetev. Also see the responsa of Chatam Sofer, Section 129, concerning a synagogue designed with a round glass window in the shape of the sun, with prominent rays around the circle resembling the sun's rays at sunrise, and with the name of God (YHVH) inscribed within it. Beside it was written 'From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is praised.' The Chatam Sofer writes that two wrongs were mistakenly committed here: It is explained in Shach, Section 141, Subsection 8, that although benefiting from a sun-shaped object one finds is permitted, nonetheless creating one is a Torah prohibition, and keeping it is a rabbinic prohibition due to suspicion. Even in public, it is certainly inappropriate, and this case is even worse, as the phrase 'From the rising of the sun…' is written beside it, making it clear that it was intended to represent the actual sun. This is worse than what the Taz stated (in Ba'er Hetev, Subsection 23) regarding the images of zodiac signs in prayer books, and even those authorities who permit that would agree here. Secondly, even if 'From the rising of the sun…' was not written beside it, it still represents anthropomorphism, especially in a sacred space, and positioned in the east where all bow upon entering the synagogue. Certainly, this is inappropriate. Therefore, it seems to me that anyone who can remove this would be blessed with the sun of righteousness, bringing healing in its wings. See there.]



And regarding images drawn on the wall. See the book Yaarot Devash, Part 1, Discourse 2, where he strongly warns against having any depiction on the wall or on a board within the home, even though, according to the law, there is no prohibition unless the depiction is raised (three-dimensional). Nevertheless, it is advisable to be cautious. See there.

It was not forbidden. See in She'elat Ya'avetz, Part 1, Section 170, regarding an incident that occurred in Amsterdam when Rabbi Elazar, of blessed memory, was appointed as the head of the rabbinic court there. A certain man took it upon himself to make his mark known in the world, meaning he minted a silver coin with an engraved likeness of his own figure, from the head down to the chest, with a clearly defined facial image in relief. The author elaborates that this is a serious and unequivocal prohibition, involving a double transgression: one being the Torah prohibition 'Do not make with Me,' and additionally due to suspicion, as it is forbidden even if others made it for him. The reasoning of 'public need' does not apply here, as a coin circulates widely and one might keep it privately. And although the Rosh wrote that a head without a body involves no prohibition for either making or possessing it, his intent was regarding a featureless, solid head with no discernible facial features. In such a case, it clearly does not resemble a full body. However, a head and body together in human form, even if the features are only roughly outlined, appears as a full human figure standing upright and is forbidden. Certainly, a human facial image alone is clearly forbidden. Even though some authorities argue that coins are considered debased, it is difficult to rely on this to permit it, as our eyes see that they are in fact respected (see earlier, subsection 3, from the responsa of Knesset Yehezkel). Furthermore, the Rashba’s opinion is that there is no difference between honored and debased items in the case of a human figure, and others agreed with him. See there, where he discusses this matter at length


One should not make. See the book Tiferet L'Moshe, where it is written that if a non-Jew made it for him, it is permitted to live in the house and to use the lamp and table. See there.
