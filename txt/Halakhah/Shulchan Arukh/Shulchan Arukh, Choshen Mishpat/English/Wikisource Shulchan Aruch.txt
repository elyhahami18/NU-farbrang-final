The ruling on someone who goes to his friend's house and on someone who brings goods to another city. It contains seven sections: If one of the members of an unopened alleyway- there are those who say that one does not have the power to object in an alleyway and all these laws only apply to courtyards- was to become a doctor, craftsman, blood-letter, document scribe or non-Torah schoolteacher, the other members of the alleyway can object because additional people will be entering and exiting the courtyard. Even if every member of the alley would agree except for one, that one person may stop him. Similarly, if one owns a house in a courtyard-partnership, he may not rent to any of these individuals. To sell to such people, however, there are those who say it is permitted and the members of the alley will then litigate with the purchaser, provided, however, that he may not sell to a gentile who will not listen to the judgement.
Neighbors in a courtyard can object to a store in the courtyard and say they cannot sleep because of the sound of the people entering and exiting. Rather, he must do his work in his store and sell in the market. They cannot, however, object and say we cannot sleep because of the sound of the hammer or mill once he has already established his behavior and they did not object. There are those who say that even initially one cannot object to what someone does in his own store and home. This is only applies to healthy individuals. If they are sick and the sound damages them, however, they may object.
Similarly, one can teach Torah to Jewish children in his home and the neighbors cannot object and say we cannot sleep because of the sound of the children. The same applies to any mitzvah activities and the neighbors cannot object.
If one member of an alleyway or courtyard become a craftsman and none of the others objected because he was already established, and people were entering and exiting and the other members were silent, he would not obtain any rights. The other members have the right at any time to say they cannot sleep because of the sound of people entering and existing, because this damage is like smoke and dust, which one cannot obtain rights to.
Members of an alleyway may force each other not to have among them a tailor, tanner or any other craftsman. If there was such a craftsman in the alleyway and no one objected, or if there was a bathhouse, store or mill and another member came and made another one opposite the existing one, the current owner cannot stop him and say he is cutting of his livelihood. Even if the new individual is from another alleyway, they cannot stop him because they already have that craftsman among them. There are many that say that in the case of a courtyard or an alleyway that is not open, they would be able to object, even in such a case. The craftsman himself, however, would not be able to object and say you are cutting off my livelihood. If one who lives in another country and wants to set up a store next to this store or a bathhouse next to this bathhouse, however, the members would be able to prevent him. If he pays government taxes with them, they would not be able to stop him. There are many who say that even in such a case he has no right to enter any alleyway that has people from his trade, because a member of that trade has the right to prevent him from entering since he is from another city. In the case of another alleyway, however, he cannot object because the new individual pays taxes. The people of the city have the right to object in all cases and say we cannot sleep because of the sound of people entering, notwithstanding the fact that they already have such a craftsman. If one did not yet pay taxes and now he wants to work and will pay taxes, there are those who say his fellow craftsman can stop him until he rents a house and becomes like a member of the city. There are those that say that one who gives the “king’s gift” is not considered to have paid taxes, until he gives taxes to the ruler of this particular city that has jurisdiction over them. In all these cases, there is no distinction between a scholar and others, other than in the case of peddlers which will be discussed shorty. There are those that say that if the people of the city need the scholar’s Torah, they cannot object, even if there is another scholar in the city because “the jealousy of scholars creates an increase in wisdom.” If a scholar brings his merchandise to the city, everyone is required to refrain from selling until the scholar sells his wares. If there is a gentile who is selling, so there will be no gain to the scholar, everyone is permitted to sell. See Yoreh Deah Siman 243. If one has a business arrangement with a gentile, there are those places that rule that others are prohibited from interfering with his livelihood and doing business with that gentile, and there are some places that do not rule that way. There are those who permit another Jew to go to that gentile to lend him, do business with him, bribe him and take property from him because a gentile’s property is considered ownerless. There are those who prohibit it. Even where a Jew regularly does work with a gentile, it would be prohibited for another Jew to compete and do the work at a cheaper price. If he wants to do it, we would rebuke him. Nevertheless, if he violated and did the work we would not remove the money from him. See later Siman 227. If two individuals live together and one wants to lend with interest to a gentile, the other cannot object. The same applies to anything similar. See later 228:18.
Residents of a country cannot stop peddlers traveling through cities because it is an Ezra-regulation to have peddlers traveling through cities so that perfume will be readily accessible to Jewish girls. Thus, it seems to me that this only applies to those who sell perfume or something similar, but in other cases there is no distinction between peddlers and anyone else. They cannot, however, set up a permanent stand and sit there without permission from the people of the city. If he is a scholar he can set up anywhere. The same rules that apply to scholars apply to schoolteachers.
Residents of a city can stop merchants who bring their wares to sell in the city from selling them individually as storekeepers do. If they only sold on market-days, the people of the city cannot stop them, so long as they sold in the market. They cannot knock on doors, however, even on a market-day. If they have an outstanding loan in the city, they can sell the amount needed for sustenance, even if it is not a market-day, until their debt is repaid and then they will leave. The same applies to lending with interest to gentiles, and the people of the city may stop them. They cannot stop them if they come on a market-day and lend with interest to the people who are gathered there to go to the market, however. If they have an outstanding loan in the city, they can lend until they make enough money for sustenance in order that they can collect their debts. There are those that say that this that people of a city can stop people of another city, is only is there is no loss to the consumer because they are selling just as the others in the city are selling and their merchandise is no better than those of the people in the city. If they were selling at a cheaper price or if their merchandise was better, however, in which case the consumers are benefiting, the seller-merchants cannot object, so long as the consumers are Jews. If only gentiles were benefiting, however, this would not apply. When merchants brings other merchandise that the city does not have, even though it is no cheaper or better than the existing merchandise, the people of the city cannot object. If members of the city fled to a settlement because of a concern of danger, the people in the settlement cannot stop them from making enough profit for them to live until the danger passes. Based on the small amount of commerce they are involved in, they will carry the burden of the public. If they are included in the city-tax, the members of the city cannot stop them. Similarly, if they come to expel someone from the city who does not have the right to live there, they cannot expel him until he collects his debts, and he can profit in the meantime the amount required to live. There are those who say that this that the merchant is only required to pay taxes based on his transactions is only where they are not allowing him to live there. If they are allowing him to live there completely, however, he must pay taxes as if he was a full resident or he must leave. There are those who disagree with this. If people of a city are involved in commerce in another city, it is not in their power to force them to give as much taxes as they want. Rather, we tell them give such and such amount or we object to them transacting in their cities. If people from another city come to spend in another city and not cause any gain to the people of the city, the people of the city do not have the right to object, notwithstanding the fact that the market rate will increase. All this only applies when others are coming to transact in a city that they do not live in, and that is why the members of the city have the right to object even though they are willing to pay taxes because they were not part of the tax base until now. If they want to come live in that city and pay taxes like a member of the city, however, there are those who say they have the right to do so because a person has the right to live in whatever place he wants. The original residents did not acquire the rights to the city. There are those who disagree and say that they do have the right to object, specifically in today’s age where we live under the jurisdiction of other nations and there is a fear that if there are more residents, something negative can arise from such other nations and thus one who wants to live there have the status of a “pursuer.” Everyone agrees that if the people of the city have the ability to close the doors, to have the rulers object to immigrants coming or some other way of preventing people from moving in, they have the right to do so. There are those places that have a custom to create a cherem against people coming to move there, in which case they have the power to force immigrants via cherem, but not by law. They can decree that no one may transact with those people coming to live there without permission. If the city has a Rabbi, he may make a decree on any student of his who is coming to live there. There are those who say that a cherem against immigration would not take effect on a scholar because he can live wherever he wants to. If they voided the cherem for one person and they gave him permission to live there for a set time, we do not say the entire cherem is voided and they can force him out later. If Reuven and his children lived in one settlement and made a bona-fide claim that they obtained rights, the obtainment of rights would be valid and they can object to Shimon living there. If Shimon claims with witnesses that he was afraid to object because Reuven and his children would snitch to the government, Reuven would not obtain rights. If Reuven was a snitch but his sons were not, however, they would obtain rights, because the son of a thief has the power to obtain rights. We apply the same rules with respect to obtaining rights to live as we do to obtaining rights to real property. There is an ancient custom that if one traveled from a city for 12 months and indicated that he has no intention of returning, he had lost his rights. If he did not indicate that he did not intend on returning, however, he would not lose his rights until he was away for three years. If he indicated that he had the intention of returning, he would not even lose his rights after three years. There are those who say that even where he did not indicate intention either way he would not lose his rights. If people of a city had the rights to live and they were driven out one time for the city and some of them subsequently returned and reestablished the city, the others will have no claims against him. See the end of Siman 149 with respect to someone who has obtained rights against the public with respect to a mitzvah.

Just as there is overcharge in commerce, there is a concept of afflicting others with words. Afflicting others with words is more severe than overcharging money, because money can be returned whereas words cannot, and verbal affliction is a crime against an individual, while overcharge is a crime against his money. A victim who cries out because of verbal abuse is answered immediately. There are those who say that the rules against verbal affliction only applies to those who have fear of heaven. If one afflicts another, the victim may afflict him back.
One must be extra cautious with respect to afflicting a convert, whether afflicting him personally or his property, because the Torah prohibits it in many places.
One must be cautions with respect to afflicting his wife because her tears are readily available.
What is affliction with words? A person should not say, “how much are you willing to accept for this item,” when he has no intention of purchasing it. If donkey-riders were looking to purchase grain, one may not say to them to go to so and so when he knows that person has nothing to sell. If someone had repented from his earlier ways, one may not say to him “remember your earlier actions.” If one is the son of converts, one may not say to him, “remember your father’s actions.” If a person was suffering a person may not tell him what Iyov was told by his friends, “is your fear of heaven not your confidence? Do you remember, please, anyone innocent who was destroyed?” If one is asked a question on a certain subject he should not tell someone who is unfamiliar with that subject to give an answer on this matter. The same applies to anything similar.
One should be cautious not to use a negative nickname on another. Even if that person is usually called by that name, if the intent of the person using it is to embarrass him, it is forbidden.
One is prohibited from defrauding another in commerce or misleading them. For example, if the item has a defect, he must inform the buyer. Even if the buyer is a gentile, he cannot sell non-kosher meat with the presumption that it is kosher. One cannot mislead others with words by showing that he is doing some for him when he is not. How so? A person should not invite someone to eat with him where he knows he won’t come. He should not send a lot of gifts where he knows he will not accept. He should not open barrels that he is opening for a storekeeper and the other will assume he opened them for him. Rather, he must inform the other that he did not open for him. If it is something that the other should have realized was not being done for him, and he mislead himself by assuming it was done for his honor, such as where he meets someone on the street and assumes he came specifically to greet him, he would not have to inform the other.
One may not say, “smear oil from this jug” when the jug is empty or go to a mourner’s house with an empty vessel and the mourner will think it is full of wine. If he does it to bring honor to the mourner it is permitted.
One may not sell skin of an animal that died with the understanding that it was slaughtered. One may not send a barrel of wine with oil floating on top to another.
One may not artificially adorn a person, animal or vessels, such as by dying the beard of a slave that is being sold so that he looks young or feeding an animal bran-liquid which will fatten the animal and make its hairs stand up so that it looks fat. Similarly, one many not comb or rake an animal so that its hairs stand up or dye old vessels so they look like new. One may not blow up innards so they look fat and wide. One may not soak meat in water to so that it should look white and fat.
One may not combine a few inferior fruits with many beautiful fruits in order to sell them as beautiful, even if he would be combining new fruits with new fruits. It goes without saying that one cannot combine new with old or even old with new, even if the old was more expensive than the new, because the buyer wants to age them.
With respect to wine, the authorities permitted one to combine strong with weak only in the winepress, because it makes the wine better. All the more so would one be permitted to combine weak with strong. If the taste can be detected, one can combine anywhere because anything where taste can be detected will be discovered by the buyer and thus can always be combined.
One may not combine water with wine. One who had his water combined with his wine may not sell it in a store unless he informs the buyer. He may not sell it to a merchant, even if he informs him, because the merchant may defraud others.
In a place where the custom is to combine water in the winepress, one is permitted to combine the amount that is the practice to combine.
In a place where the custom is that anyone who purchases something first tastes the product, one is always permitted to combine. If not everyone tastes, however, that would not apply.
One may not combine wine sediments with wine. Even if one is purchasing two barrels of wine, the seller may not combine the sediments of one barrel with the other. If they purchased a barrel of wine by a specific amount per measurement, when the buyer comes to measure, the seller may mix the sediments with the wine and sell everything together.
A merchant may take from five threshing floors and place it one place or wine from five winepresses and place it in one barrel because everyone is aware he did not grow them all in his own property and that is the presumption of those that buy from him, so long as he does not intentionally purchase the majority from a superior location so that he earns a reputation that he acquires everything from a superior location, when he is actually purchasing from an inferior location and combining.
One is permitted to remove the waste from grits and beans so that they look nice because this is something visible and a buyer will be able to see and understand how much more the product is worth because the waste has been removed, so long as the seller does not remove the waste on top and leave the waste on bottom.
A storekeeper is permitted to distribute toasted grain and nuts to children to get them to buy from him frequently. Similarly, he may sell below market rate to get people to buy from him, and the others in the market cannot stop him. See above 156:5.
One is prohibited from combining any amount of sediment with either wine or oil.
If one sells refined oil to another, the buyer does not accept the sediments. If he sold oil without specification, the buyer would accept 1.5 lug of sediments for every 100 lug. He would also accept other sediments of murky oil that rises on top of the oil in addition to the know sediments of that location. When is this true? Where the buyer gave money in Tishrei when the oil is murky and took the oil in Nisan using the Tishrei measurement, which is larger because of the oil that congeals on top. If he purchased using a Nisan measurement, which is small because the oil is already clear, however, he would only accept the sediments. There are those who say the seller would not have to deduct the sediments. Rather, the seller is permitted to combine the sediments in his barrels. If he did not combine, however, he cannot deduct the sediments other than those floating on top. When is this true? Where the seller sold them when the oil was murky. If he sold it when it was clear, however, he would not even be able to deduct the sediments floating on top.

Prohibition of Theft, Who is Considered a Thief, and From What Moment One Becomes Liable. It contains 8 paragraphs: One is biblically prohibited from even stealing a minute amount. One is prohibited from stealing as a joke, and even with the condition to give it back, pay double or just to cause the other pain. All of this is prohibited so that he not become accustomed to it.
Anyone who steals violates the prohibition of “do not steal,” even if it just a perutah, and would be obligated to pay back. This applies regardless of whether he stole the money of a Jew or the money of a gentile and whether he stole from an adult or a minor. Misleading an idolater, such as misleading him in the accounting or avoiding repaying his loan, is permitted so long as he doesn’t know so that there is no desecration of God’s name. There are those who say one is prohibited from misleading him and only if the idolater made the mistake on his own would it be permitted.
What is a thief? One who takes money secretly and the owner is unaware. If he took the money out in the open and publicly, however, he is not a thief but a robber.
As soon as the thief pulls the stolen item, he becomes a thief on it. When is this true? Where he pulled it outside the owner’s domain. So long as the item is in the owner’s domain, however, the thief would not be liable unless he lifts it. If the thief brought the item into his guarded possession, he would be liable, even if it was to his roof, courtyard or backyard and even if he did not pull or lift it. As for when a thief is liable to pay double or four or five times the stolen amount, look it up. The Mechaber did not discuss it because it is a penalty, which we do not deal with today. It does make a difference, however, in a case where the victim seized. See above 1:5.
When it comes to repaying theft, if the thief has movable items, we would go down to them. If he does not have movable items, but only real property, we would go down to them and collect from the superior properties, just like other torts cases.
If one stole and lifted the stolen item, and another came to assist him in bringing it from there, the second individual would be exempt.
If Reuven saw Shimon enter Levi’s home and steal an item, and that item ended up in Reuven’s possession, and Reuven returned it to Shimon, Levi would not be able to remove it from him in court. This is only where Shimon had some kind of claim against Levi. If he has no claim against him, however, and Shimon simply stole from him, and Reuven is aware of this and returned it to Shimon the thief, he would be required to pay Levi because he should have returned the lost item to its owner.
If Reuven made a claim against Shimon that he entered his room and stole his books and removed them from his domain, and Shimon responds that it is true that he took them but what happened was is that Shimon’s relative, who was Reuven’s daughter-in-law, asked me to take them because she was unable to lift them, and I did not know they belonged to you, nor did I lift them, but she lifted them and gave them to me, Shimon would be required to return them, because what business did he have entering Reuven’s room to take books? It is clear that his intent was to help her steal from her father-in-law. With respect to that which he claims that she lifted them and gave them to him, he is still claiming that they were his and she couldn’t lift them, which means she could not take them out without his assistance, so it is as if he took them out. Reuven would collect from whichever one he wants; from his daughter-in-law, who admits she has possession of the books, or from Shimon, if he prefers. Similarly, if the thief hid the stolen item and he needed to leave the city but was unable to move the stolen item so he sent another person to bring the stolen item to him, the agent would be liable because he is the primary thief given that he knew it was stolen. If one directs another what to seal or sends him to steal, the sender is not liable because there is no agency when it comes to a sin. If the agent is not a party capable of being liable, however, there are those who say the sender is liable. See Even HaEzer Siman 86 for a case where a woman sold or gave as collateral and the husband claims it was stolen from him.

In the case of a Jewish heretic, which is someone who worships idols or sins in spite- even if he just ate unslaughtered animal or wore shaatnez in spite he would be a heretic- and those who deny the Torah or Jewish prophecy, there is a mitzvah to remove them. If there is a way to remove them publicly, we would do so. If not, we would use excuses to remove them. How so? If one saw one of them fall into a pit and the ladder is in the pit, he would come and remove the ladder and say he is busy taking his son down from the roof and he will return the ladder, or something similar. With respect to an idolater whom we are not at war with or a shepherd of small domesticated animals in a place where the fields belong to Jews or someone similar, however, we would not arrange for their death but one is prohibited from rescuing them. When is this true? In the case of a Jewish sinner who remains firm in his wickedness and consistently repeats his sins, such as a shepherd of small domesticated animals who is cavalier with theft, and they continue in their wicked ways. With respect to a Jew who sins and does not remain firm in his wickedness, but just sins for his own benefit, however, such as one who eats unslaughtered animals out of desire, one does have a mitzvah to rescue him and one is prohibited from standing idly by his blood
