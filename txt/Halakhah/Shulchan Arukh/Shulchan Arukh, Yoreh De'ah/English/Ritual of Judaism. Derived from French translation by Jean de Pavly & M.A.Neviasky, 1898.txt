<b>On Salting and Washing</b><br>Meat must be washed before salting. <small>(G<small>LOSS</small> I: If it has already been washed by the butcher, there is no need to wash it again at home.)</small> If, after washing, the meat is cut into two or three pieces <small>(G<small>LOSS</small> II: or if, after washing, the horns of the feet are removed)</small>, a second washing is required.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small> III: If, in such a case, the meat has not undergone a second washing, it is considered as if it has never been washed. Deliberately, it is advisable to soak the meat in water for about half an hour and then drain it with the same water. If, instead of soaking, the meat is thoroughly washed, that suffices. The meat is then allowed to drain for a few moments, so that the water does not dissolve the salt and thus paralyze its action on expelling the blood. It is customary not to use the vessel in which the meat is soaked for any other purpose. If the meat has soaked in water for twenty-four hours, both the meat and the vessel are forbidden. But if it has soaked for less than twenty-four hours, there is no harm in it. Even if the vessel is declared forbidden, it can be used to soak meat again. For the method of soaking frozen meat, see above, paragraph 68.</small>
If meat is salted without prior washing, it must be washed and salted a second time. Some declare the meat forbidden in such a case.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This is indeed the custom, even if the salting was weak, as practiced on meat for grilling, and even if it did not last the prescribed duration. However, in cases of great loss, the meat can be declared permissible. If the meat was only slightly washed before salting, it is permissible when it is already a fait accompli. It is also permissible in such a case if it represents a quantity of flesh sixty times as large as the blood it contains. If, among several pieces of salted meat, there is one that was not washed beforehand, all the other pieces are permissible, and only this one is forbidden.</small>
One should not salt with salt as fine as flour, nor with salt that is too coarse and does not stay on the meat but slides off the piece.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: In the absence of other salt, it is permissible to use salt as fine as flour.</small>
Salt is sprinkled over the entire surface of the piece, without leaving any part uncovered, and in such a quantity that a piece of cooked meat salted to a similar degree would become inedible. But there is no need to sprinkle more salt than this. The piece is salted on both sides. Poultry must also be salted inside; if they are only salted inside or outside, or if a piece is salted only on one side, the meat is permissible.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some declare it forbidden in such a case, even when it is already a fait accompli. The custom is to follow this latter opinion unless in a pressing case. This applies only if the meat is already cooked; otherwise, it should not be cooked this way; but the piece should be salted on the other side as well, within twelve hours of salting one side, or if twelve hours have already passed since salting the first side, it should be grilled, as the fire expels the blood and prevents the already salted side from absorbing the concentrated blood from the unsalted side.</small>
If the already salted piece is cut, there is no need to salt the newly formed faces again.
The duration of salting should not be less than the time required to walk a league, which is approximately a third of an hour.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: One can adhere to this opinion when already faced with a fait accompli, or even deliberately when deference to guests or the approach of the Sabbath imposes haste; otherwise, it is customary to leave the meat in the salt for an hour; this custom should not be deviated from.</small>
Before soaking the meat in the vessel, it is freed from the salt on its surface, either by shaking the piece or by washing it beforehand. The water in the vessel in which the meat is soaked is changed so that it is soaked in two waters, and the vessel is rinsed before pouring water into it a second time.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that the meat should be soaked in three waters. The custom is to do so deliberately. Therefore, the meat is washed or freed from salt before soaking, and then soaked in two waters, equivalent to washing in three waters, or it is soaked immediately in the vessel but then soaked in three waters. This is the custom. Deliberately, one should pour the first water into the vessel in sufficient quantity to remove the bitterness of the salt from the brine. It is permissible to soak the meat in fruit juice, and there is no need for water specifically.</small>
If the meat was neither freed from salt nor washed before soaking in the vessel, it should not be declared forbidden, as the water in the vessel already removes the bitterness of the salt.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Even a small amount of water removes the bitterness of the salt from the brine. Some even declare the meat permissible when placed in an empty vessel before adding water: as the meat only stayed in the empty vessel for a short time, there is no cause for concern. One can rely on this opinion. This only concerns the first water washing; from then on, there is no harm in placing the meat in an empty vessel. There is no difference between a permissible vessel, a forbidden vessel, or a vessel used for dairy foods. When the vessel still contains a bit of water, so that, by removing the bitterness of the salt, the cold can no longer be compared to the hot, the meat is permissible, even if the vessel still contains traces of dairy or forbidden foods.</small>
When the meat has been cooked after salting without undergoing post-washing, for it to be declared permissible, it must have a volume sixty times greater than that of the salt.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This evaluation includes the entire content of the pot. If the pot's content, besides the piece of meat in question, is equal to that of the piece, everything is permissible, because, in this case, the pot contains a quantity sixty times greater than the salt, as the piece itself is certainly thirty times the volume of the salt. But if the pot does not contain a quantity sixty times greater than the salt, everything is forbidden, even if the meat is only in a second vessel since the presence of salt and brine causes cooking even in a second vessel. If the meat is dried, it is permissible, even if the cooking was done in the first vessel, because, with the salt also dried, the piece of meat is certainly sixty times the volume of the salt. However, one should not deliberately cook meat, even dried, in hot water that burns the hand without post-washing after salting. This concerns only the case where the meat was not washed after salting; but if it was washed once before cooking, it is permissible, as in the presence of a fait accompli, one washing suffices. It is forbidden to use salt that has already been used for salting meat; it is even more forbidden to eat salt used for salting meat.</small>
When a pagan, who is a servant of an Israelite, has put the meat into the pot, and it is unknown if he washed it after salting, the pagan's word is trusted if he knows Jewish customs and if, during this time, the house was frequented by the comings and goings of an Israelite or even a wise child.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: One of the two conditions is sufficient: either the pagan's good faith, evidenced by the absence of bias in his account, or the presence of an Israelite, even a Jewish child, as in this case, the pagan would fear acting contrary to known Jewish customs. But when he was forbidden to wash the meat without express permission and he disobeyed, the meat is forbidden, as he has proven he is not afraid; thus, his account is not trusted.</small>
When meat is cooked without prior salting, the other foods in the pot must present a quantity sixty times greater than that of the meat: in this case, everything is permissible.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some declare the piece of meat forbidden, even in the mentioned case. This is the custom unless in a pressing case, for instance, on the eve of the Sabbath or when having guests, in which case one can rely on the moderate opinion. A poorly salted piece of meat is considered unsalted. Similarly, when the meat is salted three days after the animal's slaughter, it is considered unsalted, so if cooked with other foods, they must be sixty times the volume of the meat.</small>
When meat remains unsalted for three days and nights, the blood hardens and will never flow out under the action of salt. Therefore, it should no longer be eaten cooked in a pot but only grilled; it should not be cooked after grilling; but if already done, the meat is permissible.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: One should not leave meat for three days without salting it, for fear it will be cooked in a pot afterward.</small>
If the meat was soaked before the end of the third day, it can be left for another three days minus half an hour, from that moment, without salting.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: In case of doubt whether the meat was salted before or after the end of the third day, the meat is permissible.</small>
When a piece of meat that has remained unsalted for three days is mixed with other pieces, it is considered dissolved when the other pieces together constitute a quantity twice as large as it; in this case, they can all be cooked, even if the piece is noticeable.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The same applies when an unsalted piece is mixed with other pieces during cooking.</small>
When a piece of meat stained with blood is soaked for twenty-four hours in water, it can only be eaten grilled, according to some authors, unless it is cooked in a pot containing sixty times as much water.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Other authors forbid it, even grilled. This is the custom.</small>
Meat should only be salted in a perforated vessel, on straw or shavings, or on an inclined object such that if water were poured on it, it would immediately flow off.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: When a board is planed, it can be salted on without needing to be inclined; but it must be inclined if it is not planed. Even if the vessel is perforated, care must be taken that the holes are not clogged. Therefore, the vessel should not be placed on the ground, as it would be as if it were not perforated. Some place straw or shavings in the vessel to prevent the meat from blocking the holes. If already faced with a fait accompli, the omission of these details is not an issue.</small><br>If meat is salted in a non-perforated vessel, that vessel should no longer be used for hot foods.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: If solid hot foods are placed in it, they should be scraped. But if the foods are liquid, they must be sixty times the quantity of the vessel's scraping.</small><br>Some opine that the vessel should not be used even for cold foods without first washing it. If it is not washed, the foods must be washed.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But if holes are made in the vessel, it can be used for salting meat, or meat already salted and washed can be placed in it, even without making holes in it.</small>
If the vessel is perforated, hot foods can be placed in it. Some forbid placing hot foods in it.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Deliberately, one should not act this way; but if faced with a fait accompli, the foods are permissible.</small>
If meat is salted in a non-perforated vessel and left in the salt as long as it takes to bring water to a boil, the part of the meat soaked in the brine is forbidden, even grilled; but it suffices to scrape the part that rises above the brine, even if it is fatty.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some forbid even the part that rises above the brine if it is only lightly salted and even if it has been in the salt only long enough to form brine. This is the custom, which should not be deviated from. However, only the piece in question is declared forbidden, but the other pieces are permissible. This is the custom.</small>
After salting and washing, the meat can be soaked even in cold water. Some require it to be soaked in hot water.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The custom is to follow the first opinion, which is more founded.</small>
If, after leaving the meat in the salt for the prescribed duration, it is placed, without post-washing, in a vessel filled with brine, the meat is permissible. It follows that meat falling into brine formed after the prescribed salting is permissible. One author declares it forbidden in both cases. Deliberately, this opinion should be considered.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some require the meat to be scraped, even when faced with a fait accompli. This is the custom. This concerns only the part soaked in the brine; but the part that rises above the brine is permissible. The vessel into which the brine falls is forbidden. Similarly, if the vessel is used for dairy foods and still bears traces of it, the meat is forbidden because it is considered hot food, even after salting. However, in cases of great loss or for preparing a prescribed feast, one can rely on the moderate opinion and not consider the meat after salting as hot food.</small><br>According to this author, it is forbidden to eat meat, even salted according to the regulations, without thoroughly washing it. It is forbidden to cut the meat with a knife before washing; if cut, the knife must be scalded.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some permit cutting meat, after the prescribed salting, with a knife, as the salt has no effect on dishes. This opinion is more founded; therefore, it is permissible. But the knife must be washed afterward or plunged into the earth if the brine has dried on the blade. In any case, the knife is not the issue, but the blood expulsion caused by the cut. Therefore, the meat is permissible, even if cut before the end of salting, if the new face formed by the cut is washed and salted again.</small><br>When preparing meat for long-term preservation, it should be thoroughly washed after salting in a perforated vessel, then salted a second time, even in a non-perforated vessel, for preservation. According to this opinion, grilled meat is permissible even without post-washing, as the fire absorbs the blood on the meat's surface. However, if the meat is left in the salt for a long time, it should be thoroughly washed before grilling.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See § 76 regarding meat salted and grilled without post-washing.</small>
In countries where salt is scarce, meat should be grilled to expel the blood and then cooked.

Siman 70

<b>On Salting Multiple Pieces Together</b><br>Multiple pieces of meat can be salted while stacked, without concern that the pieces underneath, whose blood flows out earlier than those on top, will absorb the blood of others: their activity in expelling brine prevents them from absorbing the blood of other pieces. Even if brine accumulates between the pieces, they are permissible. This applies only to the meat of warm-blooded animals, even beef with kid and lamb, or even poultry, as it is impossible for the brine expulsion of the latter to last as long as the blood expulsion of beef.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, when salting a concave piece of meat, such as a whole breast, it is customary to place, deliberately, the piece with the concave side down, so the blood drains. But this is not considered if faced with a fait accompli. A piece salted twice is permissible, without concern that the second salting caused the blood expelled by the first salting to infiltrate.</small><br>But it is forbidden to salt the flesh of warm-blooded animals, even poultry, with fish, as the fish expel their brine sooner than the poultry expels the blood. If salted together, the poultry is permissible, but the fish need scraping. However, if salted with scales, they are permissible.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some completely forbid the fish unless their quantity is sixty times that of the poultry. But if salted with scales, there is no issue, as this case resembles that of two pieces salted together.</small>
This applies only when both are salted, or the poultry is salted, and the fish is not; but in the opposite case, the fish are permissible without scraping.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Similarly, when the fish are placed above the poultry, they are permissible, even if both are salted, as blood never rises; this case is comparable to a piece half-soaked in brine. The fish are also permissible when placed near the poultry after the latter is salted. If fish are salted in a vessel used for salting meat, they are permissible, as salt has no effect on dishes. The ruling that unsalted fish placed together with salted poultry are forbidden applies only if the fish, once salted, have expelled all their blood. But if not yet salted, they are permissible, as they will expel the absorbed blood along with their own, just as mentioned later in this paragraph regarding a piece falling into brine before salting. See later, § 91, about the type of salting that acts like heat.</small>
When a piece of meat from a ritually slaughtered animal is salted together with a forbidden piece, and these pieces touch, or the forbidden piece alone is salted, the permissible piece needs scraping; because although it does not absorb the blood of the forbidden piece, it absorbs its brine. But if the permissible piece alone is salted, washing suffices; it does not matter if placed above or below the other piece. One author forbids the piece if it touches the other; this author believes that a piece is declared permissible only when the blood of both pieces mixes, not when one touches the other.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But when only the forbidden piece is salted, the other piece becomes inedible, even if the blood of both pieces mixes. See later, § 105, about such a case.</small>
Scraping suffices only if both pieces are lean; but when one is fatty—even if it is the permissible piece—the forbidden piece exhales its flavor and communicates it to the other; but only if placed below; the lower piece always exhales more.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See later, § 105, about the custom in such a case.</small>
Some forbid leaving meat in salt for more than twelve hours, as the salt would then cause the blood to infiltrate back into the flesh; other authors permit leaving meat in salt even for several days. Deliberately, the first opinion should be considered; but the meat is permissible if faced with a fait accompli.
Some forbid placing an unsalted piece of meat, or one that has already expelled all its blood, next to a piece about to expel blood, as the first piece would absorb the blood of the latter. Others permit it if salted afterward, as it would expel both its blood and the absorbed blood. Others permit this process in all cases. Deliberately, the first opinion should be considered.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The custom is to declare forbidden the piece whose blood and brine have been entirely expelled, which falls next to a salted piece about to expel blood. Some opine that meat expels brine for twenty-four hours after salting, and thus, if it touches a piece about to expel blood during this period, it is not forbidden. This is the custom. If it is not a case of great loss, it should be declared forbidden after twelve hours; but in no case is it declared forbidden before this period. The meat is all the more permissible when it falls, before salting, into brine without remaining there for a whole day; for it will expel what it has absorbed along with its own blood. But if it falls into the brine after expelling its blood, it is forbidden according to some authors. However, in cases of great loss, it is declared permissible if it falls before the twelfth hour from salting: but provided it is washed afterward and salted again. If, after falling into the brine, it is salted without prior washing, it is permissible when faced with a fait accompli. This concerns only brine whose action is as powerful as heat, as stated in paragraph 69: but if blood falls on meat, whose action is also as powerful as heat, as stated in paragraph 91, the meat is forbidden. Only the part soaked in the brine is declared forbidden, but not the part that rises above. Meat that falls into brine spilled on the ground is treated the same as meat that falls into brine collected in a vessel. Meat that touches a salted piece in a non-perforated vessel is treated the same as meat that falls into brine. In case of doubt whether the liquid in which the meat fell is brine or water, the meat is permissible; since brine is forbidden only by rabbinic decree, leniency is inclined in case of doubt. If the brine is mixed with water, even in very small quantities, the brine no longer acts as powerfully as heat; thus it no longer renders the piece that falls into it forbidden. For soaked meat, see later, § 105.</small>

Siman 71

<b>On Salting the Head, Feet, and Brain</b><br>The skull is cut into two pieces, and the inner surface is salted well first, then the outer surface is salted, spreading salt over the hair, as the hair does not prevent the salt from expelling the blood.
A small piece of the horns of the feet is cut off, and the feet are then salted. The cut end is placed downward, and salt is also spread over the hair.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See § 68.</small>
The meninges are traversed by veins, and the brain also contains blood that cannot be expelled by salting the head, as the skull prevents the salt from penetrating. Therefore, the brain must be extracted, and the meninges must be torn to be salted. If one wishes to salt the head with the brain inside, a hole must be made in the skull, and the meninges must also be punctured, placing the head with the hole downward. In this case, it can even be cooked in a pot.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See § 68 regarding the custom. If the head is salted without opening the skull, the brain and meninges are forbidden, but the rest is permissible. Bone marrow needs salting. Salting the bone is sufficient for the marrow, and there is no need to puncture the bone. Deliberately, bones should not be salted together with meat; but there is no harm if faced with a fait accompli.</small>

Siman 72

<b>On Salting the Heart and Lungs</b><br>At the time of slaughter, the blood concentrates in the heart; therefore, this viscera must be opened before salting.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: By doing so, the heart can even be cooked in a pot afterward. Some opine that the heart should never be cooked but only grilled.</small>
If the heart is salted or grilled without being opened beforehand, it should be opened afterward, and it is permissible. For it is assumed that the heart expels blood while absorbing it. But if it is cooked without being opened beforehand, the pot must contain a quantity of food sixty times the volume of the heart.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Even in this case, the heart itself remains forbidden; and the other foods that touched the heart must be scraped. Some forbid even the other meat salted together with the heart, as the heart's concentrated blood does not flow out of the other pieces that absorbed it as easily as their own blood. The custom is to be moderate in such a case; for even the absorbed concentrated blood flows out along with the own blood, as seen with the blood of the jugular veins in § 22. Some require scraping the piece that touched the heart. This opinion should be considered, and a bit around the heart should be scraped, then everything is permissible, other pieces as well as the heart itself, without distinction if the heart is closed or opened at its upper end. It is customary to cut, deliberately, the end of the heart and the veins distributed there; but this is done only as a supererogation.</small>
There is no poultry whose volume is not sixty times that of the heart. Therefore, the entire poultry is permissible when cooked together with the heart, even if the heart adheres to it.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Any poultry, even one from which the head and leg ends are removed, presents a volume sixty times that of the heart. Therefore, when the poultry is whole, everything is permissible; otherwise, the entire poultry is, according to some authors, considered a forbidden piece, so that the pot's contents must be sixty times the volume of the entire poultry; and even in this case, the poultry itself remains forbidden, as it does not present a volume sixty times that of the heart. If the heart does not adhere to the poultry, it suffices that the pot's contents be sixty times the volume of the heart. See later, § 92, regarding this ruling. No horned animal presents a volume sixty times that of the heart.</small>
The lungs do not need to be cut before salting. However, it is customary to cut them and open the large bronchi. This is a praiseworthy custom.

Siman 73

<b>On Grilling the Liver</b><br>The liver abounds in blood. Therefore, deliberately, it should not be cooked in a pot after salting, but an incision is made in it, and it is grilled with the cut side down, then it can be cooked in a pot.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: A few perforations made with a knife are equivalent to an incision. It also suffices to remove the bile with a piece of liver adhering to it, so that the blood can flow. If this is not done, the blood vessels are removed after grilling the liver, then it is cooked. This concerns a whole liver; but if it is cut, none of these procedures are needed. The liver needs to be washed before cooking and after grilling. It is permissible if washing is omitted.</small><br>If faced with a fait accompli, the liver is permissible if cooked alone in a pot.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Without being grilled beforehand. But the pot is forbidden, as the liver expels blood but does not absorb it. One author declares the liver forbidden in this case.</small><br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This is indeed the custom to declare everything forbidden, even if the liver was salted before cooking.</small>
If the liver is soaked in vinegar or boiling water, punctured, and freed from blood vessels, it can be cooked afterward according to the law; but the Gaonim have forbidden this. If faced with a fait accompli, the liver is permissible in this case.
Before grilling, it should be cut because of the blood vessels. If not cut before, it should be cut afterward.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that it does not need to be cut before grilling. This is indeed the custom, even deliberately.</small>
When grilling the liver with other pieces of meat in one of those ovens used in the Talmudic era, whose opening is at the top, it should be placed below and not above the other pieces. Otherwise, it is permissible if faced with a fait accompli. Deliberately, it is forbidden to roast the liver with other meat on a spit, even placing the liver below the other pieces.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But if the liver is salted, it can be grilled with other meat, even placed above the other pieces, as the blood of the liver is reduced by salting, making it like any other piece of meat.</small>
Deliberately, it should not be salted over other pieces of meat, but below.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The custom is never to salt the liver, even alone; this custom should not be deviated from. However, it is salted lightly while it is on the spit or coals. If the liver is salted, alone or with other pieces, it is permissible. Some opine that when the liver adheres to the poultry, the area where the liver was located should be scraped, but this is done only as a supererogation. It is customary to wash the liver after grilling because of the blood that adheres to it. It is permissible if not washed.</small>
When a liver is found in grilled poultry, both the poultry and the liver are permissible.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that the area where the liver was located should be scraped; but this is done only as a supererogation.</small> But if the poultry was cooked, it must present a volume sixty times that of the liver.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But there is no poultry that is sixty times the volume of its liver. Therefore, when the liver is whole, the pot's contents must present a quantity sixty times that of the entire poultry, as it is considered entirely forbidden, as stated in § 92. But if the liver does not adhere to the poultry, the pot's entire contents are sixty times the volume of the liver. However, the liver itself remains forbidden, as with the heart in § 72. When a heart or liver is found in poultry stuffed with eggs, the poultry is considered as if it were cooked with these viscera, and therefore, it must alone, without the stuffing, present a quantity sixty times greater than these viscera. But if the stuffing consists of meat, without a mixture of hard-boiled eggs, the poultry is considered as if it were grilled.</small>

Siman 74

<b>On the Spleen Assimilated to Other Meat</b><br>The spleen, despite its reddish color, which indicates an abundance of blood, is treated by law as other meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some claim that it is customary not to cook the kidneys or testicles, even after removing the forbidden veins, due to the abundance of blood. When faced with a fait accompli, this opinion need not be considered. It is permissible to salt them together with other meat, despite the abundance of blood; provided they are skinned and freed from their fatty layers.</small>

Siman 75

<b>On Salting the Intestines</b><br>The intestines are considered to be free of blood, such as the rumen, abomasum, small intestine, and rectum, stripped of their fatty appendages. Therefore, they are permissible when cooked without salting; except, however, when they are of a reddish color.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: They are all the more permissible when salted in a non-perforated vessel. However, deliberately, they should be salted in a perforated vessel and washed like any other meat. Some contest this opinion regarding the rumen and the reticulum, stating that these are, on the contrary, considered to contain blood and should therefore be declared forbidden if cooked without salting, even when faced with a fait accompli, as is the case with any other meat.</small><br>But the fatty appendage of the intestines is treated as other meat. Therefore, when salting the rectum or other parts of the intestines, salt should not be spread on the inner surface, on the chyme side, but on the outer surface, where the fatty appendage adheres.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: When the rectum is salted only on the inner surface, it is as if it were not salted at all; thus, it is forbidden if cooked this way with its fatty appendage. But if it is not yet cooked, it is salted again on the outer surface, and it is permissible. Eggs found in poultry after slaughter need salting and can be salted with other meat if their white is not yet formed. But if the egg white is already formed, it is customary to salt them, even if their shell is already hard; however, there is no harm in salting them with other meat when faced with a fait accompli. All fat, even poultry fat, is treated as meat concerning salting and washing.</small>
It is permissible to salt the intestines, stripped of their fatty appendages, with other meat, even though they are considered free of blood.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some forbid salting them with other meat. This is the custom, deliberately; but they are permissible if already done.</small>
The fatty appendage of the small intestine is traversed by very fine blood vessels. Therefore, some authors forbid cooking it in a pot, even after cutting and salting it. Nowadays, it is customary to cook it. Anyone who knows these blood vessels can easily extract them all without leaving a single one.

<b>On Meat for Grilling</b><br>Meat for grilling does not need salting, as the fire expels the blood specific to the respective piece. But if the blood of another piece falls on the meat, the fire's action is ineffective, even if the blood is cold: thus, the surface of the meat must be removed to the thickness of a finger.
Meat for grilling can be salted and eaten afterward without post-washing, without concern for the blood in the salt. Some opine that this is only if the meat is grilled immediately after salting. But if left in the salt for a long time, it must be thoroughly washed before grilling, as the salt absorbs the blood in that case.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that meat for grilling needs prior washing. Others claim it also needs salting. The custom is to wash and lightly salt it when putting it on the spit, and grill it immediately before the salt absorbs blood. But if not done this way, it is permissible, provided it has not remained in the salt for the prescribed duration; otherwise, it is forbidden. There is no difference between geese and other poultry in this regard; provided the poultry is not stuffed with eggs or meat; as then it is considered cooked and needs salting. When grilling unsalted meat, it is customary not to turn the spit often to allow the blood to drain. If done otherwise, there is no harm. There is no difference regarding whether it is meant to be eaten grilled or cooked afterward; provided it is grilled to the point, that is, half-cooked. Some opine that the meat should be washed after grilling due to the blood that adheres to it. Deliberately, this is the custom; but if not done, even if cooked afterward, and even if salted before, it is permissible, as the fire expels the blood.</small>
If, at the time of slaughter, the jugular veins of the poultry are not severed, it is forbidden to eat it, even grilled, unless cut into several pieces before grilling. It is also forbidden to eat it raw without cutting and salting it beforehand. But if the veins are extracted, it can be eaten raw and grilled, even without salting and even whole. Some forbid eating it whole, even grilled unless the jugular veins and most of the circumference of the two tubes are severed.
One author forbids cutting with a knife the meat grilled without salting and not yet fully cooked, as the knife absorbs the blood. Another author declares the spit on which unsalted meat is grilled forbidden. Yet another author forbids leaving the meat on the spit after removing it from the fire and after it has stopped expelling blood, fearing it will reabsorb it. Some declare the meat permissible in all these cases.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: We declare these things forbidden deliberately and permissible when faced with a fait accompli.</small>
When unsalted grilled meat is placed on bread, the bread is permissible, even if it turns red, if the meat is already fit for consumption, according to most people's taste.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: That is, if it is already half-cooked. Similarly, the mere juice of the meat is permissible.</small>
When grilling unsalted meat, the grease that drips should not be collected in a vessel until the meat is cooked to the point of being fit for consumption.

Siman 77

<b>On Poultry Stuffed with Unsalted Meat</b><br>Poultry or kids stuffed with unsalted meat are permissible if intended for grilling; even if placed with the opening upward, and even if salted on the outer surface; as they will expel the blood from the stuffing while absorbing it.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: They are all the more permissible when salted only on the outer surface; as the fire expels the blood from the outer surface and prevents it from infiltrating the inner surface.</small><br>But they are forbidden if intended for cooking in a pot, unless salted separately on both the outer and inner surfaces. But if only the outer surface is salted, the inner surface cannot expel the blood.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This applies only when faced with a fait accompli; but deliberately, stuffing should only be done with salted meat. This applies only to stuffing consisting solely of meat or plants; but if there are also hard-boiled eggs, the stuffing is considered cooked in a pot and, therefore, forbidden, even when faced with a fait accompli. When grilling salted meat not washed afterward with salted and washed meat, it is permissible if faced with a fait accompli; but deliberately, unsalted meat should not be grilled with salted meat, even if washed.</small>

Siman 78

<b>On the Prohibition of Wrapping Unsalted Meat in Dough</b><br>When unsalted poultry is wrapped in dough, it is forbidden. Although the Talmud distinguishes between dough made of fine flour and ordinary flour, and between dough that turns red and otherwise, we are not able to ascertain these nuances: therefore, the poultry is forbidden in all cases. But if it has been salted and washed according to regulations, it is permissible in all cases.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is only forbidden to wrap meat in dough; but it is permissible to spread oil or brine on unsalted meat, as this does not prevent the expulsion of blood. Dough is treated by law as cooking in a pot, both in cases where it results in leniency and where it results in stringency.</small>

<b>Prohibition of Mixing Meat with Milk and Explanation of the Biblical Term "Cook"</b><br>The Scripture reiterates three times the negative precept: "Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk," to indicate the triple prohibition applied to the mixture of meat and milk: First, the prohibition of cooking it, second, the prohibition of eating it, and finally, the prohibition of deriving any benefit from it. The Scripture uses the term "cook" for the prohibition of eating to teach us that, according to biblical law, the mixture of meat and milk is prohibited only when it is in a cooked state, that is, hot; but it is prohibited in all forms by rabbinic ordinance.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is permitted to derive benefit from any mixture that is not prohibited by biblical law.</small>
The biblical term "kid" should not be taken literally; it includes under this expression also an ox, a lamb, and a goat; likewise, there is no difference between the mother's milk of the animal and other milk; the Scripture simply speaks of what happens most frequently.
The prohibition of the mixture applies only to that of meat and milk from a pure animal: if one of the two comes from an impure animal, cooking as well as enjoyment is permitted. Cooking and enjoyment are permitted if the meat comes from a wild animal or poultry, even if both the meat and milk come from pure animals. Such a mixture is even prohibited to eat only by rabbinic ordinance. Whereas the flesh of fish and locusts is not even prohibited by rabbinic ordinance.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is customary to put poultry meat in almond milk, seeing that such a mixture, even if the milk were real, is only prohibited by rabbinic order; but when it comes to beef, a few almonds must be left in the milk to avoid suspicion, as stated earlier, § 66, regarding blood.</small>
It is forbidden to cook meat in a woman's milk, due to suspicion; if such milk mixes with food, it is considered dissolved, without the food needing to present a specific quantity.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It apparently follows that it is all the more forbidden to deliberately cook a mixture where one of the elements comes from an impure animal. But only the flesh of beef; whereas that of poultry presents no problem, its prohibition being only rabbinic.</small>
One can eat eggs found in poultry together with milk, even if they are attached to the ovary, provided they are developed, that is, the white and yolk are already formed; but it is forbidden to cook them with milk if they only have the yolk. However, one can eat cheese or milk after eating such eggs.
One does not incur the penalty of lashes for eating the mixture smoked or cooked in thermal waters; the same applies to the mixture of meat and whey, milk from a dead animal, milk from a male, or the mixture of blood and milk.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Milk from a male is not considered milk at all, so it does not render the meat food it falls into forbidden. But milk from a dead animal and whey do render the food forbidden, like real milk; deliberately cooking them is also forbidden. Some opine that one should not stoke the fire under a gentile's pot because he sometimes cooks meat and sometimes milk in it, so by stoking the fire under such a pot, one is cooking the mixture. The same authors also forbid mixing the waters used to wash meat dishes with the waters used to wash dairy dishes and giving them to animals to drink, as deriving benefit from the mixture is also forbidden. Finally, the same authors opine that no other use should be made of the vessel containing the water used to rub the head, as this water contains ashes often mixed with meat and milk. For the same reason, one should prohibit the use of containers placed in ovens, as drops of meat and milk often splash onto these containers. When faced with a fait accompli, one need not heed these stringent opinions and, by disregarding them, one does not commit any reprehensible act.</small>
One incurs a penalty for cooking or eating a fetus with milk; but no penalty is incurred for cooking or eating the uterus, skin, tendons, bones, horn bases, or soft parts of the hooves with milk.
A certain author opines that casein is not comparable to whey and is forbidden by biblical law. Whey is the liquid that, after cheese preparation, separates from the curd floating on the surface; this milk, being very watery, is called whey.
Milk found in the stomach, even its liquid part, is not considered milk; therefore, it can be cooked with meat. A certain author forbids it.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Such is indeed the custom.</small>
Milk found in the stomach (deliberately, it should not be left to cool there; but in a case of fait accompli, there is no harm in it), which has been salted together with the stomach, or which has stayed there for a day, should no longer be used as rennet.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: If its liquid part has been used to curdle milk, all the cheeses are forbidden unless they present a quantity sixty times greater than that of the stomach; but if the solid part was used, the cheeses are not forbidden and therefore do not need the mentioned quantity. When the liquid part has solidified, it is considered as liquid. Some are more lenient in this regard; and in case of great loss, one can rely on this opinion. Sometimes the stomach is salted, dried until it becomes like wood, and then filled with milk; such a process is permitted because the skin, in this case, is so dry that it has nothing of meat.</small>
When milk is curdled using the skin of a stomach from a permitted animal, it is forbidden if it tastes like meat, and permitted otherwise. But if the stomach comes from a nebelà or terephà animal or an impure animal, even a single atom renders the milk forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Because any forbidden food used as rennet does not dissolve even among a thousand others. But this only applies when there is only one rennet; if there is another permitted rennet, then there are two active agents and therefore the milk is permitted if it presents a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden rennet.</small>

Siman 88

<b>Prohibition of Serving Meat and Cheese on the Same Table</b><br>It is forbidden to serve meat, even from wild animals or poultry, and cheese on the same table, for fear that they might be eaten together. But they can be placed together on the sideboard.
This prohibition applies only when the two people to whom these different foods are served know each other, even if they are on bad terms; but it is permitted when it comes to two strangers who do not know each other. Even in the first case, it is permitted when the foods are separated in an obvious way, for example, when each diner uses a special tablecloth, or when a bread is placed in the middle.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But in the latter case, the diners must not eat the bread placed in the middle of the table, otherwise, it would be taken as the bread serving the meal. But if a drinking vessel serves as a separation, the diners can drink from it if this vessel is not usually placed at that spot on the table. The separation is even more valid when made using a lamp or another object. The diners must take care not to drink from the same vessel, as food adheres to it; they must, even more so, not eat from the same bread. It is also customary to serve each diner another salt shaker, due to the crumbs that sometimes remain when dipping the foods.</small>

Siman 89

<b>Prohibition of Eating Cheese After Eating Meat</b><br>After eating meat, even from a wild animal or poultry, one should not eat cheese before an interval of six hours; and even after this interval, one must clean the teeth if there are meat remnants in the gaps. The interval must also be observed when one has chewed the meat to give it to a child.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: After cleaning the teeth, one must rinse the mouth before eating the cheese. Some opine that the six-hour interval is not necessary, and one can eat the cheese after removing the dishes, reciting the blessing at the end of the meal, and cleaning and washing the mouth. In our countries, it is customary to wait one hour after the meat meal before eating the cheese; but the mentioned blessing must be recited; because only then are the two meals distinct, otherwise not. It makes no difference if the hour serving as an interval is observed before or after the blessing. Meat remnants found in the gaps must be removed, even after the interval. Some opine that the middle blessing should not be recited expressly to eat cheese afterward; this is generally not taken into account. Some rigorously observe the six-hour interval; it is advisable to do the same.</small>
After cheese, one can immediately eat meat, provided one examines the hands to ensure no cheese remnants adhere to them; at night, when this examination is impractical, they must be washed, as well as cleaning and washing the mouth. Cleaning is done by chewing bread or any other food, except flour, dates, or vegetables, which adhere to the gums and do not clean well. The mouth is then washed with water or wine. This applies only to the meat of domestic or wild animals; but poultry meat can be eaten after cheese without prior cleaning or washing.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some also forbid eating meat after cheese. Indeed, it is customary not to eat meat, even poultry meat, after hard cheese, just as vice versa. Others permit it. It is not opposed, provided the mouth and hands are cleaned and washed. But it is advisable to be stringent on this matter.</small>
After a meat food, one can eat a dairy food; intermediate washing is, in this case, optional.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some require washing.</small> But if one wants to eat cheese even after a meat food, or vice versa, washing becomes obligatory.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Animal fat is considered the same as meat itself. Nowadays, it is customary not to eat cheese even after a meat food, just as after the meat itself. One should not deviate from this custom and open the door to abuses. However, if the food does not contain meat but is cooked in a meat pot, one can eat cheese afterward, without contradicting the custom. Indeed, it is customary to eat meat after dairy foods, only washing the hands in between. The same applies when eating a meat food after a dairy food that has been touched with the hands. The server does not need to wash when touching the foods; washing is only required for the diners.</small>
After a cheese meal, the bread crumbs must be removed from the table before serving the meat. Additionally, it is forbidden to serve cheese on the same tablecloth as meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The same applies vice versa.</small> It is even more forbidden to cut cheese, even cold, with a knife used to cut meat; and even the bread eaten with the cheese should not be cut with the knife used to cut meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is also forbidden to act vice versa. But it suffices to insert the knife into hard soil. However, it is customary among Israelites to have two different knives and mark one to recognize it. The custom is to mark the knife used for dairy foods; one should not deviate from the established customs in Israel.</small>

Siman 90

<b>The Udder</b><br>The udder is prohibited by rabbinic order, considering that, according to biblical law, meat cooked in milk from a slaughtered animal is not forbidden. Therefore, one can grill and eat the udder after cutting and removing the milk it contains. If it has been cut in a cross shape and pressed against the wall, so that no trace of milk remains, it can be cooked together with other meat. If the udder is not cut beforehand, whether from a young animal that has not yet suckled or from a mature animal, it is forbidden to cook it. If this precept is transgressed and the udder is cooked alone (and even more so if it is grilled), it can be eaten; if cooked with other meat, the meat must present a quantity sixty times greater than that of the udder, including the udder itself, meaning if the whole presents such a quantity, the udder is forbidden and the rest is permitted; otherwise, all is forbidden. In any case, if it falls into another pot, everything is forbidden, unless the said pot contains a quantity of meat sixty times greater than that of the udder, just as previously, because the cooked udder constitutes a forbidden piece; it is evaluated by its volume at the time of cooking, not by the volume it had when it fell.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that if the first pot into which the udder fell did not contain the mentioned quantity, it is not included in the evaluation for the second pot. This opinion is the most substantiated.</small>
It is customary not to cook the udder with other meat. When one wants to fry it alone or in pies, it must first be cut in a cross shape and pressed against the wall; but for grilling, it suffices to cut it in a cross shape.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: In a case where, transgressing the law, it has been cooked with other meat, it is declared permitted if already faced with a fait accompli and if it involves a great loss; otherwise, no. The custom of making several crucial incisions on the udder is preferable to pressing it against the wall. For grilling, it is deliberately prepared in the previous manner; but in the presence of a fait accompli, it is permitted even without any preparation if grilled alone. If grilled under these conditions with other meat, only the piece above is declared permitted; everything below is forbidden. But not all pieces are declared forbidden, fearing that the spit may have turned, considering that in the presence of a fait accompli, nothing is feared. Deliberately, one refrains from cooking or frying it in a pot, even without other meat and even when dried. In the presence of a fait accompli, it is permitted if, before cooking, it has been prepared as indicated. If dried for thirty days, it is permitted even cooked with other meat. It is customary to use the udder for pies cooked in the oven, but not for those cooked in a pan, as the pan is comparable to the pot. Some zealous individuals abstain from using it for all kinds of pies if not dried. Some forbid cooking together in a small oven the pies prepared with the udder and those prepared otherwise, and require placing some near the oven's opening. Although this is only an act of supererogation, it is advisable to take it into account deliberately.</small>
It is permitted to cut a hot udder with a knife used to cut meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: All the more so a raw udder, even filled with milk. The same applies vice versa. The dishes of one can also be used for the other. One can use the spit used for one for the other. Additionally, it is permitted to place them, even hot, on a single plate; for once grilled, the udder is comparable to other meat. But only if it has been prepared as mentioned; otherwise, all these cases are forbidden deliberately and permitted in the presence of a fait accompli. One does not consider the milk-filled cavities found in the udder prepared according to the law and grilled; similarly, one does not consider the milk's stay in the udder for a day before being grilled; for in such a case, the stay in a liquid is not comparable to cooking.</small>
For grilling or salting the udder together with other meat, one follows the law relating to the liver. A certain author permits salting the udder with other meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It should not be salted with other meat, but it is permitted in the presence of a fait accompli. The stomach, once free of milk and washed, is comparable to other meat and can, therefore, be salted together, having no similarity with the udder.</small>

Siman 91

<b>Mixing Meat and Milk</b><br>Contact between meat and cheese presents no problem; in such a case, the surfaces where the foods touched must be washed. It is permitted to wrap these two foods in the same towel, and contact is not feared.
It is forbidden to deliberately place foods in a state that would require washing, for example, to place cold meat in a forbidden and also cold dish, fearing that washing might be omitted. But only foods that are not usually washed, such as cooked foods; whereas it is permitted to act thus, even deliberately, with foods that are usually washed, for example, raw meat or some similar food.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This only applies to slightly liquid foods; but it is permitted to place completely solid foods in a forbidden vessel if it is cold, and no washing is needed. See further, § 122.</small>
Care must be taken that meat does not touch bread, as it would then be forbidden to eat this bread with cheese. The same applies to cheese, whose contact would render the bread forbidden to be eaten with meat.
When meat and milk, both hot, are mixed together, or even when one is cold and falls on the other which is hot, both are forbidden because it is always the food underneath that prevails; but when the hot food falls on the cold food, the meat is scraped and the rest is permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: In all cases where the meat needs scraping, it is permitted when faced with a fait accompli, cooked without scraping.</small> The milk is entirely permitted. If both are cold, it suffices to wash the meat.
Any food salted to such a degree that it can no longer be eaten, for example, the salting of meat before cooking, and which has stayed in the salt for the regulated time for meat, is considered, as long as it is not washed, as food that cannot be eaten due to the salt.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that after the regulated time, the food is no longer considered hot. In case of great loss and on the occasion of a meal prescribed by law, one can rely on this opinion; otherwise, no. The meat is considered hot even if salted on only one side. But if it is not salted to the mentioned degree, it is considered cold, even salted on both sides. Some opine that, being unable to make this distinction, we must consider the meat hot even if salted only for grilling. It is advisable to take this opinion into account when it is not a case of great loss.</small> The salting done on foods intended for travel renders the foods hot, even after washing, so that the foods must be scraped as long as they are not soaked in water. There is no distinction whether the salted food is placed on the unsalted food or vice versa; it is always the salted food that imparts its flavor to the unsalted food but does not absorb it. Thus, when meat and cheese touching each other are both salted, both must be scraped at the point of contact; if only one is salted, it suffices to wash that one, and the unsalted one must be scraped.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that in salting, one must always evaluate according to the quantity sixty times greater. See § 105 concerning the practice. One declares permissible when the permitted food is salted, and the forbidden food is not salted, only if the latter is solid; but if it is liquid, it renders the other also forbidden; for not being edible due to the salt, it absorbs the flavor of the other, so that both are forbidden. But only when the permitted food is slightly liquid; whereas it never absorbs the flavor of the other if it is completely solid. If both are solid, even salted, or moist for another reason than the salt, it suffices to wash them. The brine of salted meat, even salted for grilling, is considered hot. It follows that the brine renders the cheese or the vessel on which it falls forbidden; even if the meat itself does not render it forbidden because it is not considered hot, the brine does. The vessel touched by the forbidden brine needs to be scalded; if it is earthenware, it must be broken. If the brine touched the vessel in only one spot, and if it is wood or a similar material, it suffices to scrape that spot.</small>
Scraping suffices only if none of the pieces is fatty, because if it is, the entire piece is forbidden, as well as the neighboring piece, because the fat spreads throughout the thickness.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See § 105.</small>
The distinction between various degrees of salting applies only to raw meat; but roasted and hot meat that falls into salted foods, even at a low degree, needs scraping; and if it has cavities or is spiced, it is entirely forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The same applies if it is fried or cooked. Some opine that it is the same even when the foods are cold. It is advisable to conform to this when it is not a case of great loss.</small>
Meat salted with milk, or soaked in it, is only forbidden to be eaten; but benefiting from it is permitted.

Siman 92

<b>Milk Falling into a Meat Pot</b><br>When a piece of meat the size of an olive falls into a container of hot milk, the milk is tasted by a gentile; if he detects the taste of meat, the milk is forbidden; otherwise, it is permitted, even if it does not present a quantity sixty times greater than the meat. But the piece of meat is forbidden. However, this is only if the piece of meat was extracted before it had released the absorbed milk, i.e., it was extracted before the boiling ceased; but if it was extracted later, even if the gentile detects no meat taste when tasting it, it is forbidden unless it presents a quantity sixty times greater than the meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See further, § 98, where it is said that we do not rely on a gentile's tasting, and therefore, we always require a quantity sixty times greater.</small>
When milk falls into a meat pot, the piece touched by the milk is tasted: if no milk taste is detected, everything is permitted; otherwise, that piece is forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: We, who do not rely on a gentile's tasting, require that the piece presents a quantity sixty times greater than the milk; otherwise, everything is forbidden.</small> The entire content of the pot is evaluated: if the entire content of the pot, including other pieces, vegetables, sauce, and spices, presents a quantity sixty times greater than the piece touched by the milk, only that piece is forbidden and the rest is permitted. This applies only if the pot was not stirred from the beginning and was not covered; but if it was, everything in it contributes to dissolving the milk.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Similarly, if it was not stirred at the beginning or the end, nor covered, only the piece is declared forbidden, but the rest is permitted if the content of the pot presents a quantity sixty times greater than the drop of milk that fell in. The same applies when the pot was stirred or covered at the beginning but not at the end, provided it was stirred or covered immediately after the forbidden food fell in.</small><br>Similarly, when milk falls into the liquid part of the pot or on a piece that cannot be distinguished, the pot is stirred to mix all the pieces; if a milk taste is detected, the content of the pot is forbidden; otherwise, it is permitted. When a gentile cannot be found to taste it, the quantity mentioned is evaluated.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some dispute this opinion, claiming that stirring the pot is only useful if done immediately after the forbidden food falls in. Such is indeed the custom.</small>
When a piece of meat becomes forbidden due to contact with milk, the prohibition extends to all parts of the piece, so that if it is cooked with other pieces, they must present a quantity sixty times greater than the entire piece. If it is recognized, it is thrown out, and the other pieces are permitted; otherwise, the liquid part is permitted, while all the pieces are forbidden if the fallen piece is presentable.
The law relating to the extension of the prohibition applies only to the mixture of meat and milk, but not to other prohibitions. Thus, when a piece absorbs forbidden fat the volume of an olive and does not present the required quantity to dissolve the fat, it suffices, when this piece is cooked with others, that the latter present a quantity of sixty olives, i.e., sixty times as much as the fat, for the piece that absorbed it to become permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that the law of extension of the prohibition applies to all kinds of prohibitions. Such is the custom, and one should not deviate from it. But this is only if the prohibition adheres to the piece or if it entirely rises above the liquid part; but if neither condition is met, the law of extension does not apply, so the entire content of the pot contributes to dissolving the prohibition. However, it is advisable to declare the piece itself forbidden. This applies only to other kinds of prohibitions; whereas in a mixture of meat and milk, the mentioned law applies even if neither of the aforementioned conditions is met. Some opine that the law of extension does not apply to liquid foods. One can rely on this opinion for other kinds of prohibitions in case of great loss, but not for the mixture of meat and milk. For solid foods, the law of extension does not apply to any kind of prohibition. See further, § 99, art. 15, regarding the law of extension. For a vessel that has absorbed a prohibition, the law of extension does not apply; therefore, a quantity sixty times greater than the prohibition absorbed by the vessel suffices.</small>
When a drop of milk falls on the outer surface of a meat pot near the fire, it suffices that the content of the pot presents a quantity sixty times greater than the drop of milk if it fell on the wall below the level formed by the foods, for in this case, the drop of milk spreads into the pot and is comparable to a drop falling into the foods themselves. But if it fell on the wall above the level, it spreads into the thickness of the wall and reaches the liquid part inside the pot; now, this part of the wall does not present a quantity sixty times greater than the drop, so it becomes forbidden, rendering the foods touching it when emptying the pot forbidden. Therefore, in such a case, the only solution is to let the pot cool before touching it.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But this applies only when the pot has already been used; whereas, when it is new, it suffices in all cases to have a quantity sixty times greater than the drop, as is the case further, § 94, regarding a spoon.</small>
It is customary to declare forbidden when the drop falls on the part of the pot's wall above the level, but only on the side opposite the fire; while the fire dries the drop if it falls on its side.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: In which case, the pot is also permitted.</small> However, this applies only to a drop; but if milk falls in a larger quantity, even on the side of the fire, it is only declared permitted if it falls below the level of the foods and they present a quantity sixty times greater than the milk.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The pot remains forbidden even if there is the required quantity; therefore, the pot must be emptied immediately on the side opposite to where the milk fell. For a second cooking in this same pot, one proceeds as for the first.</small>
A certain author declares, in a pressing case, for example, on the eve of the Sabbath, the foods permitted if they present the mentioned quantity, even if the milk fell above the level and on the side opposite the fire.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Such is the custom. When one places a hot pot on milk or another hot forbidden liquid spilled on the floor, the milk or forbidden liquid is considered as a second vessel if it is not near the fire; therefore, the pot is forbidden because it absorbs a little; whereas the foods it contains are permitted because the bottom prevails. When a liquid spills from a hot pot and reaches another cold pot, it is also considered a second vessel if there is a break in continuity; otherwise, it is considered a stream; the cold pot becomes forbidden if the liquid reaching it is hot enough to burn the hand, while the foods it contains are permitted; for the stream only requires scraping. But if the pot is hot and a first vessel, and all the more so if it is near the fire, everything is forbidden even if the liquid reaching it is cold because the bottom prevails; so this case resembles cold food falling into hot food, where everything is forbidden, as stated earlier, § 91. A drop falling on the pot lid is comparable to a drop falling below the level of the liquid in the pot; but only if the pot has already started boiling because then the steam rises to the lid and falls back into the liquid.</small>
When one places a dairy pot in the oven below a meat pot, the steam from the dairy pot rises and renders the meat pot forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: If the dairy pot contains milk, the meat pot must present a quantity sixty times greater than the milk. But only if the dairy pot is uncovered so that the steam rises directly from the milk to the pot, and only if the pots are close enough that the steam burns the hand when held at the height of the upper pot; but everything is permitted if otherwise. That is why it is customary to hang meat to dry above milk pots, and one does not worry about the steam. Similarly, when the dairy pot is covered, everything is permitted because the case resembles two pots touching; since the contact presents no problem, it is even more so for the steam. However, deliberately, one should avoid all of this.</small>
When a drop from a tallow candle, made like wax candles, falls on a vessel, it suffices to scrape the vessel; but if a drop of hot and melted tallow falls on a vessel, the vessel needs to be scalded.

<b>Prohibition of Cooking Milk in a Pot Used for Meat</b><br>One should not cook milk in a pot that has been used for cooking meat; if this is done within twenty-four hours, the second food is forbidden if it has the flavor of the previous one.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The required quantity is evaluated based on the entire pot.</small> But if there was an interval of twenty-four hours between one cooking and the other, the communicated flavor is altered; therefore, the food is permitted, but the pot can no longer be used for cooking either meat or milk.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, it can be used to cook other foods. The pot lid is treated the same as the pot itself. Some are more stringent and equate cooking after the interval to cooking before the interval. This is the custom in some countries, and I myself am accustomed to act this way, following the established custom. But this is merely an act of supererogation, without a legal basis. Therefore, when other circumstances favor the case, or when the foods are intended for the Sabbath meal, or in case of great loss, it is declared permitted if the lid was used only after the interval, as is the case with the pot itself. When one covers a dairy vessel with the hot lid of a meat vessel, if both are hot and both contain foods, both are forbidden; the same applies when the lid is cold and the vessel hot if the vessel emits steam, because the lower one prevails; but the reverse, everything is permitted, only the foods must be scraped if possible; otherwise, everything is permitted. If the pot does not contain foods, everything is permitted, as this case is comparable to two pots touching.</small>

<b>A Dairy Spoon Immersed in a Meat Pot</b><br>When a dairy spoon is immersed in a meat pot, or vice versa, the evaluation is based on the part of the spoon that was immersed.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: If the spoon is from the same day, that is, if it has been used within twenty-four hours.</small> A certain author claims that when the spoon is metal, the entire spoon is evaluated because heating one part benefits the whole.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The first opinion is the most substantiated. Such is indeed the custom.</small>
When the spoon has been immersed twice in the pot without realizing it, the pot's content must present twice the required quantity.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some opine that once suffices. Such is indeed the custom.</small>
When there is the required quantity to dissolve the spoon, the pot and the foods are permitted, but the spoon can no longer be used for either meat or milk, as it has absorbed both; thus, it renders any food forbidden, even in the case of a fait accompli, if it is immersed within twenty-four hours. But if there is not the required quantity, the enjoyment of everything is forbidden, even the pot; however, it is permitted to put fruits or cold foods in it, as in such a case one does not benefit directly from the forbidden thing.
If the spoon is not from the same day, the pot and the foods are permitted, but the spoon can no longer be used, deliberately, for either meat or milk. However, in the presence of a fait accompli, it does not render the foods in which it is immersed forbidden, as it is not from the same day.
When water has been boiled in a new pot twice on different occasions and each time a spoon has been immersed, the first time a dairy spoon and the second time a meat spoon, and the water did not have the required quantity either the first or the second time, it is forbidden to use this pot for either meat or milk; but one can cook something else in it, as it is new and has never been used.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But if one cooks meat or milk in it, it is permitted, as the absorbed flavor has passed through a permitted intermediary. When a same-day spoon is immersed in a pot filled with vegetables or water, but which is not from the same day, or vice versa, everything is permitted if there is the required quantity. It is customary to consider the foods as belonging to the nature of the utensil that is from the same day and to declare the utensil that is not from the same day forbidden. This is merely an act of supererogation, for according to the law, everything is permitted.</small>
When onions or vegetables that have absorbed meat are cooked in a pot used for milk, only sixty times the amount of meat contained in the onions or vegetables is required if the quantity is known.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: For the law of extension does not apply to this case, as everything is still permitted. The same applies all the more so when cooking meat in a pot used for milk and in which water has been boiled between one cooking and the other; therefore, sixty times the amount of water boiled is not required, but sixty times the amount of milk absorbed by the pot.</small>
When hot meat is cut with a knife used for dairy foods, the entire piece is forbidden if it does not present a quantity sixty times greater than the faces formed by the cut. But if the knife is not from the same day, or in case of doubt, it suffices to scrape the faces formed by the cut.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But this only applies to meat from a first vessel; it is only then that everything is forbidden if the knife is from the same day and there is not the required quantity; even the knife, in this case, must be scalded. But if the meat is from a second vessel, the meat must be scraped and the knife inserted into the soil. Such is the custom. Even when the knife is not from the same day, the meat must be scraped a little because of the fatty substances adhering to the knife.</small>
When cheese, even slightly liquid, falls on a pan, or when hot cheese falls on a plate used for meat the same day, it suffices to scrape it.
When honey is cooked in a pot used the same day for meat, and it is poured hot into a pot used the same day for milk, it is permitted, as the absorbed flavor has passed through a permitted intermediary.

Siman 95

<b>Permissibility of Eating Fish and Eggs Cooked in a Meat Pot with Cheese</b><br>It is permitted to eat with dairy foods fish cooked or fried in a vessel used for meat, but well washed, so that no fatty substance adheres, as the absorbed flavor passes, in such a case, through a permitted intermediary. But when the vessel is not well washed and the fish do not present sixty times the amount of the fatty substance adhering to the vessel's wall, it is forbidden to eat them with dairy foods.
It is permitted to stuff a poultry, even deliberately, with an egg cooked in a vessel used for milk; but it is forbidden to eat with dairy foods an egg cooked, even with the shell, in a pot containing meat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some are more stringent in this regard and forbid even grilled or cooked foods, even if the flavor has passed through an intermediary. The custom is to declare this case forbidden deliberately and permitted when faced with a fait accompli. But only for eating them together with milk or meat, whereas it is permitted, even deliberately, to put them in the vessel used for one or the other food. Such is the custom. Similarly, when they were not cooked or grilled but simply placed in a meat vessel, they can be eaten with milk, and vice versa. When the vessel is not from the same day and imparts an altered flavor, it is customary to eat them, deliberately, with the other food. However, on the condition that the foods are not spiced; if, on the contrary, spiced foods are cooked in a meat vessel, even if it is not from the same day, or if peppers are pounded in a mortar used for meat foods, it is forbidden to eat them with milk, even when faced with a fait accompli, unless they present a quantity sixty times greater than the absorbed meat. Food is not called spiced if there is only a little spice; it must be entirely or largely composed of spice. See § 96.</small>
When dishes used for meat are washed in a boiler used for milk and filled with hot water that burns the hand, both are permitted, the boiler and the dishes, even if they are from the same day, as the absorbed flavor has passed through a permitted intermediary. But provided the person who washed them assures that there was no fatty substance on the dishes; if there was, the water must contain sixty times the amount of the substance.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some forbid even in the absence of any fatty substance unless one of the vessels has served as a first vessel within twenty-four hours, in which case all the vessels are permitted. Deliberately, the water is declared forbidden. But if both are from the same day, all are forbidden if washed together in a first vessel. Such is the custom which should not be deviated from. But provided they were washed together and in a first vessel; whereas they are permitted if washed one after the other or in a second vessel. The stream from a first vessel of meat onto a dairy vessel is comparable to a first vessel and renders it forbidden if it is from the same day. But if hot neutral water is poured onto vessels used for both foods, all are permitted, even if they present fatty residues; for the stream is not quite similar to the first vessel to cause absorption between the vessels. When one finds a dairy dish among the meat dishes, one does not fear that they were washed together in a forbidden manner.</small>
It seems to me that if ashes are put into the water before immersing the dishes, they are permitted even if covered with fatty substances; for the ashes alter the flavor.
One should not place a dish containing a dairy food near a salt container, but it is permitted to place it near a vinegar container.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This prohibition applies only to uncovered containers, and even in this case, it is permitted if one is faced with a fait accompli, and there is no concern that a few drops from the container have fallen into the salt.</small>
It is permitted to place a meat vessel next to a dairy vessel in a pantry.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some forbid this deliberately. If it is not necessary, one should refrain from it deliberately.</small>
It is permitted to use salt placed on a meat dish for dairy foods.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Blessed is he who refrains from this as well, for some declare such a procedure forbidden if done deliberately.</small>

<b>Spicy Food Cut with a Meat Knife</b><br>It is forbidden to eat with dairy foods radishes or turnips cut with an uncleaned knife that has been used the same day for meat, unless one first removes the thickness of a finger from the surfaces formed by the cut, or has determined by tasting that they have no meat flavor; in which case, it suffices to wash them. Some opine that the same applies when the knife is not from the same day or is cleaned. If they have been cooked with dairy without removing the surfaces formed by the cut, and without tasting them, a quantity sixty times greater than the part touched by the knife is required. The same rule applies to a gentile's knife.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: If they were cut into thin slices, sixty times the entire radish is required. Some opine that the radish is entirely forbidden if cut with a forbidden knife, and forbidden to be eaten with dairy if cut with a meat knife. This is the custom deliberately; but in the presence of a fait accompli, it suffices to remove the surfaces formed by the cut. But only the radish itself, whereas there is no problem if only the leaves adhering to the radish were cut. In case of doubt whether the cut was made with a forbidden knife, one inclines to leniency. Therefore, one can buy radishes whose beards are cut, as it is assumed they were cut with a hoe or spade. When no other radishes are found than those cut with a knife, it is customary to buy them and be content with removing the surfaces formed by the cut.</small>
The same law applies to a knife used to cut garlic, onions, horseradish, or similar spicy vegetables, or tart fruits, or salted fish.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, it is permitted to eat sauces prepared by gentiles, such as those with cloves, for gentiles have special utensils to detach the clove flowers or they pluck them by hand.</small>
It is forbidden to eat with dairy foods peppers pounded in a mortar used the same day for meat foods.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some forbid this even if the mortar has not been used the same day.</small>
Lemon juices sold by gentiles, as well as pieces of salted fish contained in barrels and also sold by gentiles, are permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: For they bring them in large quantities, so the part that becomes forbidden due to the gentile's knife is dissolved by the rest which absorbs the flavor. Thus, everything is permitted. The same applies to other foods. This is why in some countries people eat compotes prepared by gentiles, even though the fruits have been peeled and cut with a knife. In other places, people are more stringent about this, and one should not deviate from the custom. However, it is customary to declare permitted fruits that are not tart like lemons, such as apples or dried quinces; there is no hesitation for these fruits.</small>
It is permitted to eat with dairy foods gourds cut with a meat knife, and it suffices to scrape the surfaces formed by the cut. This scraping even becomes unnecessary when it comes to melons, where a simple wash suffices; this even suffices for cold foods cut after the melons, for the flavor of the melons differs from that absorbed by the knife, which it dissolves.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But this applies only to melons, not to other vegetables, bread, or similar foods. And even after the melons, it is only permitted to cut cold foods once, but not multiple times, unless melons are cut between each cold food.</small>

<b>Prohibition of Kneading Bread with Milk</b><br>It is forbidden to knead bread with milk, lest one later eat this bread with meat. If it is already done, it is forbidden to eat the bread, even alone. But if the bread is small and intended for one meal, or if it is given an unusual shape to mark that it should not be eaten with meat, it is permitted. Similarly, bread baked in an oven greased with tail fat is comparable to bread kneaded with milk.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This is why it is customary to knead bread with milk during the Feast of Weeks, and with fat for Sabbath meals, firstly because the quantity is insignificant, and secondly because these breads are given a shape distinct from ordinary breads. This is all the more permitted for flans or pies. One should not bake bread in the oven together with flans or pies, lest the fat from these flows under the bread; if so, the bread is considered kneaded with fat. It is customary to place the bread near the oven's opening. Deliberately, one should refrain from such a procedure, even when baking them in a pan.</small>
Bread should not be baked in an oven greased with tail fat without heating it white-hot inside; external heating is not sufficient, even if the oven is masonry.
It is forbidden to eat with dairy foods bread baked together with roasted meat or fish fried in the oven together with meat. This applies only if the oven is small; but it is permitted to eat them with dairy foods if the oven has the capacity of five hundred and eighteen eggs and its opening remains open; this is also permitted, even if the oven is small, if the roasted meat is covered or the opening of the mold in which the pies are baked is closed.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See further, § 108, regarding the custom in such a case.</small>

<b>On the Mixing of Forbidden Food with Permitted Food and Dissolution</b><br>When a forbidden food is mixed with a permitted food of a different nature, for example, when forbidden fat is mixed with meat, the mixture must be tasted by a gentile. If the gentile says that they do not detect the flavor of the forbidden food, or if they do detect it but find it altered, the mixture is permitted, provided that the forbidden food has not subsequently improved the taste of the mixture; but the gentile must not be made aware that their opinion is needed. If there is no gentile to taste the mixture, the permitted food must be sixty times the amount of the forbidden food. The same applies to a mixture of two foods, one forbidden and one permitted, but both of the same nature, making tasting ineffective; in this case, the permitted food must be sixty times the forbidden food.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Nowadays it is customary not to have the mixture tasted by a gentile; it suffices to evaluate if the quantity of the permitted food is sixty times that of the forbidden food.</small>
If the mixture is composed of two foods of the same nature and the pot is overturned in such a way that it is impossible to determine if the quantity of the permitted food was indeed sixty times greater than that of the forbidden food, if it was recognized before the accident that the permitted food made up the majority of the mixture, it is permitted; otherwise, it is forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Foods with the same name, although of different forms, are of the same nature; in this case, it is the similarity of name, not taste.</small><br>If the mixture is composed of two foods of different natures and the pot is overturned, if it is known that the quantity of permitted foods is greater than that of forbidden foods, but it is uncertain if the former outweighs the latter sixty times, the mixture is forbidden. If the mixture consists of foods of the same nature and foods of different natures and the pot is overturned, making it impossible to know if the quantity of permitted foods is sixty times greater than that of forbidden foods, if it is known that the majority of the mixture is composed of permitted foods of the same nature, the mixture is permitted, with the foods of different natures considered dissolved.
The above mixture is only permitted in the case of the pot being overturned. But when witnessing the mixing of forbidden foods with permitted foods without being able to evaluate if the quantity of the permitted food is sixty times that of the forbidden food, the use of this mixture is prohibited by rabbinical authority.
When a forbidden food is cooked with a permitted food, or a forbidden food, visible and whole, is thrown out of the pot, the quantity of the permitted food must be sixty times that of the entire forbidden food, as it is impossible to evaluate the degree of flavor imparted to the mixture by the forbidden food. Consequently, when permitted foods are cooked in a pot that, on the same day, was used to prepare forbidden foods, the quantity of foods being cooked must be sixty times the weight of the pot. The same applies when, by mistake, a spoon that was used to prepare forbidden foods is dropped into a pot containing permitted foods; the quantity of the latter must be sixty times greater than the part of the spoon that came into contact with the forbidden foods. Indeed, it is impossible to evaluate the quantity of forbidden food absorbed by the pot or the spoon. The law makes no distinction regarding the material of the pot or the spoon; it does not matter whether these utensils are made of iron, clay, or wood.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Sixty times the weight of the pot is only required in the case of absorption by this utensil of forbidden foods subjected to the action of fire. But if the absorption occurs due to salting, the foods being cooked need only be sixty times greater than the quantity obtained by scraping the inside of the pot.</small><br>There are those who are stringent regarding a metal spoon and require sixty times against all of it even if only part of it was inserted, because if part of it is hot, it is all considered hot.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: We follow the first opinion (that only requires sixty times the part that was inserted). Any forbidden food that is nullified by sixty, if it is recognizable, must be removed even though its taste has already been nullified by sixty. Therefore, if milk falls into a dish and its taste is nullified by sixty, one must add cold water, as the nature of milk is to congeal and float to the surface, and then remove it. Since it is possible to remove it, it is considered as if it is recognizable and must be removed. If a forbidden food was nullified in a pot and was removed, and then fell into another pot, it needs to be nullified again by sixty against its entire amount, and so on. However, if it fell into the first pot twice, it only needs to be nullified once by sixty (see above in chapter 94).</small>
The quantity of forbidden food is known, for example, a new spoon or any other spoon previously absorbed an amount of milk equal in volume to half an olive: it is then plunged into a pot of meat. In this case, the permitted food in the pot must outweigh the quantity absorbed by the spoon by sixty times. But if the spoon, already old, was used the same day, the weight of the meat must be sixty times greater than that of the entire spoon.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The quantity absorbed is unknown; therefore, the entire weight of the spoon is forbidden.</small><br>It is also claimed that a quantity sixty times greater than the absorbed amount suffices.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The first opinion is preferable; it also aligns with paragraph 92, which deals with a small drop of milk falling into a pot of meat. Some authors, according to the law, make no distinction between a new spoon and one that has already been used; this difference would only exist between earthen and metal utensils. According to them as well, it is impossible to completely rid earthenware of forbidden food; consequently, only earthenware and not metal is considered a forbidden utensil. Under these conditions, it is preferable to strictly apply the Law. (See § 92.)</small>
A forbidden food the size of half an olive has been mixed with a permitted food. The latter must be sixty times greater than half an olive, the size of the forbidden food.
When an egg cooked with other eggs contains a small chick or a small drop of blood, they must be sixty-one times greater than the forbidden egg containing the small chick or the small drop of blood.
The udder can be dissolved by a quantity fifty-nine times greater than its own.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Nowadays, all forbidden mixtures can be dissolved with a quantity of permitted food sixty times greater than the forbidden food, except for leavened bread during Passover and wine from a gentile, for which the law must be applied; provided that the permitted food has not taken on the flavor of the forbidden food, otherwise, the mixture is forbidden, even if the permitted food is a thousand times greater than the forbidden food. Indeed, a mixture, whatever it may be, is always forbidden if it retains the flavor of the forbidden food. Salt, vegetables, which change the taste of dishes, must therefore be considered insoluble if by their nature they are forbidden.</small>
In a pot containing a quantity of permitted foods equal in volume to fifty-nine olives, two forbidden foods, for example fat and blood, both of an olive's volume, fall in. In this case, each forbidden food counts to dissolve the other with the fifty-nine parts of permitted foods and the mixture is permitted. The same applies in the following case: forbidden fat of an olive's volume falls into permitted foods representing in volume twenty-nine olives; in another pot containing permitted foods equivalent in volume to thirty olives, blood of an olive's volume accidentally falls in, then these two quantities are mixed: this mixture is permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Indeed, if these two forbidden foods of a volume equal to two olives, the first from meat and the second from cheese, each can dissolve the other.</small>

Siman 99

<b>On Considering Bones to Dissolve a Forbidden Food, and the Prohibition of Deliberately Mixing an Unpermitted Dish</b><br>When a piece of forbidden meat containing a bone falls into a pot containing permitted food, the forbidden bone counts with it to dissolve the piece of forbidden meat; it goes without saying that the permitted bone counts with the permitted food and the marrow of the forbidden bone with the latter; as for the pot, it remains outside.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some authors are more stringent on this point and forbid counting the forbidden bone with the permitted food to dissolve the forbidden dish; but when applying this rule causes too great a loss, one can rely on those whose less stringent opinion allows counting the forbidden bone with the permitted food to dissolve the forbidden food. This opinion is also the better-founded one.</small>
The forbidden bone only counts with the permitted food if the piece of forbidden meat was raw before coming into contact in the pot with the permitted food. But if the piece of forbidden meat had been previously cooked, the forbidden bone counts with the forbidden piece, as during cooking it absorbed forbidden meat.
In all cases where there has been absorption, the forbidden piece is counted with the permitted food to dissolve the forbidden part absorbed by it.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is not customary to proceed this way, as the entire mixture is forbidden.</small>
The evaluation of the broth and the bodies floating on its surface, such as scum, that of the permitted food and the forbidden food, and the various pieces composing the mixture, only takes place after boiling. This must be done even if the quantity of the permitted food would, before boiling, be greater than what is required, as boiling reduces a part of it. This only concerns cases where the permitted and forbidden foods are of different natures; if, on the contrary, these foods are of the same nature, account must also be taken of the scum and the part absorbed by the pot. The foods are then considered intact, and the loss caused by boiling is not taken into account.
It is forbidden to deliberately dissolve a forbidden dish. Consequently, when a forbidden food is in contact with a permitted food that is not sixty times greater than the former, it is forbidden to add the necessary quantity of permitted food to dissolve the forbidden food. But if the dissolution or addition of a certain quantity of permitted food occurs unintentionally, the mixture is permitted. If the act was intentional, the mixture is forbidden both for the person who performed the dissolution, when this mixture belongs to them, and for the person for whom it is intended; but it is permitted for any other person.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is forbidden to sell this mixture to another Israelite, for no one should profit from a forbidden food dissolved contrary to the Law.</small><br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This concerns the case where the mixture is composed either of dry foods or even of liquid foods; according to some authors, a food that has absorbed a certain quantity of a forbidden dish is not considered a forbidden piece. But the piece subjected to absorption remains forbidden, even after adding a quantity of permitted foods capable of making these sixty times greater than the forbidden food. Some authors claim that the mixture is permitted when one was not aware beforehand; otherwise, it is forbidden.</small>
By rabbinical decree, it is forbidden to mix a forbidden food with a permitted food; consequently, if this mixture was done deliberately, it is forbidden. But if a food forbidden by rabbinical decree accidentally falls into a permitted food that is not sixty times greater than the former, one can increase the quantity of the permitted food to dissolve the forbidden food.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some authors claim that one cannot dissolve a food forbidden by rabbinical authority; and, just as one cannot dissolve a biblically forbidden food, one cannot increase the quantity of the permitted food to dissolve the forbidden one. This is the practice followed and should not be deviated from. A mixture containing a forbidden food dissolved once and a quantity of permitted foods sixty times greater than the first is forbidden when it is increased by a quantity of forbidden food equal to the first. This prohibition applies even when the mixed foods are of the same or different natures, dry or liquid, and also when one was or was not aware of the mixture of the permitted foods with the forbidden foods. A small quantity of milk equal in volume to an olive falls into a quantity of water sixty times greater; this water, in turn, is poured into a pot of meat; the use of this meat is permitted, even when it does not represent a quantity sixty times greater than that of the water, as the latter has dissolved the milk.</small>
One can use a pot that has absorbed a small quantity of forbidden food when it is habitually used daily for preparing permitted foods; indeed, the absorption of a very small quantity of forbidden food cannot impart a flavor to the permitted food. The same applies to vessels, jugs, and dishes that have been used the same day to prepare forbidden food. It is, indeed, impossible for such a small quantity to have imparted a flavor to the permitted foods. But this is not the case when the pot, which has absorbed a certain quantity of forbidden food, is rarely used for preparing permitted foods, or when its capacity is not very large, as in this case, the quantity of forbidden food absorbed can impart its flavor to the permitted food.

<b>In a Mixture, a Quantity of Permitted Food a Thousand Times Greater than an Insect Cannot Dissolve It</b><br>An insect, like a moth, and impure poultry cannot be dissolved by a quantity of permitted foods a thousand times greater; this also includes the sinew, the limb of a living animal, the chick still in the egg. But this law only applies in things which has life, and excluding a grain of wheat; furthermore, the item must be forbidden by its very nature, with the exception of pure poultry that has lost this quality and the stoned ox. The forbidden item must be whole, as in case of disappearance it loses its name, except for the forbidden fat; the animal must be in good condition.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The true place of the sinew is on the round of the femur, and its width is about four fingers; if it is intact, it should be considered as animated.</small>
When an insect has been cooked with permitted food, the latter is forbidden if the insect is invisible; this prohibition applies to the liquid part itself if it has taken on the flavor; but if the insect is visible, it must be removed, and the food and liquid are then permitted if they are sixty times greater than the insect. The sinew is exempted as it cannot impart a taste to the permitted food since it itself has no flavor; but for the fat of the sinew, which can communicate its flavor, a quantity sixty times greater is needed. Consequently, when a thigh has been cooked with its sinew, the latter must be removed if it is still visible: then all the remaining foods are permitted if they are sixty times greater than the fat of the sinew. But if the sinew is invisible, all the foods are forbidden; as for the liquid part, it is permitted if it represents a quantity sixty times greater than the fat of the sinew; otherwise, the liquid part itself is forbidden. If the sinew has been minced and is invisible, the mixture must contain a quantity of permitted foods sixty times greater than the sinew.
The broth in a pot is forbidden if an insect that cannot be found falls into it.
When three worms are found in cooked vegetables, they are forbidden; the liquid part is permitted but must be filtered, and the meat is also permitted, provided it is washed and checked for worms.

<b>On Presentable Pieces</b><br>A presentable piece is considered like an insect that cannot be dissolved even with a quantity of permitted foods a thousand times greater. It is also forbidden to derive any benefit from a forbidden presentable piece.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: A food forbidden by rabbinical authority cannot itself be dissolved; but if there is doubt about the nature of the piece, one can be less stringent even if it were a biblical prohibition.</small>
The prohibition regarding the presentable piece only applies to food forbidden by its nature, such as the flesh of an impure animal, or part of a mixture of meat and milk; otherwise, or even if the prohibition results from a mixture in which the permitted food is not sixty times greater than the forbidden food, the rule of the presentable piece does not apply.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: One can dissolve a piece of meat that has not been salted, as the prohibition only results from the absorption of blood and not from the nature of the piece itself. When the prohibition results from scraping, the forbidden food can be dissolved, as scraping is not presentable.</small>
One can dissolve a chicken that, not having been slaughtered according to the law, is mixed with other chickens still with their feathers, as it cannot be offered to a guest with its feathers. The same applies when it has only been plucked after the mixture, as only cooking makes it presentable. A whole sheep and a piece too large are not presentable, as it would be an insult to offer them to a guest. Some authors, however, protest against this opinion.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This last opinion has prevailed, except for the chicken that has not been plucked, as the operation requires much work. Similarly, the legs and head that have not been depilated are not considered presentable pieces; otherwise, they are considered presentable pieces, even without being salted. A whole sheep is considered a presentable piece that cannot be dissolved, like goose legs, except for poultry legs. The feet of small livestock living in our regions and the heads of poultry are not considered presentable pieces.</small>
The fat of the small intestine is not presentable.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Goose fat is presentable and cannot be dissolved.</small>
The gizzard and the large intestine are not presentable.
One cannot dissolve the insect and the presentable piece if they are whole; but if they have been cut or crushed or have lost their shape, they are no longer presentable and can be dissolved even if the dismemberment occurred after their mixture with permitted foods. However, this operation must not have been done with the intention of dissolving the forbidden food; otherwise, the mixture is forbidden both for the one who did it and for the one it belongs to.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is irrelevant whether the foods composing the mixture are of the same nature or not.</small>
When a piece from a mixture has been cut without knowing if it was taken from the forbidden piece, with the intention of dissolving it and permitting the use of the mixture, only the small piece is always permitted; indeed, if it was taken from the forbidden piece, the whole mixture is permitted as the forbidden piece is no longer presentable, and if it was taken from the permitted piece, the latter is permitted by its nature. When the majority of the foods composing the mixture have been cut, the use of all the cut pieces is authorized without even knowing if they come from the forbidden food or the permitted food; only the whole pieces are forbidden.
When a chicken with a perforated gizzard is mixed with other chickens, one compares the fat of the gizzard at its attachment point with that of the other chickens; if the fats are similar, the other chickens are permitted.
When the head of a forbidden sheep is found among several other slaughtered sheep, without knowing to which animal it belongs, one must try to fit the forbidden head on the neck of one of the sheep; if the fit is perfect, one can use this proof to permit the use of the other sheep.

<b>On Foods That May Be Permitted</b><br>A food, for example, an egg laid on a holiday, may be permitted for the next day. But if it was, either whole or broken, mixed with other eggs, it cannot be dissolved even if the other eggs represent a quantity a thousand times greater. Similarly, when it is unknown if it was laid on a holiday, one cannot use the eggs with which it was mixed. But if the same egg was mixed with another food of a different nature, the mixture is permitted if the permitted food represents a quantity sixty times greater.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, the mixture is forbidden when this egg was used for a sauce or to enhance the quality of a dish.</small>
According to one author, the rule regarding the food that may be permitted and the prohibition of dissolving it only applies to food whose use could be postponed to the next day without causing loss; but in case of doubt, it can be dissolved if the permitted food in the mixture is sixty times greater than the food that might not be usable the next day. Consequently, when it is unknown if an egg was laid by a pure or impure chicken, this egg is not considered in a mixture with other eggs as food that may be used the next day, as it is not certain it can be used on that date.
A pot forbidden for having absorbed a certain quantity of forbidden food is mixed with other pots among which it is impossible to recognize it; it is not considered a utensil that can be used the next day, and if the other pots are in the majority, all the pots are permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Cleaning and tinning would result in too great a loss.</small>
One author claims that food that can spoil cannot be considered as food that may be permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, food intended to be used the next day can only be dissolved if it remains intact or if a small part of it still exists in the mixture; but if only the taste remains in the mixture, this food can be dissolved. The same applies when the prohibition does not result from the nature of the food; consequently, a piece of meat that has not been salted for three days is not considered as food that may be permitted, as the prohibition does not result from its nature, but from the absorption of blood. This opinion prevails although some authors claim that the piece of meat should be considered as food that may be permitted because it can be grilled. Any forbidden food that becomes invisible before the mixture can be dissolved; the same applies to food that may be permitted. When a person has vowed not to eat a food, this food cannot be dissolved in a mixture and is considered, for that person alone, as food that may be permitted, as the permission to eat a forbidden food by one's vow can be granted upon their request. Permitted food that has fallen under a prohibition, such as leavened bread during Passover, is not considered as food that may be permitted. Some authors oppose this opinion and claim that the law of food that may be permitted applies only to food forbidden to all without exception; but if this food is forbidden to one person and permitted to another, it should not be regarded as food that may be permitted. An example is cited: food cooked on the Sabbath is forbidden to the person who prepared it and permitted to others.</small>

<b>On Alteration of Flavor</b><br>Any forbidden food whose flavor is altered cannot cause a prohibition in a mixture, even if it is naturally good, although forbidden; if its flavor is increased while altering that of the mixture, the mixture is permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, a mixture is forbidden when it includes foods that are themselves forbidden, such as insects; these do not change the flavor of permitted foods by their nature, but they alter it, and a quantity a thousand times greater cannot dissolve them.</small>
The change in flavor should not alter the permitted foods to the point that they cannot be eaten; it suffices that the flavor is slightly altered for the mixture to be permitted. According to another opinion, this law only applies to a mixture containing mostly permitted foods; but if it contains mostly forbidden foods or is composed equally of both types of foods, its flavor must be altered to the point that it is unpleasant to eat. But the mixture is permitted, even if its flavor is only slightly altered when it contains nothing but the taste of the forbidden food. According to another opinion, the law should be applied more strictly; its defenders claim that when the quantity of a mixture is increased by adding a forbidden food that has altered its flavor, this increase can only be enjoyed if the taste of the mixture is completely spoiled. This only concerns cases where the alteration of flavor has persisted continuously; but if the presence of the forbidden food initially improved the flavor of the mixture to alter it later, or vice versa, this mixture is forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, the mixture is permitted even if its flavor has been altered by the forbidden food, but the pot is forbidden. Consequently, when food is cooked in this pot for twenty-four hours and the flavor of the first forbidden food is communicated to the second food, the latter must be sixty times greater than the former; otherwise, it is forbidden. When a spoon dipped in a forbidden food and then in a permitted food alters the flavor of the latter, the pot is permitted. The same applies when it concerns a food that has no flavor; for example, the presence of bee legs in honey that has been melted does not prevent the use of the pot.</small>
The forbidden food alone does not have the power to alter the flavor of the mixture; a second food that can give it this power falls into the pot where it is found, containing, for example, a large quantity of salt and vegetables; the mixture thus formed is permitted.
One can use the oil and honey of a gentile, even to cook meat, as the latter alters their flavor.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some authors claim that meat does not alter the flavor of honey, but that of the drink prepared with honey; when the loss is not significant, one can observe the law more strictly. When meat or fat has been cooked with the wine of a gentile, this mixture is permitted, as the meat and fat alter the flavor of the wine.</small>
A permitted food cooked in a pot that was used to prepare a forbidden food is permitted if this pot was not used the same day for a forbidden food, as it is assumed that the pot has altered the flavor of the permitted food. If the pot has not remained unused for twenty-four hours, it is considered as having been used the same day, and the permitted food cooked in this pot is forbidden; but if a twenty-four-hour interval has separated the two cookings, the use of the permitted food cooked in this pot is authorized, as the flavor communicated to the pot was altered. The pot must be very clean and not greasy; otherwise, the food cooked in it is forbidden and considered as a forbidden food that does not alter the flavor. Some authors claim that the permitted food cooked in a pot that has not been washed can be used.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: If the permitted food is sixty times greater than the forbidden substances adhering to the walls of the pot, its use is authorized if the pot was not used the same day to prepare a forbidden food. This is the practice followed in such cases.</small>
According to another opinion, a spiced food placed in a pot that was used the day before for a forbidden food is itself forbidden, as the spices enhance the flavor.
A pot has absorbed a certain quantity of a mixture of meat and milk, these two foods cooked together or one after the other, then it has been used to heat water; it is considered, before a night has passed, as having been used the same day for a forbidden food. One must wait twenty-four hours from the moment the water was heated.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: But if a night has passed since the cooking of the forbidden food, the use of the permitted food cooked in this pot is authorized; the same applies, after the same period, to a pot that has been used for a mixture of meat and milk, even if, in the meantime, water has been heated. According to practice, anything that has absorbed a certain quantity of forbidden food is forbidden; but when the loss resulting from this prohibition is too great, it is always possible to authorize the use of certain forbidden things, provided that the pot remains unused for twenty-four hours after cooking the forbidden food.</small>

<b>On the Presence of a Rat in Wine or Beer</b><br>In a mixture, the dormouse gives a pleasant flavor: previously, moreover, important people regarded it as a delicacy. It is not known if the rat, which lives in dwellings, alters or improves the flavor of wine and vinegar. When a rat falls into vinegar or cold beer, this liquid is permitted if, within twenty-four hours, the rat is removed whole. But if the same liquid is hot or cold and the rat is removed whole or in pieces after a stay of twenty-four hours, the liquid is permitted if it can be filtered, contains no trace of the rat, and is sixty times greater in volume than the animal.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Only the presence of an insect is to be feared, not that of other forbidden things.</small>
If the rat has fallen into wine, oil, or other beverages, it is certain that it has altered the flavor; therefore, it is not necessary for this liquid to be sixty times greater than the amount of flavor imparted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The rat that falls into fat alters the flavor. Some authors are even more stringent, even for solidified fat, placed liquid each day in the same pot; it can indeed be assumed that the rat fell into the still hot fat, which is then forbidden, even if it represents a quantity sixty times greater than the rat. But when it is certain that the rat was not in the pot when the hot fat was poured in, the use of this fat is permitted despite the presence of this animal when it is solidified; one must, however, remove the part surrounding the rat. The fat is thus permitted due to the double doubt: the first doubt concerns the state of the fat, which could have been solidified at the time of the rat's fall; and the second doubt arises from the fact that the fat, although liquid at one point, could have been solidified before it had time to take on the flavor of the rat, and the part surrounding the latter is, therefore, inedible; it cannot be used to make candles for the Temple, as the offering intended for the altar must be pure. If the loss caused by the prohibition would be significant, one could rely on the most lenient opinion.</small>
If insects such as flies, moths, mosquitoes, which inspire some disgust, fall into a permitted food and are dissolved by cooking, these foods must be in large quantities, and then their use is authorized. They must still be examined and filtered if possible.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: When it comes to vinegar or beer, one must be very cautious and act as with a rat.</small>

<b>On Forbidden Food Falling into Permitted Food</b><br>When a forbidden food has stayed for twenty-four hours with a permitted food in a cold liquid, it is said that these two foods are marinated: marinated foods are considered as cooked foods, and the entire mixture is forbidden. But if the foods have stayed together for less than twenty-four hours, it is sufficient to wash the permitted food for its use to be authorized.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Wherever marinated foods are considered as cooked foods, the piece that is outside the brine is forbidden like the one submerged in it, because the latter, through its emanations, imparts its flavor to the former. Some authors are less stringent with the piece that is outside the brine. The foods are forbidden when it is unknown whether they are marinated or not; this prohibition does not apply to the marinade of meat and milk. In case of doubt, the rule is applied less stringently, as the mixture of meat and milk is only biblically forbidden if cooked.</small><br>When foods are put on the fire and boiled for some time in brine or vinegar, these foods are considered cooked and, consequently, they are forbidden; but if they have stayed in the brine for a short time, it is enough to scrape the permitted food for it to be usable.<br><small>(See § 70, on meat placed in brine.)</small>
When water heated in a first vessel burns the hands, it is considered hot enough to cook food and these foods are forbidden; but when the water from the first vessel is poured into a second, its temperature is no longer high enough to cook food. Some authors claim that the water from the first vessel poured into the second cannot impart flavor to the food nor absorb part of it; others, on the contrary, argue that the water from the second vessel can do both, and they require the food to be scraped. When done deliberately, this latter opinion must be accepted, but when faced with an accomplished fact, the foods are permitted without scraping; it is enough to wash them.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See §§ 68, 92, 95, for an explanation of a second vessel and the mixture.</small>
When a hot forbidden food falls into a permitted food still having the heat of the first vessel or even if it was cold at the time of its fall, the entire mixture is forbidden; indeed, the food at the bottom of the vessel always imparts flavor to the one placed above it; the latter, in turn, heats up and imparts its flavor to the food placed below it. It goes without saying that the entire mixture is forbidden when the cold permitted food falls into the hot forbidden food; but if the upper food is hot and the lower food is cold, scraping alone suffices, even in the case where the first is a forbidden food.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This only concerns the case where the permitted food is plunged into the forbidden food contained in a first vessel that has just been removed from the fire; but if the permitted food has been placed next to or above the forbidden food transferred to a second container, the use of the permitted food is authorized, because, as previously explained, the prohibition disappears through the use of a second vessel. The entire mixture is forbidden if the two foods have been placed next to each other while still having the heat of the first vessel. However, if one of these foods is cold, it is enough to scrape the part of the permitted food that has been in contact with the forbidden food, and then the use of the permitted food is authorized. In the case where a forbidden food has been placed in a permitted vessel or a permitted food has been placed in a forbidden vessel, it is assumed that the lower food imparts more flavor; the case is the same as that of two pieces, one forbidden, the other permitted. When a lamp burns, fueled by tallow or forbidden fat, it is forbidden to add permitted fat to it using the utensil that contains it; but when faced with an accomplished fact, this prohibition is not taken into account.</small>
This only concerns the case where a forbidden food has fallen into a liquid food, because, through boiling, the flavor of the former is imparted to the latter in its entirety; but when a forbidden food, hot or cold, falls on a permitted food roasted and still on the grill, it is enough to scrape the latter to the thickness of a finger. Therefore, when the thigh has been grilled with its sinew, or when a forbidden piece has been grilled with a permitted piece, for the thigh, the part surrounding the sinew must be removed, and for the permitted food, the part that was in contact with the forbidden food. A permitted food is authorized when a forbidden piece falls, at the time of boiling, into the pot that contained it, when part of this forbidden piece exceeds the level of the uncovered pot; the mixture must not boil and the permitted food must be scraped. If the permitted food has only been partially submerged in the liquid part, according to one commentator, it must be considered as if it had been fully submerged; according to another commentator, the entire mixture is forbidden, even when only a small part has been submerged in the liquid; this prohibition must be observed, even when the piece as a whole exceeds the level of the liquid part, when the pot has boiled covered, because with the aid of steam, the forbidden piece imparts its flavor to all the foods contained in the pot.
Scraping is only sufficient for a grilled piece, for the thigh with its sinew, for a lean food, all of which cannot impart their flavor to the entire piece. But the prohibition must be observed for a fatty kid grilled with its forbidden fat; even the tip of the ear cannot be eaten, as this part is fatty and the fat imparts its flavor everywhere. However, if the kid is lean, even if it does not represent a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden fat, it can be eaten provided it is scraped; the fat of a lean animal is considered by nature as unable to impart its flavor. It is not permitted to grill a forbidden lean piece with a permitted fatty food, as the forbidden piece imparts its flavor everywhere. If a forbidden food capable of imparting its flavor falls on a grilled piece, one must scrape the place touched by the forbidden food if this place is visible, even if the permitted food is sixty times greater than the forbidden food.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Food cooked without boiling or roasted in the oven is considered as grilled food. Some authors, based on the impossibility of discerning whether the food is truly lean or truly fatty, prescribe observing the prohibition if the quantity of permitted food is not sixty times greater than that of the forbidden piece, and in this case, they order scraping the part that touched the latter. This practice has prevailed. This only concerns the prohibition related to fat or any other fatty food; but when it is certain that the forbidden food is not fatty, the use of the permitted food is authorized, provided it is scraped. (This is a consequence that can be drawn from the commentator's opinion.)</small>
When a grilled food, emitting steam while cooking, is placed in contact with a cold food, the former imparts more flavor; consequently, when a hot food falls on a cold food, the use of the permitted food is authorized on the condition of scraping it, but if the cold food falls on the hot food, the permitted food is forbidden if it is not sixty times greater than the forbidden food.
One cannot eat the permitted food that has come into contact with a forbidden piece if the prohibition results from the nature of the latter, for example, a piece of an impure animal, a mixture of meat and milk; but in the opposite case or when the food is forbidden only for having absorbed a certain quantity of a forbidden dish, the permitted food in contact with it is authorized, even when the two pieces have been grilled together. This only concerns the food that has absorbed a certain quantity of a piece incapable of imparting its flavor; but if it has absorbed part of a food that by its nature vaporizes easily, such as fat, the piece, grilled or simply in contact with it, is forbidden; the same applies to two hot foods or when the lower piece is hot and the upper piece cold, as by absorption the flavor of the forbidden food is imparted to all the pieces.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This concerns two pieces in contact, but when it concerns a pot that has absorbed a certain quantity of a forbidden food, the permitted food placed in this pot is forbidden, even if it has only absorbed part of a lean forbidden food.</small>
The kidney grilled with its fat is not forbidden, but it must be scraped, as the membrane is placed between the kidney and the forbidden fat.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, the kidney is forbidden; this is the accepted opinion. The kidney is considered as the forbidden fat grilled with a piece of meat; consequently, the kidney must be sixty times greater than its fat when cooked with it, otherwise, it is forbidden. The same applies to the diaphragm cooked with its membrane.</small>
The permitted food, which cannot be eaten because it is too salty, is considered as a hot food mixed with another forbidden food, and it must be scraped; if this food was the fat of the sinew, veins, or membranes, the prohibition must be observed, and the part of the permitted food in contact with the forbidden food must be removed. If it is indeed the forbidden fat, the quantity of the permitted food must be sixty times greater than the forbidden fat. When the meat salted with the fat was fatty, even if it concerns the fat of the sinew with its veins, the meat must represent a quantity sixty times greater than the fat, and the part that touched the veins must be removed or at least scraped. This only concerns the piece of meat adhering to the forbidden fat; as for the pieces salted with it, they are forbidden if they do not represent a quantity sixty times greater. Each piece must represent the prescribed quantity, as the fat cannot impart its flavor without boiling; consequently, all the pieces are forbidden when it is unknown if all have been touched by the fat, but when it is certain that only one piece has been touched, but without knowing which one, all the pieces are permitted, as the majority prevails, even when the pieces are presentable.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, it is enough to scrape the permitted foods salted with forbidden foods. But since it is impossible to know exactly what is fatty or what is lean, it is customary to consider salted meat as if it were cooked; consequently, the mixture is forbidden if the permitted food does not have a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden food. According to many commentators, all the pieces are permitted when they represent a quantity sixty times greater than the one containing the forbidden fat, except for the latter; as for the piece that touched it, it must be scraped a bit. All the pieces are also permitted when it is not known which one touched the forbidden piece. But if the total of all the pieces does not form a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden piece, all the pieces are forbidden and it is not permitted to violate this prohibition, even if there was a possibility of doing so. However, one can accept more lenient opinions, even if it involves a forbidden fatty food that can impart its flavor; in this case, there is unanimous agreement that scraping alone suffices in the case of salting; likewise, it does not matter whether the forbidden food is fatty or lean, when its quality is unknown. This only concerns forbidden foods that can be considered fatty or placed in brine: but, according to a single opinion, for forbidden foods that do not fall into one of these categories, such as Passover bread, scraping alone suffices. Some authors claim that in case of significant loss, the use of the salted food is authorized when it has only been scraped; although according to long-standing practice, permitted salted foods must be sixty times greater than the forbidden food, one can still accept the most lenient opinion, as the prescribed quantity for the case of salting is, according to Rambam and Maimonides, only a custom; it is not the same when it involves a fatty forbidden food, as, according to the law, the permitted food must in this case have the prescribed quantity.</small>
This only concerns two foods, one permitted, the other forbidden, that have been salted. The case is the same when only the forbidden food is salted and the permitted food does not have a strong flavor; otherwise, a simple washing is sufficient.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, the prohibition must be observed when the two foods have been in contact; others express a less stringent opinion when the loss would be significant.</small>
When of two foods, one permitted, the other forbidden, the former does not have a strong flavor and the latter is fatty, the use of the permitted food is not authorized if it does not represent a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden food; however, for this prohibition to exist, the latter must have been placed at the bottom of the pot and the permitted food above it, as the lower food always imparts more flavor. If the permitted food was placed at the bottom of the pot and the salted forbidden food above it, the use of the former is authorized, but it must be scraped.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to another opinion, there is no difference concerning the position of the forbidden food in the pot. This is the accepted opinion in such cases.</small>
Cheeses made and salted in a gentile's molds are permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Similarly, the use of a permitted food is authorized when it has been salted in a forbidden vessel whose walls are not perforated with holes, as salting does not have the same force as cooking to make the vessel release the substances it has absorbed. Of course, this must be a fact and not a deliberate act.</small>
Salt and vegetables placed in a vessel used for meat can be used for dairy foods.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The same applies when it involves permitted foods placed in a forbidden vessel; it is obvious that a vessel cannot absorb any part of a dry food. The vessel must be clean and no forbidden substance must adhere to its walls. Blessed is the one who, deliberately, wishes to be more stringent.</small>
When salt has absorbed blood, for example, the salt used to salt meat, or when salted meat is placed in a pot without being washed, the permitted food can be used if it represents a quantity sixty times greater than the salt.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Even when the salt has imparted flavor to the permitted food placed in the pot, its use is authorized, as the salt is not forbidden by its nature, but only because of the blood it has absorbed. Consequently, the food that was initially permitted and then became forbidden cannot, in turn, aggravate the prohibition.</small>

<b>On the Dissolution of Forbidden Foods by Permitted Foods Representing a Quantity Sixty Times Greater</b><br>A permitted piece that does not represent the prescribed quantity has absorbed a certain quantity of forbidden food, then it falls into a pot: the food placed in this pot is permitted if it forms, with the fallen piece, a quantity sixty times greater than what was absorbed; the fallen piece is alone forbidden, as it has not completely expelled the quantity of forbidden substance it had absorbed.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This is the better-founded opinion, but it is not the opinion of the author who, in § 92, claims that the fallen piece in the pot is also permitted. However, the following restriction must be noted. The liquid food is forbidden if it does not represent a quantity sixty times greater than the blood that fell into the pot; but the mixture is permitted by increasing the permitted food so that it exceeds the prescribed quantity; in this way, the blood is dissolved.</small><br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: It is customary to consider all prohibitions as falling under the case of the forbidden piece, and there is no difference between the liquid food and the solid food; the latter, mixed with other permitted foods, remains forbidden if these do not represent a quantity sixty times greater. It must, therefore, be removed from the mixture if it is visible and, if it is invisible, it can be nullified provided it is not presentable. Conversely, the entire mixture is permitted when the forbidden food is liquid, and the permitted food forms a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden food.</small>
A piece of meat with its forbidden fat has been cooked in a pot in which the other foods represent a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden fat; in this case, none of the foods in the pot should be removed, as it is feared that the permitted foods may no longer have the necessary quantity to nullify the forbidden food at the end of cooking. The forbidden piece should not be removed before complete cooking either, as the forbidden fat may prohibit the use of the mixture. How should one proceed? The pot and the foods must be allowed to cool.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: When it is customary to apply the case of the forbidden piece to all prohibitions, the forbidden food must be removed from the pot, and then the rest is permitted.</small>

Siman 107

<b>On the Presence of an Impure Thing in a Pot Containing Cooked Eggs</b><br>Eggs should not be removed from the water where they were cooked with their shells until they are cold; to hasten the cooling, fresh water can be poured over them, only then is it permitted to remove them; this is done for fear that one of them contains a chick. Removing them from the water before complete cooling leaves the egg containing the chick until the end, and it may happen that the other eggs no longer represent the prescribed quantity to nullify the forbidden egg, and then all the eggs can be forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, all the eggs placed in a vessel with a forbidden egg are themselves forbidden, as it may happen that the latter remains the last in the vessel; if the remaining quantity is not sufficient to nullify the forbidden egg, the use of all the eggs is prohibited, and if these same eggs are later placed in the same vessel, everything in it is forbidden. The same applies when an impure fish is found in a vessel containing other small fish placed in several batches; it can indeed be assumed that the impure fish remained the last. According to another opinion, the prohibition would not exist, as one cannot create a prohibition when it is unknown whether the permitted food was not sixty times greater than the forbidden food. This last opinion is accepted, especially when considering that those who are very stringent do not extend the prohibition to the pot used for cooking the fish, as they maintain the same quality for the pot as it had before.</small>
When a fly or repugnant insects fall into cooked foods, they must be removed, but the foods are permitted, as the substances released by these insects do not prohibit the use of cooked foods.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This is the accepted opinion. Some authors, to be sure, are more stringent, but the lenient opinion prevails, and there is no need to deviate from the practice followed in such cases. A fish or other similar item has been removed from a pot with a spoon; it is then forbidden to put the spoon back into the pot containing the permitted foods. If this is done, the pot must contain a quantity of permitted foods sixty times greater than what they absorbed and not the quantity of the spoon, as the vessel is not considered a forbidden piece. But if the spoon, reinserted into the pot, contained, in addition to the forbidden piece, a small quantity of the permitted food, the latter must be sixty times greater than the forbidden fish and the part of the food removed along with it, as this small quantity is considered a forbidden piece.</small>

Siman 108

<b>On the Prohibition of Cooking Permitted Food with Forbidden Food in the Same Oven</b><br>It is forbidden to roast permitted meat and a forbidden piece or the flesh of an impure animal in the same oven, even if these different pieces do not touch; but if this happens by chance, the prohibition disappears, even when the forbidden meat is fattier than the permitted meat. However, one can use the same oven to roast permitted meat and forbidden meat, but under the following conditions: the oven must have a capacity of 96 liters of flour, its opening must remain open, and the pieces of meat must not touch. This can be done even when the oven is small and its opening closed if one of the vessels containing the meat is covered.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The same applies when the two foods are one of meat and the other of milk. However, it is customary to take the prohibition more seriously when done deliberately; but when faced with an accomplished fact, the most lenient opinion is accepted, even if the oven is small. When bread and meat have been baked in the same oven, it is forbidden to eat the bread with milk, if there is other bread available; similarly, if a gentile has baked bread at the same time as a forbidden food in the same oven, it is forbidden to buy this bread if it is possible to obtain other bread, as this would be a deliberate act. But when it is not easy to obtain other bread, the prohibition disappears, as it is considered an accomplished fact. According to some authors, the prohibition must be observed even in the case of an accomplished fact when it involves a food emitting a flavor, unless the oven is open on the side where the smoke exits; however, if the loss resulting from this prohibition would be significant, the case of an accomplished fact can be admitted, even if the oven was closed. If the forbidden food is spiced, as is the permitted food, the flavor is emitted with more force, and the prohibition must not be violated, even in the case of an accomplished fact, provided that the vessels containing the two foods are uncovered; but if one of them was closed with a bit of dough alone, the use of the permitted food is authorized. When two foods, one permitted, the other forbidden, have been cooked or roasted uncovered in the same pan, the first is forbidden, even in the case of an accomplished fact, and if bread and meat were cooked this way, the bread cannot be eaten with milk. There is no need to observe the prohibition if the permitted food and the forbidden food were cooked in the same oven one after the other; however, when the pan has received the evaporation of the two foods, the permitted food is forbidden, even if these foods were cooked one after the other, but uncovered, as the pan is considered a lid. Some authors claim that wherever there is an emission of flavor, one cannot argue the case of an accomplished fact if the permitted food does not represent a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden food; but if the permitted food has the prescribed quantity, its use is authorized, and everything in the oven can dissolve the forbidden food. This is the accepted opinion in case of loss. According to other authors, the permitted food is forbidden even if it has the prescribed quantity when it concerns, for example, leavened bread on Passover; the oven being small and closed, and the vessels containing the two foods uncovered, the flavor of the forbidden food is emitted and makes observing the prohibition necessary, even in the case of an accomplished fact. According to another opinion, there is no need to make this distinction; but when the loss would be significant, one can follow the most lenient opinion.</small>
This only concerns the case where the permitted food and the forbidden food have been roasted in the same oven; but if each food has been cooked in a separate pot, the use of the permitted food is authorized, even if the oven is small, its opening closed, and the two pots uncovered.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This only refers to an oven that is slightly open; but when the oven has been hermetically sealed to prevent the cooling of the dishes, as is customary on the Sabbath, the permitted food is forbidden. According to some authors, the prohibition must be observed even in the case of an accomplished fact when the permitted food and the forbidden food are cooked in uncovered vessels; but if the loss resulting from this prohibition is too great, one can rely on the most lenient opinion.</small>
When there is a bit of forbidden fat in a pan, it cannot be used the same day for a permitted food; but if the pan has not been used the same day, it can be used, as it is impossible to do otherwise.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Cleaning and scraping the pan are not sufficient when it has been used the same day for preparing forbidden foods.</small>
Bread placed hot on the open bung of a barrel of wine intended for idols is forbidden, but the bread thus placed is permitted when it is cold and the opening is open or vice versa. However, when it is made with barley flour, it is forbidden when placed, still hot, on the barrel of wine even if closed.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Because the bread has absorbed the odor of the wine intended for idols, the case is not the same as in the first article. Rabbi Asher Thesphoth and several famous authors prescribe very strict observance of the prohibition regarding bread that has absorbed the scent of wine intended for idols. The cause of the stringent view of the Talmudic scholars is clearly understood; it is not merely a religious issue, but also a moral one. They aim to distance Israelites from pagan worship and any minor custom found in their morals.</small>

<b>On the Mixture of Two Dry Foods</b><br>A non-presentable forbidden piece has been mixed with other permitted pieces of the same nature, then all have been dried together; this mixture can be dissolved if the permitted food represents a quantity twice as great as the forbidden food. Additionally, the three pieces must be able to be offered to a person, provided they are eaten one after the other. According to another opinion, these three pieces cannot be offered or even eaten one after the other.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This concerns a mixture in which the two foods are not entirely confused; they are mixed together, but the forbidden food is isolated and invisible.</small><br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: The first opinion is accepted, even when done deliberately. Some authors are more stringent and require removing one of the pieces and giving it to a non-Israelite to eat, but this is only done as an extra precaution. The previously stated rule only applies if the two foods are of the same nature; otherwise, even if both are dry, the permitted food must be sixty times greater than the forbidden food; furthermore, no distinction is made between rabbinical and biblical prohibitions.</small>
The use of a mixture of dry foods, some permitted, others forbidden, is only authorized if the quantity of the permitted foods is twice as great as that of the forbidden foods; but when these two foods are cooked together and eaten separately, the mixture is forbidden if the permitted foods do not represent a quantity sixty times greater than that of the forbidden foods, as through steam, the flavor of the latter is imparted to all the pieces and prohibits their use. When one intends to cook such a mixture, if the permitted food does not have the prescribed quantity, one increases it to make it sixty times greater than the forbidden food. This can be done even deliberately.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, the entire mixture would be permitted if known before cooking, as one cannot create a new prohibition when one cannot remove the first. This opinion is accepted especially when the loss would be significant.</small>

<b>On Doubtful Prohibitions</b><br>A very small quantity of a presentable forbidden food prevents the use of a permitted food with which it has been mixed. Presentable foods include seven, namely: Pheroch nuts, Don pomegranates, commodities stored in barrels, eggplants, pineapples, watermelons, and homemade bread. Additionally, living animals are considered presentable foods that cannot be annulled. As for other foods, even those usually sold by piece, they are considered foods that can be dissolved with a quantity sixty times greater. A very small quantity of a highly valued forbidden product by the inhabitants of the country, such as Pheroch nuts and Don pomegranates in Palestine, prohibits the use of a permitted food; one relies on the appraisal of the people of the region.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to another opinion, any food usually sold by piece cannot be annulled. This is the accepted practice in such cases. However, this prohibition regarding the highly valued food that cannot be annulled is rabbinical; therefore, in case of doubt, it can be applied less stringently.</small>
Permitted animals have been mixed with other forbidden animals and slaughtered; they are no longer presentable and can be annulled, provided they were slaughtered by mistake.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: This only concerns small animals that are not presentable after slaughter.</small>
Nine out of ten butcher shops sell meat slaughtered according to the law, and the tenth sells forbidden meat; if one buys meat in a butcher shop without knowing if it is one of the nine permitted shops, this meat cannot be eaten, as the number of butcher shops of each category is well fixed, and it is considered that there is no majority. But one can benefit from the meat found in the street or in the hands of a gentile, as most butcher shops sell meat slaughtered according to the law; in this case, each butcher shop taken separately is considered part of the majority of permitted butcher shops. This opinion is in accordance with biblical law, yet the rabbinical scholars do not accept it, even when all the slaughterers and butchers are Israelites.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: See § 63. However, it has been said that any object that has been separated from a group of heterogeneous things is considered to be of the same nature as the majority of the group from which it originates; but this only concerns the case where it is unknown in which butcher shop the meat was bought; if known or if seen bought by the gentile, it is treated as if taken from a non-permitted butcher shop.</small>
The majority of butcher shops sell meat slaughtered according to the law and the minority sell otherwise; therefore, when a piece of meat has been bought from a butcher shop without knowing if it is one of those that slaughter according to the law and it has been mixed with other permitted meats, the use of this mixture is permitted due to the double doubt.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some authors claim that in this case, the mixture is forbidden, as the general rule is as follows: when a prohibition still exists, it is considered that there is no majority, and since the object on which the first doubt falls is forbidden by the Bible, there is no longer a double doubt to permit the use of the mixture. This opinion must be accepted.</small>
A presentable piece of meat has been bought from a butcher shop, then in this same butcher shop, non-kosher meat according to religion is found; one can eat the meat bought before the discovery of the non-kosher meat, as the doubt does not fall on the fixed object until the separation of the purchased piece of meat, and since the majority of the meat was permitted, the use of all the meat is authorized. But from the discovery of the non-kosher meat, it is forbidden to buy from what remains, even a non-presentable piece, as one cannot exactly distinguish the presentable piece from the non-presentable one, and one may be mistaken.
Forbidden animals or other highly valued and non-nullifiable foods have been mixed with other permitted foods, then one of the parts composing this mixture has separated from the majority; this part is forbidden if the separation was done voluntarily, otherwise, it is permitted.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, in the case of deliberate separation, when a small part of the mixture has been separated alone and the rest remains in the same state as before, one may fear falling on the forbidden food; but if the separation of the various parts of the mixture has been complete, the small quantity first separated is permitted, the rest is forbidden. This is the opinion of the author's father-in-law, the illustrious Grand Rabbi Shachno. A forbidden chicken has been mixed with other permitted chickens; any egg laid by one of them, without knowing which one, is permitted; yet, chickens are considered highly valued foods that cannot be nullified even by a quantity a thousand times greater, but for the eggs, the majority rule is applied.</small>
One of the following items, a presentable piece, an animal, a living insect, a food that may be permitted for the next day, has been mixed with another permitted food, then a food from this mixture has been eaten by mistake, or the food removed from the mixture has fallen into the sea without being able to retrieve it; in this case, the rest of the mixture is permitted, provided it is eaten all together. Indeed, the mixture always contains a permitted food, but one cannot eat each food separately.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Even if it is forbidden to eat these foods together, it is also forbidden for one person to eat them, and two people cannot eat them in one go.</small>
A presentable food is mixed with other permitted foods, then a food from this mixture falls into two other permitted foods, and finally, a food from this second mixture falls into two other permitted foods; this second mixture can be used because the forbidden food from the first mixture is in the minority. Conversely, when a food from the first mixture falls into permitted foods, one cannot use this new mixture, even if the permitted foods form a quantity a thousand times greater. In the first case, thanks to the majority principle, several doubts could be conceived; therefore, when a food from the second mixture falls into other permitted foods, the use of this third mixture is authorized.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: However, one person cannot eat all the foods. This only concerns a food whose use is forbidden by a certain prohibition; but if the prohibition is doubtful, the introduction of this food among other permitted foods does not prevent the use of the third mixture thus obtained. According to some authors, one cannot authorize, due to the double doubt, the use of a mixture in which a food that may be permitted for the next day has entered. It is good not to violate the established law, as it is already lenient enough.</small>
When a doubtful food has been mixed with other permitted foods, the entire mixture is forbidden if the permitted foods do not have the quantity necessary to dissolve it; the forbidden food must be susceptible of being nullified, because if the first doubt relates to the object itself of the prohibition, it must be observed due to the double doubt.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: According to some authors, the mixture is forbidden, as one is faced with a biblical prohibition; there is then only the doubt about the mixture, the double doubt disappears and therefore the mixture is forbidden. But if the double doubt results from a general prohibition that combines the two doubts, one can apply the case of the double doubt even for a biblical prohibition. The same applies to a typically forbidden food, such as the forbidden poultry in the following example: a chicken, after being slaughtered, is found to have a broken or detached wing; it is not known if this accident occurred before or after the slaughter; it may also be that the fracture did not perforate the lung; this chicken is permitted because of the double doubt, even when it is possible to ascertain the severity of the accident by examining the lung. There is no fear to have in this regard.</small>
The sick lung of a sheep is found among other healthy lungs and the inspector declares that he has noticed the adhesion of said lung; if this lung is mixed with other healthy lungs, but the sheep to which they belonged have not been mixed, these are considered as kosher.

Siman 111

<b>On the Mixture of Permitted and Forbidden Utensils</b><br>One has two pots, one forbidden, the other permitted; next to them are two pieces of meat, one permitted, the other forbidden by Talmudic decree, such as the fat of the sinew, and each of them falls into a pot; in this case, the use of the food placed in the permitted pot is authorized, as it is assumed that the forbidden piece fell into the forbidden pot and the permitted piece into the permitted pot. The permitted food does not even need to form the majority of the mixture. The same applies when there is only one pot and one of the two pieces, without knowing which, falls into this pot; as previously mentioned, the permitted food does not need to form the majority of the mixture. When the prohibition emanates only from rabbinical authority, one can apply the law less strictly when two pots placed next to each other contain one permitted and the other forbidden foods, and it is not known in which the forbidden food fell.
The prohibition is observed with moderation even if the permitted food does not constitute the majority, provided the forbidden food does not outweigh the permitted food; but if the forbidden food constitutes the majority, the prohibition must not be violated.
However, when faced with a biblical prohibition, it is assumed that the forbidden food fell into the forbidden pot, provided the permitted food is greater in quantity than the forbidden food, as the nullification must also be biblical.
It is permitted to be lenient when one can practice the biblical nullification of the forbidden food, as in the following example: one has two pots, one containing meat slaughtered according to the law and the other a forbidden piece; a small quantity of forbidden food falls into one of them, without being able to know exactly which one; one can dispense with strictly applying the rule if the permitted food outweighs the forbidden food: indeed, it is possible to nullify by biblical decree the forbidden foods when the various parts of the mixture are of the same nature, and the quantity of sixty times is only prescribed by Talmudic decree. Conversely, if the two pots contain permitted foods of the same nature, but the forbidden piece is of a different nature, the permitted food must outweigh the forbidden food by sixty times.
One has two pots of permitted foods and two pieces of meat, one forbidden, the other permitted, and each of these pieces falls into each pot; the food in both pots is forbidden, even if the prohibition is Talmudic. However, none of the two pots must contain a quantity of permitted foods capable of nullifying the forbidden food; but if one of the pots contains permitted foods having the necessary quantity to nullify the forbidden food, then the food in both pots is permitted.
One has two pots containing permitted foods, a forbidden food visibly falls into one of them; a second forbidden food then falls into one of them, but without knowing exactly which one: it is assumed that the second forbidden food fell into the same pot as the first, and the food in the other pot can be eaten. But when a forbidden food falls into one of the pots without knowing which one, and the same happens a second time, the food in both pots is then forbidden.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: For the prohibition to be observed, the permitted food must not represent a quantity sixty times greater than the forbidden food, but when this condition is met, one can act as if no forbidden food had fallen into one of the pots.</small>
One has two pots containing permitted foods and a forbidden food falls into one of them without knowing which one; moreover, the permitted foods in each pot do not reach the necessary quantity to nullify the forbidden food, but the necessary quantity can be reached by combining the foods of the two pots; one can then, to remove the prohibition, count the two quantities together, even if the two pots are not in the same room and there are a hundred instead of two, provided they belong to the same person, as in this case, the foods are susceptible of being combined; but if the two pots belong to two different people, this cannot be done.<br><small>G<small>LOSS</small>: Some authors maintain the prohibition even if the two pots belong to the same person; this opinion can be rejected when the loss would be significant. However, one cannot make someone eat these foods before the mixture of the two pots is an accomplished fact, as only then is the nullification effected.</small>
