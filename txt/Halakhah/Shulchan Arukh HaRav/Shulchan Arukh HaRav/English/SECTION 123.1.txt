SECTION 123 Laws Relating to Bowing at the Conclusion of Shemoneh Esreh. (1-8)1A person who [has completed] the recitation of Shemoneh Esreh should take three steps back,1 as one does when taking leave of a king, and should then bid farewell. If one did not do this, it is as if he had not recited She­moneh Esreh.... He should first bid farewell [by inclining his head] to his left, which is to the right of the Divine Presence3 that abides before him4 as he departs from [the place of his] prayer. He should then [incline his head] to his right, which is to the left of the Divine Presence. To explain: When he says Oseh shalom bimromav,5 he should incline his head to the left, and when he says Hu yaaseh shalom aleinu, he should incline his head to the right. He should not bid farewell [by inclining his head] while stepping [back], but only afterwards. [I.e.,] before stepping [back] he should bow, and take the three backward steps in the course of a single bow. Then, while he is still bowed over, before he straightens himself, he should bid farewell [as above] to his left and to his right.6 It has become a regular practice to conclude by [facing forward and] bowing7 before G‑d, like a servant taking leave of his master. Following this, it is customary to say,8 “May it be Your will... that the Beis HaMikdash be rebuilt....” Since [today] the recitation of She­moneh Esreh compensates for the sacrificial service,9 we ask [at this point] that the [Beis Ha-]Mikdash be rebuilt so that we will be able to actually perform that service.
