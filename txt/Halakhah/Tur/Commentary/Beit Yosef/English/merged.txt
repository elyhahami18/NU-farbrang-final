Introduction










I had the idea that after all the study I would decide the halacha and adjudicate between the various arguments. This is the purpose - for us to have a single Torah and standardized law. However, I realized that if I was to decide between the jurists using talmudical arguments and proofs - then Tosafot, Ramban, Rashba and Ran are full of such arguments and proofs in support of each position. Who is ready to come forward and add arguments and proofs? Who dares place his head between the mountains, mighty mountains, to decide between them using arguments and proofs to undo what they clarified or to decide what they left undecided. For on account of our many sins, our gray matter is too thin to understand their words and certainly not to place our wisdom above them. Even if we were able to trod such a path it would not be appropriate to do so as it is much too long.
Therefore I made up my mind that since there are three teachers upon whose teachings the House of Israel leans, behold they are the Rif, Rambam, and Rosh - I decided that where two of them agree on a law then we will decide the law like them - except for in a handful of places where all the Sages of Israel or most dispute their view and/or a contrary custom has spread.

One should be very careful with The blessings of Torah. As it is introduced in the last chapter of Masechet Nedarim (81A) - "Why are Torah scholars not meriting to have children who are Torah scholars? 
Ravina says: Because they do not recite the berachot of the Torah from the beginning. This refers to the beginning of their daily Torah study. Since Torah scholars are busy studying and accustomed to it, they are not careful to bless properly. Therefore, their blessing is not established. As it says, and we along with our children should be learning Torah. This is how it is explained.

The Ba'al HaManhig wrote, "If one who reads or chants Torah and makes a mistake it is better to not correct their mistake in public etc." Because even though they erred, they are still yotzei from [their obligation of] reading. For it comes in a midrash that if one reads "Aaron" as "Aron" they are yotzei. The Tosafot wrote in "Ein Mamidin" (Avodah Zara 22b) an explanation; that even though one did not pronounce the alef [his standard over me is love, SHS 2:4]. The Ri wrote, my friend, his memory be a blessing, this is what he wrote, "That if one who reads errs, we do not make him return to it." This is difficult for what was written above in the name of the Rosh, that the public is not yotzei in the reading of one who does not know. And it should be said that this is "b'deiavad" [i.e. after a reader made an error] and the Rosh’s words speak of "l'khatchilah" [i.e. when a reader doesn’t know how to read it correctly]. It should also be said that what the Ba'al HaManhig wrote is about an error that doesn’t include a change to the meaning, while the words of the Rosh refer to [an error] in te’amim which are the meaning of the pasuk itself.

And in any event, the money retains its holiness, which is to say that even though the village people are permitted to sell their synagogue, in any event the proceeds retain their holiness and the people are not permitted to reduce their holiness level, as I have explained.  And the reason is that we were considering  city residents who sold without knowledge of their Parnasim, but if the 7 Tovei HaIr agreed with the sale and it was in a Maamad of the people of the city, then they are permitted to use the money for anything they want to, as I will explain later.

As for [eating] meat after cheese, that is permitted immediately etc. (Talmud Chullin 105a). /    If it is day and one can see that his hands are clean, he does not need to clean them.  This is clear in the Chapter of "All Meat"/Kol HaBassar (Chullin 104b).  Rabbi Yitzchak (Ri) wrote that the same rule applies at night: If he has an effective lamp, he does not need to clean (his hands).  However, our master (the Tur) in Yoreh Deah chapter 89 wrote in the name of Rabbenu Peretz that "one must wash his hands even by day, since there are times that the cheese is greasy and clings to the moistness of the hands without one's being aware."  Hagahot Maimoniot wrote similarly in the name of Sefer Mitzvot Katan (SeMaK).   Rashba wrote in Torat HaBayit that the reason that it is permitted to eat meat after cheese immediately is because the cheese if soft and does not linger between the teeth.  Hagahot Maimoniot wrote similarly.  / Yet there are those who practice a personal stringency not to eat meat after cheese at one meal because it is written in the Book of the Zohar in the Portion of Mishpatim (Zohar 2:125a:9) as follows:  "We have found that [after] one consumes these foods [=milk and meat] together either at the same time [שעתא] or at the same meal, for forty days a kid roasted with its skin appears to those above.  An impure company come near him, causing judgments to be aroused in the world, judgments that are not holy.  If he begets a child during these days, it is lent a soul from the Other Side [=Sitra Achara], which is not holy." / The Mordechai has already written that Maharam [of Rothenburg] had a personal practice not to eat the meat of domesticated or wild animals after cheese, because once, between one meal and another, he found cheese between his teeth.  He decreed a stringency for himself.  This is not considered dissenting with the Talmud and is not in the category of 'adding which is subtracting,' for we find in the Chapter of Kol HaBasar "I am in this respect like vinegar derived from wine...(for while my father waited a day after eating meat before eating mik, I only wait from one meal to the next)."  Everyone may be strict with himself in order to effect a defense (against sin).  He was not lenient [the text should read: lenient] in regard to fowl (after cheese), since cheese and fowl may be eaten without restraint.  / It is certain that he [=Maharam], may his memory be a blessing, did not see the Zohar.  Nevertheless, he practiced a personal stringency on account of an event that happened.  Although he was lenient with fowl, that is because he had not seen the Zohar.  As for us, who have merited to see it, it is good and proper to be strict even with the meat of fowl.

Our rabbis taught in a baraita, “A person may not rent his vessels to a non-jew on the eve of the Sabbath,” etc. This is from the first chapter of Shabbat (19a). But Alfasi omitted it. Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Nissim wrote that he had done so because he had concluded that this baraita had its origins in a position of Beit Shamai. For they said that a person must allow their vessels to rest [on the Sabbath]. But as for us, we who follow the opinion of Beit Hillel that a person is not obliged to rest their vessels [on the Sabbath, we hold that] it is permitted even on the eve of the Sabbath. This is also the opinion of Maimonides. For he wrote in the 6 chapter that it is permitted to lend and rent out one's vessels to a non-Jew even though he will perform prohibited labor with them on the Sabbath, since we are not obliged to rest our vessels. However, the opinion of the authors of the Tosafot, Rabbenu Asher, Rabbenu Nissim, and Rabbenu Zachariah Ha-Levi was that [this baraita] had its origins in a position of both [Beit Shamai and Beit Hillel]. And the same was written by the authors of the Sefer Mitzvot Qatan, the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol, the Sefer Ha-Yashar, and the annotations of the Mordecai to the first chapter of tractate Shabbat. And they wrote--may their memories be for a blessing-- that the reason for the prohibition is that it appears as if a person is taking monetary recompense on the Sabbath. However on Wednesday or Thursday it is permitted, but only by the principle of subsumption. If, for example, they rented [the vessel] to them for a year, or for a month. Daily-term rental is prohibited even on a Wednesday or a Thursday. And this is in accordance with the teaching in a baraita at the end of Pereq Ha-Zahav (B. Bava Metzia  58a)  regarding one who hires a worker to watch his cow or his child. For even if the hire was made on the principle of subsumption, it is nonetheless prohibited on the eve of the Sabbath because of the appearance of the thing. Since it is so near and so proximate that it looks as if he is hiring them for the Sabbath itself. Therefore, even though a Jewish [renter] is permitted on the basis of the subsumption of a week’s time or a month’s, a gentile [renter] is prohibited.

One who extinguishes a lamp out of fear of the gentiles, etc. The Mishnah in chapter "With What do We Light? (Shabbat 29b)" reads: "One who extinguishes a lamp because he fears the gentiles, because of bandits, because of an evil spirit, or so that a sick person may sleep is exempt." The Gemara explains (31b) that the Mishnah is according to Rabbi Yehudah, who said that a melachah she'einah tzrichah legufah incurs a sin offering, and that the Mishnah refers to a sick person in mortal danger. Then, it would make sense for the Mishnah to say "allowed (instead of 'exempt')." Since the end of the Mishnah needed to teach "incurs a sin offering," the beginning of the Mishnah taught "exempt." But if the sick person is not in mortal danger, extinguishing a lamp for them incurs a sin offering. But according to Rabbi Shimon, doing this for a sick person in mortal danger is permitted, and a for a sick person not in mortal danger, one is exempt, as he holds that we are exempt from penalty when we perform a melachah she'einah tzrichah legufah. Our rabbis rule like Rabbi Shimon, and according to the Ramban, as the Ran wrote at the end of Tractate Shabbat, and he, of blessed memory, said so in chapter "One who Hides...." (chapter 10), that he holds like Rabbi Shimon. The Rambam wrote in Chapter 1 of Hilchot Shabbat (Mishneh Torah) that this is the opinion of the later rabbis, but the Rambam himself ruled like Rabbi Yehudah. In accordance with the Rif, the Ran wrote in the tenth chapter of Tractate Shabbat that he holds like Rabbi Shimon....and this is the opinion of Rashba, and even though from what he wrote in the third chapter, it seems that he holds like Rabbi Yehudah.

The Rav Ephraim wrote that they are forbidden even though they did not split. The same is written there by the Rosh. And the Ran wrote regarding soaking the opinion of the Ra'ah that the measure of splitting only applies to barley, but wheat since it has slits, that is a fissure in the wheat grains, it is considered as if they are split. And he (the Ran) wrote that he does not agree. And regarding the boat that sank, he (the Ra'ah) wrote that the reason they don't distinguish between split and unsplit is because it is wheat, and for wheat one does not need splitting. These are the words of the Ra'ah. But as I (the Ran) wrote above that some of the grains were split, and we are concerned that perhaps they will be sold to Jews, and they will not be informed. Or, perhaps the non-Jew will grind them, and then sell the flour to the Jews. Until here the words of the Ran. And the Ha'ga (?) wrote in Perek 5 in the name of the Re'em (?) that one one needs splitting by soaking, where there is less water, but with excessive resting, even if they are not split they are forbidden. And Rabenu Yerucham wrote in the name of the Sar Mekutsi (Count of Coucy) according to the words of the Ra'ah, and also the Ha'ga in Perek 5 in the name of the Rirsv"a. But the opinion of the Rif and the Rambam is that there is no difference between Wheat and barley, and this is how we rule.

And even if one has only enough for sufficient sustenance for two meals, one should sell them in order to purchase [sufficient] wine for four cups etc. At the beginning of the chapter Arvei Fesachim (Babylonian Talmud, Pesachim, Ch. 10, 99a), we are taught in the Mishnah: One should not have fewer than four cups of wine, and that is even if [one's finances are accumulated] via the communal donation-pot. And our Rabbi teaches, just as RaShBam taught in his commentary on "even if one's finances are accumulated via the communal donation-pot of charity," that this is the poorest among poor people--and if the charity-collectors have not given to that person, that person should sell their clothing or loan or rent out their very self for the sake of wine for the four cups. And the Mordokhai wrote in his commentary that this is regarding [only] one who has sustenance for two meals, and we [do] say: One who has [sufficient sustenance for] two meals should not collect from the communal donation-pot, and, if [that person additionally does] not [have sufficient finances] for four cups, one would not be required to collect from the communal donation-pot. And for the sake of [the] four cups, it said, the charity-collectors should give to that person charity, even from the communal donation-pot, and thus is the teaching in the Jerusalem Talmud.

An individual whose friend has not blown shofar may blow shofar for them etc. This is a baraita in the second chapter of Tractate Rosh HaShana (34b): "An individual whose friend has not blown shofar may blow for them and an individual who has not made a blessing, their friend may not make a blessing for them." And the RA"N wrote, "'Their friend may not make a blessing for them,' meaning that although we say that all of blessings, even though you have already made them, you can still make them for others, they already excluded from this rule, in Tractate Berachot, in the Jerusalem Talmud, the blessing after meals, and the  reading of Shema and the daily prayers. And the reason for the daily prayers is because it makes sense that everybody should ask for mercy for themselves. However, this refers to a person who knows how to make the blessing. But if they do not know how to make the blessing, their friend can make it for them. As it says in the chapter, "Three who ate together"(45a), "If one is a scholar and one is an ignoramous, the scholar makes the blessing and the ignoramous get's credit." And this is written in the Mordechai and in the Haghot Asheri at the end of the first chapter of Tractate Rosh HaShana. And this is not according to the position of the RI"Z Giat and Rav Shrira which our Master (the Tur) wrote.

And he says, "Kol Nidrei [All the vows], etc." And this was difficult for Rabbenu Tam — what does it help to annul that which is already past? So he established the practice of saying, "From this Yom Kippur until the coming Yom Kippur, etc." The [preceding] words of our rabbi [Ba'al HaTurim] here are terse and very unclear. As how can he say that it was difficult for Rabbenu Tam, what does it help to annul that which is already past? As behold nullification certainly helps with their past vows, as it is found in the third chapter of Shavuot (28a). And that which [actually] was difficult for Rabbenu Tam is explained in the words of Rosh [in] the first chapter of Yoma, and in Tosafot and Rosh [in] Chapter Four of Nedarim. It is because, regarding nullification, we need three ordinary men or one expert. Moreover, a sage may not annul a vow without regret [from the one who vowed]. Also, we have established that he needs to specify the vow; and also when the cantor says Kol Nidrei, who will annul his vows? For it is learned [in a mishnah] (Negaim 2:5), "All vows may be annulled by a person, except his own." But it is possible to interpret the words of our rabbi that this is what he is saying: It was difficult for Rabbenu Tam, since the content of Kol Nidrei is not annulment. Rather, it is only a type of stipulation. How is it possible to make a stipulation about their vows in the past, such that they should be annulled?

“What is Hanukkah? The Sages taught: On the twenty-fifth of Kislev… they searched and found only one cruse of oil that was placed with the seal of the High Priest…” (Shabbat 21a). One could ask – so what if it was sealed with the seal of the High Priest? We may be able to claim that even if it were touched from the outside it remains pure (because clay vessels only become impure from the inside not the outside), but nonetheless we must be concerned that it was tipped and thus became impure. The Tosafot addressed this difficulty by saying that if these events took place after the Sages had decreed all idolaters to have the impurity of a bodily issue, then we must say that it was placed in the ground and sealed in such a fashion that the vessel could not be tipped. The same seems true in the words of Rashi who wrote “with the seal, meaning that it was hidden away and sealed with his ring and thus recognizably untouched.” The Ran answered this problem by saying that if they had found it and tipped it, they would have broken it open to see if it held gold or jewels. Therefore, since it was found sealed with the seal of the High Priest it was certainly not found by the defilers. It is possible that this was Rashi’s intent as well when he wrote that it was ‘recognizably untouched.’: The reason that it was necessary to use that one jar of oil to light for eight days is that all of Israel were presumed to have the impurity of contact with the dead and it was therefore impossible to prepare pure oil until seven days had passed from they day of their defilement. Add to this one more day for crushing and preparing the olives to produce pure oil and you have eight. The Ran writes that there was pure oil four days away, and that they therefore needed eight days to go there and back. One could ask why they established an eight day celebration at all. After all, since there was enough oil in the sealed jar to light for one night then the miracle actually was for seven nights. One could answer that they divided the oil they found into eight parts and placed one portion in the menorah each night, which nonetheless burned until morning. Thus a miracle occurred every night. Further you could say that after they filled the menorah on the first night the jar remained full of oil as it was in the beginning, and thus the miracle was recognizable even on the first night. Alternatively, they poured all the oil into the menorah on the first night and though the candles burned all night they found them still full of oil in the morning, and so it happened each night.

As to the Tur's mention of lighting a Channukah candle in the synagogue, it seems to me that this was instituted for guests who did not have their own home to light a candle in, just as Kiddush was instituted in the synagogues for those guests who ate and drank in the synagogue. This is the reason given by the Kolbo, who also brought another reason: in order to publicise the miracle before the entire people, and to recite the blessings together. This is an enormous public declaration for the Holy One, and a sanctification of God's name, to be blessed in large groups. The Rivash added: the custom to light candles in the synagogue is ancient, because of publicising the miracle, and because we were not able to light individually at home as a result of the oppression of the gentiles. We bless over this just as we recite the blessing over Hallel on Rosh Chodesh, even though it is only a <i>minhag</i>. However, this lighting in the synagogue isn't a fulfilment of the mitzvah, and each person should go and light at home.

<b>Milk from a non-kosher or <i>terefah</i> animal, and its whey,</b> etc., <b>are forbidden.</b> This is explicit in the first chapter of <i>Bechorot</i> (7a) that milk from a non-kosher animal and its whey are prohibited. The prohibition of milk from a <i>terefah</i> animal is clear in the 25th chapter (116b) and in the chapter "Behemah HaMakshah" (<i>Chullin</i> 69a). Similarly, the Rif and the Rosh wrote this in the chapter "Elu Treifot."<br><br>The Rambam wrote in the third chapter of <i>Ma'achalot Assurot</i> that although milk from a non-kosher animal is forbidden by Torah law, one does not receive lashes for it, as it is stated, "You shall not eat of their flesh"—it is the flesh for which one is liable to lashes, but not the milk.

<b>And regarding the statement that "the urine of the legs [of animals] is forbidden," there is a distinction concerning a donkey, etc.:</b><br><br>In the first chapter of <i>Bechorot</i> (7a), they asked Rav Sheshet about the urine of a donkey: is it permitted or forbidden? They also asked about horses and camels since these animals are not discussed. The question was whether the urine of a donkey, which is dark and resembles milk, is like the milk that exits from it or not.<br><br>Rav Sheshet answered that the Tannaitic teaching is: <i>"That which comes from a non-kosher animal is forbidden."</i> This applies specifically to non-kosher animals, and the urine of a donkey, which is also considered non-kosher, is thus forbidden.<br><br>Rashi explains that it is forbidden because it comes from a non-kosher animal. Others say that the question was only about the urine of a donkey since people do drink it, and thus it was asked about it specifically. Rav Sheshet’s response that <i>"that which comes from a non-kosher animal is forbidden"</i> implies that all such liquids from non-kosher animals are forbidden, including those of a donkey.<br><br>The Rosh writes that the halacha follows the latter opinion, which is stricter for Torah laws. However, the Rambam in the fourth chapter of <i>Ma'achalot Assurot</i> states that the skin of a donkey’s face is permitted because it is like a membrane, and thus the urine of a donkey is also permitted. This is surprising, as even if one follows the stricter view, it would only apply to the urine of horses and camels. But how can one permit the urine of a donkey even according to the lenient opinion?<br><br>The Mordechai in <i>Shmona Sharatzim</i> and the responses of the Rashba (siman 817) state that according to <i>B"H</i> (Beit Hillel), the urine of a person or a non-kosher animal is permitted.

<b>Cheeses made from the milk of animals that are found to be treif, etc., as discussed in the first chapter of Chullin (11b). Regarding the statement, “From where do we know this matter? The Rabbis say, go according to the majority and bring it from a red heifer which must be burned while still whole,” and there is concern that it might be treif. This is not because we say, “go according to the majority.” The Tosafot wrote, “And if you say, since a cow is two years old, perhaps this is because it is established as not being treif according to the opinion that a treif animal is not alive,” and it can be said that any presumption that has not been clarified or known, even for a single moment, we do not follow.</b><br>From this, one can learn a practical halacha: if cheeses were made from the milk of several animals, and afterwards one was slaughtered and found to be treif, all are prohibited. We cannot rely on the assumption that the cow was not treif and say that it is only now that it is treif. The Rosh wrote their opinion and then wrote, “It can be said that according to what we conclude, that we follow the majority, all animals are assumed to be kosher, even within a year, because most animals are kosher and the majority is stronger than a presumption.”<br>Rabbeinu (Rashba) followed this explanation, and so did Rabbeinu Yerucham in section 31. The Rashba and the Ran, after writing the Tosafot’s reasoning, wrote in the name of Rabbi Shimshon that one should not prohibit the cheeses based on this reason. Even if it is said that we do not follow such a presumption, here it is different because it is a presumption that comes from the majority, and most animals are kosher. Therefore, we say that it is only now that it has become treif, as explained in the matter of presumptions in the first chapter of Ketubot (12b) regarding a man who married a woman and did not find her to be a virgin, and in the chapter “Ha-modir” (Ketubot 76a) regarding blemishes. Even R’ Yonah agreed to permit them, as it is said that if slaughtered, it remains in a state of permissibility until it is known what made it treif. This shows that an animal in its lifetime is presumed not to be treif; therefore, if we find it to be treif now, we say it has only recently become so. In the glosses of Maimonides on the third chapter of Ma'akhalot Asurot, he brought these reasons in the name of the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (SMG) but did not decide between them. However, the Sefer Mitzvot Katan (SMK) in section 71 ruled according to Rabbi Shimshon’s opinion and Rabbi Yonah’s opinion.

Seif Katan 4

<b>And what our Rabbi wrote: "But if it is known that before milking it was already treif, such as having a member that was treif or having a wound with a blister, etc." — so wrote the Rashba and the Ran based on the words of Rabbi Yonah who agreed with Rabbi Shimshon's view, that if we now find it to be treif, we say that it is only now that it has become treif. However, this applies to cases where it is possible to say that it only recently became treif near the time of slaughter. But for cases of clear treifot or other types of treifot where it is impossible to attribute it to the time of slaughter, it is definitely prohibited because once it has lost its status of being kosher, we cannot determine how much time it had before becoming treif. This is similar to what is said (Nidda 56b) about stains that if they are found on a garment, it defiles retroactively until you can say that you examined the garment and did not find a stain, or until the time of laundering.</b><br><b>Rabbeinu (the Rosh) who wrote that all cheeses are prohibited implies that he prohibits even cheeses made before three days, according to the view of Rabbi Yonah, the Rashba, and the Ran, who say that since it left its life with a presumed status of being kosher and you do not know how long it has been so, we are stringent. This is contrary to the opinion of the Sefer Mitzvot Katan (SMK) in Siman 1 that even if a wound was discovered, cheeses made before three days are permitted.</b><br><b>The reason we differentiate between a wound that was discovered and one that was not discovered is based on the Talmudic teaching in the first chapter of Chullin (51b) and in the first chapter of Ketubot (76b) regarding a needle found in the thickness of a cup, which if the wound was discovered, it is known to be at least three days prior to slaughter. It seems from the words of the Ran that he agrees with this view of Rabbi Yonah, but in the first chapter of Chullin regarding a case where there is a doubt about treifot, it seems from his words that he holds according to the Tosafot’s opinion, that any presumption that was not clear at the time is not a valid presumption, and therefore, according to him, all cheeses are prohibited.</b><br><b>From the Rashba’s Talmudic commentary, it appears that he leans towards the view of Rabbi Yonah, but in the short Talmudic commentary, there is no clear decision. He wrote: "In the case where cheese was made from a known animal and then the animal was slaughtered and found to be treif, such as if a needle is found in the thickness of a cup or in one of the places that make it treif, if the wound was discovered, it is known that it was at least three days before slaughter. Therefore, all cheeses and milk that were milked within three days before slaughter are definitely prohibited. But if the wound was not discovered, it is a doubt. Similarly, if the wound was discovered and cheeses were made from its milk before three days, there are some great scholars who prohibited it. Although it is a Torah-level presumption, it can be said that we maintain the animal on its presumed status, which is only a presumption and not a clear status like the case of a virgin woman at the time of birth. But an animal's kosher status is not known unless twelve months pass, after which it is known that it was not treif when it was born. Thus, any presumption that does not have a clear time is not relied upon. Some permit it and give reasons for their view, according to which since most animals are kosher, we follow the majority, and the current status is that it is treif. Since it was slaughtered with a presumed status of being permitted until we know what caused it to become treif. Nevertheless, in cases of clear treifot where it is impossible to say that it has recently become treif, it is prohibited. Since you really know that it was not treif at the time, this means it has already left its life with a presumed status of being kosher, and how much it had already left is unknown. In the case of Torah-level doubts, we are stringent. This is also supported by what some Geonim wrote that if an animal is found to be treif, the cheeses made from its milk are prohibited retroactively."</b><br><b>And you should know that in the long Talmudic commentary, he wrote in this manner. Regarding cheese that was made from a known animal and then the animal was slaughtered, and even if he made cheese from several animals and one was found to be treif, the milk of that animal is not nullified among the others. If it is known that it was treif on the day its milk was used, all are prohibited. Therefore, if within three days from which the cheese was made, the animal was slaughtered and found to have a discovered wound that was known to be three days before slaughter, it is as stated. And he wrote in his responsa, Siman 118, that he was surprised why the milk of the treif animal was not nullified in sixty. He replied that he is not mistaken, but that it is something that even children know. His intention was that if the cheese is significant and like something that is not nullified, we should be stringent about it, as if it were definitely treif. Therefore, within three days, it is certainly treif and the intention was not to prohibit all mixtures but to treat it as if it was definitely treif. The proof is that he wrote that the milk of that animal is not nullified (if it were to nullify all mixtures, he would have said so), and his intention was to state that the cheese is not nullified. What I wrote that the milk is not nullified is a mistake; it should have been written that the cheese from that treif animal is not nullified. This is to avoid confusion and clarify that the cheese from that treif animal is not nullified."</b><br><b>In the short Talmudic commentary, he wrote that if many animals are involved and one of them is found to be treif, we follow the measure of sixty like other prohibitions.</b>

Seif Katan 5

<b>And what our Rabbi wrote:</b><br><i>“And if it is in a herd with other animals and its milk got mixed with others, all the cheeses are prohibited”</i> — as it is written afterward.<br><b>And the Rashba wrote</b> that we follow the measure of sixty, etc. This implies that according to the first opinion, even more than sixty is also prohibited.<br>I do not understand <b>why there is a stricter concern with this milk compared to other prohibitions.</b> It is possible that the initial statement was not a separate opinion but rather the beginning of the discussion to say that this milk prohibits its mixture, and he intended to conclude that it only prohibits up to sixty.<br><b>However, since the Rashba wrote this explicitly, it was included in his name.</b> Even though, according to this, it would be proper to write <i>“And the Rashba wrote,”</i> and not just <i>“the Rashba wrote,”</i> which implies disagreement, <b>our Rabbi is not particular about this detail</b>, as he often writes <i>“the Rashba”</i> even if he does not disagree.

Seif Katan 6

<b>And if it became treif due to a sore,</b><br>the Rashba wrote that since it is impossible to say that it became treif right now, [the cheese] is prohibited.<br>And if it is known that it did not become treif right now, etc., the words of Rabbeinu (the Rosh) are not well explained and leave room for misunderstanding.<br>For the case of becoming treif due to a sore, the Rashba wrote this explicitly, and not for other types of treifot. He had previously written the law for other treifot but did not provide this reason for them. This reason applies to all types of treifot where it cannot be attributed to the time of slaughter.<br>As I have already cited his words and the words of the Ran, which apply to all types of treifot where it cannot be attributed to the time of slaughter.<br>The Rosh, however, seems to consider that since the law of other treifot where it cannot be attributed to the time of slaughter implies that there is no disagreement on this, he wrote it generally.<br>For the case of becoming treif due to a sore, which has a disagreement, he wrote in the name of the Rashba that it is prohibited and provided the reason.<br>In truth, it was not necessary to write this reason separately. Just as he relied on the reason for other treifot where it cannot be attributed to the time of slaughter as being evident from the rationale, so too he should have relied on this for the case of becoming treif due to a sore.<br>If he wanted to write the reason at least, he should have written it earlier regarding other treifot where it cannot be attributed to the time of slaughter, and from there we would learn the reasoning for the case of becoming treif due to a sore according to those who prohibit it, as it is a single rationale.

Seif Katan 7

<b>And the Aharonim wrote to permit [cheese] from animals that became treif due to a sore, etc., in the first chapter of Chullin,</b><br>and the Tosafot also wrote this there, even though they are stringent regarding all other types of treifot as I have written above.<br>The Mordechai also wrote this in chapter 19.<br>It is puzzling why the Rashba and the Ran prohibited [cheese from animals with a sore] since it is a doubt. They should have ruled leniently.<br>It is possible that the Rashba and the Ran mentioned the case of a sore specifically because it is a type of treifot that cannot be attributed to the time of slaughter and they did not intend to argue about it.<br>It seems to them that there is only a single doubt in this case. But if there were two doubts, there is no doubt they would agree that we rely on the lenient view.<br>Moreover, it seems that since for milk that was milked three or four days before slaughter there is only a single doubt — namely, whether it was treif at the time of milking, since it cannot be said that it became treif after these days — surely a sore more than three or four days old could develop.<br>And since it has left its life with a presumed status of being kosher, and we do not know how long it has been so, it remains in a state of presumed prohibition until it is known that it was not treif at the time of milking.

<b>The term 'Yali d’ikhmorita'</b> is permitted in the first chapter of <b>Bekhorot (7)</b>.

<b>The hide that comes from the face of a donkey is permitted, as it is a mere 'perisha' (excrement),</b> and the reason is explained because it is considered merely a form of excrement.<br>The <b>HaMa'ari</b> (He'emat HaMelech) in the fourth chapter of Maimonides' <b>Mishneh Torah</b>, writes that he is surprised by the Ramban, who rules in the laws of firstborns according to <b>Rav Sheshet</b>, that the excrement of the feet (<i>מי רגלים</i>) is prohibited, while the hide from the face of a donkey is permitted because it is considered a mere excrement and not food at all. This is unlike the case of the excrement of the feet.<br>It seems to me that the Ramban's words are consistent, for when he says <i>'unlike the excrement of the feet,'</i> it clearly indicates that he holds the excrement of the feet is not a complete form of excrement.<br>For we see that people drink the excrement of a donkey’s feet and consider it a medicinal remedy. Although the excrement of other animals and creatures is not used in this way, this is because they are not known to be beneficial.<br>However, since we find that donkey’s feet excrement is not a complete form of excrement, we learn that this is true for all types of excrement, according to the latter opinion of Rav Sheshet. But the hide from the face of a donkey is a complete form of excrement, and therefore it is permitted.

<b>"Milk from pure animals and their excrement is permitted,</b>and it does not have the prohibition of <b>'ever min ha-chai'</b> (a limb taken from a living animal), as stated in the first chapter of <b>Bekhorot (6)</b>. It is derived from the verse, <i>'And the ten holes of milk'</i> (Leviticus 7:35), and the verse, <i>'A land flowing with milk and honey'</i> (Exodus 3:8). If not permitted, the verse would be praising something that is not fit for consumption. The verse, <i>'Go, break the bread and eat it'</i> (Isaiah 55:1), and <i>'Go, break without money and without price wine and milk'</i> (Isaiah 55:1), also indicates that milk is permitted.<br>Our Rabbi learned from this that <b>excrement</b> is permitted and does not have the prohibition of <b>'ever min ha-chai.'</b> Certainly, this is the case because it is not more stringent than milk.<br>However, according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b>, who prohibited milk from a live animal nearby, it seems that the same would apply to excrement from a live animal, as it is considered to come from a living being.<br>It is puzzling, though, what Rabbi Eliezer requires from <b>Rav Sheshet</b> regarding excrement from a donkey. He should deduce that even if it is pure, it is still prohibited because it comes from a living animal.<br>Perhaps it can be explained that Rabbi Eliezer agrees that excrement is not prohibited because it is considered merely a form of excrement, unlike milk.<br>In the chapter <b>‘Behema ha-mekushesh’</b> (Chullin 69), the question is asked about drinking milk from a fetus that was removed from its mother’s womb before the mother was slaughtered, and then the mother was slaughtered. Is that milk forbidden because it is considered a limb taken from a living animal, or is it permitted because it is just regular milk?<br>It is not clear whether the prohibition is due to the fact that it was extracted from a living being and then the mother was slaughtered, or if there is no prohibition due to slaughter. The resolution was left in doubt, and the halachic authorities ruled stringently since it is a doubt concerning a Torah prohibition. <b>Rabbi</b> wrote about this in <b>Siman 14.</b>"

Seif Katan 11

<b>"Rabbi Eliezer wrote that only milk permitted by the Torah is permitted,</b>but milk of excrement is forbidden. <b>Rabbi Simcha</b> permits it, and this is how we practice.<br>The words of our Rabbi are unclear as he did not explain why <i>'milk of excrement'</i> is called so — whether it refers to the liquid left after cooking or to water that remains after the food has been removed from the cooked liquid.<br>Since it is written, <i>'This is how we practice,'</i> it seems that he is referring to the liquid left after cooking. For in other cases, we have not seen anyone who drinks it at all because it is not considered significant.<br>In truth, Rabbi Eliezer did not forbid the liquid left after cooking, but rather other types of water, as it is stated in the Talmud (Kiddushin 25) that cooking with milk does present a prohibition, as it is used in making a condiment (<i>kotach</i>) from milk excrement.<br>I say that the liquid from milk is forbidden by Torah law, while the milk that is left over from making cheese is considered merely water. <b>The Rambam</b> was stringent about consuming it, as in the first chapter of <b>Bekhorot</b>, where a verse is required to permit milk because anything that comes from a living animal is forbidden. Here, it is stated that the liquid from milk is not considered milk, and there is no verse to permit it since it comes from a living animal and is therefore forbidden.<br><b>Rabbi Simcha</b> responded that in terms of eating meat and milk, it is not considered like milk, as the verse refers to the milk from the mother as it comes from the mother mixed with the food. However, for other matters, it is considered like milk, as it is stated in the <b>Mishnah (Mikvaot 6)</b> that the liquid from milk is considered like milk, and <i>R'la (Rabbi Levi)</i> says that it is only to permit seeds, but in terms of cooking, the liquid from milk is not like milk."

<b>"A <b>treifah</b> (a non-kosher animal) that nursed from a kosher animal, the milk found in its stomach is permitted, etc.</b><br>In chapter <b>25 of Bekhorot (62b)</b>, it is taught that if a kosher animal nursed from a <b>treifah</b>, its stomach is forbidden. However, if a treifah nursed from a kosher animal, its stomach is permitted because it is absorbed into its digestive tract. In the Gemara there, it is concluded that a kosher animal that nursed from a treifah should be treated as if the milk is absorbed in its stomach. Certainly, if a treifah nursed from a kosher animal, it is permissible because the milk collected in it is only considered a superficial layer.<br>The <b>Rashba</b> wrote about this that this is the interpretation of the <b>Rif</b>, and he explained in this context that the case of a stomach cooked in its milk is forbidden before it has been returned and repeated. However, it seems from his wording that a kosher animal that nursed from a treifah and a treifah that nursed from a kosher animal are treated together, and the reason given for both is that it is absorbed in its digestive tract.<br><b>Rashi</b> did not include this in his text, and the wording does not strongly support the Rif’s interpretation. Later editions of the books have corrected this. <b>R’T (Rabbi Tam)</b> said that according to this interpretation, there is a distinction: the term <i>‘superficial layer’</i> refers to milk that has congealed in the stomach, and the Mishnah’s case of a kosher animal nursing from a treifah refers to clear milk found in the stomach, which is considered complete milk.<br>The difficulty in the Rif’s interpretation is that the Gemara asks on the Mishnah's statement that the stomachs of non-Jewish and dead animals are forbidden. But the Mishnah says that if a treifah nursed from a kosher animal, its stomach is permitted. The Gemara answers that this is not a contradiction: the Mishnah’s first part refers to before it was returned (repeated), while the second part refers to after it was returned.<br>The <b>Rashba</b> and the <b>Rosh</b> were also puzzled by the Rif’s text and wrote that R’T’s answer to distinguish between clear and congealed milk is correct. The reason is that clear milk that comes from a treifah is still clear and not considered a superficial layer. But once it has congealed, it is considered superficial. This is supported by the <b>Tosafot</b>. However, the Rif’s opinion was that according to the last Mishnah, the stomach cooked in its milk is permitted, indicating that even clear milk is allowed.<br><b>The Rambam's view</b> aligns with the Rif's, stating in the fourth chapter of the laws of <b>Ma'achilot Asurot</b> that the stomach of a non-Jewish or a non-kosher animal is permitted because it is similar to other waste in the body. Therefore, it is permitted to use the stomach of an animal slaughtered by a non-Jew and the stomach of a non-kosher animal, but the skin of the stomach is like other intestines and is forbidden.<br><b>The Kesef Mishnah</b> wrote that according to the Rambam and the <b>Geonim</b>, even clear milk is considered a superficial layer. This is consistent with the Rambam’s words in the ninth chapter.<br>Regarding the law, since both the Rif and the Rambam agree to permit even clear milk, we follow their view, and this is the practice."

<b>"Human milk is permitted</b> in the context where it is expressed from a woman who has milked it, etc., until it becomes like milk from a rodent.<br>In the first chapter of <b>Ketubot (62b)</b>, it is taught: A baby who nurses from a woman up to <b>24 months</b>, and from then on, is like nursing from a rodent according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> says that even after 4 or 5 years, if he has weaned after 24 months and then returns to nursing, it is like nursing from a rodent. The <b>Gemara</b> questions this, asking if the milk from a creature that walks on two legs is considered impure. It is taught that the verse specifies <i>"he"</i> (the creature) to exclude such milk.<br><b>Rav Sheshet</b> said that even when the milk is expressed, there is no issue; that is, the Rabbis did not enact a prohibition. The difference is: when it has been expressed and when it has not been. <b>Rashi</b> explains that the term <i>"permitted when expressed"</i> refers to milk that has been expressed into a vessel from the woman’s breast, and nursing from the breast is considered as nursing from a pest according to Rabbinic law.<br><b>The Rosh</b> adds that the reason is that if the milk has not been expressed, there is a concern that it might be mixed with the milk of a non-kosher animal since it is not common to eat human flesh. Thus, it might be confused with milk from a non-kosher animal. However, if it has been expressed, it is permitted.<br>It seems that Rashi's mention of <i>"expressed into a vessel"</i> is not limited to this scenario alone; it also includes cases where the milk is expressed directly into the mouth. This implies that if it is expressed from the breast or into the mouth, it is considered as not having been expressed properly.<br>What our Rabbi wrote about an older child who nurses from his mother being subject to corporal punishment, the <b>Rambam</b> also wrote in the third chapter of the laws of <b>Ma'achilot Asurot</b>. It is clear that this is the case for those who violate the words of the Sages."

<b>"What is mentioned that [a child is considered] healthy up to four years and sick up to five years —</b><br>this is the interpretation given by the <b>Tosafot</b> in the chapter <i>Be’Me’ah She’ah</i> (Shabbat 62b) regarding a <b>nailed sandal.</b>"

<b>"And what he wrote, 'But if he has weaned, etc.' —</b><br><br>In the chapter <i>Even HaEzer</i> (in <i>Ketubot</i> 60a), it is explained that after 24 months, if the child returns to breastfeeding, it is as if he is consuming something detestable. <b>And how long [after weaning] is it considered detestable?</b> Shmuel said, <i>three days.</i> The <b>Rosh</b> wrote that the <b>Yerushalmi</b> [states]: Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <i>three days is the limit.</i><br><br><b>When is this said?</b> When the child was weaned while healthy. But if he was weaned due to illness, he can return to breastfeeding unless it is a matter of danger, in which case even after several days, he can return to breastfeeding. The <b>Rif</b> also cited this Yerushalmi but did not conclude with a distinction between a case of danger and one without danger. The <b>Rambam</b> in Chapter 3 of <i>Hilchot Ma’achalot Asurot</i> did similarly. It seems that the reason is because it is obvious that in a case of danger, the child can return to breastfeeding, as there is nothing that stands in the way of preserving life.<br><br><b>Note</b> that the <b>Rambam</b> wrote in the aforementioned chapter as follows: <i>A child can nurse for even four or five years. But if he was weaned for three days or more due to his health, and not because of illness, he should not return to breastfeeding, provided that he was weaned after 24 months. But if he was weaned within this period, even if it was for a month or two, he is permitted to return to breastfeeding until the end of 24 months.</i><br><br>From his precise language, it seems that when it is said that a child can nurse for four or five years, this only applies if he was never weaned at all. However, if he was weaned within 24 months, although he may return to nursing, he is only permitted to nurse until the end of 24 months. <b>This reasoning is logical, but I do not know from where the Rambam derived this."</b>

<b>"And it is written in the Book of Mitzvot:</b><br>Although the bodies of the insects are mixed in, etc. Thus wrote the <b>Mordechai</b> in the chapter <i>Beitza</i> (1:4) in the name of the <b>Ra’ah</b>, and he concluded there with the <b>Semag</b> and added that the bodies [of the insects] are like a decayed carcass from the outset, which is permitted even according to the opinion that <i>no'atin ta’am le-fgam</i> (the taste that is unappealing) is forbidden.<br><br>This was also written by the <b>Ge’ot Maimon</b> in the third chapter in his name, and the <b>Tosafot</b> wrote in the last chapter of <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (61b): It is astonishing how we eat honey when the legs of insects are mixed in the honey.

<b>"Honey from bees and from locusts:</b><br><b>Rashi</b> writes that it is permitted, etc. In the first chapter of <i>Bechorot</i> (7b), it is asked regarding the droppings of a donkey whether they are permitted, and it was answered that they are forbidden.<br><br>The Gemara then asks: Why did they say that honey from bees is permitted? Because it is taken into their bodies and is not extracted from their bodies. It answers that this is because <b>Rabbi Yaakov</b> says that honey is permitted because the Torah permits it explicitly. As it is taught, Rabbi Yaakov says, <i>‘You shall not eat any creeping thing, which is a creeping thing, but you may eat what a creeping thing produces,’</i> and what is that? Honey from bees. You might say that honey from locusts and grasshoppers should be excluded, as it has a separate status. This is because the verse does not mention honey explicitly but only by inference. However, honey from locusts and grasshoppers is considered in this category.<br><br>And <b>Rashi</b> explains that Rabbi Yaakov’s reason is not because honey is taken into their bodies but because the Torah explicitly permits it. What is produced by a non-kosher creeping thing, such as honey, is excluded by analogy. Honey from bees is commonly called honey, and it appears in the Gemara that a beehive is only for bees, as Rashi also wrote there.<br><br>It is puzzling why <b>Rabbi Yaakov</b> excludes honey from locusts and grasshoppers when the verse does not specifically mention honey but only by analogy. <b>Rabbi Asher</b> and <b>Rabbi Channanel</b> ruled that it is not according to Rabbi Yaakov since the general ruling in <i>Mishna</i> is not in accordance with him.<br><br>However, it is surprising that Rabbi Asher ruled according to the <i>Mishna</i> since <b>Rav Sheshet</b> did not agree with him, as Rav Sheshet follows Rabbi Yaakov. It could be that Rabbi Asher only mentioned that Rabbi Yaakov’s opinion is in the later interpretation, but in the earlier interpretation, he only forbids honey from a donkey but permits honey from horses, which is not similar to honey from bees that is extracted from the body. However, honey from bees is not extracted from the body, and the same applies to honey from locusts and grasshoppers.<br><br>Nevertheless, according to the <b>Rosh’s</b> usual practice, we follow the stricter opinion, and the ruling is that honey from locusts and grasshoppers is forbidden. However, the <b>Rambam</b> in the third chapter rules that honey from locusts is permitted according to the general <i>Mishna</i>, even though he does not mention locusts specifically. Since the general ruling is that there is no distinction between locusts and grasshoppers, and since one is permitted, it follows that the other is also permitted. The Rambam follows this opinion and has explained the reasons for his rulings extensively.<br><br>The <b>Ramban</b>, on the other hand, ruled to be stringent and forbade honey from locusts, and it is stated that some follow this opinion. However, honey from locusts and grasshoppers is not commonly found, and for mixtures, there is no concern according to all opinions, as noted by the <b>Maharil</b>."

"And so too if it stood in it for one day, for pickling is like cooking." This is explained in 105:4. And it seems from our rabbi's words that, according to Rif and Rambam, even a stomach salted with its milk or it stood for many days would be permitted to make cheese out of, since it is not milk but excrement, and we have no difference between congealed or clear. And for Rabbenu Tam also regarding congealed. This also is implied from the response of Rabbenu Shimshon that the Mordekhai brought: "The taste that comes out of the meat becomes excrement when it is absorbed in the stomach, and the reason is because there is not enough power in the taste that receives this excrement from the skin to join afterwards with full milk, which from it comes cheese, such that the taste of meat is carried with it and it becomes afterwards meat and milk. For behold the fish that receive the flavour of meat are allowed to combine them afterwards with milk—all the more so this which is excrement and a small amount. For there is no strength to receive the flavour of meat and to transfer this flavour with it to join it with the milk of the cheese that comes out of it to become then meat and milk. For this is less effective than secondary flavour transfer (נ״ט בר נ״ט wrt the fish) because it is only excrement. But Rabbenu Yeruham wrote: There is someone who wrote that, even according to the opinion of the Geonim, if the keivah is salted in the stomach that it is forbidden to make this into cheese, for even though it is merely excrement, regardless it already took the taste of meat, and when it is made into cheese it will be meat and milk, and this seems correct." This also what the Mordekhai wrote in the name of Avi Ha-Ezri and the Sefer Ha-Terumah. He [Mordekhai] also wrote: "There is someone who wrote that, if the milk stood for many days in the stomach to dry—if it dried it is forbidden, for this is like pickling which is like salting (all the more so if they made cheese with smoke to dry it out for this is like the keivah that is salted in its skin). But this is not because of meat and milk, since we already said that meat and milk, even if it waited all day it is fine, but rather for the reason that it is the keuvah of nevelah or treifah, or because of what I wrote that even though the keivah is just excrement, regardless it takes flavour of the skin and it becomes meat and milk." But for the purposes of halakhah, even according to us who hold by the Rif and the Rambam, there are those who are strict to not make cheese with the milk of the stomach that was salted in its stomach, or that stood in it for a day. However, if it was already curdled, bedi'avad it is enough to rely on the lenient opinions. It is written in the Shibbolei Ha-Leket: "The stomach lining that they salt and dry and fill it with milk—it is permitted, since when the skin is dried it becomes nothing more than wood and there is no moisture of meat." We teach at the end of PKhB: "One who makes cheese with the skin of the stomach, if there is enough to impart flavour—it is forbidden." And the Rashba wrote: "This is surprising to me since it teaches something obvious, for meat and milk always has the law of if it imparts flavour it is forbidden! Perhaps it is teaching us that it is only if it imparts flavour that it is forbidden and because of meat and milk. But if it did not impart flavour it would be permitted, even though it is curdling—the Torah hooks meat and milk upon flavour, as Rava says above, 'The way of cooking the Torah forbids.' But this is not true for curdling in the skin of nevelah, for we go after the curdling even if there is no imparted flavour, we see it as if the nevelah were in in front of us." So too wrote the Ran there and in chapter 2 of Avodah Zarah in the name of R. Yosef Ha-Levi on what Shmuel said: "Why did they forbid non-Jewish cheese? Because they curdle it with nevelah stomach skin": "The reason he mentioned "nevelah stomach skin" is because it itself would be forbidden—since it is the source of curdling, it would not be nullified. But kosher stomach skin, which is permitted by itself and there is nothing forbidden unless combined with milk, it is not possible to say this, therefore whenever it does not impart flavour it is not meat and milk, rather this stands on its own and this stands on its own." And so are the words of the Rambam that wrote in Hilkhot Ma'akhlot Asurot 3:13: "In the days of the mishnaic sages, they decreed against non-Jewish cheese and forbade it because they curdle it with the stomach skin of their slaughtered animals, i.e. nevelah. And if you say: But isn't the skin of the stomach a small thing against the large amount of milk it stands with? Why wouldn't it be nullified? Because it curdles the cheese, and since it is a forbidden item that did the curdling the whole thing is forbidden." And in 9:15 he wrote: "It is forbidden to curdle cheese with the skin of the stomach of a slaughtered animal. But if one did so—they taste the cheese; if there is the flavour of meat it is forbidden, but if not it is permitted, since the curdling was something which was forbidden—the stomach of a slaughtered animal—and there is nothing forbidden other than meat and milk which is measured with imparting flavour. However, one who curdles with the skin of a nevelah stomach or terefah or non-kosher animal, since the curdling was a thing that was forbidden by itself, the cheese becomes forbidden because of nevelah, and not because of meat and milk. And it was because of this concern that they forbade the cheese of non-Jews, as I explained." From these words, what Rabbenu Yeruham wrote is clarified: "The law of the keivah and its skin to curdle with it cheese, the skin of the stomach is obviously forbidden whether from a kosher animal or nevelah according to everyone because it is meat and milk. And if one curdled it, a non-Jew should taste it. But there is someone who wrote that curdling cheese is not nullified, and this seems right. And so too wrote the Rambam: 'Therefore, they forbade non-Jewish cheese because they curdle it with the skin of the stomach'. It appears from his words that for the Rambam, curdling with kosher skin would also not be nullified." But this is not true, since the Rambam did not write this but rather curdling with the stomach skin of a *forbidden* animal, while curdling with the stomach skin of a *kosher* animal is with imparting flavour, as our mishnah taught. The Mordekhai wrote: "Even though Rabbenu Tam wrote that curdling only forbids in 60:1 ratio, he did not say this for practical purposes, for it is possible to dismiss his evidence, that even when there is in the milk more than 60:1 against the forbidden item, since the forbidden item curdles—it imparts flavour." The Mordekhai wrote: "About the keivah that they curdled with much milk and made cheese with it, but it was found after a while in the bag that the keivah was given a bit [of flavour] from the intestines, and Rabbenu Shimshon permitted the cheeses, and went on at length regarding the reasons. But Rabbenu Barukh permitted for a different reason, that one assumes it did not curdle all of the milk from the clear milk but rather also from the congealed, and then it is two things that combine to be permitted." The Mordekhai also wrote in the name of Rabbenu Shimshon:  Who knows if the cheeses are [not] considered to be like the piece of meat that is appropriate to give honour with, and if it is known that one of them was made from the forbidden keivah it would forbid all the others?" It is written in the Hagahat Ashiri in the last chapter of Avodah Zarah: "It is possible to be doubtful about the meat and milk that the sages forbade (such as that waited cold more than one day, or was salted) if they are forbidden to benefit or not. And the one who permits benefit—they do not prevent them too much, for there is not evidence to forbid it." And so too wrote the Mordekhai in chapter 2 of Avodah Zarah.

All the images found in villages are prohibited, etc. The beginning of the chapter 'All the Images' (Avodah Zarah 40b): All the images are prohibited because they are worshiped once a year, these are the words of Rabbi Meir." And the Sages say it is not prohibited unless it holds a staff, or a bird, or a ball.  And in the Gemara (there), Rabba bar bar Hana said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: 'We learned this regarding those that stand at the entrance of the city. And even though from Rashi's words it appears that he said this only according to Rabbi Meir, but according to the Rabbis, whether they stand at the entrance of the city or not, everything depends on whether it holds a staff, or a bird, or a ball, our teacher (the Tur) understands that this is also said according to the Rabbis. And this also appears from the words of the Rambam, of blessed memory, in chapter 7 (halakah 6) of the Laws of Idolatry. And regarding what our teacher distinguished between villages and cities, there Rabba said: 'The disagreement is in cities, but in villages, all agree they are prohibited,' meaning, it is assumed that in villages they are made for worship because the villagers do not make them for decoration.  And regarding what we learned, that it is not prohibited unless it holds a staff, or a bird, or a ball, it is stated in the Gemara (41a):  It was taught: They added to them a sword, a crown, and a ring, and the Gemara explains that it is obvious that when it holds one of these items, it is worshiped.  The Ryf and the Rosh did not write these additional items, and it is possible that because they are not common in this time, they omitted them.  But our teacher, who wrote one of them, it is perplexing as to why he omitted the others.  But the Rambam wrote all of them in chapter 7 of the Laws of Idolatry. And know that it is stated in the Gemara (17b [s/b 40b]) on the Mishnah: 'If they are worshiped once a year, what is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Rabbi Yitzchak bar Yosef said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: 'In Rabbi Meir's place, they would worship it once a year, and Rabbi Meir, who was concerned about the minority, decreed that in other places as well, due to that place.  But the Rabbis, who were not concerned about the minority, did not decree for other places due to that place.  Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel: 'We learned this concerning the statues of kings.'  And the Ran wrote that it seems Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Shmuel came to explain the Mishnah, so that we do not say Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis argue whether we decree for other places due to that place or not, but rather they argue in that very place, concerning the statues of kings and those in cities, as Rava concludes.  And certainly, they are not made for worship but only for decoration. But Rabbi Meir was concerned about the minority of people in that place who might accept it as an idol, and that is why he said they are worshiped once a year, meaning, since he was concerned about the minority, there is concern that perhaps one person made a mistake once a year. And the Rabbis, who were not concerned about the minority, permit it. The Rif and the Rosh omitted the explanation of Rabbi Yitzchak bar Yosef in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, and they wrote the statement of Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, who established it regarding statues of kings. And it seems their reasoning is because it is possible to learn from it that the Rabbis prohibit in cities when it holds a staff, etc., and in villages even if it holds nothing, for even in the case of statues of kings they prohibited. And the Rambam omitted the case of statues of kings, and it seems that he did not need to mention it, because since he does not differentiate between one form and another, but rather bases everything on whether it stands at the entrance of the city and holds a staff, etc., it automatically includes statues of kings. And this also seems to be the opinion of our teacher (the Tur), who did not mention statues of kings.  But Rabbeinu Yerucham wrote: 'All images that are statues of kings and are at the entrance of the city are permitted, as long as it is not known if they were worshiped, for if they were worshiped, they are considered an idol.' And he explains that a statue is made when the king dies and they make his image at the entrance of the city. This is clear in the chapter 'All the Images.' According to Tosafot, even if they hold something significant, it is prohibited for benefit. The Rambam wrote that another statue is not prohibited even if it holds something, but if a statue of a king holds something, it is prohibited; if not, it is permitted since they are only made for decoration.  And this also appears from the Rif. And these are the words of the Rambam: 'Images made by Gentiles for decoration are permitted for benefit, and images made for idolatry are prohibited. How so? All the images found in villages are prohibited for benefit because they are presumed to be made for idolatry. And those found in the city, if they stand at the entrance of the city and the image holds a staff, or a bird, or a ball, or a sword, or a crown, or a ring, it is presumed to be for idolatry and is prohibited for benefit; if not, it is presumed to be for decoration and is permitted.  And it appears that Rabbeinu Yerucham holds that even though he did not specifically mention statues of kings, and that standing at the entrance of the city—this generally refers to statues of kings, and in these cases, he differentiates between whether they hold something or not, but if it is not a statue of a king, it is permitted in all cases. And this is what he said: 'Images made by Gentiles for decoration are permitted for benefit (and if it is known that they are worshiped, even those despised are prohibited for benefit),' without making any distinction.And from the words of our teacher (the Tur), who wrote later: 'And the images of other constellations, etc., unless there is proof that they were made for idolatry, such as an image standing at the entrance of the city, etc.,' it appears that the Mishnah 'All the Images' specifically refers to a human form and not other forms. And I do not know where he got this from, unless it is said that since we establish it regarding statues of kings, this is what he understood. And it also appears that from the language of 'statue' (anadrati), he understood it to mean a complete form with all its limbs, and therefore, at the end of the section, he wrote that a head without a body or a body without a head has no prohibition, neither in finding it nor in making it.

The one who finds broken pieces of statues that have been discarded or within broken pieces of copper or even broken pieces of an idol itself, they are permitted.  However, if one finds the shape of a hand or the shape of a foot, etc.  Mishnah there (Avodah Zarah 41a): One who finds broken pieces of statues, they are permitted. If he finds the shape of a hand or the shape of a foot, they are forbidden because they were worshiped in such forms.  And in the Gemara, Shmuel said, even broken pieces of idols.  This means even broken pieces of idols that we saw being worshipped when they were whole are permitted.  Because once they are broken, they are no longer worshiped.  But didn’t the Mishnah teach “fragments of statues”?  Here it is even referring to broken pieces of idols. The reason it mentions “broken pieces of statues” is to introduce the later clause, “If he finds the shape of a hand or the shape of a foot,  statues, where we are unsure if they were worshiped, we must be concerned about an important fragment, such as the shape of a hand.  And in the Gemara, it says, “If he finds the shape of a hand or the shape of a foot, they are forbidden because they were worshiped in such forms.” But why, if they are broken pieces?  Shmuel explained that it refers to those standing on their base.  And Rashi explained “on their base” means on their pedestal, the place specifically designated for them, because once they are placed there, it is certain that they were worshiped.  The Tosafot questioned this, as the term “found” suggests in the marketplace or in a field.  Therefore, Rabbeinu Tam explained that it refers to pieces that have a wide seat on which they sit alone and do not appear as broken pieces, but rather as if they were initially made that way. This is the end of his words.  The words of the Rosh appear to be in agreement with Rabbeinu Tam’s explanation.

The Rambam wrote:  Whoever finds the hand of an idol, or its foot, or one of its limbs cast aside, it is forbidden for benefit:  In chapter 7 of the laws of idolatry, And this is his language; Statues found cast aside in markets or within porches, these are permitted, and it is unnecessary to say [the same for] broken pieces of statues.  But one who finds the hand of an idol, or its foot, or one of its limbs cast aside, this is forbidden for benefit.  Since it is known with certainty that this limb is from the form that was worshipped, it remains in its forbidden state until it is known that the idolaters nullified it. And what our master wrote, that it seems to him that it is established in the Gemara as standing on its base. It can be said that the Rambam interprets that Shmuel, who establishes it this way, held like Reish Lakish, who said that an idol which broke on its own is permitted.  And we hold like Rabbi Yochanan, who disagrees and forbids it, therefore Shmuel's opinion is not accepted.  And this is what he wrote in chapter 8: an idol that broke on its own, its fragments are forbidden for benefit until they are nullified.  Therefore, whoever finds fragments of an idol, they are forbidden for benefit, lest the idolaters did not nullify them.  But the Rif and the Rosh, although they ruled like Rabbi Yochanan who said that an idol that broke on its own is forbidden, ruled according to Shmuel, who said that even fragments of an idol are permitted.  And the Ran wrote that the reason is because it can be said that Shmuel properly holds like Rabbi Yochanan, who said that an idol that broke on its own is forbidden.  And the reason he permits fragments of an idol is because he does not suspect that it broke on its own, since presumably an idol does not break on its own because idolaters guard it well. And therefore fragments of an idol are permitted, because even though if it certainly broke on its own, its fragments are forbidden, like Rabbi Yochanan said, we do not suspect it broke on its own because it is not common.  Rather, we say that the idolater became angry at it and broke it, and therefore it is permitted, as he nullified it.  And Rashi also wrote this at the end of the chapter, regarding the dispute between Rav and Shmuel about an idol that broke on its own, whether it is necessary to nullify each splinter or not.  And what the Rambam wrote, that statues found cast aside are permitted, even though it implies that the Mishnah only permits broken pieces of statues, I have written his reasoning in the explanation of Sefer HaMada, and I do not have the time to elaborate.

One who finds vessels and they have the image of the sun or the moon or a dragon, etc.  It is taught in the Mishnah in Chapter 3 of Avodah Zarah (page 42a):  One who finds vessels with the image of the sun the moon a dragon, he should throw them into the Dead Sea. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says that those that are considered honorable are prohibited and those that are considered disposable are permitted. And the decisors have ruled according to Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel because we hold that wherever Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel teaches in our Mishnah, the halacha is according to him.  And the Mordechai wrote that a dragon is a type of serpent flying in the heavens and its name is the great Teli and it rules over the constellations, and therefore it is considered important along with the image of the sun and the moon.   And what is meant by “honorable” is those on earrings, rings, and other jewelry.  It is taught in the Baraita there (page 43a): And what is meant by “whether they are below the water or above the water”? There, Rav said that valuable items are those above the water and less valuable items are those below the water meaning that those above the water are on the rims of the vessels and those below the water are on the edges and sides. And Shmuel said that both these and those are considered less valuable because they are used for eating and drinking. and valuable items are only those made for adornment.  And there is a Tanna teaching like Shmuel. And therefore the decisors have ruled according to him.

And what is written that there is to say that silk and embroidered garments are considered lowly because they are for wearing etc… there in the braisa that is nearby it says that garments with embroidery are listed with the esteemed ones, the Rosh wrote there are those who call these 'shirim' meaning 'a kind of adornment' but garments with embroidery- all expensive garments are called lowly since they are worn and are like sheets. And there are those who call embroidered garments and expensive clothing 'esteemed', and according to the Ran, it seems from the Jerusalem Talmud that embroidered garments, since they are made for wearing out, are considered like sheets and they are considered lowly. And Rabbeinu Yerucham wrote that this is also the opinion of the Ramban.  But the Rambam wrote in Chapter 6 of Laws of Idolatry that garments of the second category are judged like silver and gold vessels. And Rabbeinu Yerucham wrote that some say and likewise in the Tosefta, that only the prominent ones are prohibited.

And what [he] wrote, and all of this [applies] in the case of 'stam' (unspecified), but if it is known that they are not worshipped, even if they are on important objects, they are also permitted.  In the Jerusalem Talmud, regarding what Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, “on the important objects, they are prohibited, etc.,” what [situation] are we dealing with? If it is certain that they are worshipped, even on lowly objects, they are forbidden. And if it is certain that they are not worshipped, even on important objects, they are permitted. Rather, we are dealing with [a case of] 'stam' (unspecified). And the Ran wrote, “and from this, we hear [learn], that any form that is certainly worshipped, there is no distinction between important objects and lowly ones. The Mishnah [refers to] 'stam' (unspecified), meaning that the gentiles were accustomed to worship them. But there are places where we do not know if they are worshipped there or not. And therefore, on important objects, they are prohibited; on lowly objects, they are permitted. For the vessels indicate if they are worshipped there or not.” This is the opinion of the Rashba in this matter: “And therefore, the Rabbi wrote that all vessels are forbidden, whether they are important or lowly. But it seems to me that this Jerusalem Talmud is saying, If it is certain that they are worshipped, meaning that those forms on the vessels were worshipped, they are forbidden, even if they are on lowly objects. Lest you say, 'Since they are lowly, their worship is not considered worship,' [know that] they are certainly forbidden. And if it is certain that those vessels were not worshipped, even if they are important, they are permitted. Rather, we are dealing with 'stam' (unspecified). Meaning, we do not know if these vessels were worshipped. Therefore, important objects are prohibited, since the form is certainly worshipped, we are concerned that even this vessel was worshipped because it is important. But on lowly objects, they are permitted because, although this form is certainly worshipped, it was not worshipped in this vessel because it is lowly.” And shortly, I will write that the words of the Ran seem to align with the opinions of some of the commentators. And know that we say in the Gemara (42b) regarding the Mishnah that on them are forms of the sun, the moon, or a dragon, To say that to these [objects], they worship them, but to other things, they do not. And we raise a contradiction: one who slaughters for the sake of seas, for the sake of rivers, etc., these are 'sacrifices to the dead.'  Abaye said: They worship whatever they find. And they are distressed and worship these three things that are significant to them; they make images of them and worship them. For other things, they make them merely for decoration. And the Ran wrote: “however, this [applies] in unspecified places. But in a place known for worshipping a particular form, one who finds vessels with that form on them, they are forbidden.” And Rabbeinu Yerucham wrote in the name of Rabbi Avraham ben Yismael, “That nowadays, gentiles do not worship the sun, the moon, or the dragon, so vessels found with these forms are permitted for benefit. And it is possible that those who are not attached to idolatry, everything they make with these forms on vessels, they make only for decoration, and they are all permitted for benefit. But they are forbidden to keep because of suspicion if they are raised (embossed). And it is proper to be stringent in a case of doubt regarding a Torah prohibition, end quote.” And the Mordechai wrote in the chapter of 'All the Images' that in the case of villages, everyone agrees it is forbidden, etc. On this [Mishnah] that teaches that lowly images on cauldrons, etc., and on sheets and handkerchiefs, the Rif has a version that includes coins, because sheets and handkerchiefs are one, and therefore our coins that have the image of an idol on them are permitted. And similarly, it is written in the Hagahot Ashri; Rabbi Yehudah says that from here, there is proof that our coins are permitted because they are lowly, end quote.” But it is puzzling because it is like the form of the sun, moon, and dragon, which they make images of and worship because they are significant. And they said in the Jerusalem Talmud that the Mishnah's distinction between important and lowly objects applies only in unspecified cases. But if it is certain that they are worshipped, even if they are on lowly objects, they are forbidden. And it must be said that they interpret it like the Ran explained, that when it is known that those forms on those vessels were worshipped, the Jerusalem Talmud says that even on lowly objects, they are forbidden, etc. But in any case where we do not know if these vessels were worshipped, if they are lowly, they are permitted. For although this form is certainly worshipped, it was not worshipped on this vessel because it is lowly. And it seems to me that this aligns with the opinion of Rashi, who explained on what Abaye said, 'they worship whatever they find,' they are distressed and worship, these three [things] that are significant to them, they make images of them and worship them, etc. They make images of them and worship them, therefore they make images [to them] and worship. They make an image to worship these three that are significant to them.

And [regarding] the images of the other constellations, and all other forms, even the form of a human, one who finds them, they are permitted. Here, Rav Sheshet applies the stringencies of the Mishnah and teaches: All the constellations are permitted except for the constellations of the sun and moon, and all the faces are permitted except for the face of a human. And all forms are permitted except for the form of a dragon. And the Gemara establishes the first and last parts as referring to 'one who finds' and the middle part as referring to 'one who makes'. For when it comes to one who finds, even a human face is permitted. For we learned in a Mishnah: one who finds vessels with the image of the sun, the image of the moon, or the image of a dragon, he should take them to the Dead Sea. The image of a dragon, yes [is prohibited], but the face of a human, no. And even though Rava also establishes the middle case as referring to 'one who finds' and like Rabbi Yehuda, he only disagrees in the case of a nursing woman and similar cases. But in the case of a simple human face, he agrees that it is permitted. And furthermore, Rava only established [the ruling] according to Rabbi Yehuda in order to establish the entire case as referring to 'one who finds', and not to need to establish the first part as 'one who finds' and the middle part as 'one who makes'. But regarding the law, it is clear that the halacha is not like Rabbi Yehuda, but like the Tanna of the Mishnah, who permits all human faces.

And what was written, "unless there is proof that it was made as an idol, such as a form standing at the entrance of a city, etc.," has already been explained at the beginning of the section. However, I am still puzzled by our master (Rabbeinu) who wrote this law plainly as it is mentioned in the Talmud, which certainly implies that this applied in their time. And furthermore, why should the form of the sun, moon, and dragon be prohibited in this time, since we certainly know that they are not worshiped at all. And so wrote Rabbeinu Yerucham in the name of his teacher, that vessels found with these forms at this time are permitted for benefit but prohibited to keep. However, from the words of Tosafot in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim" (Avodah Zarah 43b), regarding what we say that "Rabban Gamliel is different because others made it for him," it implies that there is no difference between this time and their time in this matter.

And what was written, but all of them are prohibited to make, meaning, the form of all the constellations and the form of a human.

And what was written, there is no difference between those in the dwelling place of the Divine Presence, and those in the upper dwelling, and no difference between those in the lower dwelling, the upper dwelling is called so in relation to the lower dwelling, but in relation to the dwelling place of the Divine Presence, it is obvious that it is the lower dwelling, and all these things that our teacher wrote, are from what is taught in the second chapter of Rosh Hashanah, Rabban Gamliel had images of the moon in his attic,  on a tablet on the wall, through which he would show the laypeople, and he would say to them, "Did you see like this or like that?" And it is challenged there and in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim" (all the images), [saying] and is it permitted?But it is written, "Do not make with Me," Do not make the likeness of My servants. Abaye said: The Torah only forbade the likenesses of those servants that it is possible to make like them, meaning, but the servants above, which it is impossible to make exactly like them, only a representation, is permitted. As it was taught in a Baraita: A person should not make a house in the form of the Temple, meaning, that it should have the same length, width, height, and measurement of its doorways, but if it is altered in some way, it is permitted. A portico in the form of the Hall, a courtyard in the form of the Temple courtyard, a table in the form of the Table, a menorah in the form of the Menorah, but one may make one with five branches, meaning, a menorah with five, six, or eight branches, because they do not resemble the one in the Temple. And one with seven branches should not be made, because it is like the one in the Temple, even if it is made from other metals, for even though it is not made of gold, it is still valid in the Temple. As we learn in "HaKomets Rabah," through the principle of general and specific and general. But one made of wood is permitted because it is not valid in the Temple, as the specific type mentioned is metal. And we challenge: And the servants that it is impossible to make like them, are they permitted? But it was taught in a braisa: "Do not make with Me," do not make the likeness of My servants who serve before Me on high, indicating that even the upper servants are also forbidden. And we respond: Abaye said: The Torah only forbade the likeness of the four faces together, meaning, the face of an ox, a human, a lion, and an eagle on one creature, like the Holy Beasts, as it is written, "Do not make with Me," the ones who dwell with Me. And we challenge: But if so, a human face alone should be permitted. And we resolve: Rav Adda bar Yehoshua said, from the teachings of Abaye I heard: "Do not make with Me," meaning, do not make an image of Me, meaning, the likeness in which I appear to the prophets. And we challenge: And are the other servants permitted? But it was taught in a braisa: "Do not make with Me," do not make the likeness of My servants who serve before Me on high, such as the Ophanim, Seraphim, Holy Beasts, and ministering angels. Meaning, the likeness in which they appear in prophetic visions, which is a human with wings. And we resolve: Abaye said: The Torah only forbade the likeness of the servants in the upper dwelling, meaning, as it is written, "with Me," but the sun and moon are in the lower dwelling. And we challenge: Are those in the lower dwelling permitted? But it was taught in a braisa: "That are in the heavens," to include the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, "above," to include the ministering angels. That teaching is about worshipping them. If it's about worship, even the smallest worm would be included. Yes, indeed. And it is derived from the end of the verse, as it was taught: "That are on the earth," to include the seas and rivers, "below," to include the smallest worm. And making them without intent to worship, is that permitted? But it was taught: "Do not make with Me," do not make the likeness of My servants who serve before Me on high, such as the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. And we resolve: Rabban Gamliel is different because others made it for him, meaning, idol worshippers. And behold Rabbi Yehuda, others made it for him, meaning, an image on a ring that he would wear. And Shmuel said to Rabbi Yehuda: "Sharp one, remove its eye," meaning, diminish its form. And we resolve: There, it was a raised seal, and because of suspicion, meaning, so that they wouldn't say he worships it. As it was taught: A ring with a raised seal, meaning, its form, is forbidden to wear, but permitted to seal with, because when it seals, the impression is sunken into the wax and is not visible from the outside. A ring with a sunken seal is permitted to wear but forbidden to seal with, because when it seals, the impression is raised. And later it challenges: If so, in the case of Rabban Gamliel, we should also be concerned about suspicion. And we resolve: And are we concerned about suspicion? But there was that synagogue in Nehardea called "Shaf Veyativ"—meaning, it was moved from another place, in the region of Nehardea. Some say that Jeconiah and his exiles took with them stones from Jerusalem and its soil, and built it there, and that is why it is called "Shaf Veyativ," moved from here and set there. And it is written, "For your servants take pleasure in her stones." And they placed in it a statue—meaning, an image. And Samuel's father and Levi would enter it and pray there and were not concerned about suspicion. The many are different. And Rabban Gamliel was an individual, but because he was a prince, many were frequently with him. And if you want, say that it was in parts, meaning, it was sectional and was only assembled at the time of examining witnesses, so it was not seen every day, and therefore there was no suspicion. And if you want, say that for learning, it is different. As it was taught: You shall not learn to do, but you may learn to understand and to teach. This is the end of the Ran (commentary) on the Gemara in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim." And the Tosafot wrote: Rabbi Yitzchak said that all these explanations of Abaye are true, for if not, he would have said in each one, rather this is what it means… that he said: The Torah only forbade the servants below, except for a house in the form of the Temple, a portico in the form of the Hall, and among the servants below, the sun, moon, and stars are forbidden, and in the upper dwelling, the likeness of the four faces is forbidden. And so wrote the Ran in the name of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, of blessed memory, and he elaborated on resolving the sugya (topic) according to this interpretation. And now, what our teacher wrote that all are prohibited to make—there is no difference between those in the dwelling place of the Divine Presence, etc., until "but one with seven branches should not be made, even from other metals"—is clear in the Gemara. And the Ran wrote, based on the interpretation of Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, of blessed memory, that all these are forbidden to keep even if others made them, except for the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, which are permitted if others made them, as long as there is no concern for suspicion, as will be explained shortly. But from the words of our teacher later on, it seems that he does not differentiate between them, and all are also permitted if others made them, as long as there is no concern for suspicion.

And what was written, that making forms of seas and hills is permitted, this is obvious because they are not included among the things mentioned in the Gemara as prohibited.

Seif Katan 12

And what was written, that the form of a dragon is forbidden for one who finds it to keep it, meaning it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, and one must take it to the Dead Sea, because we are concerned that it might have been worshipped before it was found, as has been explained in this section.

Seif Katan 13

And what was written that it is permitted to make it [the form of a dragon], this is because it is not among the things mentioned in the Gemara that are forbidden to be made. However, it seems that this only applies when there is no suspicion, such as in one of the cases mentioned further on. But otherwise, since it is something that is depicted and worshipped, it is obvious that it is forbidden, as we say regarding the sun and the moon. And know that the Rosh wrote in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim" regarding a ring whose seal is protruding, it is forbidden to wear it, etc. This seal refers to the sun and the moon, stars and constellations, and the form of a human face, which are forbidden to be made and also to be kept if made by a non-Jew due to suspicion, but the form of a dragon is permitted to be made but forbidden to be kept, end quote. And it seemed to me that he meant: it is permitted to make it for a non-Jew, not for idolatry, as one does not transgress the prohibition of making it according to the verse "You shall not make with Me" because it is not among the things that are derived from this verse for prohibition. Since it is not included in those things that are derived from this verse for prohibition, but it is forbidden to keep it due to suspicion. And it seems that our master did not want to explain it this way because if it is forbidden to keep it due to suspicion, from that very reason it should also be forbidden to make it. Therefore, he explained it as follows: it is forbidden to keep it if found, because we are concerned that it may have been worshipped before it was found.

Seif Katan 14

And all the forms that are forbidden to be made for oneself are also forbidden to be made for a non-Jew. It seems that the reason is because it is written in a general way, "You shall not make with Me," and it does not say "You shall not make for yourselves." This implies that the prohibition of making applies in all cases, even for a non-Jew.

Seif Katan 15

And what [Rabbenu] wrote: "And so too, if a non-Jew made them for him, it is forbidden to keep [them]." In what case are these words said? When it is raised... as it is taught: a ring with a raised seal, etc. This is simple from what we say: "But Rabbi Yehudah [had a ring] that others made for him." And Shmuel said to him, "Sharp one, remove the eyes of this one," there [it was because] the seal was raised, and due to suspicion. As it is taught: a ring with a raised seal is forbidden to wear, etc. And what [Rabbenu] wrote: "And it seems that all those [forms] that are forbidden when found are also forbidden when they are recessed, etc."—this is clear in its reasoning.

Seif Katan 16

And what [Rabbenu] wrote: That which is recessed is considered those that are woven into a garment or painted on a wall. That is to say, when they are painted with colors on the wall or on a board.  So wrote the Rambam in Chapter 3 of the Laws of Idolatry.  And so wrote the Mordechai in Chapter All the Idols, in the name of Rabbi Meir, may his memory be blessed.

Seif Katan 17

And what [Rabbenu] wrote: "And even with protruding images, he only forbade them for an individual". This is straightforward, as what he wrote: "If a non-Jew made them for him, it is forbidden to keep them if they are protruding" refers to this.

Seif Katan 18

And what [Rabbenu] wrote: to differentiate between an individual and a public group, between something that is jointed and something that is not jointed, and between [making it] for educational purposes and [making it] not for educational purposes—all of this is explained in the Gemara that I have brought.  And it seems that all of these three explanations that the Gemara gave are accepted as halacha, and each one of these cases is permitted.  And this also appears from the words of the Rosh, may his memory be blessed, who wrote them.  But the Rif wrote: “Is this allowed? Doesn't it say, ‘You shall not make with Me; you shall not make the form of My ministers that serve Me on high, such as the sun and the moon and the stars’?”  [But] for educational purposes, it is different, as it is written: “You shall not learn [to do], but you may learn to understand and to teach.”  And he [the Rif] did not differentiate between an individual and a public group, or between something that is jointed and something that is not jointed, and he also did not mention the permission where others made it for him at all.  And also Rambam, may his memory be blessed, in the third chapter of the Laws of Idolatry, did not differentiate to permit these things.  And the Ran wrote that it seems they [Rif and Rambam] hold that since the truth of the matter is that for understanding and teaching it is permitted, from this, it is not possible to say regarding Rabban Gamliel that others made it for him, and those explanations of “others made it for him” and “it was jointed” are rejected. Nevertheless, one can wonder about Rambam, may his memory be blessed, as he should have written that it is permitted to make them for educational purposes.

Seif Katan 19

And what [Rabbenu] wrote in the name of Rabbeinu Tam, that regarding images of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, there is no difference between [whether they are] raised or recessed, This is what the Tosafot and the Rosh wrote in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim" [in Avodah Zarah]. And they deduced this from the fact that the Gemara asks, "But Rabban Gamliel was an individual," and does not answer that the image of the moon that Rabban Gamliel made was not raised.  Therefore, they said that regarding the sun, moon, and constellations, there is no difference between raised or recessed [images], since they appear to us as recessed in the sky. Therefore, even recessed images are forbidden.  And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, also ruled this way in the third chapter of the Laws of Idolatry. And the Ran wrote in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim" [in Avodah Zarah] regarding the Baraita of a ring with a raised seal that some say it does not refer to the forms of the heavenly ministers that the Torah forbade making. For the Torah did not differentiate between raised and recessed except in other forms, where even though they are permitted by Torah law, whether to make them or to keep them, if they are raised, they are forbidden by Rabbinic law because of suspicion. And if they are recessed, they are permitted if there is no suspicion.  Similarly, the forms of the lower realm that the Torah forbade making—if he did not make them himself but others made them for him—if they are raised, it is forbidden to keep them by Rabbinic law, also because of suspicion. But if they are recessed, they are permitted because there is no Torah prohibition since others made them for him, and there is no suspicion since they are recessed.  And another version says that all the forms that the Torah forbade are specifically raised ones that are forbidden, but recessed ones are permitted.  And all other forms, whether recessed or raised, are permitted. And that which was taught in the Baraita about a ring with a raised seal, etc., refers to those forms that the Torah forbade. For in those [forbidden forms] there is room to differentiate between raised and recessed, but all other forms, whether raised or recessed, are permitted. And he, may his memory be blessed, decided according to the first version. And he further wrote: Rambam, may his memory be blessed, has a different opinion in the third chapter of the Laws of Idolatry, where he wrote that the forms of the heavenly ministers are forbidden whether raised or recessed, and all other forms, except the human form, are permitted whether raised or recessed. And this differentiation between a raised seal and a recessed seal, the Rabbi [Rambam] applied only to the human form. And I did not fully understand his reasoning—how he differentiates between the human form and the forms of the heavenly ministers, as they all derive from "You shall not make with Me." Perhaps the Rabbi [Rambam] holds that the angels, because they are not corporeal beings, and similarly the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, because they do not appear raised and even in their orbits are not raised but rather recessed within it, there is no room to differentiate between raised and recessed. But the human form, because it does not appear except as raised, is only forbidden in that manner.  For although we derive [the prohibition] from "with Me," even so, since the human form is found to be raised, it is not forbidden except when raised.

Seif Katan 20

And what [Rabbenu] wrote that the Ramban added further the image of a human and all the heavenly ministers, meaning those in the upper realm, which are forbidden whether they are raised or recessed, etc.  This is the reasoning that the Ran decided in favor of.  And the Ran further wrote there that it seems to him that they only worried about suspicion in forms that it was customary for idolaters to worship.  But forms such as these are permitted to make as long as it is not known or heard that they are worshipped at all.  For the custom is to maintain raised forms of those that the Torah did not forbid, and we have not heard of anyone objecting to this, end quote.  And further below, I will write other opinions in the name of the Mordechai concerning the form of a living creature, except for the form of a human.  And what [Rabbenu] wrote, and it seems logical that they did not forbid other forms—meaning other forms that are permitted by Torah law and were forbidden by the sages because of suspicion—except for rings and the like, which are prestigious, etc.  And that which was taught, "It is forbidden to seal," meaning that which is taught in the Baraita, that a ring with a recessed seal is forbidden to seal with, refers to sealing for the prestigious.  But to seal with it for the despised is permitted because, since they are despised, there is no suspicion.  And this reasoning of the Ramban was written by the Ran in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim."  (Note: Blessed be He) Rabbeinu Yerucham wrote about that which a ring with a raised seal is permitted to seal with, etc.  This seal refers to [images of] the sun and moon, stars and constellations, and the human form; it is forbidden to make it and even to keep it if an idolater made it, because of suspicion.  And concerning the permission when many are commonly with him, he wrote [that it is permitted] if two people enter a house where there is an image, and it seems that he learned this from what is presented in the Gemara regarding the incident with Levi and Shmuel's father, who would enter and pray in a synagogue that had an image, and we were not concerned about suspicion. And [the Gemara] answered, "The case of many is different."  And he further wrote in the name of the poskim that even though there is no suspicion when there are many, it is still disgraceful for them.

Seif Katan 21

The Rashba wrote that the image of heavenly ministers that is forbidden to make, there is no difference between prestigious and despised etc… The Rosh wrote in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim" that Rabban Gamliel's case is different because others made it for him—he acquired it from idolaters; therefore, it is permitted.  And the Tosafot wrote in the second chapter of Rosh Hashanah (24b) that Rabban Gamliel's case is different because others made it for him. And even though generally speaking, instructing a non-Jew to do work is rabbinically prohibited, here they did not decree [it as forbidden] because it was for the sake of a mitzvah.  And one must be careful when lending to a non-Jew and sealing the seal with a wax seal attached to a letter.  But if the non-Jew brings him a seal on his own, it is permitted.  And in the chapter "Kol HaTzelamim," they wrote that some wanted to be stringent not to seal for a non-Jew with a seal that has the form of a human for a debt, unless the non-Jew brought it himself.  And likewise not to wear those belts that have raised forms.  However, there is support for permitting based on this version that interprets Rabbi Yehuda's statement regarding the form of a dragon, where suspicion is more relevant than in other cases, as it is taught in the Mishnah: "If one finds vessels with a dragon image on them, he should take them to the Dead Sea."  And the Andarti [statue] that they were concerned about regarding suspicion refers to one that was a statue of a human figure, complete with hands and feet.  And so too wrote the Mordechai.

And the fact that we prohibit [making] a full form of a human and a dragon, etc… So writes the Rosh in Chapter "All the Sculptures," and the text says: And the prohibition of [making] the form of a human and a dragon is only in a complete form but [making] just the head without a complete body is permitted, as "You shall not make with Me" is interpreted and also there is no concern for suspicion if the entire figure is not complete. End of quote.  Rabbeinu Yerucham wrote: The bedspreads (מצעות) that have those images made on them are forbidden to make, For they are worshipped, and it is appropriate to excommunicate anyone who does not refrain from making them, and so wrote the commentaries. End of quote. *note start](From the "Ba"ah," wrote in "A" the Rashba in responsum #167 and #505 about an image of a lion without the inscription on a silver plate for healing purposes.  According to a book of remedies where it is found that this is beneficial for a specific illness, and if it was made at a known time, he responded that even if a Jew made it, even if it was protruding, there is no prohibition on making it.  For it is not like celestial images: the form of a lion stands alone and is not worshiped, but rather the faces of the living creatures of the chariot [Merkavah], these four living creatures. And someone who makes the face in the form of those creatures that have four faces is forbidden. But one of them alone [is not forbidden]. And he brought proofs to this. I heard that my teacher, the Ramban, used to make that image for that illness. And he wrote further that if it is for the sake of a remedy, and it is known to doctors that it works, there is no concern of following the practices of the Amorites.  And furthermore, it seems to me that if it is not explicitly prohibited in the Gemara (Shabbat 67) among those mentioned as practices of the Amorites, it is permitted to make them for healing, even though it is not clear to us if it is indeed a remedy because the effectiveness of remedies is not known to us. And he brought evidence to this.  And I found in the responsa of the later Catalan scholars that the Rashba was persuaded by his contemporaries regarding the allowance of this image and retracted his opinion. *note end Mordechai wrote in Chapter "All the Sculptures" that Rabbeinu Ephraim responded regarding images of birds and horses painted in the synagogue. It is not comparable to a seal with an image because there it is a form of an idol, a human face, or images of the sun and moon and dragon that are worshipped. But images of birds and horses. And these things are not worshipped by non-Jews even when they are standalone images, let alone when they are painted on clothes. And we learned that all images are permitted except for the image of a human, and the Talmud explains that the image of a human is only prohibited if it is found, according to Rabbi Yehuda, but the Rabbis permit even the image of a human if it is found. Therefore, there is no concern here.  End of quote. And Rabbeinu Elikim explained that the text "all images are permitted except for the image of a human" means in the case of making [the image] as explained by Abaye. And the term "all" is not absolute, for the image of the sun, moon, and dragon are included in the prohibition.  Since they are considered objects of worship. And it can be said that Abaye's opinion is only concerning those who make them, but we follow Rava who says that all images are permitted if found.  It is (the opinion of) Rabbi Yehuda, from which we learn that found (images) are permitted, but making them is forbidden. And in the Mekhilta, it forbids making even the image of an animal, birds, grasshoppers, and fish, as it is said: "the form of any animal that is on the earth" (Deuteronomy 4:17).  Based on these proofs, it was commanded to remove the images of lions and snakes that were drawn in the synagogue in Cologne. End of quote.  And in the Hagahot Ashri, it is written in the name of the Or Zarua regarding the words of Rabbeinu Elikim, and he gave another reason because it says in Berakhot 5b that we require nothing to come between a person and the wall (during prayer). And also, as it says in Bava Batra 25b, "One who wishes to become wealthy should turn to the north," thus it will appear as though they are bowing to those images. And he wrote further: "When my father was a boy, they would draw in the synagogue images of trees and birds, and he judged this to be forbidden." Now it has become clear to us that all of these are forbidden to be made, such as the images of faces, which are those of humans, animals, and living creatures, and images such as birds, fish, snakes, and worms. And statues, such as anything in the form or shape of something — anyone who makes them transgresses a prohibition. But if others made them for him, it is permitted according to Torah law but prohibited by Rabbinic law until their form is altered. End of quote. And it has already been explained above that according to the latter opinion, which the Ra"n wrote, all forms are permitted, even protruding ones, except for those that the Torah forbids because of "You shall not make with Me" (Exodus 20:20). And similarly, Maimonides of blessed memory wrote in Chapter 3 of the Laws of Idolatry, and this is what he said: The forms of animals and other living creatures, excluding humans, and the forms of trees, grasses, and the like, are permitted to be fashioned, even if the form is protruding. And this is clarified according to the words of Rabbeinu Ephraim. Even according to the first opinion, which the Ra"n ruled in favor of, and which our teacher quoted in the name of the Ramban of blessed memory, although he forbids other forms when they are protruding, nevertheless, when they are sunken, they are permitted. And it has already been explained above that what is drawn with symbols on a board or tablet is considered sunken (i.e., not protruding). And the Mordechai also wrote in the name of Rabbi Meir (the R”M) and permitted drawing forms using various colors because they are not protruding.  Therefore, from the words of all of them, we learn that in such a case where they were painted on the wall, it is permitted, and not like the opinion of Rabbeinu Elikim. Furthermore, even according to the opinion of the Ra"n and Ramban, since non-Jews do not worship those forms, even if they were protruding, they are permitted.  And as it is written earlier in the name of the Ra"n of blessed memory, therefore, we hold like the opinion of Rabbeinu Ephraim, as all agree with him, and the opinion of Rabbeinu Elikim is not followed, as he is an individual against the majority. And what Rabbeinu Elikim explained, that the teaching 'all faces are permitted except for the face of a human' — this 'all' is not literal, for the forms of the sun, moon, and dragon are included in the prohibition. I do not know what benefit there is in this explanation, since all other forms except for these three are still permitted.  And that incident where they painted in the synagogue, since they were not from these forms, it is certainly permitted.  And what he wrote, and alternatively, that only Abaye establishes this case as 'one who makes,' but we hold like Rava who says it is all in the context of 'finding' — meaning that found items are permitted, and making them is forbidden.  It can be said that Rava did not depart from Abaye's explanation except because it was difficult for him to establish the beginning and end (of the teaching) in one way and the middle in another way, and therefore, he established it all in the context of 'finding.  But regarding the law, indeed, he holds like Abaye, who permits making all forms except for the face of a human. Since we do not find that Abaye disagrees on this, we do not establish a dispute between them, and you will understand from what is said in the Gemara about the middle case, that it is certainly about 'making.  And like the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, who said that the face of a human is forbidden because of 'You shall not make with Me,' and since there was no need to bring proof for the permission of other forms.  And only to prohibit the face of a human was it necessary to bring the ruling of Rav Huna, implying that other forms are certainly permitted.  For even the face of a human would have been permitted if not for the verse brought by Rav Huna. And regarding other forms for which we do not find anyone bringing a verse for prohibition, they are certainly permitted to everyone.  And what was written, that in the Mekhilta it forbids making even the face of an animal, etc..  It can be said that this [refers to] only protruding [images], in accordance with the view of Ramban and Ra"n, of blessed memory.  And in the fifth chapter (54a) regarding the statement there that Rav only acquired his garden through a form, Rashi explains that it was a form of an animal or bird. Mordechai wrote that from here Rabbi Meir deduced that the teaching in the Mekhilta—'Do not make for yourself a graven image,' etc.—means that it prohibits making a carved image (protruding), but a sunken image (engraved) is permitted. [The verse says,] 'and any form,' even an animal, wild beast, bird, fish, or locusts. This refers specifically to a complete face carved out; a carved form refers to a protruding image, and a sunken form refers to an engraved image.  But it is permitted to use colored images, even for a Jew for his own purposes, as is implied here by Rashbam. However, a protruding or engraved seal is forbidden for a Jew to make.  However, if others made it, it is permitted to use it in a place where many people frequent, as there is no concern of suspicion, as is implied in the chapter 'All the images'—and that is the end of it.  And in my humble opinion, it seems to me that the Mekhilta is referring to one who makes an actual idol, even for a non-Jew, or to forms that non-Jews customarily worship. This is why it brings the verse 'You shall not make for yourself a graven image.  But forms that are not customarily worshiped by non-Jews are permitted, as Ra"n of blessed memory wrote.  And what was written, that based on this evidence he ordered the removal of the images of lions and snakes that were painted in the synagogue in Cologne—I do not know what was achieved by this ruling.  For according to all opinions, other forms are permitted if found, and since they are permitted when found, even though it was possible to suspect that they might be worshiped, we do not worry about that. And it implies that maintaining [such forms] is also permitted, since there is no concern of idolatry. Why should we prohibit maintaining it?  And it implies that the same applies if a Jew made them. Even though the maker committed a transgression, maintaining them is still permitted. And the one who commits the transgression did so at the time of making it, and afterward, there is no remedy, even if he removes them.  It is possible to say that nevertheless, he did not want there to be any remembrance or permanence of something that was made in violation, according to his opinion, of blessed memory,  But I have already written that all the decisors disagree with him and permit making them, even from the outset.  The Maharik wrote in his responsa, section 75, that which it is taught: a seven-branched menorah should not be made, even though its height differs from that of the menorah in the Temple, because the requirement that the Temple menorah must be 18 handbreadths high is not an absolute requirement. And he further wrote that regarding the teaching that a portico in the form of a hall is prohibited, Tosafot wrote that even though the hall had four walls, it can be said that since its entrance was very wide and high, it appeared as if it had only three walls. end of quote. And he brought proof from there that it depends on appearance.  So too, since it has seven branches, even though it is not 18 handbreadths high, it resembles the one in the Temple. And even though Rashi explained that a house in the form of the sanctuary must be similar in its length, width, height, and the measurements of its doorways, if it is altered slightly, it is permitted. This implies that we need an exact replica of the Temple. It can be said that a house is different, because if it is not made exactly like the Temple, it is not easily recognizable as a replica of the Temple. For many houses are made tall and long. But regarding a menorah, one cannot say this. And even if we say that [Maharik] disagrees with Tosafot and does not accept their reasoning regarding the portico. Nevertheless, regarding the height of the menorah, we can say that he does not disagree. For the length, height, and breadth of the sanctuary, as well as the dimensions of its doorways, are explicitly written in the verse. But the height of the menorah is not written. And even if we say that [Maharik] disagrees with them, who would dare interject themselves between Rashi and Tosafot on a biblical prohibition? And he wrote in the name of Rabbi Isaac of Corbeil that the form of a seven-branched menorah is forbidden even without the cups. And he, of blessed memory, wrote that the same applies even without the knobs and flowers; it is also forbidden.

<b>The Laws of <i>Niddah</i></b><br>"When a woman has a discharge, her discharge being blood from her body, she shall remain in her impurity seven days" (Leviticus 15:19). Our sages learnt from explication of the verses that not all blood flows render the discharger impure, but specifically those of uterine blood (a braita from Torat Kohanim). The Ri"f writes in the second chapter of Tractate Shevuot, and the Rosh at the end of Niddah, and this is his language: "'When a woman has a discharge' (ibid.) -- I could have thought any flow of blood would be impure. The Torah teaches therefore 'he has uncovered the source [uterus] of her blood' (Leviticus 20:18) -- teaching regarding the blood that it speaks only of uterine blood."

Seif Katan 2

And that which is written, "not all blood which comes from the uterus is impure, only five specific kinds of blood", is a gezeira shava: "It could be that all appearances of discharge will be impure? But to contradict this, the Torah teaches "blood" -- and blood is only red. When it says "her bloods", it teaches that many bloods are impure -- the red, the black, the saffron-hued, the muddy-water coloured, and the colours of mixed wine. The meaning is in chapter "every hand" (Niddah 19a), since it says "her bloods" "her bloods", behold there are four types. An explanation: since it says "and she revealed the source of her bloods" (Leviticus 20:18), behold there are two here. "And she will be pure from the source of her bloods" (Leviticus 12:7), behold there are two here. Behold four; and are there not five? We teach: this black is only faded red.

Seif Katan 3

And that which is written "And even with these she does not become impure until she senses the discharge of blood" in chapter "The woman who sees a stain" (Niddah 57b). Shmuel says, she checks earth [and finds it blood-free] and sits on it and finds blood upon it, she is pure, as it says "in her flesh" - until she senses it in her flesh.

A male slave who was immersed [by his Jewish master] for the purpose of becoming a [Canaanite] slave is prohibited to an Israelite woman, and an Israelite man is prohibited to a female slave who was immersed [by her Jewish master] for the purpose of becoming a [Canaanite] female slave, regardless of whether she was his slave or another's [slave] this is obvious.

Seif Katan 14

Regarding what the Tur writes: However, after his master frees him, or abandons him, or lays phylacteries on him, or if his master was a prayer leader and called him to go up to the Torah [ for an aliyah] behold he comes like an Israelite in all matters. This is in Perek HaSholeah (Gittin 40a) where we say one who abandons his slave [the slave] goes free and we say that if his master lays phylacteries on him he goes free and there it is also taught that the same is true if his master was a prayer leader and called him to go up to the Torah [ for an aliyah] that he [the slave] also goes free nevertheless there is reason to wonder why our master [the Tur] wrote that he is like an Israelite in every regard that teacher that he [the freed slave] is permitted to marry an Israelite woman for regarding one who abandons his slave in the Gemara over there we says that the [freed slave] requires a bill of manumission and regarding his master laying phylacteries on him or his master instructing him to read [his aliyah] from the Torah Maimonides writes that he he requires a bill of manumission and our master wrote his [Maimonides'] words in the Tur Yoreh Deah Cap. 267 and since a bill of manumission is a sine qua non how is he allowed to [marry] an Israelite daughter? We may answer that he [the Tur] is of the opinion that whenever [the Talmud] says he [the slave] goes free and needs a bill of manumission he is allowed to marry an Israelite daughter on account of the reason that the Rosh wrote there regarding one who marrys off his slave and I will write his words below and I will write that on this matter the Ramah disagrees.

Seif Katan 15

What [the Tur]: ...but if he lay phylacteries in the presence of his master or called him or read the Torah in his presence [during an aliyah] he does not go out to freedom this is a Baraita there (Gittin 40a) in Perek HaSholeah.

Seif Katan 16

What [the Tur] writes: If his master married him off to an Israelite woman or even if he married an Israelite woman in the presence of his master, the betrothal takes effect etc ibid [Gittin 40a]: Rabbi Zeira says: In the case of a slave who marries a free woman in the presence of his master, he is emancipated. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him Rabbi Zeira: You possess such an extreme halakha, but I teach this halakha: With regard to one who writes a document of betrothal for his maidservant, stating: You are hereby betrothed to me, Rabbi Meir says: She is betrothed, and the Rabbis argue and say: She is not betrothed, here the context of Rabbi Zeira’s statement is not that of a slave who married a woman in his master’s presence but a case where the slave’s master himself provided a wife for him [as this is certainly proof that he had emancipated him. The Gemara questions this answer:] Is there anything like this, where for his slave he would not violate a prohibition[, and by providing a wife for his slave he indicates that he must have emancipated the slave,] but he himself might violate the prohibition[, as he is suspected of marrying his maidservant without having freed her]? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: With what are we dealing here? This is a case where he said to the maidservant when he gave her the document of betrothal: Become emancipated with this and become betrothed to me with this. Rabbi Meir holds that this formulation written in the document of betrothal: You are hereby betrothed to me, contains a formulation of emancipation and therefore serves both as a bill of manumission and a document of betrothal. And the Rabbis hold: This formulation is not a formulation of emancipation. The Rif, the Rambam and the Rosh conclude with that which R. Zeira said: not only this but we forces his master to write for him a bill of manumission and the Rosh explains that the reason we require him [to write] a bill of manumission is to prevent the master from claiming "I did not emancipate him him and he is my slave" and certainly we we follow the intelligent estimate that certainly he emancipated him and we release him [the slave] from him [the master] and he is permitted to marry a free woman since he [the Talmud] did not say that he is prohibited to his wife until he [the master] frees him and the Ramah did not explain it this way until here is hi  [ the Rosh's] language. The words of the one who disagrees with this our master wrote in the Tur Yoreh Deah Cap. 267 but here he presented his words anonymously according to the opinion of the Rosh. There is reason to question what he wrote that in a case where he [the slave] married in the presence of his master the rule is the same as when his master marries him off to a woman for behold in the Gemara it suggests that only when his master marries him off to a woman because had he not emancipated him he would not have done a prohibition with his slave to marry him off to woman but when the slave marries in his master's presence he does not go free and this is what the Rif and the Rosh write explicitly and so to did our master the Tur in Yoreh Deah Cap. 267 Maybe it is possible to suggest that [the slave who marries in the presence of his master] does not go free nevertheless, regarding the prohibition of a married woman, we are concerned for had he not emancipated him he would not have allowed him to do a prohibition in his presence and therefore we says his betrothal works on her because of uncertainty and according to this it is prohibited for him to remain with her until [his master] emancipates him nevertheless his words are very unclear and require study.

Rambam wrote regarding a woman whose husband went overseas and she gave birth behold her child is assumed to have the status of a mamzer that means to stay if he [the husband] stayed there more then twelve months for the child does not remain in its mother's womb for more than twelve months [as Rambam recorded] in Cap. XV of laws of Issurei Biah and the reason is taught in the Cap. Ha'arel [Yevamot] 80b the action taken by Rava Tosfa’a concerning a woman whose husband went overseas and her baby was delayed in her womb for the twelve months of the year following her husband’s departure, and Rava Tosfa’a rendered the child fit.

Seif Katan 19

Regarding what our master the Tur wrote in the name of the Behag that the child is not presumed to have the status of a mamzer for we attribute it to the possibility that maybe her husband arrived [home] discreetly and copulated [with her] and the Rosh wrote this [too] at the beginning of the Cap. Asara Yuchsin [in Kiddushin 4:7] and it appears from his words that the view of the Behag does not appear [to be correct] to him and see what I wrote at the end of this Tur [meaning Even Haezer #178] and Teshuvot Maimuni re.

...It is written in Orchot Chaim that Rav Natronai wrote of a kohen who married a divorced woman, or any one of the woman invalid to him, and they excommunicated him two or three times, and he has not left her, and he says, I don’t want to be a kohen: We excommunicate him forever until he separates from her and divorces her, as we say (Yevamot 88b) “he is holy against his will”. And in another responsum of the Gaon he required him to separate, and we make an announcement regarding him that other kohanim should separate from him, so that it won’t be casual to them. And they require him to be excommunicated until he spearates from her, and they whip him. And if we suspect that he will go to a different place and perform the spreading his hands [i.e. birkat kohanim], we chop off the ends of his fingers, establishing blemishes in him, so that he can’t spread his hands...

And the Rosh wrote that today we do not write in the deed that it be written in the markets (per the Talmud Baba Batra 40b:) but these words were not written for Halakha for now it seems they contradict each others. In the beginning he wrote "today we do not write in the deed that it be written in the markets" seems to indicate that they did not write this phrase in the deeds. And afterwards close by he wrote that the custom is to write this phrase in all gift deeds. But the language used by the Rosh is not difficult, for it is as if he wrote "today we are not concerned about deeds that don't include the phrase, because the custom is to include the phrase in all gift deeds". And this is what he writes later "today when we are not concerned about deeds that don't include the phrase" meaning we are not concerned that the one giving the gift did not use the phrase when instructing the witnesses, and we do not require him to say this phrase, because the custom is include the phrase in writing in all gift deeds. Thus when he instructs the witnesses it is understood that he wants them to write it properly (which means including the phrase). And this explanation seems better because these are also the words of Tosafot there (Baba Batra 40b): "It is difficult to the Ri that we rule that we are concerned when the phrase is missing, and if so how do we approve of all gifts since the giver never tells the witnesses to write the deed in a public place, but since the custom today is to include in the written deed this phrase (it was written in the market and signed in public) therefore we say that in the verbal instructions he also had the same intentions as those written in the deed. And in the days of the Amoraim they did nit have the custom to include the phrase in writing, therefore the giver had to explicitly say the phrase when instructing the witnesses." However, Rabenu (the Tur) who wrote in the name of the Rosh: "today we do not write in the deed that it be written in the markets" we should not use the second explanation, but the first explanation. And Tosafot further wrote there: "And Rabenu Chanan'el wrote that the giver told the witnesses not to sit in the outside market, and considers this to be the unspecified case, because he did not tell them neither to hide nor to publicize and that is considered unspecified, meaning not to publicize nor hide. But if he just instructs the witnesses to hide (without further details) that is not considered unspecified and is valid according to Rabenu Chanan'el. Therefore the custom to write the phrase in the written gift deeds only improves the deed (but it would be valid without it). However, the word unspecified does not seem to mean this." And this is what Rav Yonah wrote: "If the giver instructs the witnesses to write the gift deed with all embellishments, this includes asking them to include the phrase, but it is better if the witnesses clarify this explicitly with the giver. The Ramban wrote that even though our deeds include many embellishments, they are worthless if they do not include all the rabbinical requirements as explained by Rabenu Tam and Rav Yonah, because the scribes write them properly as we explained, and the giver wants they testify in writing that he is gifting with a full heart, and it appears from his words that this should be widely taught". And these are further words of the Ramban: "The conclusion is that we are concerned about a concealed gift for unspecified deeds. And there are those who say that our deeds given that they are written with all embellishments they write them and publicize them, because the scribes benefit, and we do not agree". And the Ran (Ketubot 78a) wrote: "The Rif wrote in the name of Rav Hai Ga'on that we are not normally concerned with wills that do not include a (publicity) clause. It is an everyday event that we remove assets, for it is a mitzvah at a time of death, through gifts, and transfers are completed, and we are not concerned that they do not include a publicity clause. And he further wrote that a person on his deathbed who says do  not publicize this request until after I die, is not considered a concealed gift, for since it will be carried out after his death, at that time it was not concealed, for he told the witnesses that after he dies it will be revealed, and clearly it will be revealed, for he told them that after his death they should do what is in the will, and there is no need to be concerned with a concealed gift." And we have to deduce that since we conclude to be concerned about a concealed gift, how can Rav Hai Ga'on not be concerned about an unspecified deed.  And the Rif agrees with him! But from the words of the Rosh it seems that he believes that the reasoning of Rav Hai Ga'on is because the custom was to include a written phrase in the gift deeds. As this is what he meant when the Rosh wrote that today we are not concerned about unspecified deeds because there is a custom to include the phrase in all gift deeds. And these are the same words used by Rav Hai Ga'on "today we are not concerned about unspecified deeds". But this is still difficult because Rav Hai Ga'on and the Rif should have explained themselves by giving the reasoning and not be mute. To me it seems that Rav Hai Ga'on and the Rif only said "today we are not concerned about unspecified deeds" when dealing with death related gifts. And this is also the view of the Rambam in Perek 9 of Hilchot Zechiya Umatana Halakha 2: "If he (a person on his deathbed) commands due to death he does not have to say make the gift public. Even though it is written unspecified (without an explicit clause to publicize the gift) we are not concerned that it is a concealed gift." And possibly the reason for this, is that the reason for concealed gifts is that he is not willingly giving  but only to endear himself to the recipient. For a gift due to death we don not have to be concerned about this, for he will be dead, and it makes no difference if the recipient likes him or not. Or also, just like Shimon Shizuri allowed in the case of a person in danger who says to write a divorce for his wife, to write and give the divorce, because of his preoccupation he did not say write and give, here also because of his preoccupation he did not say write it in the market. And that which the Rif wrote in the name of Rav Hai Ga'on: "A person on his deathbed who says not to publicize a wish (to give a gift) until after he dies, the Rosh and the Tur in (Choshen Mishpat) Siman 253 and the Rambam in Perek 9 of Hilchot Zechiya Umatana, specify that it is a valid gift as long as he instructed the gift to be public after his death, if he instructs to hide the gift then it is not. And this is what the Rambam meant when  he wrote in Perek 5, Halacha 1: "If one presents a gift, whether in a state of good health or in illness, it should be open and publicized." The Ran wrote: "Rav Yehuda said that a concealed gift deed is not used in a transaction. Since it says it is not used, and it does not say it is worthless, it means that we don't use it because perhaps he does not mean it, but if the recipient already has the goods, or shows it him and he does not object, the deed is good, because the giver reveals that he did not intend to conceal the gift, but a full intention to give the gift. And this is the ruling of the Rif". and the Nemuke Yosef and the Ramban wrote the same. And I already wrote about this earlier.

One who finds a lost object is only obligated to announce something that has an identifying mark on itself, or when its location is fitting to give as an identifying mark, etc.; or if he gives an identifying mark in its knots or its amount, etc.: It is explained in the chapter [entitled] Elu Metziot (Bava Metzia 21a) that one is not obligated to announce [the finding of] anything that does not have an identifying mark. And this is an obvious thing; for what is the purpose of announcing [it], when there is no identifying mark by which to return it......

And that which he wrote, "But if it does not have an identifying mark in itself or its location, etc.: If it something that can be assumed that its owners noticed very soon [after] it fell from them, etc., it is surely the finders, etc. But if [the object was] not [like this, the finder] is obligated to return it - even though [the owners] abandoned it afterwards - since it came to his hand before [its] abandonment" - I have written at the end of Section 259 the disagreement of Abbaye and Rava about abandonment without awareness, and that the law is decided like Abbaye, who said it is not [considered] abandonment...

And that which he wrote, "One who finds scattered coins, round cakes of figs, etc., they are surely his," is a mishnah there (Bava Metzia 21a). And that which he wrote, "As with all of these, the owners would notice their falling: Coins, a person feels in his purse all the time; so too, are strips of combed purple wool significant" - it is already explained that it is so in the gemara. And that which he wrote, "Round cakes of figs, bread and strings [of fish] are edible items and significant, so he feels for them; unprocessed wool fleeces and flax stalk, one feels when they fall because of their heaviness" - so did the Rosh write there. But one can wonder about him, why did the switch the approach of the gemara? As they said, concerning round cakes of figs and bread, "since they are weighty (<i>yakirei</i>)," he feels them. And it is possible that he, may his memory be blessed, did not understand, "weighty," to be an expression of heaviness, but rather as an expression of significance. And also (another answer) - even if you say that he understood "weighty," to be an expression of heaviness - since there is no heaviness to strings [of fish] and he must give the reason that it is significant because of it being an edible item, that reason is also sufficient for the round cakes of figs; so there is no longer a need for the reason of heaviness. And that which he wrote in the name of the Rambam, "If one finds scattered produce in the manner of being [intentionally] placed, he should not touch them; in the manner of being dropped, they are surely [the finders]," is in Mishneh Torah, Robbery and Lost Property 15:8. And that which he wrote, "And it appears to me, that in the gemara, it establishes the mishnah (Bava Metzia 21a) of one who finds produce [...], it is surely his, in [the case of gathering [grain] on the threshing floor, etc." - his reason is that when Abbaye, who says abandonment without awareness is not [considered] abandonment, is challenged from our mishnah; that if he found scattered produce, they are surely his; it answered, it is in [a case of] gathering on the threshing floor. And if it were like the words of the Rambam, it would have been preferable to establish [the case of the mishnah] as when we find it in the manner of being dropped. And the impressive sage wrote on that which our rabbi wrote, "And it appears to me [it is not clear], etc.," [Rambam's] words are clear and enlightening: As that which we challenge - "What are the circumstances; if he [found them] in the manner of being dropped, even more [would be the finder's], etc. - we also challenge according to Abbaye, whom the law follows. For since they are weighty, [the owner] will certainly know [that he dropped it, and then abandon it], as we say about round cakes of figs. And that which Abbaye is challenged from our mishnah, and we answer that [the mishnah's case] is in the gathering on the threshing floor - is before we knew the reasoning of heaviness. But after we know it, our mishnah is established [to refer] to all cases [even] according to Abbaye. To here are his words. And like his words writes Ramban, may his memory be blessed, on that which the gemara says about that which we learned in the mishnah - scattered produce [...] are his - "And how much? Rabbi Yitzchak said, 'One <i>kav</i> in four cubits.' What are the circumstances? If [the case was in] the manner of being placed, even less [than a <i>kav</i> would require announcement]; if [it was] in the manner of being dropped, even more [than a <i>kav</i> would belong to the finder]. Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said, 'We are dealing with the gathering on the threshing floor.'" And Ramban and Tosafot raise the difficulty for us, why does he establish the mishnah to be [a case of] one <i>kav</i> in four cubits and in the gathering on the threshing floor; let it be in the manner of being dropped and even more. And they answer because of that [position of] Abbaye, who said that abandonment without intention is not [considered] abandonment, it could not establish it to be in the way of being dropped. And the Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote, "And that which our rabbi, may his memory be blessed, brought in the Halakhot (Rif Bava Metzia 12a) - 'If [it was] in the manner of being dropped, even more [than a <i>kav</i> would belong to the finder]' - is not correct according to what we have written (since the law follows Abbaye). And one must say that [the Halakhot of the Rif] holds that after we answer [up other parts of the mishnah according to Abbaye] in the gemara (Bava Metzia 21b), [that] it is on account of their weightiness and their significance, these [sheaves of grain] are also weighty and significant - so Abbaye would not need that [qualification] of Rav Ukva." To here are his words. And so too is it written in Nimmukei Yosef. ...
