In Which Manner One Must Cut the Jugular Veins. At the time of slaughter, all of the blood in the body of the animal is aroused to leave by way of the pipes and the veins in the neck. Therefore, one must puncture the veins at the time of slaughter, or afterward as long (later commentators in the name of the Rashba) as it is in a death-quiver, for then the blood is still hot and leaves by way of the holes in the veins. And if he did not do so then the animal remains "with blood inside" and the blood will not all leave neither through salting nor through roasting, and even if he punctured the veins before roasting or salting, since the blood has already cooled. And the solution is to sever the animal limb from limb, and then it is permitted whether for roasting or for salting and for the pot, for since the animal was cut up so much the blood will leave. And we have the custom to be lenient by birds in removing the head from the body alone, and we consider that as if it is severed limb from limb like an animal. Therefore, today we do not have the practice (later commentators in the name of the Mordechai) to cut or to puncture the veins at the time of slaughter, for we always take the head off of birds (Gemara) and sever limb from limb of animals before we salt or roast them, even for small sheep and goats. 
And it seems to me that if one wishes to roast a bird or an animal whole, or to salt and cook them whole, by way of cutting or puncturing the veins at the time of slaughter, he must therefore puncture all of the veins in the meat of the neck until there does not remain whole even a single one; and then it is permitted even a priori, whether roasting or cooking. And if he did not do so, it seems to me that it would not suffice even to hollow out the veins from the neck with the meat around them after the blood has cooled, since all of the veins (Rashba) in the body pour into the veins of the neck at the time of slaughter, and since there was nowhere for them to leave then, they will not leave except by cutting limb from limb by animals (Mordechai in the name of Rabbeinu Tam) and removing the head by a bird, for then they have a wide space to leave by way of roasting or salting (and see the start of Chapter 65 on what one must take from an animal and a bird even if one cut the veins or severed it limb from limb (and see Chapter 76 paragraph 3).
