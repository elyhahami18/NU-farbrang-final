Kavanah of Aleinu

And one should say [Aleinu LeShabeach]; and he needs to say it standing up (the numerical count of <i>aleinu</i> is the same as, and standing (<i>oumeumad</i>); and he needs to say it with great intention. Moreover, it has several secrets and hints, and it has great power. And some are careful to say it seven times every day, both day and night, seven times in order and seven times backwards, alternating once in order and one backwards. Such that they begin [else, none, below, the earth, upon, etc.] And Yehoshua arranged this great praise when he conquered Yericho. And he said it seven times, in order and backwards; and with that, he brought down the walls of Yericho. So it is able to do any thing or matter, [and to remove] distress and anguish - [though such] should not come and should not happen - when said forwards and backwards. And he hinted to the name, Yehoshua, at the beginning of the ideas [there]. But due to his great humility, he did not hint to his full name, but rather Hoshea; and he did not inscribe it in order, but rather backwards in this way: The <i>ayin</i> of <i>aleinu</i>, the <i>shin</i> of <i>she'lo samenu</i>, the <i>vav</i> of <i>ve'anachnu mistachavim</i>, etc., the <i>hay</i> of <i>hu Eloheinu</i>, etc. And one must intend with it to accept the Kingdom of the Heavens and [God's] unification and divinity. And just like in the verse, Shema Yisrael, there is a large <i>ayin</i> and a large <i>dalet</i> (spelling out, witness), the <i>ayin</i> [at the end of the word], <i>shema</i>, and the <i>dalet</i> [at the end of the word, <i>echad</i>, to hint that it is necessary to testify about His unification, may He blessed and may His name be blessed; so too is it hinted in the praise which begins with an <i>ayin</i> and ends with a <i>dalet</i> (<i>aleinu leshabeach</i>, etc. <i>ein od</i>. And afterwards, he should say (<i>al ken nekaveh Lecha...</i>), which is about the matter of Kingship, to crown our Maker upon ourselves. And it it similar to the praise in Aleinu LeShabeach. And [the word,] witness is hinted in it also, since it begins with an <i>ayin</i> (<i>al ken</i>) and ends with a <i>dalet</i> (<i>oule'olmei Timlokh bekavod</i>). And the beginning of its words hint to Akhan - <i>al ken nekaveh</i>. And it is possible that when [Akhan] justified the judgement upon himself and knew that he had sinned, he then said in his prayer: ["That He will quickly remove the idols from the earth, to turn all the evildoers in the earth towards You."] And the idea is is that He will move the heart of stone from our flesh, since it is what makes us err and stumble from the service of God, may He blessed and may His name be blessed. And there will come a time when they recognize and know God, and the earth will be full with the knowledge of God. Then He shall give us a heart of flesh, so that we not return to the foolishness and stumbling of iniquity. So he took upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of the Heavens before his death. And so Yehoshua told him at that time that all of his iniquities were atoned with [his] death. So he merited life in the world to come, as it is written (Joshua 7:25), "the Lord shall trouble you this day" - this day you are troubled, but you are not troubled for the world to come. Afterwards [one praying] should wait a little before he leaves [the synagogue].
