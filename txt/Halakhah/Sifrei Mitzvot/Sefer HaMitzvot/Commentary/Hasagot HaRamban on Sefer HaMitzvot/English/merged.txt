Hasagot HaRamban on Sefer HaMitzvot

Introduction



I come with my wish to learn from those who have come before, to confirm their rules, and to wear them as adorning jewels; but I shall not be a dumb mule and carry their books like a fool. I shall explicate their methods and assess their worth. But if my thoughts cannot abide them, I shall humbly take issue with them, and judge as my eyes are given to see, with the clear legal vision given to me. I shall not show favoritism to received teaching. For God grants wisdom in all ages and days, and withholds not grace from those who walk in God's ways.

On the counting of Mitzvot



Positive Commandments



Mitzvah 1


... in the words of our Rabbis OBM it is explicit that *he accepts His kingship YT3LH* and *is belief in divinity*, it says in Mechilta "Don't have other gods 3L PNY why because he said I am Hashem your god, parable to a king that enters a land the servents say to him decree for them decrees he says to them not until they accept my kingship will i decree for them decrees because if my kindhsip they don't accept how will they fulfill my decrees, thus says the omnipresent to Israel I am Hashem your god, you accepted my kingship in Egypt, they said as they accepted my kingship so to the will accept my decree have no other. it appears to the baal halachot not to count this in 613.

<b>The rav wrote</b> the fifth mitzvah, that we were commanded with service, as it says "And you shall serve the LORD your God..." (Shemot 23:25), and it says "to serve Them with all your hearts". He (z"l) said: even though this mitzvah is one of the general mitzvot, which is to say, that are not counted, as we explained in Principle 4, there is also a specific piece, and that is the commandment of prayer. The language of the Sifrei: '"and to serve Them" - this is prayer.' And in the mishna of Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yosi haGalili, he said: from where is the principality of prayer among the mitzvot? As it says, "your God fear, and Them serve". And we say: serve in Their Torah, serve in Their Temple? Meaning: to go there to pray, as Shlomo explained. All these are the words of the rav. And he's not correct in this, as the sages already explained in the Gemara that prayer is a rabbinic commandment, like it says in the third chapter of Brachot (21) regarding a <i>ba'al keri</i> who says the Shema and blesses after his meal, that he doesn't pray - and they brought up a reason for this, rather that saying the Shema and blessing of the meal are Biblical and prayer is rabbinic. And in Sukkah 38a, they say regarding prayer, as it says: if he began [to eat before praying] don't stop him [so he can pray], and they gathered this from the lulav, as it says he takes it at his table - therefore he must stop! And they responded, asking what's the problem? This [lulav] is Biblical and this [prayer] is rabbinic! And we already saw in the Laws of Prayer that he said, a person is Biblically obligated in prayer every day, it's just that the number and content of the prayers aren't Biblical. And thus he wrote in this article regarding the tenth mitzvah, that the times of prayer are not Biblical, but the obligation itself is Biblical. And this is also incorrect in my eyes! Since the <i>ba'al keri</i> blesses the blessing of the meal after the meal, since that is Biblical, and does not pray until he immerses, even if he remained many days in his <i>keri</i> status! And further: a person who was rendered unable to pray in the morning, and in the afternoon is unsure whether they prayed or not: if so, according to the words of the rav he would need to go back and pray [again]! And they decided that in every case, every doubt of prayer, that a person does not go back and pray, since it's rabbinic! And if it's not a mitzvah every day, when will this duty be laid upon us? From this reasoning, perhaps once a year? Or once in a person's life?! And it's already been said of Rav Yehuda that he would pray every thirty days, since he was busy with Torah and relied on what they said: friends who are busy with Torah stop to say Shema but don't stop to pray, since that is rabbinic. [In any case, since one can't say that the obligation from this reasoning is only every thirty days] rather, certainly every matter of prayer isn't obligatory at all, rather it's from an attribute of kindness from the Blessed Creator to us, that They hear and answer in all of our calls to Them, and the main thing of the verse "And to serve Them with all your hearts" is a positive commandment that all our service should be towards the Exalted God with all of our hearts - that is to say with intention, willing and whole, to Their Name, and with no evil thoughts. Not that one should do the mitzvot without intention or doubtfully - "perhaps there's a purpose to these" - like the matter of "And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your lives and all your means" - that the mitzvah is to love God with each and every heart, and that we endanger ourselves with love of Them with our lives and our money. And that which is explicated in the Sifrei "and to serve Them - this is Torah study; another explanation - this is prayer" is just a casual link, or to say that out of the generality of Service we should learn Their Torah and we should pray to Them in the time of troubles. And our eyes and heart should be to Them, like the eyes of slaves to the hand of their masters, and this is like the thing that was written: "And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you [הצר הצורר אתכם], then you shall blow an alarm [הרעותם] with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God" (Bamidbar 10:9). And this is a mitzvah regarding trouble [צרה] that comes to the community, to call out before it in prayer and in shouting [תרועה]. And this is a matter that Shlomo, peace be upon him, explained, as it is written "When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain" (II Chronicles 6:26), and it is written: "If there should be dearth in the land, if there should be pestilence, if there should be blight, or mildew, locust, or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever sore or whatever sickness there be: then whatever prayer or whatever supplication shall be made by any man, or by all Thy people Yisra᾽el, (for everyone shall know his own trouble and his own grief,) and he spread out his hands towards this house" (II Chronicles 6:28-9). And we already explained there in the Sifrei, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says: "and to serve him with all your hearts and with all your lives": why did the Torah say? Was it not already said "with all your heart"? There for an individual and here for a community, here for study, here for action. He said that we are commanded to serve God with all our hearts: with the study of Their Torah and with the doing of Their mitzvot. And so too this is repeated there, "Them you will serve" - serve Them in Their Torah, serve Them in Their Temple. Meaning to say that one should serve Them in Their Temple with the service of the sacrifices and the song and the bowing their, in addition to the service of the mitzvot, since the verse says: after the Lord your GOD you should walk and Them you should fear, and Their mitzvot you should keep. And they explain there in the Sifrei: Their mitzvot you should keep, this is the Torah of Moshe. And Their voice you should hark to: the voice of Their prophet. Behold, the performance of all the mitzvot was already said, and for this reason they explained: and Them you should serve, with the service of the Temple. And they said clearly the general rule of the verse: serve Them with Their Torah, serve Them with Their mitzvot - to say that They first commanded to serve Them with Their Torah, meaning, performance of all the mitzvot, from the first part of the verse. And They commanded to serve Them in Their Temple with "and Them you shall serve", since with this it will all be our service, whole, to Them (may They be exalted), and behold those are inclusive commandments. However, since They commanded us with a verse "with all of your hearts" in a new thing, that all our hearts should be unified to Them (may They be exalted) in the performance of the mitzvot, as I explained: therefore that these mitzvot should come in the count of the 248 positive mitzvot. And from this claim to him he didn't count the general/overarching mitzvot, since they were already counted in their details/specifics, and since the doubled mitzvah from the mitzvot twice, three specifically. Rather, one, since they didn't count both of them, since there's only one in generality, but however: if one explains in their doubling and adds something that's count-worthy, they should count. And if, perhaps, there should be in their explaining a principle of prayer from the Torah, it should be counted in the count of the Rav, and it should be said that it is a mitzvah at the time of troubles that are said that They, may They be blessed, may They be exalted, listens to prayer, and They save from trouble with prayer and cries, and understand this.

We were commanded when we besiege a city, to eat from the tree upon its borders all the days of the siege. And if we cut them for no reason in the way of destructiveness, we would transgress a positive commandment, on top of the explicit negative commandment about it. And He, may He be elevated, stated it, "as you may eat from it" - [as] a positive commandment - "but you may not cut it down" - [as] a negative commandment. And it is fitting for [Rambam] to count also this, according to his calculation of the commandments. And you should know that this commandment - in both its positive and its negative [forms] - is when we besiege the city to fight against it, to snatch it. As we were commanded to be concerned about it the way we would be concerned about our own, [since] perhaps we will conquer it. But upon our leaving the land of the enemy, we destroy and wreck every good tree. Likewise during the days of the siege, it is permitted to hurt the people of the city by the destruction of the trees so that they will not live off of them. The Torah only forbade its destruction for no reason...

The second mitzvah [that the Rambam‏ ‏‎“forgot” to include in his Book of‎‏ ‏Mitzvot] is that we have ‎been warned to‏ ‏never forget standing at Har Sinai, and‏ ‏to never remove this event from our‏ ‏consciousness. Rather, our eyes and our‏ ‏hearts should be directed there all of the‏ ‏days. It is as the ‎Exalted One said, “Be‏ ‏careful, and guard your soul greatly, lest you forget the things that your eyes ‎saw‏ ‏and lest they leave your heart all the‏ ‏days of your life. And you shall make‏ ‏them known to ‎your children and their‏ ‏children - the day that you stood before‏ ‏Hashem your G-d at Chorev,‎‏ ‏etc.” ‎‎(Devarim 4:9-10).‎‏ ‏The intent in this [commandment] is of tremendous importance. For if the words ‎of Torah were to come upon us only from the mouth of the prophet, peace be upon him, then ‎even if his prophecy was demonstrated to us to be truthful with signs and with wonders, if at some ‎later point in time a prophet or dreamer would arise and command us to do something which was ‎against the Torah, providing signs and wonders [to support his words], the Torah would be ‎removed by the second [prophet], or [at the very least] an uncertainty could enter our hearts over ‎this issue.‎‏ ‏However, once the explanation of the Torah arrived to our ears from the Mouth of G-d ‎and our eyes saw that there was no intermediary, we will refute any who argue or present doubt ‎and we will demonstrate his falseness. Signs won’t benefit him, nor will any wonder save him from ‎our hands. For we will recognize and testify to his falsehoods and recklessness. This is the meaning ‎of the statement regarding the gathering at Sinai, “And in you [Moshe] they shall always believe.” ‎‎(Shemot 19:9). This is[also] the meaning of the passage, “If a prophet or dreamer shall rise up ‎amongst you etc.” (Devarim 13:2). The master [Rambam] has already explained his in the Book of ‎Knowledge (The Foundations of the Torah, Chapter 8). And this is a critical foundation of the Torah ‎and is the prohibition that comes to us from the verse, “lest you forget the things that your eyes ‎saw.” It is a warning lest they leave your heart, such that you will not don’t convey them to your ‎children and their children through all of the generations.‎

We should be careful to not feel pained by giving tzedaka to the poor, nor should we give stingily, nor think of it as below us. Rather this should be in our eyes a merit, a benefit and an addition to his income, since God, Blessed be He, will compensate us in multiple ways......
