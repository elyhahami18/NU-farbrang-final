Mishneh Torah, Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4




















One who forgot and entered the bathroom while donning tefillin places his hand on them until he finishes discharging the first mass [of feces or urine], at which point he can step out and remove his tefillin. A mass of feces or stream of urine that is held back without having been discharged can place a person in potential danger.
If one forgot that he was donning tefillin and engaged in relations, he may grip neither the strap nor the box until he washes his hands. This is because the hands are active.
