There must be no light behaviour in synagogues and houses of study; no jesting, no mockery or idle talk. One may not eat or drink, indulge in physical recreation or promenade there. One may not enter, during the summer, to seek relief from the heat; or, in the winter, to obtain shelter from the rain. Scholars and their students are permitted to eat and drink in there out of necessity.
