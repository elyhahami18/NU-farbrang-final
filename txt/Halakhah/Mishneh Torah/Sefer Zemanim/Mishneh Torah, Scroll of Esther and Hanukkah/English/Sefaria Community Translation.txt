Mishneh Torah, Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah



Chapter 1



Chapter 2
















And one is obligated to distribute gifts to the poor on Purim. To no less than two poor individuals, one gives to each a gift, or coins, or a cooked dish, or a kind of food. As it is said: "And presents to the poor." (Esther 9:22) -- [This implies] two gifts to two poor individuals. We should not be discriminating in selecting the recipients of these Purim gifts. Rather, one should give to anyone who reaches out their hand. Money given to be distributed on Purim should not be used for other charitable purposes.

Chapter 3


When the Jews overcame their enemies and destroyed them, they entered the Sanctuary; this was on the twenty-fifth of Kislev. They could not find any pure oil in the Sanctuary, with the exception of a single cruse. It contained enough oil to burn for merely one day. They lit the arrangement of candles from it for eight days until they could crush olives and produce pure oil.

Chapter 4












The mitzvah of [kindling] the candle for Chanukkah is very much a beloved mitzvah, and a person must be very careful with it in order to inform [others of] the miracle and to add to the praise of God and gratitude to God for all of the miracles that God did for us. Even if one does not have anything to eat outside of tzedakah [charity], [such] a [poor] person lends or sells their clothing and[, using that money,] acquires oil and candles and kindles [the flames].
