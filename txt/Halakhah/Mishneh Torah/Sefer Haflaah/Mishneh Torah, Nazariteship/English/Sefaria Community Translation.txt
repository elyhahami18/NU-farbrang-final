Mishneh Torah, Nazariteship



Chapter 1



Chapter 2





















Naziriteship is observed only in Eretz Yisrael. If a man took the nazirite vow in the Diaspora, he is fined and compelled to go to Eretz Yisrael to be a nazirite there for the number of days he specified in the nazirite vow. Therefore, a man who pledged to become a nazirite in our days outside of Israel is compelled to go up to Eretz Yisrael and to fulfill the days of his nazirut there until he passes away or the Beit HaMikdash is built and he can sacrifice animals to finish his days as a nazir.
