Mishneh Torah, Offerings for Unintentional Transgressions



Chapter 1

Whenever a person inadvertently violates one of the negative
commandments that involve an action and for which one is
liable for karet, he is obligated to bring a sin-offering. It is a
positive commandment for him to offer a sin-offering for his
inadvertent transgression.
