Mishneh Torah, Ownerless Property and Gifts



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Chapter 5


Therefore all land gift documents in which it is not written that Ploni, the one giving the gift, told us to sit in the markets or streets and write him this gift in an open and publicized manner, or words to that effect, the document is suspect to be a secret gift and the recipient is not entitled to the gift. 

Chapter 6












A woman who wishes to marry and writes to transfer all her assets to her son or someone else, and after she marries and divorces, or her husband dies, her gift is null and void. Because she was trying to hide her assets, and she only wrote the transfer to hide her assets from her husband, so that he would not inherit them from her, and when she needs the assets, they would return them to her. Therefore, if she predeceases her husband, the recipient of the gift acquires it. But if she retains any part of her assets even chattels, her gift stands and even if she later divorces, it does not return to her.

Chapter 7



Chapter 8



Chapter 9


If he commands due to death he does not have to say make the gift public. Even though it is written unspecified (without an explicit clause to publicize the gift) we are not concerned that it is a concealed gift.
