Mishneh Torah, Immersion Pools



Chapter 1



Chapter 2















If two or more hairs are knotted in a single knot, they are not considered to be an intervening substance, because the water can go through them. If one hair is knotted, it is considered an intervening substance if the person is meticulous about it.  If he is not meticulous about it, he can immerse unless most of his hair is tied hair by hair individually. This is the teaching of the Geonim. It appears to me that a person's hair is like his body with regard to immersion and isn't a body of its own so that one could say "most of the hair." Rather, even though all of a person's hair knotted hair by hair, if he is not meticulous regarding it, his immersion is acceptable unless [the hairs] are combined with another intervening substance on his body and they are found [to cover] most of his body, as we have explained. [The same rule applies] equally to a <i>niddah</i> or to other impure [people] who have hair on their heads.
