Mishneh Torah, Vessels



Chapter 1

There are seven kinds of kelim that can acquire impurity by Torah law:  garments, sackcloth, leather vessels, bone vessels, metal vessels, wood vessels, and ceramic vessels.  For it says (Lev. 11:32), " be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack."  And regarding metal vessels, it says (Num. 31:22), "even the gold and the silver."  And regarding ceramic vessels, it says (Lev. 11:33), "if any of those falls into an earthen vessel, everything inside it shall be unclean and [the vessel] itself you shall break."
