1. Extra stringencies were instituted with regard to the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer. A person who was pure - even if he immersed himself in a mikveh for the sake of sacrificial service and stood and served on the altar - is not pure with regard to the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer, nor with regard to the burning of the red heifer, drawing its water, sanctifying it, or sprinkling it unless he immerses himself for the sake of the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer. Afterwards, he is considered pure for that purpose. Similarly, keilim - even a receptacle taken from the Temple Courtyard - are not considered as pure with regard to the purification process involving the ashes of the red heifer unless they were immersed for that purpose. Similarly, all foods and liquids - even if they are pure - are considered as impure in this context.
