Mishneh Torah, Testimony



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Chapter 5

No verdict is determined on the testimony of a single witness, whether in civil or capital cases, as it is written: "A single witness shall not take the stand against a man in regard to any crime or any offense" (19:15). [However,] it has been traditionally inferred that the testimony of one witness subjects him to taking an oath, as we've explained in Laws of Plaintiff.

If they were refuted after the execution of the person against whom they had testified, they are not put to death through an [<i>a fortiori</i>] inference. As it is written: "You shall do to him as he schemed to do" (Deuteronomy 19:19), but has not yet done. This interpretation is based on tradition. However, if the accused against whom they had testified was lashed, they are lashed. So too, if by the evidence submitted by them, money was handed over from the defendant to the plaintiff, it is returned to the defendant and they make restitution to him.
