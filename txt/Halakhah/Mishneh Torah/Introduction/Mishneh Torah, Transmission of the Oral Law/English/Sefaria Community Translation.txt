Mishneh Torah, Transmission of the Oral Law




































"All the sages who emerged after the compilation of the Talmud and delved into it, whose wisdom made their names known — they are called Geonim. And all these Geonim who arose in the Land of Israel, in the Land of Shinar, in Spain, and in France studied the method of the Talmud, revealed its secrets, and explained its themes, for its path is extremely deep. Moreover, it is written in Aramaic, mixed with other languages, because this was the language understood by all in Shinar at the time when the Talmud was compiled; but in other places, and also in Shinar in the days of the Geonim, no one knew this language unless they were taught.
Many questions are asked by the people of each city to every Gaon in their day, so that he may explain to them the difficult matters of the Talmud, and they respond according to their wisdom; and those who ask gather the answers and make books out of them for understanding.
Also, the Geonim of each generation compiled works to explain the Talmud: some interpreted individual halachot, others explained specific chapters that were difficult in their days, and still others commented on entire tractates and orders.
They also compiled fixed halachot on what is prohibited and permitted, what is obligatory and exempted, on matters that the need of the time required, so that those who cannot delve into the depth of the Talmud could have an accessible understanding. And this is the sacred work that all the Geonim of Israel have carried out, from the time the Talmud was compiled until this moment, which is the eighth year after the thousand and hundred years since the destruction [of the Temple].
In this time, the difficulties have multiplied, and circumstances have pressed everyone, and the wisdom of our sages has been lost, and the understanding of our wise ones has been hidden. Therefore, those interpretations, responses, and halachot compiled by the Geonim, which were once considered clarified, have become obscure in our days, and only a few can properly understand them. And it is not necessary to mention the Talmud itself: the Babylonian Talmud, the Yerushalmi, the Sifra, the Sifrei, and the Tosefta, which require a broad mind, a wise spirit, and a long time, and only then can one discern from them the correct path in matters of prohibitions, permissions, and other judgments of the Torah.
And for this reason, I arose and took the initiative, I, Moshe, the son of Rabbi Maimon, the Sephardi, relying on the Rock, blessed be He, and I studied deeply all these books; and I decided to compile in a clear manner the topics that are elucidated in all these writings, concerning what is prohibited and permitted, impure and pure, together with the other laws of the Torah: all in clear language and concise form, so that the entire Oral Torah may be ordered in the mouth of all — without difficulties and without contradictions, without one saying one thing and another saying something else, but rather clear, accessible, and correct matters, according to the judgment clarified in all these writings and explanations, from the days of our Rabeinu HaKadosh until the present.
Until all judgments are clear for both the small and the great, regarding each commandment and the law of each thing that the sages and prophets instituted. In summary, so that no one will need another book in the world on the laws of the people of Israel; rather, this compendium will gather the entire Oral Torah, with the decrees, customs, and ordinances instituted from the days of Moshe Rabbeinu until the compilation of the Talmud, and as the Geonim explained in all their writings produced after the Talmud. Therefore, I gave this compendium the name "Mishneh Torah" (Repetition of the Torah) — because one first reads the Written Torah, and then reads this compendium, from which they will know all the Oral Torah, and will not need to read any other book between them.
And I decided to divide this compendium into distinct laws, addressing each topic in a specific manner. I will divide the laws into chapters within each topic, and each chapter will be subdivided into small laws, so that they are organized in a clear and accessible way for memorization.
These laws, which address different topics, can be divided into two main types: some are specific to a single mitzvah, while others encompass several mitzvot within the same theme. The division of the compendium is not made based on the number of mitzvot, but rather by the topics addressed, in order to provide a clearer and more organized understanding for the reader.
The total number of mitzvot observed throughout the generations is 613. Of these, 248 are mitzvot "do" (positive actions), which correspond to the number of parts of the human body, while 365 are mitzvot "do not do" (negative actions), which correspond to the number of days in the solar year. These numbers have symbolic meanings and reflect a correspondence between the Torah and human nature, as well as the annual cycle."
