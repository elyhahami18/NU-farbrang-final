And that which he wrote, "all of these are [cases of] doubt" is an inquiry that is not resolved there (Bava Metzia 21a).
And that which he wrote, "or the kav was of two or three types such as dates, sesame [and pomegranates]" - according to our textual variant, the intention is to one of these three. And it was inquired of them there, do we say that since sesame seeds are significant, [the owner] would exert himself and gather them; and dates and pomegranates, since there is no exertion with them - as they are large - he would gather them; or maybe it is no different. And that is the rule for all that is similar to this. This is explained in our textual variants.
