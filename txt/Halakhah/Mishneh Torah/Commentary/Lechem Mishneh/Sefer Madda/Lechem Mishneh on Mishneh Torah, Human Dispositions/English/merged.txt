Lechem Mishneh on Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions



Chapter 1



Halakhah 1



Halakhah 2



Halakhah 3



Halakhah 4



Halakhah 5

...I would explain that the initial extreme is when the attribute is lacking and the final extreme is when there is an excess. For example, a person who is completely stingy so that he does not give a cent - this is the initial extreme whereas one who lavishly distributes his money is the final extreme. Now in this case the final extreme is more praiseworthy than the initial extreme. However, sometimes the initial extreme is better than the final extreme, for example one who seeks sex at all time - this is the final extreme and is worse than one who never seeks it such that even when it is requires he refrains - this is the initial extreme and is more praiseworthy than the final extreme….Maimonides never means that a the final extreme can be more praiseworthy than the middle position for certainly the middle position is perfect and certainly even the final extreme of humility where one wears torn clothing is worse and the middle position is the best one - and this is why Mainomides writes earlier...However, his intention is that the pious incline toward the final position of humility for this way they will never fall away (in the wrong direction) from the middle position which is the best path - for if they aimes to always follow the middle position it is possible that they will veer from it to the initial position which is haughtiness....
