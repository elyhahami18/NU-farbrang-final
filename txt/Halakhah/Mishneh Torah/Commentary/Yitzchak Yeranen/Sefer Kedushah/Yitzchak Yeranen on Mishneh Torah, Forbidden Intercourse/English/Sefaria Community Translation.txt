<b>Daughters of Israel do not go out, etc. A married woman as well as, etc.</b> And so too did our master [R. Yosef Karo] write in his short book [Shulchan Arukh], Even HaEzer 21. And Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim 75, queried that our teacher is contradicting himself, since he wrote there, "but virgin women whose way it is to walk bare-headed are permitted." Moreover, it is found in Ketuvot (15b:12), "if a [betrothed woman] went out [of her father’s house to her wedding] with a <i>hinnuma</i> [curtained couch] or with her hair uncovered, it is assumed that she was a virgin." And see what he answered there. But his words are puzzling. For one, that which he wrote that "bare-headed" [<i>para</i>] in Even HaEzer is braided hair and supported it from that which is written by Rashi on the Torah, Parashat Nasso: Yet, in his rush, he did not look carefully at Rashi's phrasing there. As it is not from the word, "bared," that he deduces that the meaning of bared is revealed, and as Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi wrote there, see there. Yet [the author of Magen Avraham] forced the thing, like a mirror of cast iron [alluding to Job 37:18]. Moreover, if it were like his words, what is the difference between "bared" in Even HaEzer, the meaning of which is braided hair, and "bare-headed," here, which is an uncovered head? And does the rabbi use the same word for two meanings? Rather, it is all the same, and the query returns to its place [since the answer offered has just been refuted]. And based on this query, Beit Shmuel wrote that the single women in Even HaEzer are divorcees or widows. However, for ordinary me, there is no need for all this and there is no query at all. As that which [Rambam] wrote, and also our master in Even HaEzer, is when they walk in the marketplace, and as he wrote explicitly. And even though it is permitted, this thing in the marketplace is nevertheless a disgrace and is licentiousness. So they forbade it due to this. However it is fine for virgins to walk around bare-headed at home or in the courtyard. And then I saw in Knesset HaGedolah on the section mentioned above in Even HaEzer in the name of a certain sage like I wrote, meaning it is only in the marketplace, and this is cited in Beer Sheva. Yet he disagreed with him, in that he distinguished between the house and the courtyard. Nevertheless, in the house, it is permitted. And then I saw in Bach, that this distinction [between the home and the marketplace] does not appear correct to him because of that [Talmudic passage], "she went out with a <i>hinnuma</i> or with her hair uncovered." However, in my humble opinion, this is not difficult at all. Since there, they would lead her out this way, bare-headed, at the outset, in order that they remember this and have it as testimony should the need arise
