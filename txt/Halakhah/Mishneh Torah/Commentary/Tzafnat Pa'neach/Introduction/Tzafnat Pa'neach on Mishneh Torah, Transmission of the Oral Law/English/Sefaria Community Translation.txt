Tzafnat Pa'neach on Mishneh Torah, Transmission of the Oral Law



Paragraph 1

The Torah is the written Torah, and the commandment is its meaning. Refer to Berakhot 5a, where the commandment refers to the Mishnah, and the instructions are the Gemara, as mentioned there. And consult Megillah 19b. However, this depends on a dispute in the tractate Keritot 13b regarding the state of drunkenness, whether the Gemara is called instruction. Also refer to the dispute between Abaye and Rava in the tractate Horayot 2b about whether the instruction applies only to those who learn and understand, or if it also applies to mere understanding. [See the omission in Sanhedrin 86b, where it is mentioned that a disciple is not considered a "senior rebel," according to Rabenu’s commentary on the laws of "rebels," which requires approval, and in the case of "teaching others," see Kiddushin 49b, where a disciple is treated differently]. And note in Horayot 7b, where it is discussed whether a student requires formal acceptance from a friend. Also, note the discussion in Baba Batra 4a and Horayot 7b, where it is debated whether, if he is not considered "important," his instruction is still valid for himself. Additionally, see the issue in Bekhorot 30b about whether the Talmid Chacham (wise scholar) requires formal acceptance from a friend. That is, whether he can be considered an instructor or not, as mentioned in Sanhedrin 66b. Also, in Horayot 3a, it is mentioned whether he can be considered as an instructor to others or not. And observe the difference of opinion between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbanan in the tractate Mechilta 3a regarding the instructions given to the house. Also refer to Tosefta 1, which states that this is null, and also the phrase "the soul that does," as mentioned in the Mishnah Baba Mezi’a 33b regarding the error in the study of the Torah. And see Rabenu's commentary in Hilchot Shgagot (Laws of Errors), chapter 13, where it is mentioned that he agrees with Abaye’s view on this topic. However, in Hilchot Shgagot 9:14, he does not state the same, only when clearly expressed. And consult what is mentioned in Hilchot Avodah Zarah regarding the instructions of a drunken person. Indeed, this depends on a known dispute about whether exegesis (interpretation) or law is more important, as discussed by Rambam in the book Sefer HaMitzvot and in his Perushim on the laws of utensils, chapter 17, and also regarding baths, as mentioned in the commentaries of Rambam and others. And observe the differences between Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Elazar in the tractate Gittin 60b regarding whether the majority should be written or spoken. Refer to Kiddushin 37a, where these laws are discussed. Also, consult the commentary on the Yerushalmi 1, regarding what Rabbi Meir and the Rabbanan say on this subject.

Paragraph 2

"**There, the entire Torah was written by Moses, etc.** This implies that it follows the opinion of Rashi in Gittin, page 6."
"**And He gave the book to each tribe, etc.** See the Rosh, Perek Arvei Pesachim, and Tosfot, Menachot, page 30."

Paragraph 3



Paragraph 4

"**There, Eleazar and Pinchas, etc.** See Temurah, page 16a, Eruvin, page 63, Gittin, page 59, and see Nazir, page 56, which also counts Caleb, see there. And it is also difficult because he did not count Otniel ben Kenaz, see in the Gemara of Yoma, page 81b, in the Batei Din of Ya'bez, and in those mentioned in Temurah, page 16a."

Paragraph 5



Paragraph 6

"**Ezra and his court.** See Megilah, page 16b."

Paragraph 7

"**Payment of one hundred and twenty, etc.** See Megilah, page 18a."
