An Israelite who killed a resident alien etc. In Mekhilta [it expounds Exodus 21:14] '"And if a man be deliberate against his neighbor" - "his neighbour" to exclude (his killing) others'. And this implies to our teacher (Maimonides) that a resident alien is included in the category of 'others', like he is regarding exile as he will explain. (The Mekhilta continues:) 'Issi ben Akiva says: "Before the giving of the Torah, we were exhorted against the spilling of blood (of gentiles). After the giving of the Torah, instead of being more stringent, shall we be more lenient? In truth, they said: He (one who kills a gentile) is exempt from the laws of flesh and blood, but his judgment is relegated to Heaven.' And this is (the meaning of) that which our teacher wrote:
"he is not to be executed by the court", that is to say "but he is liable in the laws of heaven".
