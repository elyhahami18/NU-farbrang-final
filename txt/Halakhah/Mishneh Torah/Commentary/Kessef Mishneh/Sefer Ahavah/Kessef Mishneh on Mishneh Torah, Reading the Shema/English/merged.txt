If there is a doubt one has said Shema... – In the chapter of Berakhot "One who dies" (3rd chapter), Rav Yehudah said that Shemuel said: If there is a doubt that one did or did not say Kriat Shema, one does not go back and say it again.  What is the reason?  Kriat Shemah is d'rabbanan!  And Rabbi Elazar said: If there is a doubt as to whether or not one did or did not say Kriat Shema, one should return and say it.  And the Rif and the Rosh write – the halakhah is not like Shemuel, who says, Kriat Shema is d'Rabbanan, as we said before that Kriat Shemah is d'Orayita.
