Chapter 1



Halakhah 1

The Great Court in Jerusalem is the essence of the Oral Torah, etc.:

Halakhah 2



Halakhah 3



Halakhah 4

When the Great Court was in existence, etc., until one prohibits and another permits. A Baraita in Sanhedrin, chapter "Those Who Are Strangled" (Sanhedrin 88b): It is taught, Rabbi Yose said: Initially, there were not many disputes in Israel, etc., until the Torah became like two Torahs. The reason our teacher (Rambam) did not write that they should go to the court nearest to their city, as mentioned in the aforementioned Baraita, is because, since we are seeking a court to inform them of the truth, it is implicitly understood that they will go to the court nearest to their city before going up to Jerusalem. Alternatively, this was not in our teacher's version, which seems more likely.

Halakhah 5

Two sages, etc. In the first chapter of Avodah Zarah (page 7a), it is taught: If there are two [sages], one declaring something impure and the other pure, one prohibiting and the other permitting, if one of them is greater in wisdom and in number, follow him. If not, follow the stricter opinion. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha says: In matters of Torah law, follow the stricter opinion; in matters of Rabbinic law, follow the more lenient opinion. Rav Yosef said the halacha is according to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha. Since the first Tanna differentiates between someone greater in wisdom and number and someone who is not, it implies that according to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha, even if one is greater in wisdom and number, in matters of Torah law, follow the stricter opinion, etc. Therefore, our teacher (Rambam) ruled in a general manner and did not differentiate....
What our teacher wrote about not in the time of the Sanhedrin means that if it were in the time of the Sanhedrin, we would not need this because, in any case, the law would be clarified, as mentioned above nearby.

Chapter 2



Halakhah 1

The Great Court that interprets, etc. Our teacher (Rambam) learned this from what we find with later Tannaim who dispute earlier Tannaim, and similarly with later Amoraim who dispute earlier Amoraim. And what is stated in the first chapter of Eduyot (Mishnah 1:5) that if a court sees the reasoning of an individual and relies on it, that one court cannot annul the words of another court unless it is greater than it in wisdom and in number, our teacher (Rambam) interprets this as referring to when that individual and those many argued about a decree or an ordinance. Meaning, if a court ruled according to the view of the individual, another court cannot dispute and rule according to the view of the many unless it is greater, etc., as will be explained nearby. But if they argued about one expounding one of the rules of interpretation and the other another, indeed, it can annul his words even if it is not as great in wisdom and number. And if you say, if so, why do Amoraim not dispute Tannaim, for indeed in every place we challenge an Amora from a Mishnah or Baraita, and it is answered, "I say like this Tanna," and if he does not say so, it is difficult for him. And according to our teacher (Rambam), the permission is given to them to dispute the words of the Tannaim. It is possible to say that from the time of the sealing of the Mishnah, it was established and accepted that later generations would not dispute earlier ones. Similarly, they did so at the sealing of the Gemara, that from the time it was sealed, no one was given permission to dispute it.
As it is stated, "To the judge who will be in those days, etc." In Rosh Hashanah, at the end of Chapter 2 (page 25a), they said: "He should act like Samuel in his generation." And there they bring the verse, "To the priests, the Levites, and the judge who will be in those days." And if you consider that a person goes to a judge who was not in his days, well, you should only go to a judge who will be in your days.

Halakhah 2

The court that decreed a decree or enacted a regulation, etc. It seems that our teacher (Rambam) explains as follows: Regarding what we learned in the first chapter of Eduyot, that one court cannot annul the words of another court unless it is greater than it in wisdom and in number—this applies when they disagreed on a decree or regulation. If the earlier court decreed or enacted something in a certain way, and a later court saw fit to enact something else regarding a different matter, they cannot annul the words of the earlier court unless they are greater in wisdom and in number. However, regarding matters where a court saw fit to decree and prohibit actions as a protective measure, if the prohibition became widespread among all Israel, another Great Court cannot annul it, even if it were greater than the earlier court. You might ask: Didn't we say in Gittin, in the chapter of Shulchan (Gittin 36a), regarding Hillel's institution of the prozbul, that Shmuel said, "If my power is greater than Hillel's, I would abolish it"? And we also say there that if Hillel instituted the prozbul universally, we do not have the authority to annul it, implying that a court cannot annul the words of another court, etc., which implies that one greater in wisdom and in number can annul them. There are those who say that the prozbul is not a fence lest people violate the Torah's words. On the contrary, it is a Torah law to release debts, and Hillel annulled the money and instituted that it should not be released. Although we say there that he instituted the prozbul because he saw that people were refraining from lending to each other and thus violating what is written in the Torah "beware lest there be a thought of wickedness in your heart," it is not an outright prohibition. They were acting as servants when they refrained from lending, for it is a negative commandment to lend and not to borrow. The main reason for the institution of the prozbul was not as a fence for the Torah, but rather for the benefit of the poor, so that the doors would not be closed in their face, and for the benefit of the rich so that they would not incur loss. This is also explained there regarding the inquiry into what is prozbul, as Rav Chisda said: "proz buli and buti," meaning the rich and the poor. Why did Rav Chisda explain it thus? Because we read prozbul, which means the institution for the rich, so that they do not transgress the Torah. And from where do we derive that it is also an institution for the poor? It is not a fence for the Torah but a correction for the rich so that they do not incur loss and a correction for the poor so that the doors are not closed in their face, as I have written. Similarly, at the beginning of Megillah, we say that the men of the Great Assembly instituted it, and they uprooted the institution that the men of the Great Assembly had instituted. There a court cannot annul the words of another court unless it is greater, etc. There it is certainly not a fence for the Torah. Therefore, if there are those greater than them in wisdom and number, they can uproot their institution. However, it is difficult from your question in Avodah Zarah, Chapter Ein Ma'amidin (Avodah Zarah 37), where we say that Rabbi Yehudah Nesiah permitted the oil of non-Jews, how can we reconcile this with the principle that a court cannot annul the words of another court, etc.? Certainly, the decree regarding oil is due to a protective measure, as we say in Shabbat, Chapter 1 (Shabbat 17), that they decreed against their oil because of their wine. So how can we explain this according to what we learned that a court cannot annul unless it is greater, etc., which implies that if it were greater, it could annul? And behold, Rabbeinu wrote shortly thereafter that in matters that are a protective measure, even a greater court cannot annul them. Therefore, some say that the question is how could they annul the institution of the earlier authorities, meaning even if there was a court later that could annul them, such as if there was no protective measure or fence, it would not be able to annul it because a court cannot, etc. And the words of the Ra'avad, "Not even Elijah and a court," etc., will be explained later.
The explanation of his words that we say in the first chapter of Beitza (page 5) that the sages instituted that one who walks a full day's journey should not redeem fourth-year fruits (neta reva'i) but should bring them up to Jerusalem and eat them there. It explains there the reason: in order to adorn the markets of Jerusalem with fruits. And we also say there that Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai was included among them and permitted that the fruits should not be brought up to Jerusalem but should be redeemed and eaten in their place, because after the destruction of the Temple, why should we adorn the markets of Jerusalem for the sake of non-Jews. Nevertheless, the Ra'avad's question is difficult for me to recognize. Sh'ribaz said to him that he was not as great as the earlier authorities. And if you ask, since we say in the chapter of "Yesh Nochalim" (Baba Batra, page 134) and similarly in Sukkah (page 28) in the chapter "Talmidim," "Hillel had a great student, Jonathan ben Uziel, the least among them was R' Yochanan ben Zakkai," perhaps it means the least in wisdom of the Torah, but in other wisdoms they were greater than him. You should know that what is said there is that he did not leave out the governments of laundresses, the fox's discussions, and discussions of angels, the work of the chariot. And in those wisdoms it is possible that they were greater than him, but not in the wisdom of the Torah. And proof for this can be found in the fact that they appointed a president and head of the academy in place of Hillel. Now, if he was the smallest among the disciples, how would they appoint him, and why would they not appoint one of the greater ones? Surely, in the wisdom of Torah, he was as great as them, and it is possible that he was greater than them. Furthermore, even if we were to say that he was also smaller than them in the wisdom of Torah, it is still possible that he was greater than them in the enactment that was made. And do not be troubled in your mind about how later authorities could be greater than the earlier ones, for we find a great example in Rabba, who was greater than Rav Yehuda, as we say (Ta'anit 24a, see also Berakhot 20b): "Rav Yehuda, when he would arrive at a woman who is squeezing herbs, he would say, 'Be mindful of the perspective of Rav and Shmuel.'" Here, we learn that we had here the greatness of Rabba over Rav Yehuda. And what we say in the first chapter of Beitza (page 4a), "And now that we know the fixed calculation of the month, why do we observe two days?" It is because they sent a message from there, "Be cautious in the custom of your fathers that is in your hands, at times when the decrees of the kingdom are enacted, lest confusion arise." It is evident that the Beit Din during the time of the Amoraim was not greater than the authorities who established two days. Consequently, even though it was not greater than them, once they nullified the reason, they could annul it. Thus, it can be said that the matter there is that since they were well-versed in the established practice of the month, why did they observe two days? The Sages at that time could have established two days to fix it so that we would not do two days. Alternatively, it was established by those who were fixing it. They explicitly said that if the time comes when they will stand on the calculation and not on the sight, we will not observe two days. According to the opinion of the Ra'avad, it is clear that it is not enough for the Gemara to be questioned upon it, as we say in the first chapter of Beitza (page 4a), "The Beit Din cannot annul the words of the Beit Din of their friend, etc." To resolve this, it means in a matter where the reason was not annulled. However, where the reason was annulled, even one not as great as them could annul it.
"Even if the reason has been nullified, etc." In the first chapter of Beitza (page 5a), we say that something prohibited by a majority, even if the reason has been nullified, requires another majority to permit it. From this, it implies according to our Rabbi [likely referring to Rabbeinu Tam] that it must be a majority greater than them. Similarly, we require that the person be wiser than them, and we took one type [of person] from among them.

Halakhah 3

In what context are these matters stated regarding things that were not prohibited by them, etc.? It seems to me that Rabbeinu learned this way, as we say in Avodah Zarah, chapter Eim Ma'amidin (page 36), 'In every court, they can annul the words of another court, except for one, which is a matter that even if Elijah were to come with his court, his words would not be heeded.' According to Rabbeinu [likely referring to Rabbeinu Tam], this implies that in every enactment of a court, another court can annul its words, except for matters like these, which are prohibitions that were established as a safeguard to the Torah. For example, the prohibition of yedi'ah (knowledge) regarding produce, and similar enactments. In the first chapter of Beitza, regarding an egg laid on Rosh Hashanah, which is prohibited on the second day, there is no safeguard to prohibit on the second day of Rosh Hashanah more than the two days of other festivals. Concerning the case of 'adorning the streets of Jerusalem with fruits,' certainly there is no safeguard there either. Similarly, in the case of 'prozbul,' where Shmuel said, 'If my strength permits (it), I will annul it,' there is no safeguard to the Torah, as I have proven above....
And regarding what Rabbeinu wrote, 'If its prohibition is widespread among all of Israel,' so they said there in Avodah Zarah, chapter Eim Ma'amidin: 'In every court, they can annul the words of another court, except for one matter.' Rav Mesharshiya said, 'What is the reason? Since its prohibition has spread among the majority of Israel.' Rabbeinu wrote 'among all of Israel' based on what most agree, 'its majority is like its entirety.' And since this opinion is plausible, the Raavad has no authority to reject it due to his opinion that does not differentiate between enactments that are safeguards and those that are not safeguards. The entire reasoning depends on whether its prohibition has spread or not, and therefore, he wrote above, 'Even if Elijah and his court since its prohibition is widespread among all of Israel,' as stated in Avodah Zarah, etc. I have already clarified that point according to Rabbeinu.

Halakhah 4

And a court has the authority to uproot, etc." This is straightforward in itself and did not need to be written, except to say that the sages did not strengthen their words more than those of the Torah, even though it seems so from here, it comes to teach us that they did not....
And what is said that even the words of the Torah, every court has the authority to uproot it. So it is taught in Sanhedrin, in the chapter 'Nigmar HaDin' (Sanhedrin 46a): 'Rabbi Abba said, I heard that a court administers lashes and punishments not prescribed by law, not to transgress the Torah, meaning, to establish halacha thus, but to create a fence around the Torah, meaning, temporarily.' This has already been explained in the words of our Rabbi in Tractate Sanhedrin, Chapter 24.

Halakhah 5

A court that sees fit to enact a decree... In the tractate Avodah Zarah, page 37, our Rabbis relied on the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer ben Rabbi Tzadok, who used to say: 'We do not enact a decree upon the community unless the majority of the community is capable of abiding by it.'

Halakhah 6

Behold, if a court decreed a decree and they reconsidered... It seems to me that this is learned from what we say in Avodah Zarah, page 35, where it relates that Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua: 'Why did they forbid the cheese of Gentiles?' Ulla said, 'Because when they decreed a decree in the West (Babylonia), they did not reveal its reason until thirteen years later. Perhaps there was someone who did not agree with it and came to treat it with disrespect. If it is found that the court can enforce it and it spreads, what do we care if someone treats it with disrespect? The court can compel compliance. But it implies that if they doubt it and it does not spread, they are not authorized to compel the people to follow it. Moreover, it is a fortiori argument from the law that our Rabbi wrote shortly after, 'They decreed and they reconsidered...' that if even after several years a smaller court than them can annul it, certainly they themselves cannot compel the people to follow it.

Halakhah 7

They decreed and reconsidered, and it spread..." In Avodah Zarah, page 37, we discuss Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, how he permitted the oil of Gentiles. He was not as great as the disciples of Shammai and Hillel who forbade it. Additionally, it is a matter (issue) that even Elijah and his court cannot annul. We return [to the original discussion]: that the oil did not spread to most of Israel because Rabbi Shmuel bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, 'Our Rabbis sat and deliberated whether the oil should be forbidden to most of Israel.' Our Rabbis relied on the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Tzadok who said, 'We do not decree an edict on the community unless the majority of the community can abide by it.'  According to the opinion of our Rabbi, since they found that the prohibition did not spread to most of Israel, they decided to permit it. For indeed, we find that they do not decree an edict on the community unless the majority of the community can abide by it. Therefore, even if they had decreed, it would not have been a decree, as explicitly stated by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi who was not as great as the earlier authorities. Furthermore, it was a matter that serves as a safeguard to the Torah, as we say in Shabbat, chapter 3, where they decreed against oil due to its use for anointing purposes, yet they permitted it because its prohibition did not spread to all of Israel. One might ask, how did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rely on what he checked? Perhaps, in the days of the early authorities, it spread and later they questioned it. From this, it would seem logical to say that even if it initially spread, since nowadays most of Israel does not practice it, they permit it. However, I have seen that Rambam wrote that it has not yet spread, and their majority did not maintain the decree to observe it as forbidden. This is implied by his wording that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi checked from the day the decree was enacted until today, and he found that at no time did its prohibition spread throughout all of Israel.

Halakhah 8

"And any court that permitted..." There, in Avodah Zarah, page 37, they said: "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi permitted two things, and they told him to also permit bread, but he did not want to. If so, we have a precedent from the court that teaches us, as we learned at the end of Eduyot, page 48, that Yosei ben Yo'ezer testified regarding three matters to permit them, and they called him 'Yosei the permitter'.

Halakhah 9

"Since there is authority to decree..." The Ra'avad wrote: "All these, let the spirit carry away..." I say, it seems that the Ra'avad means that anything they decreed upon and prohibited, etc. But does Rabbeinu say this? Because regarding chicken cooked with milk, which Rabbeinu brought as an analogy, it is certainly forever prohibited. Even at the beginning of his statements, he wrote similarly in explanation, that since there is authority for the court to decree and prohibit something permissible, its prohibition will endure for generations. If he bases his reasoning on what he said and relies on it from the Scriptures, etc. However, Rabbeinu does not say it is prohibited outright, except when they say it is directly from the Torah itself. But when they say it is merely a scriptural derivation, they say it is not from the Torah itself, and that particular verse does not indicate it but rather it is a general scriptural derivation. And regarding "if he diminishes due to temporal necessity," etc., Rabbeinu already wrote in this chapter that if they see fit to annul a positive commandment or transgress a prohibition to bring the masses back to the religion, etc., they act according to the needs of the hour. And regarding "you will not find an additional prohibition," etc., it seems this is the essence of his reasoning, and I do not know the reason for his opinion. And if one says that chicken cooked with milk is prohibited from the Torah because the Torah prohibited a specific type of meat, and similarly for anything called meat, it is considered an additional prohibition, for sure it would be called additional.

Regarding what Rabbeinu said here, based on hearsay, they learned that what the Torah prohibited, etc., applies equally to the meat of domesticated animals and wild animals. This is difficult from what Rabbeinu said in Chapter 9 of the Laws of Forbidden Foods, that the prohibition of eating the meat of wild animals is only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. One can argue that there he meant the essence of the matter, ruling according to Rabbi Akiva's opinion. Nevertheless, since we see in the Talmud (Chullin 116b) that Levi came to the house of Yosef Rishba and said he heard from Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, and I thought perhaps he interpreted it according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda of Galilee. From now on, when the court will stand and say that the meat of wild animals is permitted according to the Torah, except that we prohibit it due to a fence, it is already possible that it diminishes if it is in a place where they follow the custom of Rabbi Yehuda of Galilee. To take an example that fits the case of whether it applies to diminishing or adding, he brought up this matter and did not fear that it would lead to confusion regarding the law, since in its place, he ruled according to Rabbi Akiva that the prohibition of eating wild animals is not from the Torah.

Chapter 3



Halakhah 1

"Someone who does not acknowledge the Oral Torah, etc." This is the opinion of our Rabbi (Rabbeinu), and similarly it is explained in the Mishnah in Sanhedrin, Chapter Hanachakim.

Halakhah 2

"And we do not elevate him, and he is like any other, etc." In a Baraita in the tractate Avodah Zarah, page 26, it discusses Epicureans, apostates, and those who pervert to idolatry—concerning them, we bring them down and do not elevate them. This means we do not rescue those who fall into the pit of apostasy, where they deliver the permitted (things) and consume the forbidden. However, out of necessity to save life, it is permitted, but it is prohibited to support their actions. This is stated similarly by our Rabbi in Chapter Four of the Laws of Murder and Preservation of Life. Regarding the statement "and we do not elevate him," the Gemara posed a challenge: now we are engaged in a matter that requires resolution. It was resolved that if there was a ladder in the pit, one should remove it, and if he says, "I want it for my sister," one should respond firmly. Further resolutions were offered in subtle ways, as stated there.

Halakhah 3

"In what case are these matters said regarding a person who denies the Oral Torah, etc." This is the opinion of our Rabbi (Rambam), and similarly stated in the explanation of the Mishnah in Chapter 1 of Chullin.

Halakhah 4

"But an apostate elder mentioned in the Torah is a sage among the sages, etc." This is explicitly stated in Sanhedrin, Chapter Hanechnakin (Sanhedrin 47a), as will be explained shortly.
"And what is meant by 'he has received tradition' and judges"? This refers to one who has received tradition and says, "Thus have I received it," or one who judges according to one of the methods by which the Torah is expounded.
"And what is meant by 'he confesses and has a share in the World to Come'?" In Chapter Negaim (Sanhedrin 43a), we learned that anyone sentenced to death is told to confess, because anyone who confesses has a share in the World to Come. Our Rabbi (Rambam) wrote concerning the apostate elder that if he confesses, he has a share in the World to Come, unlike one who does not acknowledge the Oral Torah, for such a person does not have a share in the World to Come.
Even though he judges and they judge, he receives and they receive, etc." There in Sanhedrin (page 88a), Rav Kahana said, "He is not executed until he says, 'This is how it appears to me,' and they say, 'It is based on tradition.'" Rabbi Elazar said, "Even if he says it is based on tradition, and they say, 'This is how it appears to us,' he is executed, so that disputes do not increase among Israel." I reconciled this with the statement of Rav Kahana through a logical argument, and the halacha follows Rabbi Elazar. This is what Rabbi Moses Maimonides (Rambam) wrote: "Even though he judges and they judge, meaning he says it appears to me this way and they say it appears to us this way, he receives and they receive," meaning he says it based on tradition and they say it based on tradition. This is contrary to Rav Kahana's view. Consequently, it implies that if he received and they judged, he would be sentenced as an apostate elder. In Chapter Four, Rabbi Moses Maimonides (Rambam) wrote this explanation specifically, while here he presented the general principle without concern for its particulars.
"And if the court wishes to waive their honor, etc." There, Rabbi Yashiyah said: "There are three cases that were minor to me from the people of Jerusalem: A rebellious son whose parents wanted to waive his rebellion, we waive it; a stubborn and rebellious elder whose parents wanted the court to waive his punishment, we waive it." When I came to my colleagues in the south regarding two matters, they agreed with me on the case of a rebellious elder but did not agree with me, so as not to increase disputes among Israel.

Halakhah 5



Halakhah 6



Halakhah 7

(5-7) An elder who defies the court is not liable to death unless he is, etc. A Baraita there (Sanhedrin 86b): "When it will be too difficult for you" – the verse speaks of one distinguished in the court. And our Rabbi wrote in the commentary on the Mishnah that this means someone for whom only the difficult and wondrous matter is elusive, but a student who has not yet reached the level of issuing rulings, everything is wondrous to him.
"And he disputes with the court about a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet (spiritual excision) and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering, or regarding tefillin." There (Sanhedrin 87a), it is taught: "An elder who defies the court is only liable for a matter where intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering; these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, 'For a matter whose fundamental aspect is from the Torah, but its explanation is from the Scribes.' Rabbi Shimon says, 'Even for a minor detail of the Scribes.'" And our Rabbi (Rambam) ruled according to Rabbi Meir because there is a Baraita (teaching) there that states: "When it will be too difficult for you" - the verse speaks of the one distinguished in the court. 'From you' refers to a counselor, meaning someone who disputes the intercalation of the year, which is called a secret and counsel, as it says: 'From you will come a schemer against the Lord, a counselor of wickedness.'" "A matter" - this is a law, meaning a law transmitted to Moses at Sinai. "Between blood and blood" - between the blood of menstruation, childbirth, or abnormal discharge. "Between judgment and judgment" - between cases of capital punishment, monetary cases, or cases of lashes. "Between plague and plague" - between plagues of humans, houses, or garments. "Matters" - these are valuations, dedications, and consecrations. "Disputes" - these are the drinking of the sotah (suspected adulteress), the decapitation of the calf, and the purification of the leper. "Within your gates" - this refers to the gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the field. And it is taught there: Rav Huna bar Chinana said to Rava, "Explain this Mishnah according to Rabbi Meir." Rava said to Rav Papa, "Go explain it to him." And he explained that from all the matters mentioned in the Baraita, there emerges a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering. And as explained in the words of our Rabbi (Rambam) in the following chapter, the Baraita and its interpretation, and since we see that these later Amoraim strive to establish the Baraita according to Rabbi Meir, it is evident that we rule according to him, that one is only liable for a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering. And later in the Gemara (Sanhedrin 88b) it says: Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Oshaya, 'One is only liable for a matter whose fundamental aspect is from the Torah and its explanation is from the Scribes, and it can be added to, and if one adds, he diminishes.' And we have nothing but tefillin according to Rabbi Yehuda. Rashi explained, 'And it can be added to based on what the Sages explained, and if one adds, he diminishes and invalidates the original with his addition. And we have nothing but tefillin, whose fundamental aspect is from the Torah and its explanation is from the Scribes, that they are four compartments, and one can add five or more, and if he adds, he diminishes, as he violates "You shall not add" and does not fulfill the commandment.' Thus far his words. And now, since our Rabbi rules according to Rabbi Meir, that one is only liable for a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering, he should not have written 'or regarding tefillin,' since tefillin do not result in a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering, one does not become a rebellious elder (zaken mamre) when disputing about them. And indeed, the Raavad (Rabbi Avraham ben David) criticized him in the following chapter, where he wrote, 'Except for the commandment of tefillin alone, etc.' The Raavad said: 'This is an error, for according to Rabbi Meir, we require a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering, and for tefillin, one is exempt. According to Rabbi Yehuda, one is liable for tefillin.' Thus far his words. And it appears to me that our Rabbi (Rambam) holds that Rabbi Elazar, citing Rabbi Oshaya, came to explain the matter of Rabbi Yehuda. And this is what he says: Even though Rabbi Yehuda mentioned only a matter whose fundamental aspect is from the Torah and its explanation from the Scribes, one must also consider another condition, that it has the potential for addition, and if one adds, it diminishes. According to these conditions, it turns out that there is no matter for which a rebellious elder (zaken mamre) would be liable except for tefillin. For there is no matter where these conditions converge except for tefillin, according to Rabbi Yehuda. In other words, Rabbi Oshaya's statement explains Rabbi Yehuda's matter, and since he came to explain Rabbi Yehuda's words, it implies that we follow his view. Additionally, we have a rule that between Rabbi Meir (R.M.) and Rabbi Yehuda (R.Y.), the law follows Rabbi Yehuda. And to reject Rabbi Meir's view is impossible because the later Amoraim strive to establish the Baraita according to him, as I wrote. Therefore, we hold according to both that in a matter for which intentional transgression incurs karet and unintentional transgression incurs a sin offering, or in the case of tefillin, one becomes a rebellious elder. I will explain and reconcile the rest of the Raavad's (Rabbi Avraham ben David) words in that criticism in the next chapter with the help of Heaven. And the RaMHa (Rabbi Meir HaLevi Abulafia) challenged our Rabbi's words, asking what his position is. If he holds like Rabbi Meir, then he should not obligate for tefillin, and if he holds like the anonymous Mishnah which obligates for tefillin, then that is certainly not like Rabbi Meir. And they answered him that Rabbi Yehuda adds to Rabbi Meir's words to obligate even for a matter that does not incur karet and a sin offering if there is Torah and 'they will teach you.' The ruling to act according to his instruction is found in the Mishnah there (Sanhedrin 86b): He is not...
And to instruct to act according to his ruling. In the Mishnah there (Sanhedrin 86b): He is not liable until he instructs to act, as it is stated, 'And the man who will act presumptuously.'
And what is written, 'or he acts according to his instruction,' is from a Baraita there, which I will explain at the end of this chapter with the help of the Almighty.
And he disagrees with them while they are sitting in the Chamber of Hewn Stone. A Baraita there (Sanhedrin 87a) states: 'And you shall go up to the place'—this teaches that the place causes [the judgment to be binding]. This excludes [the scenario] where he found them outside their place and rebelled against them. Explicitly, it is taught in the first chapter (14a): If the rebellious elder found the court in Beit Pagi, which is a place within the walls of Jerusalem, and rebelled against them, one might think that his rebellion is considered valid rebellion. Therefore, it says 'and you shall arise and go up to the place,' teaching that the place causes [the judgment to be binding]. Rashi and Tosafot explain that Beit Pagi is not specific, but rather any place outside the Chamber of Hewn Stone is not their designated place.
But if he was a student, etc. This is from the Mishnah in the chapter 'Those Who Are Strangled' (Sanhedrin 86b).
And what he wrote, as it is stated 'if a matter is too difficult for you to judge,' etc., until 'it teaches that the place causes him to be liable for death.' This has already been explained from what I wrote above.
And all of these and similar cases where they are [compliant]: The rest of the laws and details that have not been explained here are explained there [in the Talmud].

Halakhah 8

And how do they judge a rebellious elder etc., until 'He is exempt.' Mishnah in Sanhedrin there. However...
"In what context does 'if they heard and accepted it from them, it is better' apply? It is written in the Mishnah: 'If they heard, they say to them,' and when interpreting the matter, it seems that this refers to a case where the same court that heard the case ruled accordingly. According to the words of our Rabbi (Rambam), it appears that he explains it thus: if a rebellious elder heard and accepted to act according to the rulings of that court, they say to him: 'Your reasoning is sound.'"
When he instructs to act or has acted, etc. Mishnah there, as I have written above, he is not liable until he instructs to act. And in the Baraita (Sanhedrin 88a) it teaches: 'The Sages taught: He is not liable until he acts according to his instruction, or he instructs others and they act according to his instruction.' The Gemara challenges this: Granted, if he instructs others and they act according to his instruction, from the outset (k'lomar), meaning before he comes to the court sitting in the Lishkat Hagazit, he is not considered a liable person (bar k'tila). But now, if he acts according to his instruction, from the outset he is considered a liable person. Where do we see this? In the case of forbidden foods (chalav v'dam), from the outset he is not considered a liable person. But now, in the case of capital crimes (hayavei mitat beit din), from the outset he is considered a liable person. From the outset, he requires prior warning; now, he does not require prior warning. He is an inciter who does not require prior warning, meaning if he was inciting and justifying a reason to permit, this language does not constitute incitement. What can we say in his favor? From the outset, he also applies the penalty without prior warning. If he claims justification, we accept it from him; now, if he claims justification, we do not accept it from him, since he heard from the court's mouth not to act, and he acted against their ruling.
They conclude his judgment to death in the Supreme Court of his city. In the first chapter of Sanhedrin (page 16a), we learn that we do not judge a false prophet except in the Supreme Court of Jerusalem. The Gemara states: 'What is the comparison? As Rabbi Yehuda bar Chanina taught: The intentional act (hazdah) [that leads to death] applies similarly whether there [in Jerusalem] at seventy-one [judges], so too here [in other places] in the Supreme Court [of a city].' Now, regarding 'hazdah,' it is as written in the context of 'k'tila,' which means it is explicitly stated that 'k'tila' [capital punishment] is in the context of seventy-one [judges]. It is impossible [for it] to be actual 'k'tila,' as it is explicitly taught that it applies only in the Great Court [of Jerusalem], as I will write shortly. Rather, it refers to the final decision of his judgment, which is in the context of seventy-one. This is also implied from Rashi's commentary. This is what Rabbeinu wrote: 'They conclude his judgment to death in the Supreme Court of his city.'
They do not execute him in the court of his city, etc. Mishnah in the chapter of the stoned (Sanhedrin page 89): They do not execute him either in the court of his city or in the court of Yavneh, but rather they bring him up to the Great Court in Jerusalem and keep him until the pilgrimage festival, and they execute him during the festival, as it is stated, 'And all the people shall hear and fear.' Rabbi Akiva says: We do not delay the judgment of this one; rather, we execute him immediately, and we write and send [notices] to all places, 'So-and-so has been sentenced to death by the court.' And Rabbeinu explains: 'Not in the court of Yavneh'—meaning if the Great Court has gone outside Jerusalem.
And what is meant by 'until the pilgrimage festival, they keep him.' Rabbi Akiva ruled regarding Rabbi Yehuda that the halacha follows Rabbi Akiva over his colleague.
And four require proclamation: the rebellious elder, witnesses, etc. A baraita states there. And be aware that these four proclamations are not equal: for the rebellious elder, they keep him until the pilgrimage festival, as Rabbi Akiva explained nearby. The other three, they execute them immediately, and their proclamation is that they send out notices everywhere stating, 'So-and-so is liable to death by the court.' This is also written by Rabbi Akiva in the conclusion of the laws regarding the rebellious son and in Chapter 18 of the Laws of Testimony concerning conspiring witnesses. This is because since we do not find Rabbi Akiva dissenting except regarding the rebellious elder, it implies that he does not agree with Rabbi Yehuda's opinion. I have already written this there.

Chapter 4



Halakhah 1

This refers to one who disputes the Great Court on a matter, even if he himself derives his opinion from tradition, etc. I have already written earlier that the dispute between Rav Kahana and Rabbi Eliezer is in the chapter of the rebellious son, and the conclusion is in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer who said: 'Even if he states based on tradition, and they (the court) say differently, in our view, he is liable to death.'...
Similarly, if one disputes them regarding a decree from their enactments, etc. This matter is clear by itself, since once the Temple is leavened after six hours (on Passover), we do not concern ourselves with its sanctity, as explained in Pesachim. This is elaborated in the words of our Rabbi in the laws of marriage. This dispute concerns a matter where intentional violation incurs the punishment of excision (karet) and unintentional violation incurs the punishment of a sin offering.

Halakhah 2

One [instance] where they incur excision for intentional violation, etc., until 'or if he is stricter and they are more lenient, he is liable; and if the dispute does not lead to this, he is exempt.' All this is in the Braitah in Sanhedrin, as I wrote earlier in the preceding chapter, and also there I explained that Rabbi Meir interpreted it thus, as stated by our Rabbi. However, it is difficult...
And similarly, if they disputed regarding administering the Sotah ordeal, etc., she is forbidden to the levirate husband, etc., since the prohibition of the Sotah does not incur excision on the yevamah [levirate wife] to obligate her to receive excision. This requires analysis as explained above, and Rashi elucidated this in Yevamot with precision and clarity.

Halakhah 3

Except for the obligation of Tefillin alone, the Ra'avad wrote that this is an error in the view of Rabbi Meir, for we require something where intentional violation incurs excision, and unintentional violation incurs a sin offering, etc. I have already responded to the beginning of his statement in the previous chapter and will now address the rest in the language of the Talmud, substantiating the opinion of our Rabbi. In Sanhedrin (page 88a), we have a version where Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaiah: 'He is liable only for something whose essence is from the words of the Torah and its explanation from the Oral Tradition (Midrash), and there is room to add or subtract from it.' We only have Tefillin according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. But what about the Lulav, whose essence is from the words of the Torah and its explanation from the Oral Tradition, and there is room to add or subtract from it? If one adds to the Lulav, what do we hold? If we say that the Lulav does not require an additional part (Aggad), this one stands alone, and that one stands alone, meaning it does not detract. If we say that it requires an Aggad from the outset, then it is considered a defect from the beginning because it added a supplementary Mitzvah. We require it to detract since it was valid from the beginning, but its addition invalidates it. And what about the Tzitzit, whose essence is from the words of the Torah and its explanation from the Oral Tradition, and there is room to add or subtract from it? If one adds to the Tzitzit, what do we hold? If we say that the upper knot is not from the Torah, this one stands alone, and that one stands alone, meaning since it is not tied, it is not considered connected to the others, and the commandment should be the Mitzvah itself, and the additional part is like it is not. If we say that the upper knot is from the Torah, it is a defect from the outset, yet it remains so even so. Therefore, the Tefillin also needs to be made of four houses, and it is brought after others, and we are about them alone, and that alone, and if the five houses are made, it stands, and the outer house that cannot see the air is disqualified. And the Ra'avad of blessed memory was confronted with the question that if matters are as straightforward that Rabbi Yehuda obligates only in Tefillin, as mentioned in the Beraisa I wrote in the chapter preceding this, the dispute between Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Shimon. It is incumbent upon him to mention the words of Rabbi Yehuda at the outset, as every Tanna later came to add to it, and Rabbi Yehuda obligates only in Tefillin alone, whereas Rabbi Meir obligates in everything where intentional violation incurs excision and unintentional violation incurs a sin offering, and Rabbi Shimon obligates in all matters, even in the nuances of the scribes' meticulous details. From the strength of this query, he wants to explain that Rabbi Yehuda does not obligate only in Tefillin alone but also in Lulav and Tzitzit. According to the opinion of the Ra'avad of blessed memory, it is conceivable that this is the rule for all commandments whose essence is from the words of the Torah and whose explanation is from the words of the scribes. However, he takes Lulav and Tzitzit because from these it implies that the Talmud does not obligate, and the Ra'avad of blessed memory appears to interpret that Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Oshaia that if you allow another condition, it is because it needs to add. And the Ra'avad of blessed memory was challenged regarding this, that if the matter is as straightforward as Rabbi Meir holds that Rabbi Yehuda obligates only in Tefillin, and there is no one who maintains this view except Rabbi Yehuda and not the author of the statement, then it is understood that when this condition is applied—if Lulav and Tzitzit are included or not in the general rule—according to the truth, even though there is no need to add, if it is a matter whose essence is from the Torah and its interpretation is from the scribes, it is obligatory according to Rabbi Yehuda. And the measure of the language of the Ra'avad is such, and this is the law: if he added to Lulav and Tzitzit, if the addition invalidates the primary requirement, meaning, according to the opinion that Lulav requires an Agud and according to the opinion that the upper knot is not from the Torah, if he added and did not invalidate, it means that if one initially did not perform it correctly, he made an Agud and stood, meaning from the beginning, he did not act properly. There, he made an additional mitzvah, and we hold it against him because he did not fulfill the action, but he invalidated it because Lulav and Tzitzit also forget about it and so on. It is difficult to understand his words because the positive command is not from the one who made it, except for the Tzitzit and not the Lulav and Tzitzit (and) among his words, we learned that the reason why the upper thread is not connected, but if one added and subtracted to this day, is it not connected. And what is said, 'And some say specifically regarding Tefillin,' and he says, 'I concede to Rabbi Yehuda,' and so on, saying, 'Yes,' so that this opinion is not countered by the question I raised above. Rabbi Yehuda only came to invalidate, and initially, it would have been appropriate for the Beraisa to mention the words of Rabbi Yehuda. As I have written to explain that he adds to the words of Rabbi Meir, who holds that one is obligated for Tefillin, adding to those obligated for Karet (severest punishment). Rabbi Meir said, and it is easy to understand why the Ra'avad began his words 'This is a mishmash according to Rabbi Meir,' etc., perhaps our Rabbi holds like the others, and the Ra'avad's own view is that he writes and says, 'I concede to Rabbi Yehuda,' etc., and rules like Rabbi Yehuda, specifically concerning those obligated for Karet and Tefillin, he is obligated. It is possible to say that according to the opinion of some, Tefillin, which is obligatory based on a verse, we should include them, and our Rabbi wrote that it is a halacha from the Kabbalah. If so, he certainly does not hold like that opinion. This is how I understand the explanation of the words of the Ra'avad, and our Rabbi interprets the tradition straightforwardly and explains that which Rabbi Eliezer said, the interpretation of Rabbi Yehuda, and if so, according to Rabbi Yehuda, there is an obligation only in Tefillin, as I have demonstrated in the previous chapter.
And what is said, 'Our Rabbi says he is pure, and this one says he is impure,' regarding one who is secondarily impure, he is exempt from death, as clarified in the words of Rabbi Yitzhak in the third chapter of the laws of the entry into the Temple, that one who is secondarily impure upon entering the Temple is not liable for Karet.

Chapter 5



Halakhah 1

One who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death by stoning." This is from the Mishnah in Sanhedrin, Tractate Makkot, Chapter 4 (Sanhedrin 53b). And in the Gemara: "And one who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death by stoning." You say 'by stoning'—is it only by stoning, or is it one of all the deaths mentioned [in the Torah]? It is stated here, 'his father or his mother,' likening his curse to them, and it is stated regarding the witch and the necromancer, 'their blood is upon them'—just as there, it is explicitly written 'they shall be stoned with stones,' so too here [it is] by stoning.
"And one who curses them [his father or mother] during their lifetime or after their death." This is from the Mishnah in Sanhedrin, Tractate Makkot, Chapter 1 (Sanhedrin 45a).
And witnesses are required, etc. It seems to me that it was necessary to write this regarding one who curses or strikes his father, because you might think that striking one's father or mother and cursing them, as it typically occurs within the household, where valid witnesses are not found, would therefore not require witnesses. The mention of warning teaches us otherwise.
And one [case applies] to a man, and one [case applies] to a woman, and similarly [applies to] a tumtum, etc. In the chapter of the Four Types of Capital Punishment (Sanhedrin, page 56), it teaches: 'A man [who curses his father, etc.]'—what is the teaching [derived] to include? 'A man'—to include a daughter of a tumtum and an androgynous....
And what is meant by 'and they should be adults, etc.' is straightforward in itself: 

Halakhah 2

He is not liable to stoning, etc." Mishnah there, and at the end of the chapter of Shevu'at Ha'edut (Shavuot 36a): "One who curses his father or mother is not liable until he curses them by name (using their actual names)." And in the Mishnah (Shavuot 35b): "One who curses his father or mother with any form of designation (a nickname) is liable according to Rabbi Meir, while the Sages exempt him, and the halacha is in accordance with the opinion of the Sages....
"And what is meant by 'he is to be beaten as he is beaten,' etc." This relies on what was ruled in Perek 46 of Hilchot Sanhedrin that one who curses another, even with a nickname, is liable to be beaten. I have already written there how we derive this, yet there remains a difficulty in the words of our Rabbi [Maimonides], as he ruled here according to the Sages. In the Gemara (page 36), they said that their reasoning is because it is written, 'in piercing [him] through, his name shall he put to death' — what is the meaning of this? It teaches about one who curses his father and mother that he is not liable unless he curses them by name. Rashi explained (if it does not matter to him, since it is written 'and pierces a name'). He taught us a matter concerning the one who curses his father and mother. And in the Chapter 4 of Mishnayot, above from this, we say, 'I will bless the name,' we say a teaching: A time has come, Samuel said that he said, "in piercing him, his name to put him in his name, a death, and truly wise man not have it, and his Shmuel, for instance,

Halakhah 3

"And similarly [regarding] one who curses, etc." It appears that he learned this from what is stated in Makkot, Perek Elu Hen HaGolin (Makkot, page 12): It teaches [a case where] a father who killed his son [intentionally], becomes liable for blood redemption. And it was taught elsewhere [in a different Mishna], there is no blood redemption for [the son] of his son. It seems to conflict, this, in his son, this, in the son of his son. Rashi separated. This taught the son to be put to death, his son is saying, it is in the son of the son of a son, the man is not to be his, and he is warned not to honor him

Halakhah 4

"Warning regarding one who curses his father, etc., until 'his father' is included in the category of Israelites. In Perek D' Mitzvah (Sanhedrin page 66), I have derived from what is written in the Torah: 'You shall not curse God, nor shall you curse a leader among your people,' and it is also written 'You shall not curse a deaf person,' why is it necessary? It is not the same for me, why should I write 'curse' to 'God' in the event of a word. We can infer from our teacher [Rabbeinu] regarding why he said: We say there, 'Good [reasoning] for the opinion that [the word] 'Elohim' means 'profane,' but for the opinion that [the word] 'Elohim' means 'holy,' what is there to say? That is to say, here it warns regarding the blessing of the Name. What can one say? Isn't there an additional verse here? [One might] object that it is not the same as there, where it concludes with 'profane' from 'holy,' [saying] perhaps the verse [actually] reads 'I will sanctify.' A warning [there is] 'profane,' not 'warn,' and from both of these, if so, it should be written, 'You shall not curse.' What is 'You shall not curse?' Understand [this] twice, and our teacher considers like the opinion that 'Elohim' means 'holy.' Because Rabbi Akiva is the one who said thus, there [are places where] Rabbi Ishmael disagrees with him, and the law follows Rabbi Akiva from his colleague. And it implies to him, when they say 'if so, it should be written, 'You shall not curse,'' it turns back on the above statement, and he brings [support] from 'You shall not curse a deaf man,' and so it is written: 'What is for a deaf man, because his silence has caused him this, that is to say, since he is humble, the verse warns against despising him. If so, why should it be written, 'The Merciful One shall not curse?' What is 'The Merciful One shall not curse?' Understand this warning once for the deaf man and once for the father, as stated above, according to the opinion of our teacher, or as it is said, that our teacher believes that since we say in the oath of testimony [page 36] that one who curses his fellow is from him who is liable and responds, because it is written, 'You shall not curse a deaf man,' and it does not contradict there between a deaf man and every other person, and the reason for saying 'deaf' is already explained in the words of our teacher [folio 86] from Hilchot Sanhedrin. And the sugya of the fourth chapter of Mitzvot opposes the one who opposes between a deaf man and every other person. And the sugya of the oath of testimony holds that since there is a reason why it says 'deaf'...

Halakhah 5

The one who strikes his father, etc. Mishnah beginning of Sanhedrin Chapter 7: These are the ones who are liable to be executed by strangulation: one who strikes his father and mother.
"And one who is a man, etc., and likewise a tumtum, etc." It seems to me that it is learned from what we say similarly about cursing, as I wrote above. And our teacher holds that we analogize here to cursing, as I explained in this chapter, with God's help.
"He is not liable to strangulation, etc." Mishnah in the chapter of those liable to strangulation (Sanhedrin, page 85a):

Halakhah 6

One who strikes his father on his ear, etc." In Bava Kamma, in the chapter of one who injures (Bava Kamma, page 86a), Rava said: "One who plows his father [with a plow] is liable to execution, because it is impossible without causing a drop of blood to fall on his clothing.

Halakhah 7

"One who causes blood to spurt for his father, or who was a doctor and performed surgery, etc." In the beginning of the chapter of those liable to strangulation (Sanhedrin, page 84a). It is necessary to clarify this, and I will write about it shortly.
"Even though he is exempt from the outset, he should not do [it], etc." There, Rav did not abandon his son to give him an ounce of weight, meaning if a thorn was embedded in his flesh, he would not let his son remove it. Ravina did not abandon his son to open a window for him, meaning to force out phlegm from him, lest he choke accidentally.
And regarding what he wrote, 'But if there is no one else who can do it except him,' etc., it seems to me that it was learned thus: When the question arose about whether a son may cause blood to spurt for his father, it was derived from 'Love your neighbor as yourself,' meaning that Israelites were not instructed to do for their fellow what they themselves would not desire. Rav Dimi derived from [the case of] striking a person and striking an animal: just as striking an animal for healing purposes exempts one, so too striking a person for healing purposes exempts one. And he learned from [the comparison with] striking an animal that one is definitely exempt and permitted. Rather, Rav Papa and Ravina, since they found someone who could heal them, did not leave their sons [to treat them], because perhaps they would harm them more than necessary, as is common in medical treatment. And this is stated explicitly in the name of the Ramban.

Halakhah 8

"Warning concerning striking, etc." It seems to me that it was learned from what was said regarding the warning against striking one's father, as I wrote nearby. And in Sanhedrin, in the chapter of those liable to strangulation (Sanhedrin, page 85a), Mar Sheshet was asked about what if a son acts as an agent of the court to strike and curse his father, meaning if his father incurred lashes or excommunication. And it was concluded that it is permissible, and this was supported from a teaching: Just as one who is commanded to strike him (a transgressor) is commanded not to strike him (a non-transgressor), so too, one who is not commanded to strike him is not judged as if commanded to strike him. What is it? Both in a place of a commandment here, not in a place of a commandment here. And thus it was taught. And what if in a place of a commandment where it is a commandment to strike him, it is also a commandment not to strike him, not in a place of a commandment where it is not a commandment to strike him? It is not the case that it is a commandment not to strike him. And Rashi explains: And what if it is a commandment to strike him, a Brita was taught this way in the Mechilta: What is it? Both a commandment and not a commandment, both in a place of a commandment and not in a place of a commandment, whether it is his son or another, and the question arises, and he derives a warning to one who strikes his father. And what about another, where it is a commandment to strike him in a place of a commandment, as it is written, 'They shall correct him,' a commandment not to strike him more than forty, as it is written, 'Do not add, lest he add,' his son who is not commanded to strike him, even in a place of a commandment. Therefore, he is not made an emissary. Therefore, it is not the case that he is warned not to strike him, not in a place of a commandment. And what about in a place of a commandment where it is a commandment to strike him, more than forty, not in a place of a commandment, all the more so, and he derives a warning to one who strikes his father or his friend from here.

Halakhah 9

Shetuki is liable regarding his mother, etc. But his son from a maidservant, etc." Mishnah in Yevamot, chapter "How is it?" (page 22): "If a man has a son, nevertheless he exempts his father's wife from levirate marriage, and he is liable for striking him and cursing him. His son is regarded in all matters, except for one who has a son from a maidservant or a non-Jewess.
And regarding what our Rabbi wrote, that he is not liable for his mother, it is because if she has not yet been freed, her status is not like that of an Israelite woman. If she has been freed and he has not been freed, she is considered to him like a minor who is born but he is not regarded as her son. Whether she has been freed or not, if he has been freed, he is to her like a minor who is born, and he is exempt from her, as our Rabbi wrote nearby. Alternatively, one can derive from what our Rabbi wrote nearby: one who is not liable for his father is also not liable for his mother....
"And similarly, a convert whose parentage is non-sanctified, etc." This is straightforward: since his parentage was not sanctified, his status is like that of a full convert who does not inherit from his father, as we find in the teachings of Rav Mari, as it is stated in the chapter "One who dies" (Baba Batra, page 149b).

Halakhah 10

"Just as he is not liable, etc." This means that if his father is known, and even so he is not liable for him, he is not liable for his mother. This excludes the case of a shetuki (a person whose father is unknown), where the reason he is not liable for his father is because we do not know who he is.

Halakhah 11

"A convert is forbidden to curse, etc." I found some evidence for this from what we say in Yevamot, chapter "How is it?" (page 22), and it is also found in the words of our Rabbi in chapter 14 of Hilchot Issurei Biah, that a forbidden relationship was only prohibited to a convert so that people would not say, 'We have come from a stricter sanctity to a lighter sanctity.'
But the slave etc...

Halakhah 12

One who was, etc." A Baraita in Sanhedrin, chapter "Those liable to strangulation" (Sanhedrin 85a): "If someone is about to be executed and his son comes and strikes or curses him, he is liable. If another person comes and strikes or curses him, he is exempt." They asked there, "What is the difference between his son and another person?" They answered, "The reason another person is exempt is because the verse says, 'Do not curse a prince among your people,' which means someone who is acting in accordance with your people. Since this person committed a crime for which he is liable to death, he is not considered to be acting in accordance with your people." This explains cursing, but from where do we derive striking? We derive striking from cursing. If so, the son should also be exempt, etc. The case here is when he has repented. If so, another person should also be liable. Rav Mari said, 'Among your people' refers to those who are fit to remain among your people, meaning those who are worthy of continuing to live. And not this one whose judgment has been concluded. If so, his son as well [should be exempt], just as [he is exempt for striking] after death. And Rashi explained: We learn later that one who curses after death is liable. And if you say, but we have learned that one who strikes after death is exempt, and here he is made liable for striking, as it teaches, 'he struck him and cursed him,' the reason he is exempt for striking after death is because we require a wound, and after death, there is no wound, etc. But for someone who is about to be executed, there is a wound, because he is alive, just that he is about to die. End of quotation. From the fact that we established that in the case of one who is about to be executed, and his son comes and strikes or curses him, he is liable, while another person is exempt, when he has repented, we clearly learn that if he has not repented, even his son is exempt. And if he has repented, it is specifically his son who is liable, but another person, even if he has repented, is exempt. Also, in the chapter "How is it?" (Yevamot 22b), regarding the Mishnah I wrote about in this chapter—"if a man has a son, nevertheless, etc., and he is liable for striking and cursing him"—the Gemara says, "What does 'nevertheless' include?" Rav Yehuda said it includes a mamzer (a child of a forbidden relationship). And why does the verse say here, 'Do not curse a prince among your people'? It means one who is acting according to the ways of your people. This case refers to one who has repented.
And what our Rabbi wrote, that even if they have not repented, it is forbidden to strike or curse them, is learned from the ruling he wrote nearby: 'If his father and mother committed an offense for which they are to receive lashes, etc., he should not strike them.'...
And if they shamed him, they are liable to pay the fine for shaming. This means that whoever shames, whether it is his son or another person, if he has other children, the one who shamed must give them the fine. And it is also found in the section on those liable to strangulation, before we established the Baraita (page 85) that I wrote about earlier, where it discusses one who is about to be executed, and his son comes and strikes or curses him, etc., when he has repented. There, Rav Sheshet said that the reason another person is exempt is because the person is already considered dead. And he raises an objection, 'Didn’t Rav Sheshet say that if one shames someone while he is sleeping and he dies during his sleep, he is liable?' Rashi explained that the reason is that his children feel ashamed, and in this case, it is no different. And from the fact that this is raised as an objection based on Rav Sheshet’s statement, it is implied that if one shamed this person, he is liable.

Halakhah 13



Halakhah 14



Halakhah 15

"One who is obligated to take an oath to his son, etc." The Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (SeMaG) wrote that this is how the Geonim ruled. He explained that an oath of a curse is similar to what is customary when pronouncing a ban, excommunication, or something similar....
"And we have already explained, etc." in the first chapter of the laws of the murderer:
"And not only for the striking, etc."


Chapter 6



Halakhah 1

"Honoring father and mother is a commandment, etc., until now they are equal in punishment." A Baraita in the first chapter of Kiddushin (page 30b) is close to the language of our Rabbi.

Halakhah 2

"The father precedes the mother in honor, etc." There, it is taught in a Baraita: Rabbi says, "It is revealed and known before the One who spoke and the world came into being that a son honors his mother more than his father, because she encourages him with words. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, prioritized honoring the father alongside honoring the mother, and it is revealed and known before the One who spoke and the world came into being that a son fears his father more than his mother, because he teaches him Torah. Therefore, the Scripture prioritized fearing the mother alongside fearing the father. From here it implies that both of them are equal in both honor and fear.
