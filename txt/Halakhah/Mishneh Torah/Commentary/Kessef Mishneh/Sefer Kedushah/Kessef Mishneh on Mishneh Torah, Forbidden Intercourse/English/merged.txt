The Ribash wrote that they act there [so as to] be stringent regarding the clean days of a woman who gives birth, even if she does not see [blood] during them. They behave this way to fence off and [promote] separation, even if it is permitted or during [her] days of blood they find it appropriate to rely on their custom and they do not permit them among them but if they act thus in error because they are thinking that it is prohibited by law, it is appropriate to inform them that they err and that this is a custom that comes from the <i>Tzadoqim</i> as Rambam wrote.
