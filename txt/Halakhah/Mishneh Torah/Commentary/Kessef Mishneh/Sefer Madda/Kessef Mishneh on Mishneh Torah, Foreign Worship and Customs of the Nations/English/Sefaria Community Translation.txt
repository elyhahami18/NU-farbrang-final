It is forbidden to make figures for decoration, etc. In the second chapter of Rosh Hashanah (page 24), it was taught that Rabban Gamliel had images of the moon in his attic, on a tablet and on the wall, with which he would show the laymen, meaning the witnesses who came to testify about the sanctification of the new moon, and he would say to them, "Did you see something like this or like that?" in order to check if their words were accurate. And it raises a question there, and in the chapter "Kol HaTzlamim" (Avodah Zarah, page 43), "Is this permitted? But isn't it written, 'You shall not make with Me'? You shall not make a likeness of My attendants who serve before Me in the heavens, such as the sun and the moon, stars and constellations." And it answers, "Rabban Gamliel is different, because others, that is, idol worshipers, made them for him." But didn't Rav Yehuda have others make one for him, and Shmuel forbade it to him? And we answer there: In the case of a raised seal, because of suspicion (of idolatry). If so, in the case of Rabban Gamliel, too, let us be concerned about suspicion. Many people are different (there’s no suspicion because many people are present). And since Rabban Gamliel was a Nasi (prince), many people were frequently around him. And if you want, you could say: It was made of segments, meaning, from sections, and he would only assemble them at the time of examining the witnesses. And all day, they wouldn’t see it, so there was no suspicion. And if you want, you could say: To learn is different, as it was taught: "You shall not learn to do," but you may learn to understand and to teach. And our master (the Rambam) holds that the truth of the matter is, that to understand and to teach is permitted. Therefore, we should not say regarding Rabban Gamliel that others made it for him, and those explanations (like "others made it for him") are pushed aside—that "others made it for him" and that it was made of segments. And therefore, our master did not mention these distinctions. And so it seems that this is the opinion of the Rif, may his memory be blessed, who only wrote, "To learn is different." However, it is difficult: why didn’t our master mention that to learn is permitted? This requires investigation. And it was further taught there: "You shall not make with Me, You shall not make in the likeness of My attendants who serve before Me in the heavens, such as the Ophanim (wheels) and Seraphim (fiery angels), and the holy creatures and ministering angels." And further, it was taught: All likenesses are permitted, except for the likeness of a human face. And it was further taught there: A ring with a raised seal, it is forbidden to wear it, but permitted to sign with it. A ring with an engraved seal, it is permitted to wear it, but forbidden to sign with it. And our master’s opinion is that the likenesses of My attendants in the heavens are forbidden, whether raised or engraved. And this is what he wrote: that even on a tablet it is forbidden. And all other images, except the image of a human face, are permitted, whether raised or engraved. And this distinction made regarding a ring, between raised and engraved, was specifically with regard to the image of a human face.
The Ra'avad wrote: "And it is also forbidden to form the shape of the sun. It seems that he distinguishes between the shape of a person and the shape of celestial beings, which are equal in judgment, and this is the main point." And the Ran wrote in the chapter "All Idols" on the words of our Rabbi, "and I did not understand his reasoning thoroughly from where he derives the basis to distinguish between the shape of a person and celestial beings, as all of them is derived from 'You shall not make for yourselves' as stated in the Gemara." And even the Ra'avad, may his memory be blessed, responded to him, "Perhaps he holds that the ministering angels do not have physical bodies, and so the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are not seen as protruding. Even in the sphere, they are not protruding but rather embedded within it, therefore, there is no distinction between protruding and sunken forms regarding them. But the shape of a person, because it is only seen as protruding, is only prohibited in such a case." And I do not understand why the Ran wrote this argument as if he were uncertain about it, for the authors of the Tosafot hold this view that regarding the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, there is no distinction between protruding and sunken forms, for the reason that the Ran wrote. And so wrote the Rosh in his rulings.
The Ramak wrote that it is difficult for those who say that anything whose seal is not protruding is permitted. Why does he need to explain that it was made in parts? Let him say that it was not protruding on the tablet. And what he explained earlier in the teaching, that its seal is protruding, is not the point, since we question in the latter part of the teaching that R. Gamliel was an individual, and it not suspect. If it is because of this, it does not make sense, because even if we say that it is primary, it does not pose any difficulty. The essence of the explanation that distinguishes between recessed and protruding only pertains to the matter of allowing to keep them, but to make them is prohibited, and this rabbi is discussing the act of making, end of quote.
The forms of animals: The Ra’avad wrote that the likeness of four faces together is forbidden, as Abaye said, and indeed the four faces are like the forms of animals and birds. And if you ask, why not prohibit it because of the form of a human, you could say that if one makes a combined form of a human and an ox, it is worse than just a human alone, since we do not find a verse explicitly stating "You shall not make with Me" in such a case. It is perplexing why we do not rule like Abaye, as no one disagrees with him, thus concludes his statement.

And nevertheless the matter needs a solution, as it is impossible that these righteous ones would be divining. And so it appears to me that the divining that the Torah forbade is when one makes his actions depend upon a sign that logic does not suggest will cause benefit or injury to the thing, such as "bread fell from his mouth," or "a deer blocks him on the way." As these [signs] and those similar to them are from the 'ways of the Amorite.' But if one accepts signs that logically indicate a benefit to the thing or its injury; this is not divining. For all business of the world is like that. As behold, the one who says, "If it rains, I will not go out on the road; but if not, I will go out," is not [practicing] divination. Rather it is the way of the world. And Eliezer and Jonathan were making their actions dependent on things similar to this... And when the Gemara cites [them] regarding the prohibition, this is what it is saying: Any divination of the things the Torah forbids, that logically has no impact - anyone who does not rely upon them like these two relied upon something that was permissible, is not [practicing] divination, and it is not forbidden...

Within this prohibition: At the end of the first chapter of Yevamot (13b), if you will ask how can Rambam decide like Abaye against Rava, perhaps you can answer that we only say (as a rule) that halacha is like Rava where they argue according to their own logic, but not where they argue about what someone else said or his logic.  See there.  And Rav David Cohen in a responsum has difficulty with the words of Our Rabbi (Rambam), because when there is in one city a difference of customs, where some have a certain custom and others have a different custom, this creates a situation of two courts.  But they are not truly two courts in every matter and instance.  And it is possible that for this reason he was exacting in his language.  He did not say that two courts in one city should not each practice its own custom, rather he wrote that there should not be two courts in one city, because once they each practice different customs, they are akin to two courts.  It is also possible that there is an error in the text, and it should read 'it should not be _like_ there are two courts', and copyists left out the 'like'.
