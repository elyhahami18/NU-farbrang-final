"In the introduction of the Rambam, at the beginning of 'It is concluded that from Rav Ashi to Moshe Rabbeinu, may peace be upon him, there are forty generations, etc.' At first glance, this is a great issue, because when counting individually, there are only thirty-eight generations from Rav Ashi to Moshe Rabbeinu, may peace be upon him. (In this edition, this has already been corrected in the text, and the difficulty has been resolved)."
"And these are: Rav Ashi of Rava. At first glance, this is surprising, because of what is written in Kiddushin 72: when Rava passed away, Rav Ashi was born. And I have heard that also the chassidic rabbi, our master Shimshon, of blessed memory, author of *Nezirut Shimshon*, raised this issue. Perhaps there were two Rav Ashis."
