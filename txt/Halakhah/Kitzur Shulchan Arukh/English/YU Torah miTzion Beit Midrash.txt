‎#2: We are taught (Chullin 95b),"Regarding a house, a child or a wife,‎‏ ‏sorcery involving them is ‎forbidden, but‏ ‏they may be [seen as] a sign." This means‏ ‏that one who built a house or whose ‎child was born or who married a wife, and who‏ ‏then had three successes or failures, may‏ ‏take it as ‎a sign for the future and say,‎‏ ‏‎“This house is good for me etc.” One may‏ ‏also ask a child which verse ‎he studied and‏ ‏then rely on it to perform an action, for this‏ ‏is considered somewhat like prophecy.‎‏ ‏Some say that one may make a sign‏ ‏regarding something which will happen in‏ ‏the future, like ‎Eliezer the servant of Avraham [Bereishit 24] or Yehonatan th‏ ‏eson of Saul [Shemuel I 20], while ‎others‏ ‏forbid. One who follows the way of the pure‏ ‏and trusts in G-d will be surrounded by‏ ‏kindness.‎...
‎#3: [Devarim 18:10 prohibits various types‎‏ ‏of magic, including‏ ‏mi'onen.] What is‎‏ ‏mi'onen? One who ‎suggests times [related‏ ‏to the root‏ ‏onah, a designated time], saying‎‏ ‏via astrology that a certain day ‎is good or a‏ ‏certain day is bad, a certain day is fit for a‏ ‏specific venture or a certain year or month‏ ‏is ‎bad for something else.‎‏ ‏Our custom to marry only under a waxing‏ ‏moon is not included in “sorcery ‎and‏ ‏mi'onen” because we only do this as a‎‏ ‏positive sign, along the line of anointing a‏ ‏king at a ‎spring as a sign that his kingship‏ ‏should be prolonged. So, too, we do this as‏ ‏a positive sign, like the ‎moon which‏ ‏develops and becomes full. Nonetheless,‎‏ ‏one should not postpone a marriage for‏ ‏this, and certainly should not perform a‏ ‏chupat niddah for this.‎‏ ‏Similarly, there is a custom to begin‏ ‏studying [Torah] on Rosh Chodesh. Some‏ ‏also permit the practice of beginning (the‏ ‏school year) ‎on a Monday or Wednesday as well.‎
‎#4: Our also sages said: "What is included in mi'onen?‎‏ ‏Someone who “grabs the‏ ‏eyes” [related to ‎the root‏ ‏ayin, an eye], as‎‏ ‏though he was grabbing people’s eyes and‏ ‏closing them, for he tricks ‎them. It appears‏ ‏to them that he is performing amazing,‎‏ ‏supernatural deeds, but in truth he does‏ ‏nothing other than via the speed of his‏ ‏hands. With trickery he deceives them. The jesters who do ‎this at weddings transgress‏ ‏a prohibition, and one who requests this‏ ‏from them transgresses, “Do ‎not place a‏ ‏stumbling block before the blind.”‎‏ ‏Therefore, one who has the ability to object is ‎obligated to object, and certainly one may not gaze and watch them. However, one may watch a ‎non-Jew do this.‎
‎#5: One may not seek [the advice] of magicians other than for life-threatening situations. ‎Alternatively, one who contracts a disease by way of magic or happenstance or bad spirits may be ‎treated by a non-Jewish magician.‎
