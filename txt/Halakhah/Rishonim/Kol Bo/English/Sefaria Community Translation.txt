And in this song, Praise the Lord, call upon His name (Psalms 105), there are ten expressions of thanksgiving corresponding to the ten plagues that the Holy One, blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt. <i>Remember the wonders He has done</i> (Psalms 105:5) — [its] explanation is [that it refers to] the ten plagues that the Holy One, blessed be He, brought on the Egyptians upon the sea and the ten miracles that were done for our forefather upon the sea. And these are them: He split the sea for them — it was split like a dome, and it was divided into two, as it is stated, <i>and He split it</i> (Exodus 14:16); it became dry land; [the bottom] became like a type of clay; the water became crumbs; it became many stones, as it is stated: <i>You smashed the heads of the monsters upon the waters</i> (Psalms 105:5); it became twelve strips; it became stacks; it stood like a heap; fresh water came out from the salty sea; and the water congealed and became like a type of glass, such that they could see one another.

(1) Laws of taking out the Torah and the laws of reading it and its blessings. (29) On the Sabbath during Shaharit, it is customary to say a "Mi Sheberach" after the Haftarah. There are places where they bless the king and afterward the congregation and everything is according to custom.




























































































<b>On the Shabbat of the intermediate festival days</b>, both on Passover and on Sukkot, we take out two Torah scrolls and seven go up to read from the section [that begins], <i>Behold, you say to me</i> (Exodus 33:12). And the reason is because it has in it, <i>You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread</i> (Exodus 34:18). And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, in Tractate Moed Katan, expounded that it is to include the intermediate festival days, And on the second day, the final reader [<i>maftir</i>] reads [about the day relating to both the first and second day of Sukkot based on] the doubt about the day. And he reads the haftara from [the section that begins], <i>On that day, when Gog came</i> (Ezekiel 38:18). And Rav Hai Gaon, may his memory be blessed, wrote a reason for it: Because, in the future, the war of Gog and Magog will be in Tishrei.

























<b>And in a place</b> where they are accustomed to having two cantors, one for the morning prayer and one for the additional prayer, the first one reads from the Torah. And after the reading of the Torah and the haftara, he recites the prayer for the community [<i>Mi Sheberakh</i>], Ashrei [Psalm 145], and “Let them praise [Yehalelu]” and brings back the [Torah] to its place. And afterward, the second one rises, says the small Kaddish, and prays the additional prayer service.

And I found in the [Midrash] Tanchuma, "All matters of Shabbat are doubled: Two sheep; A cantillation (<i>Mizmor</i>), a song for Shabbat; two breads (<i>lechem mishneh</i>); 'Remember' (Exodus 20:8) and 'Guard' (Deuteronomy 5:12) - and it appears that the custom to light two lights is from this." All of this is from the composition by Rabbi Asher, from the Sefer HaMinhagot (Book of Customs). And it is also written there, "And all Israel is obligated to eat three meals on Shabbat. And the early ones were accustomed to break between one meal and another in the morning, and to spread a [new] tablecloth and recite the grace after the meals. And there is one who gets up from the table to stroll outside the house, or in the house, and say a chapter or a mishnah." And it is a proper custom, since the spreading of a tablecloth is called a break [only] with regards to a group that was sitting and the [Shabbat begun] upon them - they may spread a tablecloth and recite Kiddush.

Siman 25







































































































And when we recite [the grace over the meal] in a house of mourners, we add to the blessing as follows: the living King, the One who is good and does good to all, the God of truth, the true Judge, judging righteously and truthfully, who governs His world according to His will, so that we are His servants and His people, and we are obligated to thank Him for everything and to bless Him. And one elaborates out of his desire to seek mercy for the mourner and to comfort him.







































From the first day onwards, we only say [the one blessing of], "who created," unless there are new faces that did not yet hear sheva berakhot (the seven blessings recited in honor of a bride and groom). And that is when [the new face is that of] a great and honored person, for whose sake [the groom's party] would need to add [food]. And it appears that the reason that we recite the blessings on the first day is that it is impossible that there not be someone who did not hear them at the time of the wedding. 
And we are also accustomed to recite sheva berakhot on Shabbat during the seven nuptial days since you will not find a greater and more honorable new face than Shabbat. And the Rash (R. Shimshon of Sens), may his memory be blessed, explained that new faces are those that were not there yesterday, but some explain that they are those who did not eat at the wedding meal. And those people who ate in a room adjacent to the [area of the] wedding canopy do not recite the blessings of grooms, since there is joy only at the wedding canopy. However, if there is one attendant for all of them, the attendant unites them together [such that they can all recite the blessings].

Women are obligated to light Hanukkah candles, for they too were included in the miracle. This means that the enemies came to destroy everyone, men, women, and children, and there are those who say that the great miracle occurred through a woman. Her name was Judith, as the story goes, and she was the daughter of Yochanan, the high priest. She was extremely beautiful, and the Greek king wanted her to lay with him. She fed him a dish of cheese to make him thirsty, so that he would drink a great deal and became drunk, and recline and fall asleep. And it happened just that way, and once he was asleep, she took his sword and cut off his head. She brought his head to Jerusalem, and when the armies saw that their leader had been killed, they fled. For this reason, we have the custom of eating a cheese dish on Hanukkah.


Siman 45




Since women are obligated (in Megillah) due to being involved in the miracle, there is reason to say that they may even exempt men. Never the less, it is not possible for them to complete a quorum of ten, because any situation which requires ten, requires men. The author of Aseres Hadibros wrote that women may not exempt men with the reading, because of "kol b'isha erva." Even though they may light the Chanukkah candles and recite the blessing over them, that is not comparable, since it is not necessary for men to be there at the time of lighting.

And we pour the third cup and he recites the Grace after the meal. And afterwards, we pour a fourth cup and complete the Hallel over it. And we begin with, “Pour out Your wrath, etc.”; after it is, “Not for us.” Then we complete the Hallel and after it is, “And they shall praise You.” But one does not recite the [introductory] blessing over it, “to complete the Hallel.” That is because we do not recite it by way of an obligation. Moreover, we do not recite the whole thing. However, that which it uses the term, complete, only means that one doesn’t skip around in it, like on Rosh Chodesh. And Rabbi Zerachiah, may his memory be blessed, wrote - and these are his words: And the closing [blessing] of Hallel is not on account of it requiring a blessing after it. For here there is not [the principle of], there is nothing that requires a blessing after it that does not require a blessing before it, and since we don’t recite a blessing before it, we may not recite a blessing after it. Rather we understand from it, that it is not from this reason that we make a blessing after it, but rather that the closing [blessing] is from the structure of Hallel. For so do we conclude it on the days [that we say] Hallel. Hence we do not differentiate from that on this night. And the Hallel that we say on this night is not from the category of Hallel, but from the category of saying song for the miracle. For this is as we learned (Pesachim 10:5), “Rabban Gamliel said, ‘Whoever has not said these three things on Pesach has not fulfilled his obligation.’” And [at that mishnah’s] end, we learned, “Therefore we are obligated [to praise].”

<b>52: the Law of the Order of Prayer for Festivals — Evening and Morning and Musaf and Afternoon, and the law of Yaknehaz<b></b></b>
Say the blessing for forefathers and mighty acts and the sanctification of the name, and in place of the middle blessings say "You chose us," "let it ascend and go," "and carry us," and finish with "sanctify Israel and the times," And the prayers of the festival day all are equivalent, except for the additional blessing for they would offer up and add offerings.



And this is the order of recitation: every day that it is completed you bless "Who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to finish the Hallel." And open with <i>Hallelujah,</i> (Psalm 113), <i>when Israel left</i> (Psalm 114), <i>not unto us</i> (Psalm, 115:1-11), <i>LORD, remember us</i> (Psalm 115:12-18), <i>I loved</i> (Psalm 116:1-11), <i>how can I repay</i> (Psalm 116:12-19), <i>praise the LORD</i> (Psalm 117), <i>give thanks</i> (Psalm 118:1-4), <i>from the straits</i> (Psalm 118:5-20), and it is customary to repeat each verse from <i>I praise You</i> to the end of the psalm (Psalm 118:21-29), because all the psalm up to <i>I praise You</i> is repeated in it of itself, as in <i>from the straits I called on Yah; who answered me in width, Yah</i> (Psalm 118:5), <i>the LORD's right hand is high, the LORD's right hand does wonders</i> (Psalm 118:16), and thus them all. And some do not repeat from <i>please</i> (Psalm 118:25) and on, and this is our custom — they pause and repeat <i>please, LORD, save us please</i>, and then afterwards <i>please, LORD, give us success please</i>, and although the whole thing is one verse, since  <i>please, LORD, save us please</i> David's brothers recited, and <i>please, LORD, give us success please</i> David recited (Bavli Pesaḥim 119a:14). And although it is said only to pause in the midst of a verse to teach children, since one poet didn't say the whole thing we pause there. Or, one could say, they only said the prohibition of the midst of verses in Torah and Prophets, but not for writings. And bless afterwards  "Let them praise You," and say the full kaddish.
And the Ra"M wrote that we only say Hallel with three, so that one can say <i>give thanks </i> to the other two, and if there are only two, they both say <i>give thanks</i>. And the RI"F of blessed memory wrote it is good to say it communally even before prayer.
And the days when it is customary only to recite it in abbreviated form, they read it thus: <i>Hallelujah,</i> (Psalm 113), <i>when Israel left</i> (Psalm 114), <i>LORD, remember us</i> (Psalm 115:12-18), <i>how can I repay</i> (Psalm 116:12-19), and continuing with the rest until "Sovereign, lauded in praises." And it is customary to bless before "to recite the Hallel," and afterwards "Let them praise You," and some have the custom also to bless when reciting it entirely "to recite," and we already wrote the reason above in the order for Pesaḥ. And after the Kaddish they bring out two Torah scrolls and read from one the matter of the day, and from the other the additional sacrifice, as we explained in the order of Torah reading.
And it is customary on the seventh of Pesaḥ and on the first day of Atzeret <small><small> that is to say, Shavuot</small></small> to translate the entire portion, so as to make the miracles and wonders understandable for women and the <i>hoi polloi</i>, and make it intelligible for their ears that they may give thanks and praise to the Name for the matters. At the time when the custom was fixed, everyone spoke the Aramaic language. And in this time, the custom has not moved from its place, but they add to it, to elaborate on the Ten Commandments in the vernacular, and also on the seventh of Pesaḥ from <i> And He saved</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Exodus 14:30</i> to the end of the song, and tell of wonders that the Name did for us and our ancestors in a language that all can understand. And also extrapolating on what the Holy Blessed One in the future will do when bringing us from exile, just as those of blessed memory said, <i>In Nisan we were redeemed, and in Nisan we will be redeemed.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"> Rosh Hashanah 11a:2</i> And in the future is the revival of the dead and the days of the Messiah, to strengthen the hearts of all who don't know of the matter of redemption and the revival of the dead. And that is the crux of the ordinance that Moses ordained upon Israel to extrapolate the laws of Pesaḥ on Pesaḥ and similarly for all holidays.
It is also customary of eating honey and milk on Shavuot because the Torah is compared to honey and milk as it is written "honey and milk under your tongue" (Songs 4:11)
And it is customary in all Israel to place saffron in matzo, the reason for which was to make the heart rejoice. Also women customarily made for Shavuot a long loaf of bread with four corners. And it seems that this custom is found to remember the two breads in the midst of the assembly. Or it is possibly on account of the constellation of Gemini, which serves in Sivan.
And it is customary on the last day of the festival - which is called Simchat Torah, because the entire people is happy about the conclusion of the Torah - to have more than a quorum read the Torah: Everyone in the congregation reads, as do people who are not accustomed to go up [to the Torah] and read on other days of the year. And this custom is in order to increase joy. But [only one] individual reads from "And Moshe ascended" (Deuteronomy 34:1) to "And Yehoshua son of Nun" (Deuteronomy 34:9), in [Parashat] Zot HaBerakhah; and [these verses] should not be divided into two. And we have already written the entire order above in the order of the Torah readings.

And there are those that wonder: How was this custom good in the eyes of the Sages - that a man should snatch [a woman, to be] his wife? And, God forbid, it is similar to it being as if the daughters of Israel were abandoned! But this is not a [true] wonder. For it should be known that anyone who could afford to marry off his daughter would not send her there. For if she was a minor, what does his snatching help? Behold, she is not married without the consent of her father. And if she was a maiden or an adult [and could consent on her own], he would not let her go out [there]. And if he did permit her to go out, he would warn her to only get married to [a man] who was suitable for her. Rather the custom was for girls whose fathers could not afford to marry them off; and if it were not for this custom, perhaps they would have remained [single] until their hair whitened.

These are days on which we fast, not to eat and not to drink until the evening; anyone who fasts on them is assured that he [will have a share in] the world to come:
On the first of Nissan, the two sons of Aharon died. On the tenth of it, Miriam the prophetess died, and her well went away. On the 28th of it, Yehoshua bin Nun died.

And we are accustomed to blow the shofar in all the places of Israel on the first day of Elul. And this custom is supported in the Midrash. And likewise is it written in several Aggadot: On the first day of Elul, Moshe ascended the mountain to receive the second tablets, so they blew the shofar in the whole camp - behold Moshe ascended the mountain - so that they should not err in idolatry anymore. And the Holy One, blessed be He, ascended with this blow and with that shofar, as it is stated (Psalms 47:6), God arose with the <i>teruah</i>; the Lord with the sound of the shofar." So our Sages, may their memory be blessed, accordingly established that they should blow the shofar on the first day of Elul every year. And we are accustomed to say, Avinu Malkenu (our Father, our King) after the morning service and the afternoon service, even on Shabbat.

The willows of the river that are mentioned in the Torah are not anything that grows from the river, but rather a specific species known as a river willow. Its leaves are elongated and their edges are smooth; and its branches are red. And that is what is called an <i>aravah</i>. And most of this species grows on rivers, and that is why it is called a river willow. But even if it grew in the desert or in the mountains, it is [still] fit. And there is another species that is similar to the willow, except that its leaves are round, and their edges are similar to a saw; and its branches are not red. It is called, a <i>tzafzafah</i> and it is unfit. And there is [another] type of willow, the edge of the leaves of which are not smooth and not like a saw, but it rather has very small indentations like the blade of a small sickle; and it is fit. And they learned all of these things from tradition; they were explained by our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him.

We learned in the last chapter of Tractate Peah (8:9), "Anyone who does not need to take [charity] but takes [anyway], will not depart from the world until he will become dependent on others. And all who need to take, yet do not take, will not die from old age until he will [be enabled to] provide for others from what is his. Regarding this, it is stated: <i>Blessed is the man who relies on the Lord</i> (Jeremiah 17:7)." And anyone who is not blind, nor lame, nor [stricken with other disabilities], but makes himself out to be one will not die from old age until he will become like one of them. And in the Yerushalmi of Tractate Peach [it says], "Anyone who needs to take but does not take is like one who spills blood." The explanation is [that it is referring to] a sick person, an elderly person, someone with afflictions, or someone who has adult daughters and is unable to marry them off and give them a livelihood, but he does not take.
One who appeases a poor person with words is greater than one who gives charity. And anyone who turns his eyes away from [giving] charity is called a ruffian, cruel and a sinner — as it is stated: <i>Be careful, lest a ruffian thought arise in your heart</i> (Deuteronomy 15:9); <i>the mercies of the wicked are cruel</i> (Proverbs 12:10). And he denies his ancestry. As he is not from the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were merciful, but rather from the seed of the nations, about which it is written: <i>they are cruel, they show no mercy</i> (Jeremiah 50:42). Anyone who has mercy will be shown mercy, as it is stated: <i>and He will grant you mercy, and He will be merciful to you</i> (Deuteronomy 15:9).

One who rents a house outside the land [of Israel] is exempt from [having a] mezuzah for all of thirty days. And likewise, someone who lives in an inn in the land of Israel is exempt for thirty days. But one who rents a house in the land of Israel is obligated [to have] a mezuzah immediately. And when one rents a house to his fellow, it is incumbent upon the renter to bring a mezuzah and to affix it, even in a place where they would pay rent for that — since mezuzah is an obligation on the one living [there], not an obligation on the house. And when he moves from the house, he should not take it in his hand and leave. But if [the house] was that of a gentile, he should take it from there when he leaves.

Meat that mixed with milk by way of cooking or if something hot fell into something hot or something cold into something hot, both [the meat and milk] are forbidden. But if the hot fell into the cold, one may peel off [the top layer of] the meat in the area that the milk touched it and eat the rest. And if it fell, cold into cold, he may rinse the piece [of meat] and eat it. And likewise, meat and cheese that one wrapped in a handkerchief and touched one another – he should rinse each one and may eat them. And likewise, with anything forbidden and permissible, if they touch one another, they need rinsing. However, if they are things that it is not their way to rinse before they are eaten, he should be careful that they not touch one another, lest he forget and not rinse [them]. But there is no concern with anything the way of which is to rinse if they touch one another, both being cold. Hence, we are not concerned about [kosher] meat touching [non-kosher] meat in a non-Jewish slaughterhouse. For it is impossible that they will not rinse it at home. However, if what is pure is bland and what is impure is salted and they touch one another, if they sat there together, it needs to be scraped or peeled.

130. The Law of the Sinner
A sinner who violated the decrees of the community, if they were not excommunicated, they are counted in a quorum of ten and they are obligated in all of the mitzvot. For thus it is said of Achan, "Israel has sinned"(Joshua 7:11) even though he sinned, he is still Israel. Therefore, they still maintain their holiness and they are not removed from the generality of Israel who are not suspected for their oaths. However, if they have been excommunicated, since they must separate themselves from the community of the diaspora, if they were to include them, what would be left of their curse what good was their decree? It is not appropriate to include them at all for they have already separated them from their community.
