[If] one ate meat, it is forbidden to eat cheese until [waiting for] another meal. This follows the opinion of Rav Chisda (Perek Kol Habasar, Chullin 105a). This is also the opinion of Mar Ukva since the meat and fat stay in one's mouth a long time, as well as Rabeinu Baruch who says that the meat between the teeth is called meat, as it says: "the meat was still between their teeth" (Bamidbar 11:33). The time is three hours, per Rashi. For this reason it is good to pick one's teeth after the meal if one will be eating cheese. If one did not eat meat, but rather something that was fried in fat, it is acceptable to eat cheese afterwards with wiping the mouth and rinsing the hands. There is no need to inspect the hands. This is from Rabeinu Peretz.
