Paragraph 1

5) It is hard to comprehend how we can bake in the public oven [where the bread is given to a Gentile baker to bake for a charge]… [but we have several grounds for leniency, because, among other things] the baker bakes in a special place set up for that purpose, and he is not intending to bake for himself nor for any specific person, but rather he is doing his job, because he is hired to bake and to cook for anyone who comes to that designated place. People neither eat nor drink there, and it is a public space open to all. In this instance, it is possible to justify the practice by saying that this is not really considered Gentile cooking, because there is no fear of social intimacy in this setting. And this is all the more so with respect to bread, which they were lenient with.
