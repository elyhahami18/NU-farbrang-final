Chapter 1

One who purchases the fetus of a donkey<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the ownership rights to the future offspring of a pregnant donkey</i> belonging to an idolater, and one who sells [such a fetus] to him, even though he is not permitted to do so, and one who partners with him, [and] one gives it to him in partnership, and one who receives it from him (i.e., to look after in exchange for a share in the offspring), and one who gives it to him in receivership, [are all] exempt from [the laws] of the first-born, as it is said (Num. 3:13), "[I sanctified to Myself the firstborn] in Israel," but not "in others." And so too you may say regarding priests and Levites, given that priests and Levites are liable in the [laws of the] first-born [in the case of] clean livestock, perhaps they are also liable in the [laws of the] first-born [in the case of] unclean livestock, therefore the verse states Num. 8:17), "of man and of livestock." That which you have with man (i.e., redemption), so too you have with livestock. That which you lack with man, so too you lack with livestock -- to exclude Levites from [the obligation to redeem] the first-born of unclean animals. But the [payments for the] redemption of the first-born son and the redemption of the first-born donkey are only given to priests.
Out of all the unclean domesticated animals, there are none that are liable in [the laws of] the first-born except for a donkey. Out of all the unclean wild animals, there are none that are forbidden on account of their sale-price [to donate to the Temple] except for a dog (Deut. 23:19). Rabbi Meir used to say, [as to] anyone who fulfills the commandment of the first-born donkey, they treat him as though he has fulfilled the commandment on behalf of every unclean domesticated animal, and [as to] anyone who disregards the commandment of the first-born donkey, they treat him as though he has disregarded the commandment on behalf of every unclean domesticated animal. Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, behold, it says (Num. 18:17), "But a first-born bull or a first-born sheep or a first-born goat shall not be redeemed, [for] they are holy." A first-born bull: [The obligation does not apply] unless the birth-mother is a [female] bull and the offspring is a bull. A first-born sheep: Not unless the birth-mother is a sheep and the offspring is a sheep. A first-born goat: Not unless the birth-mother is a goat and the offspring is a goat. And if [the offspring] has even a few signs [of its species] similar to its mother, it is liable in [the law of] the first-born.
A clean (kosher) domesticated animal that gives birth to a species of unclean (non-kosher) domesticated animal: [The offspring] is permitted to eat, and if it has even a few signs [of belonging to a kosher species], it is liable in [the law of] the first-born. And an unclean [domesticated animal] that gave birth to a clean domesticated animal: [The offspring] is forbidden to eat, for that which emerges from the unclean is unclean, and that which emerges from the clean is clean.
An unclean fish that swallowed a clean fish: [The clean fish] is permitted to be eaten. And a clean [fish] that swallowed an unclean fish: [The unclean fish] is forbidden to be eaten, because it is not an outgrowth of [the clean fish].
For what reason did they say that the honey of bees is permitted? Because they do not discharge it; rather, they ingest it. The honey of <i>zizin</i> (a species of wild bee or locust) is forbidden, for it [consists of] nothing but secretions. Rabbi Shimon says, what does the twofold repetition of "camel" and "camel" (Lev. 11:4 and Deut. 14:7) come to teach? To include the camel that is born from a cow, which is like one born from a female camel, but if its head and most of its body are similar [in appearance] to its mother (i.e., the cow), it is permitted to be eaten. And the Sages say, that which emerges from the unclean is unclean, and that which emerges from the clean is clean, for no unclean livestock can be born from one that is clean, and no clean [livestock] can be born from one that is unclean, and no large livestock (i.e., a cow) can be born from small livestock (i.e., a sheep or goat), and no small [livestock] from a large one, and no human from all other species, and no other species from a human, even though they said<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "because they said" (see Minchat Bikkurim); Minchat Bikkurim writes that the printed version ("even though they said") can potentially be understood as explaining that even though there are other animals with a nine-month gestation period, none of these can bear a human child, and vice-versa; see also Minchat Eretz Yisrael (stating that the received text is defective)</i> that small clean livestock gives birth at five months [of gestation], [and] large clean livestock at nine months, [and] large unclean livestock at twelve months, a dog at fifty days, a cat at fifty-two days, a pig at sixty days, a fox and all the <i>sheratzim</i> at six months, the wolf and the lion and the bear and the panther and the leopard and the elephant and the monkey and the hedgehog (<i>kipod</i>) at three years, and the snake at seven years. § Dolphins give birth to and raise their young like humans. Unclean fish spawn [their young], [and] clean fish lay eggs. § The digestive track of fish and fetuses [of animals] may not be eaten, except from an expert. Fowl are eaten if there is tradition [that a particular species is kosher]. A hunter is believed to say, "This fowl is clean."
A cow that gave birth to [an offspring resembling] a kind of flock-animal (<i>seh</i>): One may not redeem a first-born donkey with it, for in every place [in Scripture] in which <i>seh</i> is written, it includes sheep and goats, adults and juveniles, males and females, pure and blemished, [and] one may redeem [a first-born donkey] with it two or three times, and may bring it with a vow-offering or a freewill offering, for a sin-offering, or for a guilt offering, and one is liable in [the laws of] the first-born and in the [priestly] gifts. Rabbi Elazar says, [as to] the mixed-breeds from [the coupling of] a ewe and a goat, they may redeem with it, [but as to the mixed-breed offspring] from a wild animal, they may not redeem with it. Just as they may not redeem with a slaughtered animal, so too they may not redeem with a first-born donkey that is dead. A first-born donkey: Its commandment must be fulfilled within thirty days from this point (i.e., its birth) and forward, and it is either redeemed or its neck is broken. What is the minimum value [of a sheep used to redeem a first-born donkey]? Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says, not less than the equivalent of a shekel. Which one [is selected for] redemption of a first-born donkey? That which enters the pen to be tithed (Bekh. 1:4). An Israelite who had doubts [regarding which donkey was the first born], and he went and redeemed them, and so too a priest who inherited [a first-born donkey] from his father and from his Israelite mother<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "from the father of his Israelite mother" (Minchat Bikkurim)</i>, or who was given as a gift a first-born donkey to redeem -- [in such cases,] which one [is selected for] redemption of a first-born donkey? That which enters the pen to be tithed. Behold, if he had a first-born donkey [but] had nothing (i.e., no sheep) with which to redeem it, and he says to a priest, "Give me [a sheep] and I will redeem it," behold, he should not give it to him unless he knows [for certain] that he will redeem it. § [If a first-born donkey is not redeemed,] he breaks its neck with a hatchet from behind, and he buries it, and it is forbidden to derive benefit from it. Not with a rod, not with a reed, and not by bolting a door before it in order that it dies (i.e., of starvation), but if he did so, behold, he has fulfilled his obligation. § One is prohibited from shearing and from working [a first-born animal] during its lifetime. And Rabbi Shimon permits it, and a first-born human is permitted in everything. § A female donkey who had never given birth, and then gave birth to two males, he gives two lambs to the priest (contra. Bekh. 1:3 ("one lamb")). A male and a female, or two males and a female, he gives one lamb to the priest. Two females and a male, or two males and two females, and he does not know [which was born first], he need not give anything to the priest; rather, he sets aside one lamb and redeems each and every [newborn donkey] with it by himself.

Chapter 2

One who purchases the fetus of a cow belonging to an idolater, and one who sells [such a fetus] to him, even though he is not permitted to do so, and one who partners with him, [and] one gives it to him in partnership, and one who receives it from him (i.e., to look after in exchange for a share in the offspring), and one who gives it to him in receivership, [are all] exempt from [the laws] of the first-born. Rabbi Yehuda says, even one who receives from an idolater, even though he is not permitted to do so, behold, he is credited with its full value, and he gives half the money to a priest; and one who gives it to him in receivership, even though he is not permitted to do so, behold, that one shall credit him -- and even if there are ten -- with its full value, so as to give its money to a priest. But the Sages say, since the finger of the idolater is in the middle [of the transaction], he is exempt from [the law of] the first-born.
Ownerless livestock, and consecrated livestock, and the livestock of a convert who died and has no heirs -- [all these are] exempt from [the law of] the first-born. Livestock [used to pay off] property tax are liable in [the law of] the first-born.
All consecrated animals whose permanent blemish preceded their consecration, and they were redeemed, are liable in [the law of] the first-born, and in the [priestly] gifts, and their offspring<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>וולדותיהן</b> (MS Vienna)</i> are mundane, and may be redeemed unblemished, and they may be brought for any sacrifice that one desires before their redemption, and they are subject to the prohibition of benefiting from Temple property after their redemption, and whether before their redemption or after their redemption they may not be exchanged for other sanctified animals. Whether before their redemption or after their redemption, one who shears them and one who performs work with them does not receive forty lashes. The general rule of the matter: Behold, they are like mundane animals in every respect, and they are only [similar to consecrated animals in that they are] subject to commandment of valuation<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מצות עלוי בלבד</b> (see Ohr HaGanuz)</i>. But if their consecration preceded their blemish, or a transitory blemish [preceded] their consecration, and afterward they developed a permanent blemish, and they were redeemed, they are exempt from [the law of] the first-born and from the [priestly] gifts, and their offspring are consecrated, and they may not be redeemed in their unblemished state, and they may not be brought [into the Temple] for any sacrifice that [their owner] desires, and before their redemption one can [be held liable for violating of the law against] misuse of consecrated property with them, and after their redemption one cannot [be held liable for violating the law against] misuse of consecrated property with them, and whether before their redemption or after their redemption, they may be substituted for another animal (<i>temurah</i>). And whether before their redemption or after their redemption, one who shears them or performs work with them -- behold, that one is administered forty lashes. The general rule of the matter: Behold, they are like consecrated animals in every respect, and they are only [similar to mundane animals in that they are] subject to the permission to be slaughtered [and eaten as chullin].
One who receives an "iron flock" (i.e., a flock sold to payment in terms under the condition that the young be divided until the payment in full has taken place (Jastrow)) from an idolater: The offspring are exempt [from the law of the first-born] and the offspring's offspring are liable. [If] the mothers died and the offspring were stood in place of the their mothers, the offspring's offspring are exempt and the offspring's offspring's offspring are liable.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">tr. follows the <i>girsah</i> of Minchat Bikkurim</i> Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, they, their offspring, and their offspring's offspring are exempt from [the law of] the first-born and from the [priestly] gifts, even until the end of the world.
A ewe that gave birth to a type of goat, or a female goat that gave birth to a type of sheep, [the offspring] is exempt from [the law of] the first-born, but if it has even a few signs [of being the same species as its mother], it is liable in [the law of] the first-born. A ewe that had never given birth, and then gives birth to two males, and both of their heads emerged simultaneously: Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, both of them are [set aside] for the priest, as it is said (Ex. 13:12), "The males (plural) are for the Lord." And the Sages say, this is impossible; rather, one is for him and one is for the priest. Rabbi Tarfon says, the more desirable of them [is for the priest]. Rabbi Akiva says, the less desirable of them (contra. Bekh. 2:6 ("They compromise between them."). The second one (i.e., the one not given to the priest) is left to pasture until it develops a blemish, and it is liable in the [priestly] gifts, but Rabbi Yosei exempts it. [If] one of them dies, Rabbi Tarfon says, they split [the value of the live one]. Rabbi Akiva says, the burden of proof rests on the claimant (i.e., the priest). [If] a male and female [are born] and it is unknown [which emerged first], the priest receives nothing; rather, the male is left to pasture until it develops a blemish, and it is eaten with its blemish by the owners. <br><br>Two ewes that had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males [and it is unknown which gave birth to which], both are given to the priest. A male and a female, the male is for the priest. Two males and a female, one [male] is for him and one is for the priest. Rabbi Tarfon says, the the more desirable of them [is for the priest]. Rabbi Akiva says, the less desirable of them. The second one<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>השני</b> not <b>הכוי</b> (MS Vienna and Ohr HaGanuz)</i> is left to pasture until it develops a blemish, and it is liable in the [priestly] gifts, but Rabbi Yosei exempts it.  [If] one of them [dies], Rabbi Tarfon says, they split [the value of the live one]. Rabbi Akiva says, the burden of proof lies with the claimant. Two females and a male, or two males and two females, and it is unknown [which ewe gave birth to which offspring, and which emerged first], the priest receives nothing; rather, the males are left to pasture until they develop a blemish, and they are eaten with their blemishes by the owners.<br><br>One ewe that had previously given birth, and one that had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males [and it is unknown which gave birth to which], one is for him and one is for the priest. Rabbi Tarfon says, the more desirable of them. Rabbi Akiva says, the less desirable of them. The second one is left to pasture until it develops a blemish, and it is liable in the [priestly gifts]. Rabbi Yosei exempts [one of them], for Rabbi Yosei used to say, any [animal] whose replacements are in the hands of the priest is exempt from the gifts, and Rabbi Meir renders it labile, for he used to say, if it is a first-born, give it to me, and if not, give me its gifts. [If] one of them died, Rabbi Tarfon says, they split [the proceeds]. Rabbi Akiva says, the burden of proof rests on the claimant. [If a ewe that had previously given birth, and one that had never given birth, gave birth to] a male and a female, and it is unknown [which gave birth to which], the priest receives nothing;  rather, the male is left to pasture until it develops a blemish, and it is eaten with its blemish by the owners.
One who purchases a domesticated animal from an idolater and does not know if it had previously given birth or not: [The offspring of] a female goat up to a year old is deemed to certainly belong to the priest, and [the offspring of a goat] older than that is in doubt. [The offspring of] a ewe up to to two years old is deemed to certainly belong to the priest, and [the offspring of a ewe] older than that is in doubt. [The offspring of] a cow up to to three years old is deemed to certainly belong to the priest, and [the offspring of a cow] older than that is in doubt, and a donkey is like a cow. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, a four year-old donkey. Up to this point are the words of Rabbi Yishmael, and when these words were spoken before Rabbi Yehoshua, he said [to his students], "Go and tell Rabbi Yishmael, 'You have erred. Were an animal exempted only by giving birth to an offspring, you would have spoken well. Rather, [the Sages] said, the sign of [previously having] given birth in small livestock is a murky discharge [from the womb], and in large livestock is [the emergence of] an afterbirth, and in a woman is a fetal sac or an afterbirth.' And I say, a goat that has emitted a murky discharge at six [months] can give birth during the first year; [and] a ewe that emitted a murky discharge at a year can give birth during the second year." Rabbi Akiva says, this teaching has not reached me; rather, any [animal] as to which it is known that it gave birth, the priest does not receive anything [from subsequent births], and that which has not given birth, behold [the next birth] belongs to the priest, [and] in a case of doubt, they are eaten along with their blemish by the owners. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, large livestock from which was expelled a mass of [congealed] blood, [that mass] requires burying, and it does not defile by carrying, and any [offspring] that is born after it is exempt from [the law of] the first-born (Bekh. 3:1).
One who purchases a nursing domesticated animal from an idolater: That which is born after [the purchase is considered] a first-born, due to the doubt that she cared for [a newborn animal] that she did not birth. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, behold, it retains its presumptive status (i.e., a nursing female is presumed to be nursing her own offspring), and so too would Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel say, one who entered amidst his flock at night and saw around ten [or] fifteen of the first-born offspring which had been borne [by first-time mothers], and when morning rose, he came and found that the males were nursing (lit., "dangling") from older [animals] and the females [were nursing] from the first-time mothers, he need not be concerned lest the offspring of this one came [to nurse] by that one, or lest the offspring of that one came [to nurse] by this one. And so too would Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel say, one who delivers his domesticated animal to an idolater to shepherd, even though that he is not permitted to do so, and the next morning came and found [newborn] males with older [animals] and [newborn] females with first-time mothers, he need not be concerned lest the idolater placed the offspring of this one by that one, or the offspring of that one by this one.<br><br>One who removes wool from an unblemished first-born, and sets it down in a window, even though [a blemish] developed afterwards and it was slaughtered, behold, this one shall bury the blemished first-born that [the wool] was removed from and afterwards died. Akavya ben Mehalalel permits it and the Sages forbid it. Said Rabbi Yehuda<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">not "Rabbi Yosei Rabbi Yehuda"</i>, Akavya [ben Mehalalel] conceded that it is forbidden [to use the wool in such a case]. About what did they disagree? About [a first-born] that was rendered unclean<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per Mitzpat Shmuel, "rendered unclean" should be read as "given a blemish"</i> from which [its wool] was then removed, and afterwards he slaughtered it, that Akavya ben Mehalalel permits [the wool] and the Sages forbid it. Said Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Halafta agree with this,  that [the wool] is permitted, but the Sages more specifically said, let him set it down in a window, lest there be a way to rectify [the situation], for if it should die it will be prohibited, but if he slaughtered it, it is permitted. About what did they disagree? About [a case when] it was rendered unclean and he removed [wool] from it and after that it died, for Akavya ben Mehalalel permits [the wool] and the Sages prohibit.

Chapter 3

How long is an Israelite required to care for a first-born? As to a small domesticated animal, thirty days, and as to a large domesticated animal, fifty days. Rabbi Yosei says, as to a small domesticated animal, three months, for it [requires] a lot of care. An unblemished first-born: During this time (i.e., the initial period), behold, one is permitted to to maintain it [in his possession] for two or three years, before taking it to an expert [to to examine for a blemish]. From the time that he takes it to an expert, [if] it becomes blemished within a year, he is permitted to maintain it for all twelve months. After twelve months, he is not permitted to maintain it for [more than] thirty days.
All consecrated [animals] that become consecrated in the womb, and are born by caesarian section (lit., "from the side"), consecration is imbued upon it. [As to] a first-born and [an animal subject to] cattle-tithe, consecration is not imbued upon them. All sanctified animals about which it is written, "year after year" (Deut. 15:20), as soon as their year has passed, behold, they are disqualified. A first-born and a cattle-tithe, even [after there have passed] two or three years, behold, they are valid.
The same [law applies to] the first-born and the animal tithe, and as to all [other] consecrated [animals] that have been consecrated: Once a year [has passed without three] Festivals, or [three] Festivals [have passed without] a year [elapsing] (R. Hash. 6b:3), one transgresses the law of "thou shalt not delay" on their account.
One who slaughters a first-born that is presumed to possess a blemish, but it turns out to be unblemished: Blemishes that are in the eye, they do not examine them, because [the eyes] change after death, but those of the body, they do examine them, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, even those of the body they do not examine; rather, behold, this one examines: He who is not an expert and saw the first-born, and it was slaughtered on in his word [that it was unblemished]. This in fact once happened, and Elazar ben Padai came and asked the Sages [what to do], and they said, "He must pay half [the value] as to a small domesticated animal, and a quarter as to a large domesticated animal."
One who is suspected to take a wage (i.e., a bribe) and judge, or to take a wage and testify: All the judgments that he has rendered, and all the testimonies that he has given, behold, all of them are nullified. But one may give a judge a wage (i.e., pay him a salary) to act as a judge, or a witness a wage in order to testify, even though they said, it is kosher for a judge to take a wage and for a witness to take a wage for his testimony. One who is suspected to take payment in order to sprinkle or mix the waters [of purification], his waters are [treated as] cave water, and his ashes are [treated as] burnt ashes. And if he was a priest, he becomes defiled from from [eating] his terumah, and they feed him and give him drink, and anoint him (see Bekh. 4:6). And if he was an Elder, they give him a donkey to ride on, and give him his wage, like an unemployed laborer, even though they said, "ugly is the judge [who takes a salary to judge]." One who is suspected concerning first-borns, one may not even buy from him deerskins or untanned skins. Rabbi Eliezer says, they my buy from him skins from a female, because it has never fallen under the general rule of "consecrated [animals]." Rabbi Shimon says, one who is suspected to sell terumah as chullin, one may not purchase from him anything that has any connection to terumah or tithes, and he is [also] suspected as to all the purities and impurities in the Torah. One who is suspected to be contaminated with corpse-impurity is believed regarding [the location of] marked graves. One who is suspected about seventh-year produce is suspected about tithes, [and] one who is suspected about tithes is suspected about seventh-year produce. One who is suspected about either this or that is suspected about tahorot (i.e., preparation of foods in a state of purity). An Israelite is suspected about tahorot but is not suspected about either tithes or about seventh-year produce. One who is suspected about idolatry is suspected about every commandment that is in the Torah, but not retroactively; rather, from that point forward, as it is said (Num. 15:23), "From the day that God commanded you and forward, through all of your generations."
All [animals that are] disqualified from being brought as sacrifices are sold in the marketplace and slaughtered in the marketplace, and sold by liter, except for first-borns and animal tithes, since their profit goes to their owners [rather than to the Temple]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, a person may appease himself by liter (i.e., by weighing the animal himself), to know how much it weighs. Rabbi Yehuda says, a person may seek out his fellow in Jerusalem and say to him, "Did you eat today?" [If his fellow] says to him, "manna," then he knows that he ate from tithes, for just as manna has no monetary value, so too tithe has no value.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">in Jerusalem, one always spoke in hints (see Lam. Rabbah 1:2)</i> [If] he says to him, "summer fruit," he knows that he ate from a first-born, for just as summer fruits are sold cheaply, so too a first-born is sold cheaply. Beit Shammai says, only priests may share a [blemished] first-born amongst themselves, and Beit Hillel says, even with an Israelite. Rabbi Akiva permits [it to be shared] even with an idolater, as it is said (Deut. 12:15), "like the deer and like the gazelle." The meat of a first-born: Beit Shammai say, it may not be fed to a menstruant, and Beit Hillel say, it may be fed to a menstruant. A first-born that has a blood attack (see Bekh. 5:2), one may not let its blood even in a place that causes a blemish, but one may let its blood in a place that does not cause a blemish, the words of Rebbi. Rabbi Yehuda says, it may even be slaughtered on the basis of that blemish. Rabbi Shimon, even if it will die, one may not let its blood. [If] a first-born was coming after him, and he blemished it (i.e., in self-defense), if he intended [to cause a blemish], it is forbidden [to be eaten], and if not, it is permitted. As to all blemishes that are fit to have been inflicted by a person, Israelite shepherds are trusted, [but] shepherds who are priests are not trusted. [The Sages subsequently] went back and ruled as follows: One is trusted about [the first-born] of his fellow, but is not trusted as to his own. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefusai says, one may only slaughter a first-born on the testimony of two [witnesses]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, even [on the testimony of] his son, and even his daughter. Rebbi says<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">compare Bekh. 35b:5 ("Rabbi Yosei says")</i>, even if there are ten people within his household [who testify about the blemish], they are not believed, for one who is suspected about a matter may not judge nor testify [about that matter]. They do not evaluate unblemished first-borns for an Israelite, but they evaluate blemished first-borns for them. [An expert] should not evaluate a first-born for an Israelite, but if a priest said to him, "Send me along with you," or in the case of who inherits from the priestly father of his mother, they may evaluate. A kosher (i.e., fit to perform Temple service) priest who was shepherding an Israelite's flock should not say to him, "Give me these first-borns"; rather, he may say to him, "Those four impure [animals] from your flock -- give them to me." All first-borns may be permitted by a person except his own first-borns, and he may be questioned about the impurity and about the purity of that which belongs to him.
One who blemishes that which is blemished, behold, he is administered forty lashes. One who  leavens that which is leavened, behold, he is administered forty lashes. One who castrates that which is castrated, behold, he is administered forty lashes. A blemish that is exposed, behold, that [animal] is slaughtered on the testimony of three who [regularly] attend the synagogue, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says, even if its leg was cut off or its eye was blinded, one may only slaughter it on the testimony of an expert.

Chapter 4

Every blemish disqualifies [all] sacrifices and disqualifies a first-born. A split of any size renders the ear defective, whether by the hand  of man or the hand of God. What is a "defect"? Anything that [a person] can put his finger on it, and [the remaining skin] can encircle it. What is the size of a puncture [that would render it defective]? As small as a vetch. Rabbi Yosei b'Rabbi Yehuda says, if [the ear] is dessicated, as small as a lentil. Until when (i.e., when is it considered "dessicated")? Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam says, [so dry that] it will crumble if one touches it. And the two opinions<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the opinions regarding  the vetch and the lentil (see Minchat Bikkurim here)</i> are almost identical. 
What is the "mucous" (i.e., that renders the eye blemished)? That which rises to the surface of the eye and does not become embedded in the "floor" of the eye. A <i>chilazon</i> (i.e., snail-shaped blemish)? As it sounds. A <i>nachash</i> (snake-shaped blemish)? As it sounds. If there was a wart in it, and he cut it, if there is a bone inside, he may slaughter [the first-born], and if not, he may not slaughter it. And if it constantly emits discharge for forty days, [or] constantly drips water for eighty days, [it is considered blemished,] the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [if] it constantly emits discharge for eighty days, [or] constantly drips water for eighty days. [If] it ate wet and dry [food] from a field irrigated with rainwater, and not wet and dry [food] from a [hand-]irrigated field, or [if] it ate wet and afterwards dry, that counts toward [the tally of days], [but if first it ate] dry and afterwards wet, that does not count toward it. In any event, they may not count toward it until it eats dry after wet. Rabbi Chananiah ben Antigonos says, and they must examine the discharge (i.e., by calling on an expert) three times within eighty days, lest it clears up and then returns. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, if there were tears in its eye, it is known that the dripping of water is passing. If it stops tearing up, it is known that the dripping of water is permanent. [If] its nostrils were pierced, one inside of the other, from the inside it may not be slaughtered, [but] from the outside it may be slaughtered.
Which [tooth] is the <i>t'yomet</i> ("molar"; see Bekh. 6:4). [The area] from the <i>t'yomet</i> and within, or from the <i>t'yomet</i> that are within. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefusai says, they may only slaughter the first-born based on [a blemish in] the outermost [teeth]. Rabbi Chananiah ben Antigonos says, they may not inspect the inner [teeth] no matter what. [If] a consecrated [female animal's] genitals became mutilated, behold, that is a blemish. [If] the "sheath" was mutilated in any amount, behold, this one is slaughtered. What is the "sheath"? The pouch [which covers the member] but not the member itself. Said Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam, it so happened that a wolf removed [the pouch of] one of them, and it returned to its place (i.e., it grew back). [If] the tail was severed from the bone and not from the joint, or [if the flesh covering] the root of the tail is split open [revealing] two bones, or [if] there is flesh between one vertebrae and another vertebrae, behold, this one is not slaughtered (i.e., these are not disqualifying blemishes). If it only has one testicle, behold, this one is slaughtered. [If] it had two testicles -- even though the second one was only the size of bean -- behold, this one is not slaughtered. Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened with a cow (alt., "in Parin") of Beit Menachem, that [the animal] was placed on its buttocks and he squeezed on the testicles, and only one emerged, and it was slaughtered, and the second one was found attached to its loins, and the matter came before Rabbi Akiva, and he permitted it. And when these matters were stated before Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, he said, "Akiva fed them neveilah (carrion)." [If] the horns and the hooves were removed, and the member along with them, behold, this one is slaughtered. 
What is [considered] "extra"? Any [animal] that has three eyes or five legs. [What is considered] "missing"? Three legs or one eye. What is "unfit"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><i>pasul</i>; alt., <i>kasul</i> (Jastrow)</i>? Any [animal] whose loins (<i>k'salim</i>) protrude. [If] most of its ribs were broken, or if he had in it a blemish from within, it is not a [disqualifying] blemish, as it is said (Lev. 21:18), "blind or lame," What is "blind or lame"? Specifically, a blemish that is openly visible and does not revert to its former state. Said Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam, Ila (see Bekh. 6:8) would count blemishes in Yavneh and state them before the Sages, and they agreed with him. And another three he added. They said to him, "We have not heard about any one of these: That the eyeball is round like that of a human, and its mouth is like that of a pig, and that most of its tongue has been removed." And Rabbi Chananiah ben Antigonos said, "Most of the speaking part of the tongue." The Beit Din that came after them said, behold, these are [indeed] blemishes. The lower lip protrudes over the upper: Behold, that is a blemish. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, if the upper [lip] protrudes over the lower one, like that of a pig, behold, that is a blemish. [If] its mouth is swollen or its leg is swollen<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מובלמות</b> (see Bekh. 40b:5, Minchat Bikkurim here)</i>, on its own accord, it may be slaughtered; on account of the wind, it may not be slaughtered. [If] its ears were closed up with a single cartilage, it may not be slaughtered; with two cartilages, it may be slaughtered. Rabbi Chananiah ben Gamaliel says, the tail of a ewe that has three vertebrae in it, it may not be slaughtered; two -- it may be slaughtered. The tail of a calf that does not reach to its "joint" (<i>arkov</i>), behold, this one may be slaughtered. To which "joint" did they refer? Rabbi Chananiah ben Antigonos says, to the joint that is in the middle of the thigh (Bekh. 6:11), until the upper joint, and not until the lower joint.
There are things that are similar to blemishes and they may slaughter on their basis in the Temple, but they may not slaughter on their basis in the outlying areas, and they are these: The <i>gomim</i>, the <i>tzomeach</i>, the <i>tzumam</i>, and a female (<i>n'keivah</i>)<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "a female that has horns" (MS Vienna)</i>. What is a <i>gomim</i>? Anything that lacks horns. And a <i>tzomeach</i> is anything that lacks ears. A <i>tzumam</i>: One whose ears are closed up. Rabbi Ilai said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: An <i>androgynous</i>: It is [considered a] first-born male, and its blemish is upon it, [and] it may be slaughtered on account of [that blemish]. And the Sages say, sanctity does not rest upon it [<i>ab initio</i>]; rather, it may go out and pasture with the flock. Rabbi Shimon says, behold, it says (Deut. 16:19), "Every first-born that is born among your herds or among your flocks, the male you shall consecrate to Hashem your God," so that in every place where it says "male," it excludes the <i>tumtum</i> and the <i>androgynous</i> from the general rule.

Chapter 5

These blemishes (i.e., those mentioned above as to animals), whether permanent or transitory, are disqualifying in a person (i.e., a priest serving in the Temple) (Bekh. 7:1). In addition to those, [there are certain defects that are only considered blemishes] in a person: One whose neck is short or narrow, those who have leaky [eyes], those who are bald, and those who have no teeth. Those who are hump-backed are fit [to serve], but they are [nonetheless treated as] disqualified because of  their appearance. A eunuch by man and a eunuch by nature; one whose member is wounded, crushed, or severed; the <i>shachniah</i>; and the <i>sagris</i> [are all disqualified]. What is a <i>shachniah</i>? One whose eyebrows lie flat (i.e., thereby covering his eyes). A <i>sagris</i>? One who has one black eyebrow and one white. What is a <i>sakei shemesh</i> (Bekh. 7:3)? One who can see the room and the attic at the same time. He looks once and sees both. How so? He saw his fellow, and [his fellow] said, "I don't see." A sunken, drooping, or retreating nose. Crushed ears or pierced ears, or bleary eyes or overly round eyes or eyes that are too large or too small. "Too large" -- like those of a calf. "Too small" -- like those of a goose. And one who has spotted [hands], or if a melancholy spirit comes over him, or a fallen spirit (i.e., a demon spirit) has come upon him, [or if he is] an epileptic, even if only once in a long while.
What is a <i>meroach ashekh</i> (Lev. 21:20)? That refers to one suffering from a scrotal hernia, for the wind (<i>ruach</i>) enters his testicles, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says, that refers to one [whose testicles are] crushed (<i>shachuf</i>)... A superfluous [appendage]: If there was a bone in it, he is disqualified, and if not, he is fit. [What is the meaning of] "superfluous"? For example, that he had extra fingers in his hands or toes in his feet, six and six, [in which case] Rabbi Yehuda renders him fit and Rebbi renders him disqualified. Said Rabbi Yehuda, this matter came before Rabbi Tarfon, and he said, "High Priests such as these predominated in Israel." Rabbi Yosei said to him, rather, this is what he said: "Nitinim and mamzerim such as these decreased in Israel." One who is either left-handed or left-footed is disqualified [to serve in the Temple]. One who is equally dominant with both hands: Rebbi renders him disqualified and the Sages render him fit. One with unsteady eyes, and one with thick and connected eyebrows (<i>lipiz</i>), and one with no eyebrows (<i>timiz</i>), a <i>limiz</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per Jastrow, a variant of <i>lipiz</i> ("one with thick, connected eyebrows")</i>, and one who is white-spotted in the face (<i>l'vikan</i>), and one who is bandy-legged (<i>aklan</i>), and one who is crooked-legged (<i>ikshan</i>), and one who is club-footed (<i>kalban</i>), and one whose legs knock against one another (<i>kishan</i>), are disqualifying in a person, and fit in an animal.

Chapter 6

One who is born after the fallen (i.e., a stillbirth), even though [the stillborn] emerged in the eighth month or in the ninth month [of pregnancy], [or when] its head emerged [it was already] dead, [the subsequent newborn male] is a first-born for purposes of inheritance but is not a first-born for purposes of [redemption from] a priest, as it is said (Deut. 21:16), "He may not treat as a first-born the son of the beloved [wife], etc." This is the general rule: Anything whose head and most of its body emerged alive exempts that which comes after it from the [status of] first-born, but not the five selas of the son (i.e., the redemption price paid to the priest). Two wives of two men that had never given birth, and they gave birth in a hiding-place (e.g., in times of war (Jastrow)), and one of them died, the second one is a first-born for purposes of inheritance, but is not a first-born for purposes of the priest. [If] she and a priestess gave birth -- [or] she and a Levitess, [or] she and a woman who had already given birth -- to two males, [the one that is considered hers] is a first-born for purposes of the priest but is not a first-born for purposes of inheritance. [If] one of them died, or if they were male and female, [the one that is considered hers] is neither a first-born for purposes of inheritance, or for purposes of the priest.
There is one who gives [the redemption payment] on his own behalf, there is one whose father gives on his behalf, there is one as to whom both he and his father give, [and there is one as to whom] neither he nor his father give. Which is the one who gives on his own behalf? [If] his conception was not in sanctity and his birth was not in sanctity (i.e., his mother had neither converted by conception or by childbirth), he gives on his own behalf. One as to whom there was a doubt if he was born nine months [after the death of] the previous [husband], or seven months [after her marriage to] the subsequent [husband], he gives on his own behalf. Two wives of two men who had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males in a hiding-place, and one of them died, the second one gives on his own behalf.<br>Which is the one whose father gives on his behalf? Two wives of two men who had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males in a hiding-place, this [man] gives five selas and that [man] gives five selas to the priest. [If] one father gave five selas and he died, the other father is liable, and the sons are exempt. [If] she and a priestess gave birth -- [or] she and a Levitess, [or] she and a woman who had already given birth -- [to two males], his father gives on his behalf. [If] one of them died, or if they were male and female, neither he nor his father give.<br>Which is the one as to whom both he and his father give? Two wives of two men who had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males in a hiding-place, this [man] gives five selas to the priest, and that [man] gives five selas to the priest. [If] one father gave five selas and died, the other father is liable, and the sons are exempt. [If] one of the sons died, the other son is liable, and the fathers are exempt. [If] one father gave five selas and [then] one of the sons died, behold, all of them are exempt. [If there were two women,] one who had given birth and one who had never birth,  [married to] two men, and they gave birth to two males, and one one of them died within thirty days, behold, all of them are exempt.<br>Two wives of two men who had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males in a hiding-place, this [man] gives five selas to the priest, and that [man] gives five selas to the priest. [If] one father gave five selas to the priest and he died<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The printed text and MS Vienna read "and the sons died." However, this is not possible since they could not therefore be liable. Mitzpat Shmuel therefore references Bekh. 48a:2 (cf. Bekh. 8:3-8:4), involving the death of the father.</i> before the sons had divided up their fathers' property, they are liable. Once they had divided up their fathers' property, they are exempt. Rabbi Yehuda says, even once they divided up their fathers' property, if this one had ten dinars from his father and that one had ten dinars from his father (see MS Vienna), they are liable, and if not, they are exempt. Two women who had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males in a hiding-place, [and the women] gave ten selas to the priest, [and] one of them (i.e., the sons) died within thirty days, they may take them (i.e., the selas) out of his hand. Rabbi Yehuda says, if they gave to one priest, they may take them out of his hand, [but] if they gave to two priests, they may not take them out of his hand, because the one who takes something from his fellow bears the burden of proof.
Should he redeem himself or ascend [to Jerusalem] for a pilgrimage festival? He redeems himself and afterwards ascends for a pilgrimage festival. Rabbi Yehuda says, he ascends for a pilgrimage festival and afterwards redeems himself, for [the pilgrimage festival] is a commandment whose time elapses. Should he study Torah or marry a woman? He studies [Torah] and afterwards he marries a woman. Rabbi Yehuda says, if he is unable to sit down [to study Torah] without having a wife, he marries and afterwards he studies Torah. Should he study Torah or should his son study Torah? Should he marry a woman or should his son marry a woman? He takes precedence over his son. Rabbi Yehuda says, if his son is a bright student and the Torah becomes established in his hands, his son takes precedence. It so happened that there was someone who wanted his son to study Torah, and he subjected him to a vow not to engage in any work, and Rabbi Yosei permitted him to fill up a jug of water for him, and to kindle a lamp for him.
Five selas for a son; thirty for a slave (Ex. 21:32); fifty for a rape (Deut. 22:29-30) and for a seduction (Ex. 22:16); and one hundred for publicly defaming [a virgin] (Deut. 22:17-19): All of these [are paid] in the shekel of the Temple, and [calculated in the standard of] a Tyrian maneh (Bekh. 8:7). And all of these are redeemed with silver or with the equivalent of silver, except [for sacrifices purchased with funds contributed to the Temple's] collection of shekalim (see Shek. 4:4), the appearance-offering, and the redemption of second tithe, which may only come from coins.<br>[If he said,] "This calf is for the redemption of my son," his son is not redeemed. But if he said, "This calf, worth five selas, is for the redemption of my son," or "This cloak, worth five selas, is for the redemption of my son," his son is redeemed (see Kidd. 8a:8). But they may not redeem with slaves, nor with a promissory note, nor with land, and even if he said, "This slave, worth five selas, is for the redemption of my son," or "This land, worth five selas, is is for the redemption of my son," his son is not redeemed. [If] the father gave five selas to five priests, his son is redeemed. [If] he gave them to [the priest], this one after that one, and that one after the other (i.e., one sela at a time), his son is redeemed. And this is what Rabbi Tarfon would do: He would take them from [the father], and then he would go back and return them to him (Bekh. 51b:5).
A first-born may not take a double portion of an increase to the value of the property [that accrued] after their father's death. Rebbi says, I say that the first-born may take a double portion of an increase to the value of the property after their father's death, for even his<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שאף שלא</b> (Mitzpat Shmuel)</i> [portion] increased along with theirs. How so? He had an animal that was leased or rented to others, [or] pasturing in open territory, [and it gave birth,] the first-born takes a double portion.  The foreleg, the maw, and the jaw: Rebbi says, [as to] every item [of inheritance] that the orphans did not [have to] search for after their father's death, the first-born takes a double portion. And he only takes a "double portion as to all that which is found with him" (Deut. 21:17), but if they built a building, or planted a planting, everything [is divided] equally. One who takes a double portion, if he said, "I want that which was not taken, and that which was not given," he has the right to do so. 

Chapter 7

The cattle tithe applies to large and small [livestock], males and females, unblemished and blemished, and they tithe them from one year to the next, as it is said (Deut. 14:22), "You shall surely tithe [all the produce of your sowing, [and] that which emerges from the field, year after year]." The verse speaks of two types of tithe, one ("the produce of your sowing") being the grain tithe, and the other ("that which emerges from the field") being the cattle tithe, the words of Rabbi Akiva. And the Sages say, "year after year": Of that year you shall tithe, and you shall not tithe from one year to the next. A goat that gave birth to three female kids, and the kids [when grown] give birth to three each, they are brought into the pen to be tithed.  Says Rabbi Shimon, I saw a female goat whose one-year-old daughter was tithed. [If] he had an animal of two or three years of age, if he recognizes it as belonging to a certain year, she is brought into the pen to be tithed, [and] if not, she is not brought into the pen to be tithed.
Animals are combined for tithing [if they] can pasture within the distance that cattle wander. How much do cattle wander? Thirty-two mil (cf. Bekh. 9:2 ("Sixteen mil")). How so? If he had five in Kfar Chananiah, and five in Kfar Othney, and five in Kfar Tzippori, behold, they combine. Five in Kfar Chananiah and five in Kfar Othney<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">not "Kfar Tzippori" (see GR"A)</i>, [they would not be tithed] unless he had at least one in Tzippori. [If] he had [cattle] across the Jordan, on this side and on that side, for example, in HaShulmei and Namiri, or in two autonomous districts, they do not combine with each other, and it goes without saying [that this rule applies for cattle] in the Land [of Israel] and outside the Land. The river that flows from the Cave of Pamyas (Banias) and flows into the Lake of Sofnei, and into the Lake of Tiberias: Even though its name is the "Jordan," it has nothing to do with the Jordan [that separates the herds]. What, then, is that "Jordan"? From Beit Jericho and downward.
What is [included in the meaning of] "purchased" (Bekh. 9:3)? Anything that they sold him, and he returns and they purchased it from him, or which they gave him as a gift, and he goes back and they purchased it from him. But one who buys the fetus of a cow of his fellow, even though it gave birth in on the property of its owners, it is brought into the pen to be tithed.<br>Everything enters to be tithed, except for mixed-breeds and a <i>tereifa</i>, the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Yehuda Ish Bartuta, who spoke in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua. Said Rabbi Akiva, I heard in his name only that which is born via Caesarean section, and that which is born prematurely, and an orphan. But what are "mixed-breeds"? A ewe that was born from a goat, even if it resembles a [normal] sheep, and a goat that was born from a sheep, even if it resembles a [normal] goat. A <i>tereifa</i> is as it sounds. That which is born via Caesarean section is as it sounds. It may not [be tithed] if it is less than eight days old. Rabbi Shimon says, one that was born prematurely is brought into the pen to be tithed. 
[An animal] with whom a person had sexual relations, or which was set aside [for idolatry], or which had been worshipped, or which was the fee [of a whore] or the exchange [of a dog], or which was a <i>tumtum</i> or an <i>androgynous</i>: They are not brought into the pen to be tithed. Rabbi Shimon bar Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i> are not brought into the pan to be tithed, for in every place [in Scripture] that it says "male," it excludes a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i> from the rule.
What is the fee [of a whore]? Anyone who gave her [ownership in] the fetus of his cow, and he returned and bought it back from her. What is the price [of a dog]? Anyone who exchanges for it the fetus of his cow, and he returned and bought it back from him.  
There are three seasons (lit., "threshing floors") for cattle tithe: in the period adjacent to Passover, in the period adjacent to Shavuot, and in the period adjacent to Sukkot (Bekh. 9:5). They have no fixed period, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, they are not less then fifteen days before [each respective] pilgrimage festival. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the following is reproduced in Tos. Rosh Hashanah 1:6</i>, since these ones say "on the first of Elul," and those ones say "on the first of Tishrei," the "Eluls" will [only] tithe for themselves. How so? If five [calves] were born in Av and five in Elul, or five in Elul and five in Tishrei, they do not combine [to form ten]. [But] five in Tishrei and five in Av, behold, these do combine.
How do they tithe? They stand the mothers outside [the pen] and they bleat, and their young go out to meet them. [If] the eighth and ninth go out at the same time, behold, he completes his count on their behalf (i.e., they are included in the count). The ninth and the tenth: He sends them out to pasture until they develop a blemish. The tenth and the eleventh: They all shall die. [If] he was counting them one by one, and one died, or one by one, and one was slaughtered<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נשחתו</b> (see MS Vienna)</i>, behold, he completes his count on their behalf. [If] he was counting and his fellow greeted him to speak with him, behold, he completes his count on their behalf [despite the interruption].<br>[If] he was counting and it became dark, on Sabbath Eve, behold, he completes his count on their behalf. [If] he was counting and the head and most of the body [of one of them] protruded from the [fence of the] pen and returned, behold, it is like those that are counted in every respect. [If] he counted them crouching or standing (Bekh. 9:7), behold, he  completes his count on their behalf. [If] he was counting and it jumped from those that were counted to those that were not counted, if he can recognize it, he is exempt and they are liable, and if not, behold, they are all exempt. [If] an orphan became intermingled with them, or one that had been purchased, behold, they are all exempt. [If] he had ten and counted up to five, and one died among those that had been counted, behold, he completes his count on their behalf. [If the one that died was] from those that had not been counted, those who he had counted are exempt, and the remainder will be combined with those of the next [tithing] season. [If] he had fifteen, he should not say, "I will bring ten of them into the pen"; rather "I will bring all of them," and he counts ten of them, and the remainder will be tithed the following year.<br>[If] he counted them backwards, the tenth of all of them is consecrated. [If] he called the ninth one "the ninth," the tenth one "the tenth," [and] the eleventh one "the eleventh" (i.e., in the correct order), the ninth is unconsecrated, the  tenth is consecrated, [and] the eleventh is unconsecrated. [But if] he called the ninth one "the tenth," and the tenth one "the ninth," and the eleventh one "the eleventh," the ninth is eaten in its blemished state, the tenth is tithe, and the eleventh is brought as a peace offering. [If] he called the ninth one "the ninth," the tenth one "the ninth," and the eleventh one "the tenth," the ninth is unconsecrated, the tenth is tithe, and the eleventh is brought as a peace offering. [If] he called the ninth one "the tenth," the tenth one "the ninth," and the eleventh one "the tenth," all three of them are consecrated: The ninth is eaten in its blemished state, the tenth is tithed, and the eleventh is brought as a peace offering or exchanged [for other offerings].<br>An animal that got mixed up with one of doubtful status for cattle tithe during these times (i.e., post-destruction) shall be sent out to pasture until it develops a blemish. A doubt as to whether it was [the tenth or] the eleventh, behold, all of them shall die. The cattle tithe of orphans: They sell it, for [that situation] is like one who returns a lost object to its owners. A tithed animal that was slaughtered: Its sinews, and its horns, and its bones, and its hooves, and its fats, and its hide, and its shearing, behold, they are all permitted.
