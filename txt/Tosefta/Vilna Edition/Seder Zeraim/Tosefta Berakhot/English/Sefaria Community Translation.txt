Tosefta Berakhot



Chapter 1





The grooms and all [others] who are involved in [other] Mitzvot (commandments) are exempt from reading [the] Shema and from [the Amidah] prayer and from Tefillin (phylacteries), as it is said, “… when you sit in your house”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) which excludes grooms, “and when you walk on the way”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) which excludes those who are involved in mitzvot.

Chapter 2

One who says the Shema must remember the exodus from Egypt when saying "Emet V'Yatziv". Rabbi [Yehuda] says that one must remember the [Davidic] kingship. Aherim say that one  must remember the slaying of the first born and the dividing of the Red Sea. 

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

A person should not taste anything until he makes a Beracha (blessing) [on it], as it is said, “To Hashem is the Earth and its fullness…” (Psalms 24:1) [A person] who receives pleasure from this world without a Beracha makes inappropriate use of sacred property, until all of the Mitzvot (commandments) [that must be done over this object] will permit it to him. A person should use his face, his hands and his feet only for the honor of his Creator, as it is said, “Every creation of Hashem is for His sake.” (Proverbs 16:4)
The Beracha (blessing) that is made on date honey, apple cider and vinegar made from autumn grapes is the same as the Beracha made on fish brine.
The Beracha (blessing) for undiluted wine is Borei Pri Haetz (Who created the fruit of the tree) and it (i.e. undiluted wine) can be used to wash hands. [If] he added water into it, [then] the Beracha on it [becomes] Borei Pri Hagafen (Who created the fruit of the vine) and it (i.e. diluted wine) cannot be used to wash hands. [These are] the words of Rebbi Eliezer. And the Chachamim (Sages) say, “Whether this one (i.e. undiluted wine) or that one (i.e. diluted wine), the Beracha on it is Borei Pri Hagafen and it cannot be used to wash hands.”
