Tosefta Maaser Sheni



Chapter 1

Second tithe [produce]: One may not sell it, use it as collateral, pawn it, exchange it, or weigh gold dinars against it, even in order to deconsecrate other second tithe produce on their behalf. Nor may one given them to a moneychanger or use them to create a good impression (i.e., of one's business), to repay a debt, or to make oneself appear wealthy (לְהִתְעַשֶׁר) through them.  If it is so that they will not become moldy, behold, that is permitted.
How so, "one may not sell it"? One should not say to another, "Take two hundred and give me a maneh." How so, "one may not use it as collateral"? One should not enter [a debtor's] house and take his second tithe [produce] as collateral. How so, "one may not pawn it"? One should not say to another, "Take this tithe and it let it stay in your possession, and give me unconsecrated [produce] on its behalf." How so, "one may not exchange it"? One should not say to another, "Take this wine and give me that oil," [or] "Take this oil and give me that wine." Rather, one says to him, "Take this wine because I don't have oil," and the other says to him, "Take this oil because I don't have wine."  It comes out that they have exchanged [in fact] but they have not exchanged [contractually], and each one does a favor to the other.
Second tithe [produce] may not be applied to a rash or to a callous, nor may it be made into an amulet.
They may not redeem second tithe [produce] with uncoined metal (Maaser Sheni 1:2), but Rabbi Dosa permits it. But small coins bearing the insignia of a bathhouse (i.e., used as tender for entry to a public bathhouse) -- all agree that they may not redeem it with them.
They may not redeem it either with coins of the rebellion,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מרוד</b> not <b>מדור</b>, see GR"A, MSS</i> or with uncirculated coins, or with money that is not in one's possession. How so? If he had <i>Kozibian</i> money (i.e., coins minted following the Bar Kochba (Koziba) revolt)<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">This appears to be the only direct mention of Bar Kochba in the Tosefta, and there are no direct mentions in the Mishna.</i> or Jerusalem money, they may not redeem it with them  (i.e., those coins). If it was [nonetheless] redeemed, they may not purchase tithe with them, but [as to] coins circulated by the early kings, they may redeem it for them. They may not redeem it either with money from here<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>של כאן=שכן</b> (see Lieberman)</i> that is in Babylonia, nor with [Babylonian] money that is in Babylonia, but if he was here and he had money from Babylonia, they may redeem it with them. How so, "They may not redeem [second tithe] with money that is not in his possession"? If he had money in a camp<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>קצטרא</b> not  <b>קיסטרא</b> (=tin), see Lieberman; alt., <b>קיסטרא</b> (=a large, unwieldy vessel), see GR"A; alt., <b>קסטרא</b> (=Castra, a locale), see Minchat Yitzchak. Despite the uncertainty re: the exact wording, the unifying idea is that the money is not presently available or accessible.</i> or in the King's hill country<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בהר המלך</b>; it appears that <b>בית המלך</b> (=palace) is a misprint</i>, or that fell from his purse into a pit -- even if he knows that it's there, they may not redeem it with them, and if it was [nonetheless] redeemed, he may not purchase tithe [with that money].
Similarly, one who comes along the road with coins in his hand, and he sees a robber coming toward him: He should not say, "Behold, these are hereby deconsecrated on account for the coins that I have inside my house." [However,] if he did so, his words stand. [If] he was laden with jugs of wine or jugs of oil and saw that they were breaking, he should not say, "Behold, these are hereby designated as terumah and tithes on behalf of the produce that I have inside my house." If he he did so, behold, that is forbidden.
One may purchase wild animals and fowl [in Jerusalem] for "meat for one's craving" (see Deut. 12:20 and Deut. 14:26), but not for peace offerings. From the time that they decreed that "meat for one's craving" defiles the hands, they said, one may not purchase a wild animal for "meat for one's craving," but one may purchase fowl for "meat for one's craving." Rabbi Elazar ben Yehuda, a man from Avlin (אבלין) says, one also cannot [purchase] fowl for "meat for one's craving," since all the wine-pressing is done on top of "meat for one's craving" that is impure vis-a-vis consecration and pure (alt., "impure," Lieberman) for terumah.
One who purchases an open jug in Jerusalem needs to consume the equivalent [value] of the storage vessel<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מרוד</b>see Bartenura to Maaser Sheni 1:3</i>; sealed, there is no need to consume the equivalent [value] of the storage vessel. When do these words apply? With regards to wine; however, with regards to [jugs of] vinegar brine, or fish brine, or oil, or honey, whether open or sealed, there is no need to consume the equivalent [value] of the storage vessel.









Second tithe oil and unconsecrated choice perfumes (ראשי בשמים, see Songs 4:14) that got mixed, the increase in value [is measured] according to the proportion. This is the general rule: Said Rabbi Yosei, whatever increases in measure [as a result of being mixed with unconsecrated produce], [if] the improvement [in value] can be recognized, the improvement [is calculated] according to the proportion, [and] whatever does not increase in measure, [if] the improvement [in value] can be recognized, the [entire] improvement [goes] to second tithe (see Maaser Sheni 2.1).

Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4






[In the case of] two brothers, or two business partners, or a father and his son — they may redeem each other's second tithe [<i>ma'aser sheni</i>] and give each other the tithe for the poor. Rabbi Yehudah said, "A curse should come to one who gives the tithe for the poor to his father." [They said to him, "What if they were] both poor?"











One who set aside an <i>issar</i> and ate [food worth] half its value on account of it, and then went to another place and behold, it (i.e., the <i>issar</i>) came out to [the value of] a <i>pundion</i> (the equivalent of two <i>issars</i>) (Maaser Sheni 4:8): He may eat another <i>issar's</i> worth on account of it. One who sets aside a <i>pundion</i> and he ate [food worth] half its value on account of it, and then went to another place and behold, it came out to an <i>issar</i>, he may eat half an <i>issar</i>'s worth on its account. This is the general rule: Before one has redeemed [second tithe], whatever increases [in value], the increase is [calculated] according to the proportion, and whatever decreases in value, the decrease is [calculated] according to the proportion. Once it has been redeemed, whatever increases [in value], the increase belongs to second [tithe], and whatever decreases, the decrease belongs to second [tithe].

Chapter 5







One who says to his children, even if you are dying, do not touch this corner-shelf (זוית), [and] they went and found coins there -- behold, these are [considered] unconsecrated. [If] they saw their father hiding coins in a chest, in an ark, or in a cupboard, and he said, "These belong to so-and-so," [or] "These are second tithe," if [he said it] like those who deceive (e.g., the coins actually were his or were unconsecrated), he has said nothing.  [But] if [he said it] like one who intends to testify, his words stand. [If] someone said to them, "I saw your father hiding [coins] in a chest, in an ark, or in a cupboard," [his words are treated like] he has said nothing.  "In such-and-such a place," [or] "In such-and-such a field (שדה not שידה)," his words stand. This is the general rule: Whatever is accessible [only] to them (i.e., the descendants), he has said nothing, [and] whatever is not accessible [only] to them, his words stand.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, in the first case, the witness's testimony is not accepted because he lacked the ability take the coins for himself, as they were hidden in the father's house, but in the second case, he is believed, since he presumably could have taken the coins from the field or another outside location (see Sanh. 30a:6-8).</i>
