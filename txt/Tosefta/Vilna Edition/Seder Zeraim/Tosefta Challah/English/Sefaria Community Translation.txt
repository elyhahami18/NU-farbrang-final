Tosefta Challah



Chapter 1

Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, even <i>keramit</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a type of wild wheat normally used as animal feed, but which can be used for human consumption if necessary (see Pes. 35a:11)</i> renders one liable in challah. Rabbi Yishmael son of Rabbi Yosei says in the name of his father, what is <i>chalut</i> (see Hal. 1:6)? Flour poured into hot [water]. And <i>ma'aiseh</i>? Hot [water] into flour. And the Sages say, either this one or that one, [if] it is made with a stew-pot or a boiling pot, it is exempt. In the oven, it is liable.
[With respect to] provisions belonging to a Jew, or [a store belonging to a Jew with] Gentile workers who work inside of it, it is liable in challah. Provisions belonging to a Gentile, or [a store belonging to a Gentile with] Jewish workers who work inside of it, it is exempt from challah. One who makes starter dough for the masses is liable in challah. One who makes [starter] dough<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עיסה</b>, as opposed to <b>בצק</b> ("risen dough"); except where otherwise indicated, the term "dough" will refer to <b>עיסה</b></i> [intended] for eating as risen dough, it is liable in challah.
Parched flour that was rounded and made into dough is liable in challah. Dough that was taxed is liable in challah because [the owner] is liable for that which he is responsible, until the moment that he hands it over [to the taxing authorities]. Second tithe in Jerusalem is liable in challah. Doubtful <i>medumma</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., unconsecrated produce that may have been mixed with terumah</i> is liable in challah, the words of Rabbi Meir. And Rabbi Yosei exempts it and the Sages say, <i>medumma</i> is exempt from challah, but doubtful <i>medumma</i> is eaten  [by the Kohanim] on account of <i>dema</i> (i.e., the potential terumah within the mixture), and is liable in challah.
Said Rabbi Ilai, I asked Rabbi Yehoshua, "The loaves of the thanksgiving offering and the wafers of a nazir, what is their [status] in challah?" He said to me, "They are exempt." And when I came and asked Rabbi Eliezer, he said to me, "They exempt themselves, [but] to sell in the market, they are liable" (see Hal. 1:6). When I recounted these words before Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, he said to me, "By the covenant! These words were spoken from Mount Horeb!"
Rabbi Yehuda says, dough for dogs, [the status can be determined] from the manner it was prepared.  If it was made into cakes, it is liable. If it was made into strips, it is exempt.
A Kohen who had flour left over when he was making his dough, and so too a woman who had flour left over from her dough, the flour and the leaven join together to [add up to] five fourths [of a <i>kav</i>] to forbid the dough. Said Rabbi Yehuda, for what reason did they say, the homeowner [takes out] one twenty-fourth (Hal. 2:7)? Because he is generous (lit., "he has kind eyes") with his dough. [But as to] a baker, [who need only take out] one forty-eighth, it is because he is stingy (lit., "he has narrow eyes") with his dough. And the Sages say, No. It is not for that reason; rather, the homeowner's dough is little, and there is not enough of it for a [meaningful] gift to the Kohen. [But as to] a baker, his dough is abundant, and there is enough of it for a gift to the Kohen (i.e., even at a smaller fraction).
One who buys from a baker or from a woman who makes [dough] to sell in the marketplace needs to separate challah as <i>demai</i>. From a homeowner or from the lodgers at his place, he does not need to separate challah as <i>demai</i>. [Rather,] he removes from it one forty-eighth. Rabbi Shimon says, even if only one sixtieth came up in his hand, he has fulfilled [his obligation].
Whoever cannot prepare his dough in purity, he may prepare it in <i>kavim</i> (which would not render him liable in challah), but he should not prepare it [in larger quantities] in impurity. Rabbi Akiva says, he should prepare it in impurity, and should not prepare it in <i>kavim</i>, for just as he may designate [challah] over the pure, so too he may designate over the impure. On this one he designates it as challah by name, and on that one he designates it as challah by name. But <i>kavim</i>, they have no portion in the name [of challah]. They said before Rabbi Akiva, one does not say to a person, "stand up and sin in order to gain merit, [or] stand up and bring ruin so that you can rectify it".   
Rabbi Eliezer says, challah may be removed from the pure on behalf of the impure (Hal. 2:8). They said before Rabbi Yishmael, "Is there not so-and-so in the south, and did he not teach this teaching?" He said to them, "By the [priestly] garments that my father wore, and the gold plate (<i>tzitz</i>) that he placed between his eyes, if I will not educate any teacher who teaches such a thing!" They said to him that it was in the name of Rabbi Eliezer. He said to them, "In that case, he must have something to rely in."
A woman who declares her dough ownerless (שהפקירה (see Lieberman)), or who sold it, or who gave it away as a present is exempt, until she rolls it out in the case of wheat [flour], or until it is mixed into a cohesive mass in the case of barley [flour]. She is not liable in challah until there is a sufficient quantity of grain. [If] she rolled it out in the case of wheat, or she mixed it into a cohesive mass in the case of barley, even though there is only an olive's bulk in each one, she is liable in challah (i.e., since the total amount exceeded the minimum).
[If] a doubt as to impurity arose in dough before she rolled it, she should prepare it in purity (alt., "impurity" (see Lieberman)). Once she rolled it, she may prepare it in impurity (alt., "purity" (ibid.)), and its challah [has the status of] suspended [impurity]. <i>About which doubt were they speaking?</i> About a matter of doubt as to the challah. And so too produce as to which arose a doubt as to impurity. [If the doubt arose] before its work was completed, [the remaining work] may be performed in purity (alt., "impurity"). Once its work is completed, it must be performed in impurity (alt., "purity"), and its terumah [has the status of] suspended [impurity]. <i>About which doubt were they speaking?</i> About a matter of doubt as to the terumah.
A convert who converted and he had dough that was [previously] prepared: [If he converted] before a crust formed on the surface [of the bread], he is liable, [but] once a crust formed on the surface, he is exempt, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, before it was rolled out in the case of wheat, or it was mixed it into a cohesive mass in the case of barley, it is liable. Once it has been rolled out in the case of wheat, or it has been mixed into a cohesive mass in the case of barley, it is exempt. Others say in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, once it was made into separate cuttings. 

Chapter 2

One who prepares dough from wheat and from rice, Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says, she is not liable in challah until the grain [itself] has [at least] the minimum quantity, and a person does not fulfill his obligation on Passover until [the matzah] has [at least] the minimum quantity.
One who removes leaven from dough from which challah has not been raised up (i.e., separated), and puts it inside dough from which challah has been raised up, behold, this one brings flour from a different place and combines it [with the first batch] so that [it is at least] five-fourths [of a <i>kav</i>] in order to render it liable according to the calculation [of the quantity of the new dough and the leaven].
A <i>kav</i> on one side, and a <i>kav</i> on the other side, and a <i>kav</i> of new grain in the middle; a <i>kav</i> on this side, and a <i>kav</i> on that side, and a <i>kav</i> of barley in the middle, behold, they combine together [to form a quantity of dough that is liable in challah]. [The Sages then] added to [the list]: A <i>kav</i> on this side, and a <i>kav</i> on that side, and a <i>kav</i> from another woman in the middle; or a <i>kav</i> on this side and a <i>kav</i> on that side, and a <i>kav</i> of something whose challah had already been removed in the middle, behold, these combine together. A <i>kav</i> on this side, and a <i>kav</i> on that said, and a <i>kav</i> of a Gentile in the middle; a <i>kav</i> on this side, and a <i>kav</i> on that side, and <i>kav</i> of rice in the middle; a <i>kav</i> on this side, and a <i>kav</i> on that side, and a <i>kav</i> of terumah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>תרומה</b> not <b>מרובה</b> (see Lieberman)</i> in the middle, these do not combine together. A <i>kav</i> of wheat and a <i>kav</i> of barley and a <i>kav</i> of spelt in the middle, behold, these combine<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the spelt combines with the wheat to render it liable in challah, and also combines with the barley to render it liable (Lieberman)</i>, [but] when he takes terumah, he takes terumah from each and every one [separately], for one does not take terumah from one species on behalf of a different species. Half a <i>kav</i> of wheat and half a <i>kav</i> of barley and half a <i>kav</i> of spelt, he removes challah from the spelt [on behalf of all three]. Said Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, one who removes challah from a <i>kav</i> (i.e., less than the minimum quantity to render dough liable), to whom is he similar? To one who takes terumah from produce that has not grown to [at least] a third [of its expected size], for his terumah is not terumah. <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The following sentence ("And the Sages say...") appears in MS Erfurt but not in the printed version.</i>And the Sages say, [he is similar] to one who takes terumah from fruits that did not complete their work, for his terumah is not terumah (Ter. 1:10). They went back and said, neither this nor that; for behold, this <i>kav</i> is able to combine with others.
Impure flour that got mixed up with pure flour, and there is not enough of the impure [to render one liable in challah], once he removes it, he says, behold, this is challah, except for the impure that is inside it. Impure wheat that got mixed up with pure wheat and there is not enough of the impure, once he takes terumah, he says, behold, this is terumah, except for the impure that is inside of it.
Said Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tzadok, even though Rabban Gamaliel exempted tenants of land in Syria, it is forbidden to be a land tenant [in the first place in Syria], [but] if one was a land tenant, behold, he is exempt as long he does not harvest [produce] and others bundle on his behalf, or harvest grapes and others tread on them on his behalf, or harvest olives and others press them on his behalf. Rather, they harvest [produce] and he bundles on their behalf, they harvest grapes and he treads on them on their behalf, and they harvest olives and he presses them on their behalf. And so too Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tzadok says, Rabban Gamaliel did not render one liable in Syria except for one [portion of] challah only.
One who purchases from a baker in Syria needs to separate challah as <i>demai</i>, the words of Rabban Gamaliel. And the Sages say, there is no need to separate challah as <i>demai</i>. From the river south of Cheziv and onward, two [portions] of challah [must be separated] as <i>demai</i>. Rabbi Shimon says, if he did not raise up the first of [at least] the minimum quantity, he may not do so from the second.
Loaves of Gentiles outside the Land [of Israel] and terumah of Gentiles outside the Land, they let him know (מודיעין אותו (see Lieberman)) that it is not liable in challah, and it may be eaten by non-Kohanim.
Twenty-four priestly gifts were given to Aharon and his sons, in particular, in general and with an everlasting covenant. These are they: ten in the Temple, four in Jerusalem and ten in the surrounding environs. Ten in the Temple: sin offering, guilt offering, communal peace offerings, bird sin offerings, conditional guilt offerings, the oil of the leper's offering, the two loaves of Shavuot, the weekly showbread, the remains of the flour offerings and the Omer offering. Four in Jerusalem:  first born animals, first fruits, the elevated portions of the thanksgiving and Nazirite offerings, and the skins of the sacred offerings. Ten in the surrounding environs: the terumah portion of produce, the terumah taken from the Levitical tithe, the first bread (challah), the first fleece, the shoulder, cheek and stomach portion, redemption of the first born male child, redemption of the first born donkey, devoted offerings, a devoted ancestral field which was not redeemed, returned property stolen from a convert who is dead. All of these were give to Aharon and his sons in general, in particular and with an everlasting covenant in order to create an obligation on the whole and on each particular, to grant a reward on the whole and on each particular. One who transgresses and withholds them is as if they transgressed both on the whole and the particular. 
What is considered "the Land [of Israel]" and what is considered "outside the Land [of Israel]"? From the slopes of Taurus Amanus inwards is the "Land of Israel," from Taurus Amanus to the outside is "outside the Land." About the islands in the sea, one looks at them as if a string were drawn from Taurus Amanus to the rivers of Egypt: from the string to the inside is the "Land of Israel," from the string to the outside is "outside the Land." Rabbi Yehudah said, all that lies before the Land of Israel is like the Land of Israel since it is said (Num. 34:6): “The Eastern border shall be for you the Great Sea as border.” It is as if a string were drawn from Cephalaria to the Ocean, inside the string is the "Land of Israel," and outside is "outside the Land."
A boat that comes from outside the Land to the Land, and it had dough in it: [If it entered the land] before a crust formed on its surface, it is liable. Once a crust formed on its surface, it is exempt.
