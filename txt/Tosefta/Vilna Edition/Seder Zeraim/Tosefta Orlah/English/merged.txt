Tosefta Orlah



Chapter 1

One who plants [a fruit tree] to make a fence, for beams, or for firewood<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">compare Orlah 1:1 (lacking "or for firewood")</i>, it is exempt from orlah. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, to what case do these words apply? To a situation where he planted [a fruit tree] to make a fence, for beams, or for firewood, which are things that are fitting for [such trees]. But if he planted to make a fence, for beams, or for firewood, which are things that are not fitting for [such trees], he is liable in orlah. [If] he planted it for firewood, and then he reconsidered and [decided that the tree would be] for eating, from what time does he [begin to] count it[s years]? From the moment that he planted it.
One who plants for [the benefit of] the masses: [The tree] is liable, and Rabbi Yehuda exempts it. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in his own name, [as to] one who plants for the masses, [the tree] is liable in orlah. That which grows on its own<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מאיליו</b> ( MS Erfurt)</i> for the masses is exempt from orlah.
One who plants on a boat, in a flowerpot, or on top of the roof: [The tree] is liable<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "exempt" (MS Erfurt, MS Vienna)</i> in orlah. [If] it was planted in an unperforated flowerpot, [and thereafter the flowerpot] broke and he went back and replanted it in a perforated flowerpot, if it could have lived on its own, it is liable, and if not, it is exempt. How would he know if it can live on its own or not? He digs a hole in the ground and plants [the tree] inside of it. If it can live on its own, it is liable, and if not, it is exempt.
A tree that grows either from the trunk or from the roots is liable [in the laws of orlah]. Rabbi Yehuda says, one that grows from the trunk is liable, [but] from the roots is exempt. [If] he consecrated it and afterwards planted it, it is exempt. [If] he planted it and afterwards consecrated and redeemed it, from when [are its years] counted [for purposes of orlah]? From the moment he planted it.
A Gentile who grafts a fruit-bearing tree onto a barren tree: It[s years are] counted from the moment he planted it. Rabbi Yosei says, they may plant young  orlah shoots, but they may not plant orlah nuts, because they are fruit. And they may not graft orlah date-berries. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, powdered dye of orlah is lifted up (i.e., nullified) at two hundred and one [to one]. [If] a liquid dye made from one of them is [inadvertently poured] into a mixture [of permitted dyes], we follow after the majority.
Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, meat with milk is permitted to derive benefit from. Blemished [animals] are forbidden [to benefit from] in any amount. Rabbi Yosei says, blemished [animals] should be inspected [by an expert]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., before declaring them unfit</i>.
An oven that they fired with peels of orlah: If it is new (i.e., fired for the first time), he must break it. If it is old, he lets it cool down. [If] he baked or cooked with [orlah] coals, it is permitted. The ashes<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אפר</b> not <b>אפה</b> (see GR"A)</i> of any of them are permitted except for the wood of an Asherah. The ashes of leprous clothes, and the ashes of a leprous house (Lev. 14:34), are forbidden to derive benefit from.
Doubtful orlah in the Land of Israel is forbidden in Syria. [Doubtful orlah] outside the Land is permitted [in Syria]. How so? A vineyard or a field in which vegetables were planted (i.e., causing kilayim), and the vegetables were sold outside of [the vineyard or field], its doubtful status renders it forbidden in the Land of Israel, but permitted in Syria and outside the Land. Rabbi Yehuda says, even this doubtful status renders it forbidden in Syria. What doubtful status renders it permitted in Syria (i.e., according to Rabbi Yehuda)? A vineyard in which vegetables were planted or a field with vegetables [growing] on its side, and the vegetables were sold outside of it, its doubtful status renders it forbidden in the Land of Israel and permitted in Syria and outside the Land. Behold, if a small amount of plants were found [unintentionally growing] inside in his field, its doubtful status renders it forbidden in the Land of Israel, and permitted in Syria and outside the Land. Rabbi Eliezer b'Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Dormaskit, who said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, who said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the Great, "There is no orlah outside the Land."
