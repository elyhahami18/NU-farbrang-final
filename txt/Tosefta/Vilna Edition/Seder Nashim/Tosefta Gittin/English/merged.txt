Tosefta Gittin



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3


















In a city that has both Jews and Gentiles, those who oversee the communal fund should collect from both Jews and Gentiles for the sake of peace. So should they distribute to the poor Gentile and the poor Jew alike for the sake of peace. One should eulogize and bury the deceased Gentile for the sake of peace, and one should comfort the mourning Gentile for the sake of peace.
