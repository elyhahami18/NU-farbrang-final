Tosefta Nazir



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4






Rabbi Shim'on Shezuri says: a man throws [his hair] under the cauldron, but a woman does not throw it under the cauldron, on account of the young priests. How would he throw it? He would put juice upon it and throw it under the cauldron of peace-offerings. If he threw it under the cauldron of sin-offerings or of guilt-offerings he has fulfilled his obligation. Said R. Shim'on the Righteous: in my days I never ate a naziritic guilt-offering except for one occasion when one man came from the south, and I saw he was good-looking and handsome with curled locks. I declared to him, "What have you seen, to destroy such beautiful hair?" He declared to me, "I was a shepherd in my city, and I went to fill up on water from the well, and I gazed at my reflection and my inclination rose upon me and sought to make me transgress from the world. I said to it, 'Wicked one! You can only incite what is not yours, what is bound to be dust and worms and maggots. Behold, I am going to shave you for the sake of heaven.'" I lowered my head and hissed him and I said, "May more be like you, doing the will of the Omnipresent in Israel. Upon you it fulfilled what is said: 'A man or woman who is marvelous, to vow a vow of naziriteship to be a nazirite to the LORD.'"
