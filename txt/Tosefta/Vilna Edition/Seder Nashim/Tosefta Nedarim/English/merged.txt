Tosefta Nedarim



Chapter 1

One who says, "Right," behold, that is an [expression of an] oath. "Left," behold, that is an oath. "In the Name," behold, that is an oath. "For the Name," behold, that is a sacrifice.
[One who says,] "Like the vow of the wicked," [it is as though] he has not said anything, for the wicked do not vow in the manner of the vows of the upright. Rabbi Yehuda says, one may vow regarding being a nazirite, for the early [generations] of pious men (chasidim), would vow to be a nazirite, for the Place did not give them an opportunity to bring a sacrifice for [even] an inadvertent sin (i.e., since they never committed such a sin, much less an intentional sin). [Therefore,] they would make a vow to be a nazirite so that they would be able to bring a sacrifice. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, [one who wished to vow] "in the manner of the vows of the upright" did not vow regarding being a nazirite, for the early [generations] of pious men would <i>not</i> vow to be a nazirite, for if one desires to bring a burnt offering, one can bring peace-offering, one can bring a thanksgiving offering, and four types of bread offerings (Lev. 7:12). They would [also] not vow to be a nazirite, because they require atonement [equivalent to one who had contact with a corpse], as it is said (Num. 6:11), "And he shall effect atonement for one, in that one became contaminated by the corpse." 
One who says, "I do not vow" -- behold, he is permitted (i.e., his vow is absolved). "I have already vowed" -- behold, he is forbidden (i.e., his vow is not absolved). "That which I taste of yours shall be a sacrifice" -- he is permitted. "That which I do not taste of yours should be a sacrifice" -- he is forbidden.
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, one who says, "<i>moheh</i>" and the one who says "<i>mohi</i>," behold, they are epithets for an oath.
And so too would Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel say, two that had vowed, each one against [benefit from] the other: [If] one of them said to his fellow, "This is already a sacrifice if I tasted it," [and] his fellow said to him, "It is not a sacrifice if you tasted it,"   [or he said] "I am hereby a nazir if I have already eaten it," [and his fellow said] "I am not a nazir if we ate it," anyone who nullifies his words is forbidden.
