Tosefta Yevamot



Chapter 1

When did they say that if they<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> i.e., any of a man's wives who would be forbidden to his brother in yibbum (levirate marriage) due to being close blood-relatives of the brother</i> died or were divorced, their rival wives are permitted (Yevamot 1:1)? During their husband's life, but after their husband's death, their rival wives are forbidden. [If a minor wife] performed miyun (a declaration of refusal) during the life of their husband, their rival wives are permitted; after their husband's death, their rival wives perform chalitzah (the ritual of removing the shoe, Deut. 25:9) and are not subject to yibbum. And all who are found to be aylonot (showing no sign of puberty by the age of 20), or who had been married to others, either during during the life of their husband or after the death of their husband, their rival wives are permitted. Any who could have performed miyun but did not perform miyun, and [her husband] died, her rival wife performs chalitzah and is not subject to yibbum. How so? If they died, their rival wives are permitted. [If] she was his daughter or any of those forbidden relationships with relatives (i.e., the fifteen mentioned in Yevamot 1:1), [if] she was married to his brother and he had another wife, [if] his daughter (i.e., who had married his brother) died and afterwards his brother died, her rival wife is permitted.<br> If his daughter’s rival wife went and married his second brother, and he had another wife (Yevamot 1:2), and his brother died and afterwards her rival wife, even though his daughter remains [living], the rival of her rival wife is permitted. [If] the rival of her rival wife died and afterwards his brother died, even though his daughter remains [living], her rival wife is forbidden, even if there are a hundred. It turns out that one can say, whenever the brothers are many, the rival wives are many; the brothers are few, the rival wives are few. Just as if they died or performed miyun or divorced or were found to be aylanot or that were married to others, their rival wives are permitted, so too [as to] the rivals of their rival wives who died or who performed miyun or divorced or were found to be aylanot or that were married to others, their rival wives are permitted.<br>Just as they exempt from marriage, so too they exempt from betrothal. When do these words apply? In regards to a woman whose betrothal has not taken effect, but as as to a woman whose betrothal has taken effect, the rival wives perform chalitzah and are not subject to yibbum, the words of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai permit the rival wives to the brothers [of the deceased].
Six forbidden relationships with relatives are more serious than these, because since they can only be married to others, their rival wives are permitted (Yevamot 1:3): His mother and his father's wife and his father's sister and his father's sister and his brother's wife from his father and his father's brother's wife, for there is only a rival wife as to a brother. [If] their marriage to the brothers did not involve a transgression, their rival wives are exempt. [If] those rival wives went and married, Beit Shammai say, they are unfit and their offspring is unfit, and Beit Hillel say, they are fit and their offspring is fit. [If] they had yibbum performed on them, Beit Shammai say, they are fit and their offspring is fit, and Beit Hillel say, they are unfit and their offspring is a mamzer. Said Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri: Come and see, how can this halacha [ever] take effect in Israel [given the dispute between the two houses]? If it is established according to the words of Beit Shammai, the offspring will be a mamzer according to the words of Beit Hillel. If it is established according to the words of Beit Hillel, the offspring will be of flawed lineage (paggum) according to the words of Beit Shammai. Rather, [they said,] "Let us enact a general decree that the rival wives perform chalitzah and are not subject to yibbum." But they didn't have enough time to conclude the matter before the hour was ripped from their hands (i.e., due to the Roman persecutions). Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel: What should we do with the earlier rival wives? They asked Rabbi Yehoshua, "What is the status of the children of those rival wives?" He said to them, "Why are you inserting my head between two great mountains -- between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel -- so that they will smash my skull? Rather, I can testify about the family of Beit Aluvei from Beit Tzevaim, and about the family of Beit Kufei from Beit M'koshesh, that they were the children of rival wives, and from them descended priests, and they were sacrificing offerings on top of the Altar." Said Rabbi Tarfon, I would love to have the rival wife of a daughter, and I would marry her into the priesthood. Said Rabbi Eliezer, even though Beit Shammai were divided against Beit Hillel regarding rival wives, they agree that the offspring is not a mamzer, for a mamzer can only be born from a woman who is forbidden through a forbidden relationship with a relative, and as to which they would render her liable for excision (karet).
Even though Beit Shammai were divided against Beit Hillel regarding rival wives and sisters, and regarding women of doubtful marital status, and regarding old bills of divorce, and regarding one who betroths a woman with the equivalent of a perutah, and regarding [the marital status of] one who divorces his wife and then lodges with her in an inn, Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel from Beit Shammai. Rather, they conducted themselves with truth and peace between them, as it is said (Zech. 8:19), "Love truth and peace." [Similarly,] even though these prohibited and those permitted [in matters of purity], they did not refrain from the preparation of ritually pure foods [using the vessels of the other], to fulfill what is said (Prov. 21:2), "All the ways of a man seem meritorious in his own eyes, but God measures the hearts." Rabbi Shimon says, they would not refrain in matters of doubt; however, [they would refrain] in matters of certainty. The halacha is always according to the words of Beit Hillel. One who desires to be stringent on himself to conduct himself according to the stringencies of Beit Shammai and according to the stringencies of Beit Hillel, concerning him it is said (Ecc. 2:14), "A fool walks in darkness." One who grabs onto the leniencies of Beit Shammai and the leniencies of Beit Hillel is an evildoer; rather if [one conducts himself] according to the words of Beit Shammai, [one does so] according to their leniencies and according to their stringencies, [and] if according to the words of Beit Hillel, [one does so] according to their leniencies and according to their stringencies.

Chapter 2

How so, "the wife of his brother who never existed with him" (Yevamot 2:1)? [If there were] two brothers who existed at the same time, and one of them died without offspring, and the second one got up [to perform yibbum], but before he was able to perform ma'amar<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">an act of betrothal preceding a levirate marriage, which is not required under Torah law but which was instituted by the rabbis</i> with his yevama before a [third] brother was born to them, who never existed with [the first brother], the second [wife] either is subject to chalitza or yibbum. [If] he performed ma'amer with her, but before he was able to marry her a [third] brother was born, and afterwards he died, or if a [third] brother was born and he performed ma'amar with her, but before he was able to marry her the first [brother] died, the second [wife] is excluded from the name "wife of his brother who never existed with him," and the first [wife] is subject to chalitza but not to yibbum. Rabbi Shimon says, if one of [the wives] engages in relations or has chalitza performed on her, the rival wives are exempt. [If] he performed chalitza with one [of the deceased brother's wives] who had ma'amar performed on her, he [also] performs chalitza on the first [wife]. [If] he married her and then died, and a [third] brother was born, and afterwards he married her and died, both of them are exempt from chalitza and from yibbum, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says, since neither of them became betrothed on his account, and he came and found both of them in a state of permissibility, then should one of wives engage in relations or chalitza, she exempts her rival wife. 
What is "ma'amar"? [The brother of the widow's deceased husband says,] "Behold, you are betrothed to me with money," "with the equivalent of money," or "with a document." And what is a "document"? [He writes,] "I, so-and-so the son of so-and-so, hereby acquire for myself so-and-so (fem.), my yevama, to provide alimentation and sustenance as is appropriate, as long as she has her marriage contract concerning the property of her first husband." Just as betrothal [in a typical case] does not [alone] effect the acquisition of a wife -- rather, only if it is done with the informed consent of both of them --  the difference between betrothal and ma'amar is that betrothal completes [the acquisition of a wife] and ma'amar does not complete [the acquisition of a yevama].
The forbidden relations of which they spoke (i.e., which render one liable for excision): They are not like one's wife in any respect. They do not have a [valid] marriage contract, nor the right to use his property (<i>peirot</i>), nor alimentation (<i>mazanot</i>), nor compensation for her used or spent property (<i>b'laot</i>), and they do not merit [the ability to] claim whatever they find, nor what they make with their hands, nor to have their vows invalidated. They do not have [any right to] inheritance, and he may not impurity himself for her, nor do the laws of betrothal apply, and she does not require a divorce document from him [before remarrying]. She is disqualified [from marrying a priest] and her offspring is a mamzer.<br>The widow of a High Priest, and the divorcee or chalutza of an ordinary priest: Behold, they are like his wife in every respect, and she has a [valid] marriage contract, and the right to use his property, and alimentation, and compensation for her used or spent property, and she merits [the ability] to claim whatever she finds and what she makes with her hands, and to have her vows invalidated, and he does not defile her. The laws of betrothal apply to her, and she requires a divorce document from him [before remarrying]. She is disqualified [from marrying a priest] and her offspring is disqualified [from the priesthood].<br>Second-degree relations that are forbidden by rabbinic decree: They are not like his wife in any respect. They do not have a [valid] marriage contract, nor the right to use his property, nor alimentation, nor compensation for her used or spent property, and they do not merit [the ability to] claim whatever they find, nor what they make with their hands, nor to have their vows invalidated. She does inherit, and he may make himself impure for her. The laws of betrothal apply to her, and she requires a divorce document from him [before remarrying]. She is fit [to marry a priest] and her offspring is fit [for the priesthood]. And they force him to go out [from the marriage].<br>Rabbi Yehuda says, [with respect to] the widow of a High Priest, and the divorcee or chalutza of an ordinary priest, this is a prohibition [resulting from] a mitzvah. Second-degree relations that are forbidden by rabbinic decree, this is a prohibition [resulting from] sanctity. The laws of betrothal do not apply to her. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, and for what reason did they say, "the widow of a High Priest has a [valid] marriage contract"? Because he is fit [for the priesthood] and she is disqualified [from marriage to the priesthood], they penalized him [by requiring him] to give her a marriage contract. For what reason did they say, "second-degree relations that are forbidden by rabbinic decree do not have a [valid] marriage contract"? Because he is fit and she is fit, they penalized her by imposing a marriage contract on her, so that it would appear easy in his eyes to take her out [from the marriage]. Rabbi Yosei says, this one is [derived from] the words of the Torah, and and the words of the Torah do not require [the application of] presumptions, and that one is [derived from] rabbinic decree, and rabbinic decrees do require presumptions. Another interpretation: In the first case, she is made accustomed to marry him, and in the second case, she accustoms herself to marry him.
There are those [woman] who are subject to either chalitza or yibbum; who are subject to yibbum but not chalitza; who are subject to chalitza but not yibbum; and who are subject to neither chalitza nor yibbum. The forbidden relations about which we stated "neither subject to chalitza or yibbum," added to them are the wife of eunuch by nature, and the wife of a brother of the same mother, and the wife of a convert, and the wife of a freed [Hebrew] slave, and an aylonit -- [they are subject to] neither chalitza nor yibbum. A female deaf-mute and a female imbecile are subject to yibbum but not chalitza. One who is prohibited [due to] a mitzvah, and one who is prohibited [due to] sanctity -- they are subject to chalitza but not yibbum. A barren woman, and an elderly woman, and all other women are subject to either chalitza or yibbum. There are those who [instead] state [the rule as follows]: "There are those [men] who either perform chalitza or yibbum<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"<i>choltzin o m'yabmin</i>" (in the masculine, from the point of view of the yavam), as opposed to "<i>choltzot o m'yabmot</i>" (in the feminine, from the point of view of the yavama), as is used in the earlier portion of this Tosefta</i>, who perform yibbum but not chalitza, who perform chalitza but not yibbum, and who perform neither yibbum nor chalitza. The forbidden relations about which we stated "neither perform chalitza or yibbum," added to them are the eunuch by nature, and the <i>androgynous</i>, and the brother from the same mother, and the convert, and the freed [Hebrew] slave -- [they perform] neither chalitza or yibbum. A male deaf-mute and a male imbecile perform yibbum but not chalitza. 'One who is wounded by crushing' and 'one whose member is severed' (Deut. 23:2), a eunuch by human agency, and an elderly man perform chalitza but not yibbum. And all other men perform either chalitza or yibbum."

Chapter 3

Second-degree relatives [that are forbidden] by rabbinic decree: The mother of his mother, and the mother of his father; the wife of his father's father, and the wife of his mother's father; the wife of his mother's brother from his father's side, and the wife of his father's brother from his mother's side; and the wife of his son's son, and the wife of his daughter's son. A man is permitted to the wife of his father-in-law, and the wife of his step-son, and forbidden to the daughter of his stepson. And his step-son is permitted to his (i.e., the step-father's) wife and to his daughter. [As a result,] such a woman can say, "I am permitted and my daughter is forbidden to you."
[If] her sister is also her sister-in-law, she is subject to either yibbum or chalitza (Yevamot 2:3). How so? His daughter from one he had raped married his brother, and she had a sister from the same mother but from another man, who was married to his second brother, and he died without offspring, she is subject to either chalitza or yibbum. [If] the daughter of his daughter was married to his brother, and the daughter of his wife was married to his brother, and the daughter of the daughter of his wife was married to his brother, and she had a sister from the same father but from another woman who was married to his second brother, and he died without offspring, she is subject to either chalitza or yibbum.
They asked Rabbi Eliezer, "A mamzer, can he inherit?" He said to them, "Can he perform chalitza?" "Can he perform chalitza?" He said to them, "Can he inherit?" They said to him, "Can one whitewash one's house?" He said to them, "Can one whitewash one's grave?" They said to him, "Can one whitewash one's grave?" He said to them, "Can one whitewash one's house?" They said to him, "Can one raise dogs?" He said to them, "Can one raise pigs?" "Can one raise pigs?" He said to them, "Can one raise chickens?" "Can one raise chickens?" He said to them, "Can one raise small cattle?" "Can one raise small cattle?" He said to them, "Can one save a shepherd from the grasp of a wolf?" "Can one save a shepherd from the grasp of a wolf?" He said to them, "It would be the same if you had only asked about the lamb." "And the lamb, may he save it?" He said to them, "It would be the same if you had only asked about the shepherd." "So-and-so, what will become of him in the World to Come? And so-and-so, what will become of him in the World to Come?" He said to them, "It would be the same if you had only asked, so-and-so and so-and-so, what will become of them in the World to Come?" And it was not that Rabbi Eliezer was [purposely] being argumentative; rather than he never said anything that he had not himself heard in his days.

Chapter 4

Two unrelated men who betrothed two sisters, [and] this one doesn't know which one he betrothed, and that one doesn't know which one he betrothed: This one issues two divorce documents, and that one issues two divorce documents. [If] one of [the men] died, the second one is forbidden to both of [the sisters]. [If] one of [the sisters] died, both of [the men] are forbidden to the second one. [If] they died and they had one brother, he performs chalitza on both of them; two brothers, they [both] perform chalitza on both of them. If they preemptively married them, they are taken out [from the marriages].<br>One who betrothed one of two unrelated women, and doesn't know which one he betrothed, he is married to both of them. [If] he died and he had one brother, he is married to both of them. Two brothers, they are married to both of them.<br>Two brothers who betrothed two sisters, [and] this one doesn't know which one he betrothed, and that one doesn't know which one he betrothed, this one issues two divorce documents, and that one issues two divorce documents. [If] one of [the brothers] dies, the second one is forbidden to both of them. [If] one of [the sisters] dies, both of [the men] are forbidden to the second one. [If] they died and they had one brother, he performs chalitza on both of them. Two brothers, they [both] perform chalitza on both of them. If they preemptively married them, they are taken out [from the marriages].<br>Two unrelated men who betrothed two unrelated women, [and] this one doesn't know which one he betrothed, and that one doesn't know which one he betrothed, this one issues two divorce documents, and that one issues two divorce documents. [If] one of [the men] dies, the second one is permitted to both of [the women]. [If] one of [the women] dies, both of [the men] are permitted to the second one. How do they do it? One gives a divorce document and one marries. [If] they died, and this one has a brother, and that one has a brother, this [man] performs chalitza to this [woman], and the other [man] performs yibbum; or this [man] performs chalitza to that [woman], and the other [man] performs yibbum. If they preemptively married them, they are taken out [from the marriages].<br>It is incumbent on an adult male to perform yibbum, but it not incumbent on an adult female to have yibbum performed on her; rather, he may perform yibbum on any of [the widows] he desires.
The cistern that is closest to the channel is filled first. If the [owner of the] second-closest preemptively fills it up, behold, this one was industrious, and he receives his reward. [If] this one preemptively causes a water channel to pass over the cistern of his fellow, behold, this one was industrious and he receives his reward.
One who says to his fellow: "Go out and betroth for me such-and-such a woman," and [his fellow instead] goes and betroths her for himself, [or] "Go out and buy for me the wares of so-and-so," and he goes and [instead] buys them for himself, what is done is done; however, it was conducted in a treacherous manner. One who redeems a captive is permitted to marry her. One who testifies about a captive: Behold, he may not enter into marriage with her, but if he [nonetheless] entered into marriage with her, he is not taken out of it.
One who brings a divorce document from foreign lands, and it says, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed," he (i.e., the messenger) may not marry his (i.e., the purported divorcee's) wife. [If he testifies,] "He died," "I killed him," [or] "We killed him," he may not marry his wife. Rabbi Yehuda says, [if he testifies,] "I killed him," he may not marry his wife, [but] "We killed him," he may marry his wife. They said to him, it once happened that there was a certain bandit who was caught in Cappadocia, and he was being taken away to be killed, and he said, "Go and tell the wife of Shimon bar Kahana, 'I killed him in the entrance to Lod.'" And the matter came before the Sages, and they allowed his wife to remarry. He said to them, that is no proof, for he only said, "<i>We</i> killed him."
One who is suspected [of having relations] with another man's wife, and she became divorced by means of another, behold, this one shall not enter into marriage [with her], but if he entered into marriage [nonetheless], he is not taken out of it. A convert or an idolater or a slave<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "A Gentile or a slave..." (Lieberman [omitting "A convert"])</i> who comes onto a daughter of Israel: Even though the idolater came back and converts, [or] the slave [came back] and is freed, behold, this one shall not enter into marriage [with her], but if he entered into marriage [nonetheless], he is not taken out of it. An Israelite who comes onto a maidservant or onto an idolatress, even though the maidservant came back and was freed, [or] the idolatress [came back] and converted, behold, this one shall not enter into marriage [with her], but if he entered into marriage [nonetheless], he is not taken out of it.
A Sage that prohibited a woman in regards to a vow concerning her husband, behold, this one shall not marry her. Said Rabbi Yehuda, when do these words apply? When he (i.e., the Sage) didn't have a wife, or if he had [a wife] but he divorced her on account of that [prohibition], but if he had a wife and she died, he is permitted to marry her. § And any of these women<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a woman who is forbidden from marrying a Sage who prohibited her in connection with a vow regarding her (former) husband, or from marrying one who brings a divorce document from overseas, or from one testifying about her husband's death (see Bartenura to Yevamot 2:10)</i> who [subsequently] got married to other men, and [their husbands] died -- they<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the Sage, the one bringing a divorce document, or the one testifying about the husband's death</i> are permitted to marry them, and any of those who had [other] wives who [subsequently] died are permitted to marry them. Rabbi Eliezer says, [as to] all those who were married to their brothers, and they died, the women are permitted to have yibbum performed on them, but [as to] the signatory on the sale of a field, or on the divorce document of a woman, the Sages were not concerned about them.
A Sage who issued a judgment [regarding] impurity or purity, [or regarding] prohibited or permitted, and so too witnesses who testified [about a case] -- behold, they are permitted to purchase [the item in question]. But the Sages said, "Distance [yourself] from unseemliness and from that which is similar to unseemliness." There are those who are industrious and are rewarded; there are those who are industrious and incur a loss; there are those who are lazy and are rewarded; and there are those who are lazy and incur a loss. One who is lazy (i.e., does not perform labor) on Erev Shabbat, or from Shabbat to the conclusion of Shabbat, or on Erev Shevi'it, or from Shevi'it to the conclusion of Shevi'it, or on the intermediate days of a festival, or on any occasion where [performing labor] carries with it a hint of transgression<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נדנוד עבירה</b> (lit., a transgression at which people "shake their heads")</i> behold, that person is "lazy and rewarded."

Chapter 5

Four brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, and those who married the sisters died: Behold, they (i.e., the sisters) are subject to chaltiza but not to yibbum, and if [the two surviving brothers] preemptively married them, they are taken out [of the marriages]. Rabbi Eliezer says, Beit Shammai say, they may remain, and Beit Hillel say, they are taken out. Rabbi Shimon says, they may remain. Abba Shaul says, this matter was [actually] a leniency of Beit Hillel (i.e., the opinions are reversed). If one of [the women] was the mother-in-law of one of [the surviving brothers], he is forbidden to her, and permitted to her sister, and the second [brother] is forbidden two both of them. It comes out that the forbidden is permitted and the permitted is forbidden. If one of [the women] was the mother-in-law of one of [the surviving brothers], and the other one was the mother-in-law of the second one, this one is forbidden to his mother-in-law, and permitted to his brother's mother-in-law of his brother, and that one is forbidden to his mother-in-law and permitted to his brother's mother-in-law. That is what is meant by the saying, "what is forbidden to this one is permitted to that one, and what is forbidden to that one is permitted to this one." [If] one of them was the mother-in-law of both of them, this one is forbidden to her and permitted to her sister, and that one is forbidden to her and permitted to her sister. [If] both of them were mothers-in-law to one of the them, the second [brother] is permitted to both of them. This is the general rule: Any woman [who would be] fit for him [as a wife] is forbidden to him [as a yevama], on account of (Lev. 18:18), "A woman and her sister [you shall not take in marriage, producing rivalry]." If they were forbidden to him [to take as a wife] on account of another prohibition against "uncovering the nakedness"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., any of the other forbidden relationships referenced in Lev. 18:5-17)</i>, he is forbidden to her and permitted to her mother-in-law<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "to her sister" (MS Vienna, GR"A)</i>.
Three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, or to a woman and her daughter, or to a woman and her son's daughter, or to a woman and her daughter's daughter: Behold, they are subject to chaltiza but not to yibbum, and Rabbi Shimon exempts both of them from chalitza and from yibbum.
Three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, and [the third] one is a bachelor, [and] the husband of one of the sisters dies, and the one who is a bachelor gets up and marries her, and afterwards his second brother dies: His wife remains with him, and the other [woman] leaves [and is exempt from yibbum] on account of [the prohibition against marrying] "a woman and her sister."<br>Three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, and [the third] one is a bachelor, [and] the husband of one of the sisters dies, and the one who is a bachelor gets up, but before he has a chance to perform ma'amar with his yevama, the wife of the surviving brother dies, and afterwards he dies; [or] he performs ma'amar with her, but before he has a chance to marry her, the wife of the living brother dies, and afterwards he dies; [or] he marries her, and the wife of the living brother dies, and afterwards he dies: Behold, [in all of these cases,] she is exempt from chalitza and from yibbum.<br>Three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, and [the third] one is married to an unrelated woman, [and] the husband of one of the sisters dies, [and] the one who is married to the unrelated woman gets up, but before has a chance to perform ma'amar with his yevama, he dies: The unrelated woman is subject to either chalitza or yibbum. [If] he performed ma'amar with her, but before he had a chance to marry her, he died, the unrelated woman is subject to chalitza but not to yibbum. [If] he married her and afterwards he died, the unrelated woman is exempt from chalitza and from yibbum. [If] the one who was married to the unrelated woman died, [and] the husband of one of the sisters got up, but before he had a chance to perform ma'amar with his yevama he died, the unrelated woman is subject to either chalitza or yibbum. [If] he performed ma'amar with her but before he had a chance to marry her he died, the unrelated woman is subject to chalitza but not to yibbum. [If] he married her and afterwards he died, the unrelated woman is exempt from chalitza and from yibbum.<br>Three brothers, two of whom are married to two sisters, and one of whom is married to an unrelated woman, [and] the husband of one of the sisters dies, [and] the one who is married to the unrelated woman gets up, but before he has a chance to perform ma'amar with his yevama, the wife of the surviving brother dies, and afterwards the unrelated woman dies, that one is subject to chalitza but not to yibbum. [If] he married her and the wife of the surviving brother died, and afterwards he died, both of [the remaining women] are exempt from chalitza and from yibbum. [If] the [brother] who is married to the unrelated woman died, [and] the husband of one of the sisters got up, but before he had a chance to perform ma'amar with his yevama, the wife of the surviving [brother] died, and afterwards he died, both of [the remaining women] are subject to either chalitza or yibbum. [If] he performed ma'amar with her, but before he had a chance to marry her, the wife of the surviving [brother] died, and afterwards he died, both of them are subject to chalitza but not to yibbum. [If] he married her and the wife of the surviving [brother] died, and afterwards he died, intercourse or chalitza with one of them exempts her rival.<br>What is "doubtful betrothal" (Yevamot 3:8)? A betrothal about which there is a matter of doubt as to whether [the item with which the betrothal was performed] had the value of a perutah, or whether it did not have the value of a perutah (see Kidd. 1:1).
Three brothers who were married to three unrelated women, and one of [the brothers] died, and the second performed ma'amar and [then] died: Behold [the two widows] are subject to chalitza but not to yibbum. She is [an example of] a rival wife of a paternal brother's wife that is subject to chalitza but not to yibbum, the words of Rabbi Yosef (see Yevamot 12a:17). Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Shimon says, he may perform yibbum with whichever one he desires, and perform chalitza with the second one, as long as intercourse precedes chalitza. [If] he married her and afterwards he died, intercourse or chalitza with one of them exempts her rival.
Two brothers who were married to two sisters, and one of [the brothers] died, and afterwards the wife of the second one died: Behold, that [widow] is forbidden to [the surviving brother] forever, since she became forbidden to him for an hour (i.e., a short period of time). If he has intercourse with her, he is liable for it on account of "his brother's wife" and on account of "his wife's sister," the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, she is only liable on account of "his brother's wife."
An "outsider" (i.e., a non-priest) that performed [Temple] service on the Sabbath in the Temple, and a blemished [priest] who performed [Temple] service in a state of impurity, are liable on account of being an outsider, and on account of the Sabbath [in the first case]; [and] on account of the blemish, and on account of impurity [in the second case], the words of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Shimon says, they are only liable on account of being an outsider [in the first case] and on account of the blemish [in the second case].
Two who married two women, and at the moment  that they entered the chuppah, this one switched with that one, and that one [switched] with this one: Behold, they are liable for sixteen transgressions. On account of brothers, and account of sisters, and on account of menstruants, and on account of another man's wife. If the men are not brothers, they are liable for twelve. If the women are not sisters, they are liable for eight. If they are not menstruants, they are liable for four. [If] the women are adults and the men are minors, they are liable for two. [If] the men are adults and the women are minors, the women are liable for four. If the women are [dependent] on their fathers, the men are liable for eight. [If] one of the men was an adult and one was a minor, the woman who has intercourse with the the minor is liable, since she is the wife of an adult, and the woman who has intercourse with the adult is exempt, since she is the wife of a minor.

Chapter 6

One who performs ma'amar with his yevama and she is found to be pregnant and she gives birth: In the event that the offspring is viable, his ma'amar is not a [valid] ma'amar, [and] he is permitted to her close relatives, and she is permitted to his close relatives, and she is not disqualified from [marriage into] the priesthood. [If] the offspring is not viable, his ma'amar is a [valid] ma'amar, [and] he is forbidden to her close relatives, and she is forbidden to his close relatives, and she is disqualified from [marriage into] the priesthood. One who consummates his marriage with his yevama and she is found to be pregnant, and she gives birth: In the event that the offspring is viable, he must send her out [from the marriage], and they are liable for a [sin-]offering. [If] the offspring is not viable, he may maintain her [as a wife] . [If] there is a doubt as to whether the offspring is viable or not viable, both stringencies are imposed upon him. [If] there is a doubt as to whether [the woman has given birth to] a ninth-month offspring of the first [husband] or a seventh-month offspring of the last [husband]: [If it was] the offspring of the first, it would be fit to be a High Priest; [while if it was] the offspring of the last, it would be a doubtful mamzer. One who performs ma'amar on his yevama and she is found to be pregnant, behold, this one may not marry her rival wives until it is known whether the fetus is viable, for a newborn infant does not exempt [the rival wives] until it emerges into the air  of the world.
[A woman] who dies while she is waiting for her yavam: He is permitted to marry her mother. What is her status vis-a-vis her sustenance payments? As long as her husband is liable, her yavam is liable. [If] her husband is not liable, her yavam is not liable. One who consummates his marriage with his yevama acquires his brother's estate (Yevamot 4:7). Rabbi Yehuda says, in either case, in either case, if the father is living, the estate belongs to the father. If the father is not living, the estate belongs to the brother.
Four are liable from the Torah, and four are second-degree relatives (i.e., as to whom the Sages extended the prohibition against marrying a chalutzah): His father and his son, his brother and his brother's son, behold, they are liable on her account. The father of his father, and the father of his mother, the son of his son, and the son of his daughter, behold, they are second-degree relatives. To these there is a stringency as to a divorced woman that there is not as to a chalutzah, and [a stringency] as to a chalutzah that there is not as to a divorced woman: A divorced woman is permitted to return to the man who divorced her; therefore, he is liable for [relations with] her close relatives. A chalutzah is forbidden to return to the man who performed chalitzah on her; therefore, he is exempt for [relations with] her close relatives.
[A woman] whose deceased-husband's brother betrothed her sister while she is waiting for her yavam: As to she herself, they said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, they say to [the brother], "Wait until she has yibbum performed." [If the brother] who betrothed [her sister] dies, the yavam performs chalitzah. [If] both of them die, the one who betrothed sends out his wife with a divorce document, and [sends out] the wife of his brother with chalitzah. In the name of Rabbi Eliezer they said, [if] his wife dies, he performs chalitzah on his yavama. [If] his yevama dies, he may consummate the marriage with his wife.
One who was married to two women, and he dies, sexual relations or chalitzah with one of them [by his brother] exempts her rival wife. [If] one of them was forbidden to one of his brothers [pursuant to] a prohibition against forbidden relations, and he performed chalitzah on her, he has done nothing, and her rival wife is not exempt; rather, either she or her rival wife are subject to yibbum by one of the other brothers. [If] she was subject to a prohibition [resulting from] a mitzvah, or a prohibition [resulting from] sanctity (see Yevamot 20a:12-13), [and] he performed chalitzah on her or engaged in relations with her, her rival wife is exempted.
One who returns to his divorced wife after she was married [to another man]; one who marries a woman to whom he had performed chalitzah; and one marries the close relative of a woman to whom he had performed chalitzah: There is no [valid] betrothal and she does not require a divorce document from him; she is disqualified [from marriage into the priesthood] and her offspring is disqualified, the words of Rabbi Akiva. And the Sages say, there is a [valid] betrothal, and she requires a divorce document from him; she is fit [for marriage into the priesthood], and her offspring is fit; [and] they force him to send her out [from the marriage].
Behold, a woman who always was running back to sleep at her father's house, or was always angry at her husband, or her husband was old or infirm, or her husband went off to lands overseas, or her husband was incarcerated in prison, or who had miscarried after the death of her husband, [or if] she was barren or old or an aylonit or a minor who was not fit to give birth: [Even in such cases], they need to wait three months [before remarrying], the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda permits them to get betrothed and married immediately. Said Rabbi Yishmael the son of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah, I heard in the vineyard of Yavneh that no woman may get married or betrothed until three months have passed. A female convert and a female captive and a freed maidservant need to wait three months, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei permits them to get married immediately, and so too would Rabbi Yosei say, every woman may get betrothed [immediately] except for a widow, because of the thirty days of mourning, but none of them may get married until three months have passed. A yevama whose yavam performed chalitzah on her within three months needs to [nonetheless] wait three months. [However,] the "three months" that they spoke of apply after the death of her husband, but not after the chalitzah of her yavam.
One who deposits a divorce document for his wife [with a trustee] and says to him, "Do not give it to her except after three months," once the divorce document reaches her, she is permitted to marry immediately, and there is no concern that it is an old divorce document. A daughter of a priest who married an Israelite, and her husband died: She can eat terumah that evening, and there is no concern that she is pregnant.
A yevama receives sustenance payments by the estate of her husband for the entirety of the first three months [following his death]. After three months, she does not receive sustenance payments either by her husband's estate or by her yavam's estate. If her yavam was brought to judgment [and required to either perform yibbum or chalitzah], and he escaped, behold, he must provide sustenance payments from his estate. It so happened that there was someone who came before Rabbi Yosei. He said to him, "Rabbi, what is the ruling regarding performing chalitzah within three months?" He read to him this verse (Deut. 25:7): "And if the man does not desire to take his yevama, etc." One who is is fit to perform yibbum is fit to perform chalitzah. Within three months, since he is not fit to perform yibbum, he is not be fit to perform chalitzah. [Therefore,] the yevama should not be subject to yibbum or chalitzah until three months have passed.<br>And just as they do not tell him to perform yibbum, so too they do not tell him to perform chalitzah. It so happened in Rophah (ברופא (MS Erfurt)) that there was someone whose husband was traveling overseas, and there was a woman who was waiting him to perform yibbum, and he had a minor brother. In the name of Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok they said, she should [be permitted to] perform chalitzah lest some evil befall him, and it turns out that she is bound to the minor [brother]. And the Sages say, just as they do not tell him to perform yibbum, so too they do not tell him to perform chalitzah.<br>The beautiful captive mentioned in the Torah is given thirty days, but the Sages said, she [actually] needs to wait three months so that the [parentage of the] offspring is rectified (i.e., it is determined whether it is the offspring of her captor or her slain former husband). Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would bring [a proof] from Scripture, as it is said (Deut. 21:13), "A month of days, and after that [you may come to her]."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (Yevamot 48b:2) explains that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar midrashically expounded the verse as follows: "A month" = thirty days, "days" = thirty days, and "after that" = thirty days, for a total of ninety days. (See also Lieberman here.)</i>
One who comes upon his yevama for the sake of pleasure or for the sake of property: They view him as though he came into contact with a forbidden relation, and the offspring is close to being [considered] a mamzer.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In the Talmud (Yevamot 39b:17), this statement is attributed to Abba Shaul.</i> Rabbi Meir would say, a man should not come upon his yevama until she has reached a marriageable age, and so too the rival wives, and so too the forbidden relations<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">in other words, the <i>rival wives</i> of forbidden relations (Lieberman)</i>, one should not marry them or betroth them until they have reached a marriageable age, lest they are found to be an aylonit or found to be unfit, and the Sages say, behold, they are presumed to be fit. Rabbi Akiva agrees that with regards to a widow of a High Priest, or the divorcee or chalutzah of an ordinary priest, that even though she [falls into the category] of "do not come upon her," the offspring is not a mamzer, for a mamzer only arises from [a union between] blood-relatives. Rabbi Shimon the Yemenite agrees that as to one who comes upon his wife when she is a menstruant, that even though this results in excision, the offspring is not a mamzer, for a mamzer only arises from [a union between] blood-relatives.

Chapter 7

One who performs ma'amar with his yevama and dies: She is subject to chalitza but not yibbum. Rabbi Shimon says, either chalitza or yibbum, for if his ma'amar is a [valid] ma'amar, then she is subject to yibbum, for she is [halachically] the wife of the second man, and if his ma'amar is not a [valid] ma'amar, then she is subject to yibbum [regardless], for she is [still] the wife of the first man.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שאם מאמרו מאמר תתיבם, שהיא אשתו של שיני, אין מאמרו מאמר תתיבם, שהיא אשתו של ראשון</b> (Lieberman)</i><br>How is the mitzvah of yibbum performed? He performs ma'amar with her and afterwards takes her into his house. [If] he took her into his house before he performed ma'amar, he has acquired her. One who performs ma'amar with his yevama has acquired him for himself, and disqualified her for his brothers. [If] his brothers came upon her, or they performed ma'amar with her, [or] they gave her a divorce document, or they performed chaltiza on her, they have disqualified her for him.<br>One who performs ma'amar with his yevama exempts her rival wife, [and] one who performs chaltiza on her exempts her rival wife.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">This is the view of Rabban Gamaliel (Yevamot 5:1; see Minchat Bikkurim here)</i> And the Sages say, there is [such a thing as] "divorce after divorce," and "ma'amar after ma'amar." Rabban Gamaliel concedes to the Sages that there is divorce after ma'amar, and ma'amar after divorce, [as well as] divorce after sexual relations following ma'amar, [and] ma'amar after sexual relations following divorce. How is it that Rabban Gamaliel says, there is no "divorce after divorce"? [If there were] two yevamas and one yavam, and he gave a divorce document to one of them, and came back and gave a divorce document to the other one, Rabban Gamaliel says, he must perform chalitza on the first one, and he is permitted to the close relatives of the second one. And the Sages say, he is forbidden to the close relatives of both of them, and he needs to perform chalitza on one of them. [If] he performed ma'amar with this one and came back and performed ma'amar with that one, Rabban Gamaliel says, he gives a divorce document to the first once and performs chalitza on her, and he is permitted to the close relatives of the second one. And the Sages say, he is forbidden to the close relatives of both of them, and [the women] need two divorce documents, and he performs chalitza on one of them. And so too where there are two yavams and one yevama.<br>[If] he had sexual relations with this one and sexual relations with that one, had sexual relations with this one and performed ma'amar with that one, had sexual relations with this one and gave a divorce document to that one, and had sexual relations with this one and performed chalitza on that one, there is nothing [that need be performed] after chalitza. [If] he performed chalitza on this one and chalitza on that one, chalitza on this one and ma'amar with that one, chalitza on this one and he gave a divorce document to that one, chalitza on this one and had sexual relations with that one, there is nothing [that need be performed] after sexual relations.<br>Even though they said, "there is nothing after sexual relations," chalitza after sexual relations disqualifies her for [marriage into] the priesthood. How so? Three yevamas and one yavam, [and] he performed ma'amar with this one, and had sexual relations with that one, and came back and performed ma'amar with the other one, Rabbi Nehemiah says, the first one needs a divorce document, and there is nothing after sexual relations, from a logical deduction: Since as to chalitza, which disqualifies [a woman for marriage into] the priesthood [in the instance of] chalitza after sexual relations, there is no validity to any subsequent act, [then as to] sexual relations, which do not disqualify [a woman for marriage into] the priesthood [in the instance of] sexual relations after chalitza, does it not logically follow that there would be no validity to any subsequent act? And the Sages say, they need three divorce documents, and he performs chalitza on one of them. When did they say that "there is nothing after sexual relations"? In a situation where it is performed <i>a priori</i>, but if it is not performed <i>a priori</i>, behold, it is like ma'amar. 

Chapter 8

A boy of nine years and one day [who is an] Ammonite or a Moabite, an Egyptian or an Edomite or an an idolater, a Nitin or a mamzer who engaged in relations with the daughter of a priest or the daughter of a Levite or the daughter of an Israelite -- she is disqualified from [marriage into] the priesthood. Rabbi Yosei says, whoever's offspring is fit, she herself is fit; whoever's offspring is disqualified, she herself is disqualified. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, anyone whose daughter is permitted to you in marriage, his widow is permitted to you in marriage, and anyone whose daughter is not permitted to you in marriage, his widows is not permitted to you in marriage. A Levitess whose daughter is taken captive -- she is fit to the priesthood. Levites [whose genealogy may have been] compromised by their mothers -- the Sages did not suspect them. A Levitess who was taken captive, or who engaged in sexual relations with a man to whom she is forbidden -- they take away the tithe from her. The daughter of a Levite who is born of a female Nitin or a female mamzer -- they do not take away the tithe from her. An ordinary priest who married an aylonit<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a female of 20 years or older who has not gone through puberty and is considered barren (see Nid. 5:9)</i> -- behold, she may eat Terumah. A High Priest may not marry a woman he raped or seduced, but he may marry a minor who refused her husband. A High Priest whose brother died must perform chalitza, but if there are other brothers, he does not perform chalitza. For what reason did they say (see Yevamot 6:4) that a High Priest who performed ma'amar<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the rabbinically ordained betrothal preceding a levirate marriage</i> with the former wife of his deceased brother [before he was appointed High Priest] shall not bring her into marriage? Because the acquisition effected by ma'amer is not a complete acquisition.
A man should not desist from [fulfilling the commandment of] "be fruitful and multiply" unless he has sons. Grandsons -- behold, they  are [considered to be] like sons. If one of them died, or if one of them became castrated, he is not permitted to desist. A man is not permitted to abide without a wife, but a woman is permitted to abide without a husband. A man is not permitted to drink a [sterilizing] root drink in order that he not bear children, but a woman is permitted to drink a root drink in order that she not bear children.
A man is not permitted to marry a barren or elderly woman, an aylonit, a minor, or one who is not fit to bear children, but a woman is permitted to marry even a eunuch. Rabbi Yehuda says, one who castrates a male is liable, but [one who sterilizes] a female is exempt. Rabbi Natan said: Beit Shammai say two boys [are required to fulfill the commandment of "be fruitful and multiply"], like Moshe’s sons, as it is written: “And Moshe’s sons were Gershom and Elazar" (1 Chr. 23:15). Beit Hillel say: a son and a daughter, as it is written: “Male and female God created them” (Genesis 5:2). Rabbi Natan says: Beit Shammai say: a son and a daughter, and Beit Hillel say: a son or a daughter.
One who marries a woman and remains with her for ten years, and she does not bear a child -- he [still] is not permitted to desist from  [the commandment of "be fruitful and multiply"]. Rather, he goes out and gives her her ketubah lest he does not merit bearing children from her. And even though there is no proof of the matter, there is a hint of the matter, as it is said (Gen. 16:3), "at the end of ten years of Avram's settling in the land of Canaan."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"> The full verse reads, "And Sarai, the wife of Avram, took Hagar the Egyptian, her hand-maid at the end of ten years of Avram's settling in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Avram her husband as a wife for him."</i> We learn from this that [the duration of] one's settling outside the Land [of Israel] is not included in the count.
She whose husband is elderly, or infirm, or her husband was incarcerated in prison, or her husband traveled overseas, these [time periods] are not included in the count. A divorcee should go and marry another, lest she did not merit to bear children from him. And up to how many is she permitted to marry? Up to three. More than that, she should only marry someone who [already] has a wife and children. If she married someone who has no wife or children, she goes out without her ketubah, because her marriage was entered into in error. § Rabbi Akiva says, whoever spills blood, behold, that person causes the image [of God] to be diminished, as it is said (Gen. 9:6), "One who sheds a man's blood, by a man his blood shall be shed, [for God made man in His image]." Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says, anyone who does not occupy himself with [fulfilling the commandment of] "be fruitful and multiply," behold, he is a spiller of blood, and causes the image [of God] to be diminished, as it is said (Gen. 9:6-7), "for God made man in His image / And as for you, be fruitful and multiply." Ben Azzai says, anyone who does not occupy himself in "be fruitful and multiply," behold, he is a spiller of blood, and causes the image [of God] to be diminished, as it is said, "for in the image of God did He make man," and it is written, "And as for you, be fruitful and multiply, etc." Said to him Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, beautiful are the words that flow from the mouth of one who sustains (i.e., fulfills) them. There are those who expound with beauty but do not sustain [their words] with beauty, and there are those who sustain with beauty but do not expound with beauty. Ben Azzai is one who expounds with beauty but who does not sustain with beauty (i.e., he has no children). He said to him: What should I do? My soul's desire is for the Torah, and let the world sustain itself through others.

Chapter 9

A daughter of Israel who marries a priest and brings into [the marriage] <i>melog</i> slaves (i.e., slaves from her own estate, which remain her property but which her husband can benefit from during the marriage), and <i>tzon barzel</i> slaves (i.e., slaves from her estate that are held by her husband during the marriage, and as to which he must remunerate her (or her estate) in case of divorce (or her death)): The <i>melog</i> slaves eat from hers (i.e., non-terumah), and the <i>tzon barzel</i> slaves eat from his (i.e., terumah). What are "<i>melog</i> slaves"? [If] they lost or gained [value], behold, they (i.e., their loss or gain) are hers. And what are "<i>tzon barzel</i> slaves"? [If] they lost or gained [value], behold, they are his. [If] she brought them [into the marriage] for their monetary value, she takes them for their monetary value. [If she brought them in] as children, she takes them out as youths; [if] as youths, she takes them out as elders. In either case, their fruits (i.e., the profits of their labor) belong to the husband. [And] in either case, the husband is liable for their sustenance, and they are not able to sell either this one or that one. The man is not able to sell because they are pledged to the woman, and the woman is not able to sell them because their fruits belong to the husband.
[If] he died and he left her as she was (i.e., without offspring (Minchat Yitzchak)), the <i>melog</i> slaves may not eat in a manner that she [herself] cannot eat, [and] the <i>tzon barzel</i> slaves may eat [terumah] because they are presumed to belong to the [husband's] legal heirs until the moment that they are conferred to her. [If] he left her with children, both these ones and those ones eat [terumah]. [If] he left her pregnant, neither these ones nor those ones eat [terumah]. [If] he left her with children as well as pregnant, the <i>melog</i> slaves eat [terumah] in the same way that she eats, [and] the <i>tzon barzel</i> slaves do not eat [terumah] because of the "share of the fetus" with them (see Yevamot 7:3). Rabbi Yishmael b'Rabbi Yosei says in the name of his father, the daughter may eat [terumah] but the heirs may not eat [terumah]. Rabbi Shimon says, [if] all of them are males, they eat [terumah], [but] if there are any females, they may not eat<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "[if] there are any males, they eat [terumah], [but] if all of them are females, they may not eat" (see Minchat Yitzchak and Minchat Bikkurim)</i>, lest the fetus be a male, for a daughter does not [receive] any [inheritance] where there is a son.
A daughter of a priest who marries an Israelite, and brings into [the marriage] <i>melog</i> slaves and <i>tzon barzel</i> slaves: [If] he died and he left her as she was (i.e., without offspring), the <i>melog</i> slaves may not eat in a manner that she [herself] cannot eat, [and] the <i>tzon barzel</i> slaves may eat [terumah] because they are presumed to belong to the [husband's] legal heirs until the moment that they are conferred to her.
A deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor who purchased slaves: They (i.e., the slaves) may not eat of terumah, but if the Beit Din purchased [the slaves] on their behalf, or [if] the Beit Din appointed a guardian over them, or [if the slaves] were passed down to them through inheritance from another place, behold, they may eat of terumah.
A priest who purchased a slave, and an Israelite has even one-hundredth [of a stake] in him: [The slave] may not eat of terumah. The wife of a priest who purchased slaves, and her slaves who [themselves] purchased slaves, behold, they may eat of terumah. The slave of a priest who escaped, and the wife of a priest who rebelled, behold, they may [nonetheless] eat of terumah. § A murderer may not leave the boundary of a walled city due to the presumption that the High Priest is still alive.
The fetus [of a divorcee or widow], and a yavam, and betrothal, and a deaf-mute, and a son of nine years and one day [all] disqualify [a woman from eating terumah], and do not cause her to eat [terumah]. Said Rabbi Shimon, in this regard, logic is deficient, for if there is an action that disqualifies, there should also be an action that causes her to eat. [Similarly,] if there is no action that would cause her to eat, there should also be no action to disqualify her. § [If] his mentally competent daughter marries the brother of a deaf-mute, her rival wife is exempt from chalitzah and from yibbum, from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If the marriage of her daughter is [considered a valid] marriage, [then] the marriage of her rival wife is [all the more so a valid] marriage. [Conversely,] if the marriage of her daughter is [not considered a valid] marriage, [then] the marriage of her rival wife is [all the more so] not a [valid] marriage.
[If] his deaf-mute daughter was married to his mentally competent brother, her rival wife is subject to chalitzah but not yibbum. A deaf-mute (f.) who was married off by her father, behold, she is [treated] like one who is mentally competent in every respect. The mentally competent daughter of an Israelite who was married to a deaf-mute priest does not eat of terumah. [If] she became pregnant, she may not eat. [If] she gave birth, she may eat. [If] the fetus [was miscarried and] was cut up in her womb, she may eat. The deaf-mute daughter of an Israelite who was married to a mentally competent priest may not eat of terumah. [If] she became pregnant, she may not eat. [If] she gave birth, she may eat.
The mentally competent daughter of a priest who was married to an Israelite imbecile: She immerses himself [after she separates herself] from the breast of her husband (i.e., after sexual relations), and she may eat of terumah in the evening. [If] she became pregnant, she may not eat. [If] she gave birth, she may not eat. Anyone who has offspring from a priest, whether [the offspring] are males or females -- and even the offspring's offspring -- behold, this one may eat of terumah.
[If] her daughter from [her marriage to] an Israelite was married to a priest, she may not eat of terumah until [her daughter] first has offspring from the priest. A priestess whose fetus died inside her womb: Behold, this [woman] may eat of terumah. A woman who has a difficult labor: They may cut out the fetus from her womb, and even on the Sabbath, and [they may even] extract it limb by limb, because her life takes priority over him. [But if] his head emerged -- even on the second day [of her labor] -- they may not touch him, for one life may not be pushed aside for the sake of another life.

Chapter 10

A mentally competent (sane) daughter of Israel who became betrothed to a mentally competent priest, but he did not have enough time to marry her before he became a deaf-mute: She may not partake of terumah. [If] he died and left her before a yavam, even one who is a deaf-mute, she may partake [of terumah]. The power of the yavam is thus greater in regards to feeding [his wife terumah] than the power of the husband of a daughter of Israel. A mentally competent daughter of Israel who became betrothed to a mentally competent priest, but he did not have enough time to marry her before she became a deaf-mute: She may not partake of terumah. [If] he died and left her before a yavam, even one who is a deaf-mute, she may partake [of terumah]. The power of the yavam is thus greater in regards to feeding [his wife terumah] than the power of the husband of a daughter of Israel.<br>A mentally competent daughter of Israel who was married to a deaf-mute priest does not partake [of terumah]. [If] he died and left her before a mentally competent yavam, she may partake; a deaf-mute, she may not partake of terumah unless she enters the chuppah for the sake of marriage and she engages in sexual relations for the sake of marital state (i.e., legally valid wedding and marital state). A deaf-mute daughter of Israel who was married to a mentally competent priest does not partake of terumah. [If] he died and left her before a mentally competent [yavam], she does not partake.<br>A mentally competent daughter of Israel who became betrothed to a mentally competent priest, and entered the chuppah for the sake of marriage, but there wasn't time for them to engage in sexual relations before his testicles were crushed or his member was severed, behold, she partakes of terumah, since she had [already] fallen under the general rule of "permitted," even if she was [only married] for one hour. [But] if she was still betrothed, and he becomes one with crushed testicles or a severed member, behold, she does not partake. The widow of a High Priest, [or] a divorcee or chalutzah of an ordinary priest, who entered the chuppah for the sake of marriage, but there wasn't enough time to engage in sexual relations before he died, is fit for [marriage to] the priesthood, and fit to partake of terumah. [If one who was unfit for the priesthood] came upon her, she would become unfit for [marriage to] the priesthood and unfit to partake of terumah.
A tumtum may not partake of terumah, [but] his wife and his servants may eat. A <i>mashuch</i> ("one who has his prepuce drawn forward in order to disguise the sign of the covenant," Jastrow), and one who is born as though he is [already] circumcised (i.e., lacking foreskin), behold, they may partake of terumah. An androgynous may partake of terumah, but not of consecrated foods. A tumtum may not partake either of terumah or of consecrated foods. Whoever is half a [Hebrew] servant and half a freeman does not partake either of terumah or of consecrated foods. Said Rabbi Eliezer, I heard that regarding an androgynous, that they are liable for stoning for their [forbidden] sexual relations, just like a male. When do these words apply? At a time that the "way of males" came upon him (i.e., his sexual organ functioned like that of a male), [but] if the way of males did not come upon him, he is exempt.
What is "one who is wounded by crushing" (Deut. 23:2)? Anyone whose testicles were crushed, or had decayed (or dissolved), or that had been punctured, or that were missing. Said Rabbi Yishmael b'Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah: I heard in the vineyard in Yavneh, one who does not even have one testicle -- he is [categorized as] a eunuch by nature (i.e., not one wounded by crushing). Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened with someone from Kfar Mandon, that he climbed to the top of an olive tree, and he fell and crushed one of his testicles, and [afterwards] he went and had relations with his wife and he died, and they came and asked Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, "What is the status of his wife? Must she have yibbum performed on her?'" He said to them, "Before you ask me, 'What is her status? Must she have yibbum performed on her?', you should ask me, 'What is her status in regards to eating terumah?' For she would become disqualified from from the priesthood [as a result of her husband's injury], and disqualified from eating terumah."
What is "one whose member is severed" (Deut. 23:2)? Anyone whose member is severed from the crown and within (i.e., towards the body). If there remains from the crown and within even [flesh the width of] a strand of hair next to the head [of the penis], and which can surround all of it, he is fit. [If] it is punctured from below, he is unfit, because [the semen] pours out [from the wound]. [If] it becomes closed, he is fit, because he can progenerate. And this [is an example] of one who was unfit and returns to being fit. "Bruised, or smashed, or torn up, or severed" (Lev. 22:24) -- all these [defects] refer to the testicles, the words for Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, all of them refer to the member. Rabbi Yosei says, "Bruised" and "smashed" refer to the testicles, [and] "torn up" and "severed" refer to the member.
What is a "eunuch by nature" (Yevamot 8:4)? Anyone who was twenty years old, and he had not grown two [pubic] hairs. Even if he grew them after [he turned twenty], behold, he is considered a eunuch in all respects. What are his signs? Whoever lacks a beard and his skin is smooth. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Yair: Anyone whose urine flow does not ascend in an arc. And there are those who say, anyone whose urine flow does not ferment. And there are those who say, anyone whose seminal emission is discolored. And there are those who say, anyone whose [urine] does not produce vapor. Others say, one who immerses in cold water during the rainy season and his flesh does not produce sweat. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, anyone whose voice is defective and one cannot determine whether it is [the voice of] a man or of a woman. 
What is an "aylonit"? Anyone who was twenty years old and she had not grown two [pubic] hairs. Even if she grew them after [she turned twenty], behold, she is considered an aylonit in all respects. What are the signs? Anyone who does not have breasts, and her hair is defective, and she stiffens herself during intercourse. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, anyone whose lower abdomen is not like [other] women. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, anyone whose voice is defective and one cannot determine whether it is [the voice of] a woman or of a man.

Chapter 12







The commandment of chalitzah must be performed before three [individuals acting as judges], as long as they know how to recite [the relevant verses]. Rabbi Yehuda says, before five. Said Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon, it so happened that [there was a woman] who performed chalitzah before only Rabbi Yishmael, at night.




Originally they would write the bill of chalitzah [as follows]: "[So-and-so] came forward before [the court] and she removed the shoe from his right foot, [and] she spat before him, and she said (Deut. 25:9), 'Such should befall, etc.'" Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Akiva, [the failure] to remove the shoe prevents [the chalitzah from taking effect], but [the failure] to spit does not prevent. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, since [the brother] did not desire to establish a name for his brother in Israel, he comes and take a [new] name in exchange for his name, [as it says,] "And his name in Israel shall be called, etc."
