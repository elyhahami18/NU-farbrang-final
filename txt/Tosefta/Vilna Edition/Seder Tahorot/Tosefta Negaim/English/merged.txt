A leprous house (Lev. 14:33) has never existed and never will exist. Why, then, is it written about? Only to say, "Expound it and receive your reward." [However,] Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says, there was a place in the area of Gaza, and they would call it a "leprous ruin"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><i>churvata s'girta</i> (specifically, a ruin declared leprous after its period of quarantine)</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>משום</b> (GR"A)</i> a man from K'far Akko, there was a place in the Galilee, and they would mark it, for they would would say that there were leprous stones in it. And Jerusalem was never contaminated with leprosy. Said Rabbi Yehuda, I never heard that [about all of Jerusalem]; rather, only about the Holy Temple.
