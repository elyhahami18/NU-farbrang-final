Chapter 1

One who touches the vertical supports that are on either side [of the loom]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., which are attached to the upper and lower beam of the loom (GR"A; see Kel. 21:1)</i>, or the vice that is on top of the [weaver's] reeds, even though it is concave in shape and forms a [type of] receptacle, it is pure, and it can only become impure if it [directly] touches the iron. A menstruant who stretched out the rope or treaded on the reed<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "on the garment made on the reed" (MS Vienna)</i> that goes up and down (i.e., used for the vertical (warp) threads): The [woven] garment is impure [with midras-impurity (MS Vienna)].<br>It so happened that there was a certain woman who would weave garments in a state of purity, and she came before Rabbi Yishmael, and he was examining her. She said to him, "Rabbi, I know that this garment was not defiled, only that my heart was not [constantly] set on watching over it." During the examination that Rabbi Yishmael was performing on her, she said to him, "Rabbi, I know that a menstruant came in and stretched out the rope with me." Said Rabbi Yishmael, "How great are the words of the Sages, who said that one who does not intend to to watch over [an object], it is [deemed] impure!"<br>And there was another incident with a certain woman who would weave tablecloths in a state of purity, and she came before Rabbi Yishmael, and he was examining her. She said to him, "Rabbi, I know that this tablecloth was not defiled, just that my heart was not [constantly] set on watching over it." During the examination that Rabbi Yishmael was performing on her, she said to him, "Rabbi, I know that a thread broke and I knotted it in my mouth." Said Rabbi Yishmael, "How great are the words of the Sages, who said that one who does not intend to to watch over [an object], it is [deemed] impure!"
A weasel that dragged a shuttle thread, which [the weaver] intended to weave back in, and brought [the thread] into a house with a corpse inside of it: Even though there was only a minute amount [of material] inside the tent (i.e., inside the area covering the corpse), the garment is defiled with corpse-impurity. [If] a zav treaded on it within ten handbreadths, the garment is defiled with midras-impurity. The warp: As long as he intends to weave [on it], it is [considered] connected to whatever is woven [on it]. [If] he finished weaving, it is only impure up until the place that he intends to separate [the unused threads]. One who touches the separated threads of the warp or of the woof, behold, that is not considered connected. Rabbi Yosei says, one who touches the separated threads of the warp up to three fingers' [breadth], it is connected, for the fuller<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שהכובס</b> (GR"A)</i> is an expert at pleating [loose threads] back into [the garment]. One who touches the wool which is on the spool<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>האַשְׁוָוה</b> (MS Vienna, Jastrow)</i>, or the spun wool that is on the whirl of the spindle, it is pure, but [if it is] on the spindle [itself] or on the vertical supports [of the loom], it is impure. One who touches the black [wool] that is on top of [other] black [wool], it is pure,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "One who touches the black that is on top of the white, or the white that is on top of the black, it is pure" (GR"A)</i> but if everything on one side was black, and he moved it on top of the white [on the other side], or [if] everything on one side was white, and he moved it on top of the black, it is impure.<br>The [sword-shaped] handle of a plough that became detached along with the peg of a plough, behold, it is impure, because he digs circular trenches around wells with it. The eye of the axe and the eye of the plough and the sheath of the ploughshare: Whenever they are attached, they are considered connected for purposes of impurity and for sprinkling [the waters of purification], [and] whenever they are by themselves, they are pure. The threads and straps that are on the share-beam: If they are sewn, they are considered connected, and if they are knotted, they are not considered connected.<br>A carpenter's vice: Whenever it is attached, it is considered connected for purposes of impurity and sprinkling. [If] it is removed, it is not considered connected, either for impurity or for sprinkling. Rabbi Yehuda says, even one who touches the frame of a large saw on either side remains pure, and only contracts impurity in the place where it is held by hand<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מקום אחיזת יד</b> (GR"A)</i>, on either side facing the iron [of the saw].
A table or a serving board or a <i>delphica</i> (a three-legged service table) that were carved<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שנתקסמו</b>; alt., <b>שנתקרסמו</b> ("that were <i>cut up</i>") (MS Vienna, Jastrow); alt., <b>שנפחתו</b> ("that were <i>damaged</i>") (GR"A, accord Kel. 22:1)</i>, and one handbreadth<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "two handbreadths" (MS Vienna)</i> was left [undamaged], they are impure. If it was sawed [in half], the underside is impure; and the upper side is pure.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., <b>שחברו התחתון טהור והעליון טמא</b> ("If it was <i>joined</i>, the underside is <i>pure</i> and the upper side is <i>impure</i> (GR"A)</i> [If the pieces] became separated, it is susceptible to impurity from that point onward. A serving board that was filled with pieces of wood that were attached to it is pure. [If] it was covered with wood planks, it is impure. A table that was covered with marble in order to eat on it, even though he made a wooden rim around it to contain the marble with it, it is pure, for he only made it to strengthen, to contain the marble with it.<br>Benches [set up] at inns: Even though they have holes into which the [removable] legs are inserted, they are pure. Benches of teachers of young children: Even though they have holes into which [legs] are inserted, they are pure. [If the legs] are affixed [to the benches] with nails, they are impure. A bench that becomes detached [from one of its legs (Kel. 22:3)] is pure. [If] he strapped it [to the legs] with cords or ropes, it is impure.  A <i>tarkosh</i> ("a sideboard on which drinks are mixed" (Jastrow)) under which they placed a piece of wood in the shape of a spear [to provide support] in order to be able eat on it, is pure. [If] he made a wooden rim around it to serve that purpose (i.e., to eat on it), it is impure.<br>A stool that was set in a baker's trough in the manner of sitting (i.e., right-side up) is impure, and if it was not in the manner of sitting, it is pure.  [If] it was made inside it: Beit Shammai renders it impure, and Beit Hillel renders it pure (see Eduyot 1:11), the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about one made inside of it, that it is is pure, but Shammai [the Elder] would render it impure. About what did they disagree? About [a stool] that is brought from a different place and [then] set in it, that Beit Shammai render it impure and Beit Hillel render it pure. Said Rabbi Yosei, I prefer the words of Shammai, for I say, even a frame from a workshop is impure.
A loose seat on a coach is pure; [if] he attached it, it is impure. And one that is on the outer side of the coach, either this way or that way (i.e., loose or attached), it is pure, because it is nothing other than a "seat of suffering." A loose stone-cutter's seat is pure; [if] he attached it, it is impure. It may be defiled and purified even ten times in the same day. The leather hide of a privy-stool and its inner cavity: Behold, these are measured with a handbreadth. The gold [base] and the small rug<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>פדר</b> not <b>פרד</b> ("mule") (MS Vienna)</i> that are [placed] in front of a bed, behold, they possess midras-impurity. The planks that are beaten onto [wetted] hides, behold, they are defiled with corpse-impurity. This is the general rule: Anything that is removed and its legs are not removed along with it, whether it is [made] of wood or of stone, it is pure; and anything that is removed and its legs are removed along with it, if it is [made] of wood it is pure, and of stone it is impure. A shoemaker's press that he uses to stretch the letter and sets a stone down on top of it: Even though that [the press] is hollow and can serve as a receptacle, it is pure and is not [rendered impure] on account of being a vessel with a receptacle (i.e., since the hollow is filled with a stone).

Chapter 2

A smooth wooden block that is not higher than a handbreadth is pure, and [as to] that which is higher than a handbreadth, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon render it impure, [and] Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok render it pure. Said Rabbi Meir, it so happened that there was someone who tied together two fronds of a date-palm [which together were higher than a handbreadth] in order to sit on it, and that incident came before the sages, and they declared it impure. Said Rabbi Shimon, it so happened that there was someone that brought a stump of an olive tree, which had been smoothed down like a cupboard, before Rabbi Akiva, and he said, "I used to sit on the like," and he declared it impure for him. His students were in disbelief. He said to them, "Why are you in disbelief? Rabbi Yehoshua declared [something even] worse than this impure!" Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened with four elders, that they were sitting in secret (<i>cheresh</i>) before Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah in Tzippori: Rabbi Chutzpit, and Rabbi Yeshevav, and Rabbi Chalafta, and Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Rabbi Chutzpit the interpreter, and Rabbi Yeshevav the scribe, and Rabbi Chalfta my father, and Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri" (GR"A)</i> and he brought before them the end of one beam that had been removed [from the rest of the beam] with a chisel. And he said, "I was sitting down on this." And they declared it pure for him. Said Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Tzadok, ends of beams were on the Temple Mount, on which artisans would sit and smooth down stones, and the Sages were not concerned for them on account of impurity. And so too would Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Tzadok say, two blocks of wood were in the house of my father, one impure and one pure. I said before my father, "Why is this one impure and that one pure?" He said to me, "The one that is carved out is impure, and the one that is not carved out is pure. And on that one sat Chaggai the Prophet." And as to all of them, if they did not intend to carve them out (i.e., make them concave), they are pure. [If] he found them carved out and considered them [to be objects for sitting], they contract impurity from that point forward. [If] a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor considered them [to be objects for sitting], or [if] a person to whom they did not belong [considered them as such], they are pure.
A wooden block<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כופית</b> not <b>כף</b> ("spoon") (see GR"A)</i> that the priests use for kneading [their dough], and so too the wooden block<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כופית</b> not <b>חבית</b> ("jar") (GR"A"); alt., <b>חפית</b> ("cover") (MS Vienna")</i> for a cooking-pot (i.e., upon which the pot is placed after being removed from the fire): If they are carved out (i.e., made concave), and can hold even the smallest amount [of liquid], they are impure, and if not, they are pure. It so happened with the butcher of Onkelos the Convert, that he brought his [butcher's] block<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כופתו</b> not <b>פתו</b> ("a piece of his bread")</i> before Rabban Gamaliel, and there were eighty-five elders sitting there. Rabban Gamaliel took it and examined it, and handed it to the one next next to him, and that one to the one next to him. When he saw that no one said anything [regarding its purity status], he removed a thread from the linen cloak of a student who was sitting before him, and stretched it out [across the block] and found that it was ever so slightly concave, and declared it impure for him.<br>If they did not intend to carve them out, they are pure. [If] he found them carved out and considered them [to be objects for preparing food upon], they contract impurity from that point forward. [If] a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor considered them [to be objects for preparing foods upon], or [if] a person to whom they did not belong [considered them as such], they are pure.
The trimmings of a <i>mishkav</i> (an object used for lying down): They cannot [contract impurity] if they are less than three by three [handbreadths], and of a <i>moshav</i> (an object used for sitting), one handbreadth, and of a stand, any amount. Of wood: [It is pure] until one makes it concave or until one makes legs for it. A ball, and a shoemaker's last, and an amulet, and tefillin, and a round cushion that were torn: [If] they form a receptacle [large enough to hold] what is [typically] inside them, they are impure. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, they must be immersed [if they form a receptacle] in any amount.  
A saddle possesses riding-impurity, and its wooden grip (i.e., which is fastened to a saddle to grasp while mounting) possesses riding-impurity, and [as to] the remainder of the saddle-attachments that are on the sides, if their width is a handbreadth, they are impure. Rabbi Shimon says, three for sitting [impurity] and three for riding [impurity]. An Ashkelon donkey-belt, a Medean saddle, and the wooden grip -- these are the three for riding. The seat for a female camel and a horse, and a saddle -- these are the three for sitting. The bed, the basket-saddle, and the cushion of one who has died: Rabbi Meir says, they do not impart midras-impurity, and the Sages say, they do impart midras-impurity because women sit on them and weep for their dead, and all agree that they are impure with corpse-impurity.<br>There are three [types of] beds (see Kel. 24:8): One that is made for lying upon possesses midras-impurity. One upon which vessels are sold possesses corpse-impurity. And that of the rectangular bed-frames of Levites is completely pure (Kel. 18:3).<br>There are three [types of] cots:  One that is made for lying upon possesses midras-impurity. One that is used by daughters possesses corpse-impurity. And that used for potters' moldings is completely pure.<br>There are three [types of] hairnets (see Kel. 24:16): That of an old woman possesses midras-impurity. That of a young girl possesses corpse-impurity. One that is torn and cannot hold most of the hair is completely pure.<br>There are three types of sandals: That of a man possesses midras-impurity. That of [molten] metal or of an animal possesses corpse-impurity. And that of cork or goat's hair is completely pure.<br>Rabbi Yosei says, all whips are pure. And the Sages say, there are three types of whips: That of trappers of wild animals possesses midras-impurity. And that of trappers of birds possesses corpse-impurity. And that of fig-pickers is completely pure.<br>Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Tzadok says, the cup of a balance possesses corpse-impurity, and a patch on the inside rim of a kettle, whether it is punctured or whether it is not punctured, is impure; on the outside, if it is punctured it is impure, and if it is not punctured, it is pure. A patch on its side from the inside: [If] it is punctured, it is impure, and if it is not punctured, it is pure. From the outside: Whether punctured or not punctured, it is pure.

Chapter 3

A basket-saddle that was turned inside out: Its outsides become its inside, and its inside [becomes] its outsides. A basket that was turned inside out: Its outsides become its inside, and its inside [becomes] its outsides. Rabbi Meir says, anything that has seams has outsides and an inside (such that if the outsides are defiled, the inside remains pure), [but if] it does not have seams, it has neither outsides nor an inside (such that defilement on either side renders the whole impure (Kel. 25:1)). Rabbi Yehuda says, anything that has a "face," its face is its inside. [A dish with] food compartments onto which impure liquids fell on part of it, the whole thing is impure, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, [if] they fell inside of it, the whole thing is impure. On its outsides, only its outsides are impure. [If] they fell on its broadside, they scour it and it is pure. A smooth sideboard for mixing drinks and a smooth serving board onto which liquids fell on part of them, the whole thing is impure, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, [if] they fell inside of it, the whole thing is impure. On its outsides, only its outsides are impure. [If] they fell on its broadside, they scour it and it is pure. A table upon which liquids fell on part of it, the whole thing is impure. [If] they fell on its outsides, only its outsides are impure. [If] they fell on top of one leg, they scour it and it is pure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, I say, the halacha in the days of the priests [was that] they did not refrain from placing a table leg on top of impure liquids. They said, because it is a leg, it may be scoured and it is pure.
A plough-handle onto which [impure] liquids fell on part of it: The whole thing is impure. [If] they fell onto its underside, only its underside is impure, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [if] it fell on the point of a lance, it is only impure up to seven [handbreadths].  And [if impure liquids] fell on the metal peg, only the four [handbreadths of the beam adjacent to the peg become impure]. A soup ladle (זוֹמָלִיסְטְרוֹן) into which impure liquids fell is entirely impure. [If] they fell on its underside, only its underside is impure. Its inside and the fork and the handle are pure. [If] they fell on top of the fork, they divide the handle: That which services the impure is impure, and that which services the pure is pure. [If] they fell on top of the handle, he dries it off and it is pure. A basket into which [impure] liquids fell is entirely impure. [If] they fell on its undersides, the undersides are impure, [but] its inside and its rim are pure. [If] they fell on top of the rim, he dries it off and it is pure, only that the priests became accustomed to not let their backsides remain impure, because that would become a snare.<br>The quarter-measure and half of the quarter-measure: One who makes a cavity for the quarter-measure and intends to make a cavity for the half quarter-measure in the future, [and] before he makes the cavity for the half quarter-measure the undersides of the quarter-measure were defiled with liquids, the undersides of the half quarter-measure are [also] impure. And when he immerses the quarter-measure, he needs to immerse the half quarter-measure [as well]. [If] there was something on it that interposed [between the vessel and the water], and he immersed it, it is as though he hasn't done anything.
[A block with a cavity of] one-fourth of a <i>kav</i>, that one filled with pieces of wood and affixed them: Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and Rebbi render it impure until it is affixed with a nail. Said Rabbi Akiva, they only mentioned the "gripping place" (Kel. 25:7) in regards to cups, so that one would not drink and defile one after another. Impure liquids that placed on the gripping place of a cup and he touched a pure loaf of bread to them: The loaf is defiled. Pure liquids that were placed on the gripping place of a cup and he touched an impure loaf of bread to them: The liquids are defiled. Impure liquids that were placed on the ground and he touched them [with a cup] whose outer sides were pure, the gripping place defiles the outer sides of the cup. Pure liquids that were placed on the ground and they touched the gripping place of a cup whose outer sides were impure: The liquids are defiled.<br>Rabbi Meir says, [the laws concerning the purity status of various parts of a vessel] apply to impure hands (Kel. 25:7). How so? It is possible to say (alt., "It is <i>im</i>possible to say" (GR"A)), in regards to [a vessel that has been] dried, for hands cannot defile that which is dried. It is impossible to say, in regards to [a vessel] filled with liquids, for unless he touches them, the liquids are not defiled. Conclude from this that his hands were impure and the outsides of the cup were pure, and the liquid dripped onto the outer sides of the cup. He may hold onto it by the gripping place, and he need not be concerned lest the liquids the were on the outer sides of the cup defiled him due to his hands, and that he went back and defiled the cup (Kel. 25:8).
Rabbi Meir says, [the laws concerning the purity status of various parts of a vessel] apply to pure hands (Kel. 25:7). How so? If his hands were pure and liquid was dripping on them, and the outer sides of the cup were impure, he may hold onto it by its gripping place, and he need not be concerned lest the liquid [that remains] on his hands become impure due to the cup, and that they went back and defiled his hands. Rabbi Tarfon says, [this rule applies] to a large wooden trough, [which] has a gripping place on it. This is the general rule: That which is taken up with one hand has one gripping place, [and] that which is taken up with two hands has two gripping places. The place where it is grasped onto -- that is its gripping place. Rabbi Yehuda says, a vessel that has an ear and an ear and a hand has no handling place. Consecrated vessels [are considered to] have no outer sides, or inside, or handling places, and they may not immerse vessels inside vessels for sanctification.<br>Said Rabbi Yosei, this word (<i>achuraim</i>) ("outer sides") is in the dual form, [and thus we may deduce] that anything that has outer sides and an inside must also have a gripping place [that is considered separate for purposes of purity], and anything that lacks outer sides and an inside does not have a [separate] gripping place (see Tosefta Chagigah 3:2). It is the same with consecrated objects for the Temple and consecrated objects for the outlying areas in this regard. All vessels may be rendered susceptible to impurity by thought, but they cannot be rendered unsusceptible to impurity except via a [physical] change brought about by an act (Kel. 25:9). Rabbi Yehuda says, a change brought about by an act can only cause ruin.

Chapter 4

A tefillin box: At what point is it susceptible to impurity? From the time that its manufacture is completed. [Once] he trimmed the edges: Even though he intends to place the straps inside of it in the future, it is impure. And when is its purification? The hand-tefillin, from the time that it is loosened [from the base] on three sides, and the head-tefillin, from the time that it is loosened [from the base] on three sides, and each of the compartments [containing the scrolls] are loosened from one another.<br>A pouch within a pouch, one of which was defiled with liquid: It is impure, and its counterpart is pure. When do these words apply? Whenever the two of them are of equal size, but if the outer one was [larger] than the inner one, [and] the inner one was defiled, the outer one becomes defiled [as well], [but if] the outer one was defiled, the inner one does not become defiled. When do these words apply? In regards to liquids, but in regards to a sheretz, both are equal (i.e., either pouch defiles the other). Said Rabbi Natan, Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages did not disagree about a bag in which money is bundled (see Kel. 26:2). About what did they disagree? About a bag in which pearls are bundled, that Rabbi Eliezer renders it impure and the Sages render it pure. A bag in which pearls are bundled: Whenever they are inside it, it is impure; when it is  empty, it is pure. [In this way,] it can become defiled and purified even ten times in a day.<br> A leather hide that he made to be placed over his chest during the harvest because of the heat is impure: If it is five by five [handbreadths], it is impure, and if not, it is pure. [A leather hide] for [protecting] his heel or the sole of his foot: If it covers the majority of his foot, it is impure, and if not, it is pure.
A straw sandal: Rabbi Akiva renders it impure, and a woman can perform chalitzah with it, and they can go out with it on Shabbat, but [the Sages] did not agree with him. A sandal whose holes (i.e., the toe-opening and the foot-opening) were torn open, or its loops were torn open, or most of one of its soles became separated from it, is pure. [If only] one of its holes was torn open or one of its loops was torn open, or if an area the size of the sole became separated from it, it is impure. Rabbi Yehuda says, the inner one renders it impure and the outer one renders it pure. A sandal that opened up and can [still] hold most of the foot, [or] a shoe that became separated and [still] covers most of the foot, or its straps were torn, or its lining was removed, is impure. [If] it opened up and it cannot hold most of the foot, or its holes tore open, it is pure. A shoe that is on a shoemaker's last: Rabbi Eliezer renders it pure and the Sages render it impure (Kel. 26:4). Said Rabbi Shimon, for behold<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אר"ש שהרי</b>; alt.,<b>אר"ש שזורי</b> ("Said Rabbi Shimon Shezuri") (GR"A)</i>, Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages did not disagree about a shoe [that is on a shoemaker's last], that it is pure. About what did they disagree? About one that was taken from the shoemaker's last, for Rabbi Eliezer renders it pure and the Sages render it impure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Rabbi Eliezer renders it <i>impure</i> and the Sages render it <i>pure</i>" (MS Vienna)</i>, because a woman may wear it and return it to the shoemaker's last. 
The hide of a donkey, and the hide used by a donkey-driver, and the hide used by a flax-worker, and the hide used by a doctor, and the hide used to cover a child's chest, and the hide of that young girls spin around on: If it has an area of five by five [handbreadths], it is impure, and if not, it is pure. The hide used for a rug, and the hide spread over a bedframe (קטבליא (GR"A)), and the hide that covers a cushion, and the hide that covers a bolster: Even though they do not have an area of five by five [handbreadths], they are impure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, if they have an area of five [by five], they are impure, and if not they are pure, for there are no hides that are less than an area of five by five. A hide that was prepared to be a shroud: It is impure no matter how small.<br>Said Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Yosei, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about a bag for purple wool or a wrapping for purple wool, that they are impure (Kel. 26:6). About what did they disagree? About a bag for garments and a wrapping for garments, for Beit Shammai render them impure and Beit Hillel render them pure. A wrapping for purple wool: Whenever [the wool] is inside of it, it is impure; when it is  empty, it is pure. [In this way,] it can become defiled and purified even ten times in a day. A bag for wool and a knapsack that comes from lands overseas: Even though they come oversized, they are impure.   
A box and a chest and a cupboard made of bone or of reed-grass (alt., "leather" (GR"A)): Rebbi renders it impure and Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda renders it pure. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says, a fur<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עוצבא</b> not <b>אצבע</b> ("finger") (GR"A)</i> that he intended to trim and remove its tail is pure, and all that have not yet been sent to be stretched out or scoured are pure. [If] they lack being [reinforced with] netting<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>סבכה</b>; alt., <b>סיכה</b> ("rubbed with oil") (GR"A)</i>, they are [nonetheless] impure. A mat: Whether it is in the house of a thief or the house of a robber, it is considered to be impure because its owners have given up on it. The covering of a wicker basket for flasks or for cups (cf. Kel. 16:2), even though it has an area of five by five [handbreadths], it is pure, for it is only a covering and it there is nothing joining it with the impure vessels [that it covers]. A leather strip that is placed on the face of a donkey, even though it has an area of five by five [handbreadths], it is pure, for it is only a covering. Its bolster is pure, but if it was stitched to the saddle, it is impure. And [if] it can hold even the smallest quantity [of liquids], it is impure.<br>One who fashions a girdle to be tied around an animal's chest or to wrap around an animal is pure. For under the belly of a donkey, it is impure. The [measure for impurity for the] remnants of a girdle is four handbreadths, which suffices to place it under the belly of a donkey. One who fashions a girdle of a minute size: It is pure, [but if it is used] to strengthen packing bags with it, to travel with it from place to place, it is impure. All the [ornamental] fringes (גדילות) for animals are pure; and for people, all are pure except for those of sack-cloth or cloth.<br>A sling whose pocket is made of surveyor rope: Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas renders it pure, and the Sages say, [if] three it is impure, and [if] two it is pure. [If] the middle one split apart, it is impure, and if the outer one [split apart], it is pure. [If] a handbreadth remains of it, it is impure. [If] its string handle split apart, it is impure (Eduyot 3:5). All mats, whether of bamboo (<i>sha'am</i>) or of sack-cloth or of goat's hair, Rabbi Dosa says, they are defiled with corpse-impurity, and the Sages say, midras-impurity (Eduyot 3:4).

Chapter 5

A linen frock: From what point is it susceptible to impurity? From the time that its manufacture is complete. And when is its manufacture complete? From the time that he "opens its mouth" (i.e., makes an opening large enough for the wearer one to slip over his head. For a large person according to how large he is, and for a small person according to how small he is. And from what point is its purification? From the time that it wears out and it can no longer be used for its original purpose. [If] it got worn out but the majority of the upper portion remains intact, it is impure. The majority of the lower portion, it is pure. And if it was ripped from its opening, it is pure.<br>A frock of papyrus: From what point is it susceptible to impurity? From the time that its manufacture is complete. And when is its manufacture complete? From the time that he "opens its mouth." For a large person according to how large he is, and for a small person according to how small he is. And from what point is its purification? From the time that it wears out and it can no longer be used for its original purpose. [If] it got worn out but the majority of the upper portion remains intact, it is impure. The majority of the lower portion, it is pure. And if it was ripped from its opening, it is pure.
A bulk of papyrus that was adapted to use to gird one's loins with it is impure. A bulk of hemp that was adapted to use to gird one's loins with it is pure. Two bulks of hemp that were stitched together and adapted to use to gird one's loins with them are impure. Said Rabbi Yosei, Yonatan ben Charsa of Ginosaur came before the Elders in Yavneh and asked, "Two bulks of hemp that were stitched together and adapted to use to gird one's loins with them, what is their status?" They said to him, "Impure." "Punctured soft dates on the tree, what is their status?" They said to him, "Even the entire palm tree is forbidden." "The gap of an espalier (Kil. 7:3), what is its status in regards to the prohibition [against mixed seeds]?" They said to him, "[It is prohibited] until the place that the new growth is able to reach during that same year."<br>One who makes a belt from [a strip on] the side of a garment or from [a strip on] the side of a sheet, Beit Shammai render it impure and Beit Hillel render it pure until it is "circumcised" (i.e., until a strip on the other side is also used). From the middle of a garment or from the middle of sheet, and he circumcised it on one side: Beit Shammai render it impure and Beit Hillel render it pure until he circumcises it on the other side. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about one who makes a belt from the middle of a garment or from the middle of a sheet[<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the bracketed portion follows the GR"A's emendations, as the printed text is defective here</i>and circumcises it on one side, that it is pure until it is circumcised on the other side. About what did they disagree? About one who made a belt from the side of a garment or from the side of sheet], for Beit Shammai renders it impure and Beit Hillel renders it pure until such time that he circumcises it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, a belt whose edges became worn out but its middle portion remains intact is impure on account of [the law of] "the remainders of a belt." The edge [of a garment] that became separated from the garment, and it was adapted to use to gird one's loins with it is impure, became it is like a netted wrapping.
A cloak that started tearing: Before the majority of it is torn, that which touches even the separated portion, on this side or on that side, is [considered] connected [to the rest of the cloak]. Once the majority of it is torn, that which touches even the connected portion is not [considered] connected [to the rest of the cloak].<br>What are the "thick materials" and what are the "thin materials" [that are not governed by the size of three fingerbreadths (Kel. 28:8)]? Those such as the <i>birtzin</i> (cloaks of thick woolen material), and [those such as] the <i>bartitzin</i> (Brundisian cloaks, thicker than the <i>birtzin</i>), and the <i>familiyot</i> (knee-breeches), and the <i>chamilot</i> (thick, coarse blankets), and white linen garments, and the <i>sagusin</i> (coarse woolen blankets) -- these are the thick materials. The fine silk, and the inferior silk, and the <i>Kallakh</i> wool and the felt-cap: They are not [impure] on account of [the law of] three by three [fingerbreadths], but they are [impure] on account of [the law of] three by three [handbreadths]. One who fashions a shirt out of a wine strainer (cf. Kel. 28:9) that had worn out: If the strainer [remains capable of performing] its original function, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon says, those of sack-cloth or of cloth, their measure is that of a strainer. Of bamboo and of goat's hair and of rope, their measure is that of pomegranates. 
The funnel of a wine-press: Even though it is made like a large sieve, it is impure. A thread that became separated from a garment, even one hundred cubits, all of it is [considered] a single unit [for purposes of impurity]. And a small amount [of thread] that he sews into [the garment]: [If] it was necessary for it to be sewn in, it is [considered] joined; and [if] it was not necessary for it to be sewn in, it is not [considered] joined. A prostitute's shirt that is woven like a net (see Kel. 28:9): [If] it was made three fingerbreadths wide, either above or below or on the sides, it is impure. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, one who makes a garment from a fisherman's net or from a hunter's net, and he folded it over and sewed it, and the [wearer's] flesh cannot be seen through it, it is impure. The the forehead band of a hair-net (see Neg. 11:11) is impure on its own because it can be adapted for use as a net by another. And what would be its measure [for purposes of impurity]? Of sufficient quantity that it surrounds [the head] from ear to ear. The satin and the metal plating and the metal links of [the forehead band] are pure [on their own], but on account of their being joined to the forehand band, they are impure. And the cords of [the forehead band] that are stitched to it are [considered] joined; [if] they are [only] knotted, they are not [considered] joined. Others say, the hair net of an old woman that is torn may be placed on a chair, and her flesh touches the chair [through the net], it is pure; and if not, it is impure (see Kel. 28:9). The remnants of a <i>p'sik'yah</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>פסיקיא</b> ("band or fillet worn by women over the breast; girdle; bandage round the legs and feet") (Jastrow)</i>, of sufficient size to wrap around the waist of a young girl. The remnants of fringes (i.e., that are cut off when the weaver finishes the garment<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אוזמיאות</b> (see Jastrow)</i>), of sufficient size to wrap around the finger of a young girl.

Chapter 6

One who alters a leather vessel from one [type of] simple vessel (i.e., without a receptacle) to [another type of] simple vessel: It is impure. From one with a receptacle to one without a receptacle: It is pure. And as to clothing, all are impure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, my colleagues used to say, [with respect to] a sack and a leather hide and a reed mat that are used patch up one another, [the purity status of the patch] of the one is not nullified by [virtue of being patched onto the larger area of] the other. A sack and a leather hide and a reed mat that were torn: If they are placed on a chair and one's flesh can touch the chair, it is impure, and if not, it is pure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "it is <i>pure</i>, and if not, it is <i>impure</i>" (GR"A, and see Kel. 27:12); if the tear was so large that the material cannot even cover the seat of a chair, then the material has no useful purpose and is thereby pure</i>. A sack and a leather skin and a reed mat that were thrown into a dung heap are impure. A strip of cloth that was used to patch up a basket requires intention [regarding its new usage] after it is separated [from the rest of the cloth]. A poor-man's cloak that was worn out: If the majority of its edges remain intact, even if it does not have an area of three-by-three, it is impure. [If] the majority of its edges do not remain intact, [then] if it has an area of three-by-three, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, if it has an area of three-by-three, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. [If] there were <i>davdolin</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>דבדולין</b> (frayed threads from the part that was torn) (Zar Zahav)</i> that came out of it, all that are opposite the border [of the material] are [considered] joined, and all that are not opposite the border are not [considered] joined.
A goatskin bag that a priest cut open to use it to remove loaves of terumah from the oven (i.e., as an oven mitt) is pure. A leather hide that was placed on the table in order to eat on it is impure, and its measure [for purposes of impurity] is a handbreadth. The hand-hold and the covering of a window<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חלון</b>; alt., <b>חלוק</b> (shirt or frock) (GR"A)</i>, behold, they are measured doubled (i.e., folded over). This is the general rule: That which comes doubled is measured doubled; that which comes simple is measured simple.<br>[And with what midras-impurity did [a divided piece of cloth] come in contact?<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">following MS Vienna; this refers to Kel. 27:10, which states that a three-by-three cloth that was divided does not possess midras-impurity but can still be defiled by contact with midras impurity</i>] Rabbi Yosei concedes that if there were two -- this one on top of that one -- that one did not nullify the other. Three by three inside the house, behold, it is impure, for the entire house is [considered to have the properties] of a concealed location. [If] he found it behind the door or in his clothing or a <i>pundion</i> (a type of coin) was bundled in it, or a needle was stuck through it, or it was used to plug up a small basket or a large basket, it is pure, and it will never become impure unless he dies it for [use as part of] a garment. Rabbi Shimon says, [if] he uses it for something that is susceptible to impurity, it is impure, and for something that is not susceptible to impurity, it is pure. 
A three-by-three fingerbreadth [piece of fabric] that all of it was made of two threads that ran alongside each other   is impure (contra Kel. 27:12, "pure"). Rabbi Yosei b'Rabbi Yehuda says, if all of it was made of two threads that ran alongside each other, it is impure, [but] if it had a fringe, it is pure. Less than three-by-three that was adapted to stop up a hole in a public bath, or to empty out a cooking-pot, or to wipe millstones (Kel. 28:2): If it is from that the prepared (i.e., previously designated for that purpose), it is impure, but [if] not from the prepared, it is pure, the words of Rabbi Eliezer, [and] Rabbi Yehoshua says, whether it is from the prepared or whether it is not from the prepared, it is pure, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, Rabbi Eliezer says, whether it is from the prepared or whether it is not from the prepared, it is impure, [and] Rabbi Yehoshua says, whether it is from the prepared or whether it is not from the prepared, it is pure. Rabbi Akiva says, from the prepared, it is impure, and not from the prepared, it is pure. 
A three-by-three fingerbreadth [piece of fabric] that was used as a compress, an emollient, or a plaster is pure. A three-by-three handbreadth [piece of fabric] that was used as a compress, an emollient, or a plaster is impure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, [for] a compress, it is pure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>טהורה</b> not <b>טמאה</b> (GR"A)</i>; [for] an emollient or a plaster, it is impure, and so too would Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel say, one who makes a compress from frankincense spices  (סממנין, see Shab. 74b:3) -- it is pure, and from grasses -- it is impure, because it is poured out. A leather compress -- it is pure; a [leather] emollient or a plaster -- it is impure.<br>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, the words of Rabban Gamaliel (Kel. 28:4) are preferable in regards to the coverings of scrolls, and we agree with his words. Rabbi Yehuda says, even for those of a burying-woman (i.e., a mother who buries her infant in such a covering)<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>קברנית</b> (MS Vienna and Mishnat Eretz Yisrael to Kil. 9:3)</i>. Similarly, Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, those [placed on] a reading-desk for a scroll are pure, and for its carrying case are impure. And the stand that is on it is [considered] joined for purposes of impurity and sprinkling.
The head-covering of an old woman (Kel. 29:1) that was defiled with midras-impurity, and they used it for [covering] a scroll: Rabbi Meir renders it pure and Rabbi Yosei renders it impure. All vessels descend into susceptibility for impurity by intention, but they cannot rise from their susceptibility to impurity except by a change-effecting action. Rabbi Yehuda says, a change-effecting action can only cause ruin (i.e., alter an object's status for the worse). 

Chapter 7

Shreds (or "dangling threads") from the girth and of the wrapping cloths [are impure] in any size. Shreds of under-garments -- ten fingerbreadths, and if they are interwoven (סבך (GR"A)), in any size. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, interwoven [material] ascends [from impurity] with a measure of three handbreadths, and does not ascend with a measure of three-by-three handbreadths. [If] it was wide: If it was placed on a chair and his flesh touched the chair, it is pure, and if not, it is impure. Shreds of <i>birsin</i> (cloaks of thick woolen material), and <i>bartisin</i> (Brundisian cloaks, thicker than the birtzin), and <i>familiyot</i> (knee-breeches), and the <i>chamiliyot</i> (thick, coarse blankets), and white linen garments, and  <i>sagusin</i> (coarse woolen blankets), and cushions, and bolsters: Three fingerbreadths. The cord of a plumb-line: Twelve fingerbreadths, and of carpenters, eighteen fingerbreadths, and [the size of its bag for purposes of impurity] is like that of a saddle-bag. The cord of builders and plasterers is fifty cubits. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, even that of surveyors is fifty cubits. The chain of the scales of those who weigh metal is two handbreadths, because he grabs onto it with two hands and lifts it up.
[The measure of] the handle of a knife [purposes of impurity] is a handbreadth, and the shards of a cup is a handbreadth, and the shards of a winnowing fan is two handbreadths, and the handle of an axe from its backside is three fingerbreadths, and Rabbi Yosei says, [if the handle it is less than] a handbreadth on its backside, the whole thing is pure. The handle of a large or a small plane is six handbreadths. The handle of a large or a small scraper is five. The handle of a small slaughtering-knife is five and of a large slaughtering knife is ten. The handle of a householder's trowel: Beit Shammai say, seven handbreadths, and Beit Hillel say, eight handbreadths. Of plasterers, Beit Shammai say, nine, and Beit Hillel say, ten. More than that, it is not [considered] joined [to the trowel], either for impurity or for sprinkling. When do these words apply? When he does not intend to cut [the beam] with it, but when he does intend to cut [the beam] with it, it is [considered] joined for impurity, but not joined for sprinkling, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei say, not even for impurity.<br>Said Rabbi Yosei: I said one thing, and they said one thing. I said to them, "Do you not concede to me regarding the cord of builders and of plasterers, [that its maximum measure for impurity is] five cubits, so that if one wants to maintain [a handle] larger than this, he will be pure?" And they said to me, "Do you not concede to us regarding the shreds of a sheet and of a head-scarf, and of a weaver, and of a felt cap, [that their minimum measure for impurity is] six fingerbreadths, and of a nightgown, ten, so that if he wants to maintain larger than this, that he would be impure?" And I prefer my words to their words, for I am responding to them [with a proof] from something that is joined for impurity and for sprinkling, about something that is joined for impurity and for sprinkling. And they respond to me [with a proof] from something that that is joined for impurity and for sprinkling, about something that they concede is not connected for sprinkling.<br>Everything that they mentioned regarding the "projection of a handle" (Kel. 29:5): The handle is in front of them. That which one is accustomed to grasp in one hand, such as the handle of an axe, [the measure is] a handbreadth, and that which one is accustomed to grasp with two hands, such as the handle of a trowel, [the measure is] two handbreadths.
[The laws of impurity regarding] glass vessels derives from rabbinic enactments. The simple  ones (i.e., which lack a receptacle) are pure and those that have a receptacle are impure. A chest and an ark and a cupboard of glass that come oversized are pure, and [as to] the remainder of all the glass vessels, even if they come oversized, they are impure. And this is a stringency with glass vessels over wooden vessels. Glass vessels do not receive impurity until their manufacture is complete, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, as soon as they are taken out of their molds. A [glass] serving tray that was made into a looking-mirror, even though it can be used [for its original purpose], it is pure. [If] it was impure and it was made into a looking-mirror, it is impure until it is affixed [to the window-frame] with a nail. A <i>tarvad</i> (a spoon that is pointed on top and curved at the end) of metal: Whether it has a handle or whether it does not have a handle, whether it can hold a small amount [of liquid] or whether it cannot hold [even] a small amount [of liquid], it is impure. And of wood or of bone or of glass: If it can hold a small amount [of liquid], it is impure. [With respect] to those that cannot hold [even] a small amount [of liquid], but rather are used for stirring and pouring, Rabbi Akiva renders them impure and Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri renders them pure.
A stone cup that was punctured, that one dripped [molten] lead inside (i.e., to fill the hole): Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, it is impure on account of [the laws] of metal vessels. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, Yehuda ben Shammua would declare it impure in the name of Rabbi Meir. A glass jug whose bottom rim was removed: If it can sit in its normal manner, Rebbi renders it impure and the Sages render it pure, and if from the start they made it rimmed, all agree that it is impure. A cup and a small flask that were punctured, either from above or from below, are pure. A serving tray and a platter that were punctured from above are impure; from below, they are pure. [If] they cracked: If they can hold hot [liquids] as well as cold [without leaking out], they are impure, and if not, they are pure. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, cups from Sidon [that are manufactured] in pieces are pure because [their rough edges] lacerate the lips, and the Sages render them impure. An oil flask  or a wine flask whose mouth was removed: [If] it was removed with one hand, it is impure, and if with two hands it is pure. A glass lantern that has a receptacle for oil is impure. A receptacle for a candle, it is pure. And it only can be defiled by that which services the needs [of the receptacle]. A bed and a chair and a bench and a <i>catedra</i> and a kneading trough of glass, and all [vessels otherwise susceptible to] midras-impurity, are pure if made from glass<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Tos. Kelim Kamma 2:1 (stating this rule as to earthenware vessels)</i>. A penknife, and a reed pen, and a plumb-line, and weights, and <i>amidin</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עמידין</b> ("iron tools for crowding olives into the vat") (Jastrow)</i>, and a measuring rod, and a measuring-table of glass are [all] pure.
