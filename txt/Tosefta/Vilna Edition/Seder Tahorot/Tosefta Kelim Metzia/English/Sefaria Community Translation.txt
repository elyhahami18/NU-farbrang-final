Chapter 1

[On the question of whether re-forged metal vessels revert to their former state of impurity (Kel. 11:1)], Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, "Not as to any impurity; rather, [only] as to impurity of the soul."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><i>tum'at hanefesh</i>, i.e., corpse-impurity (Zar Zahav)</i> Rabbi Shimon says, even a metal vessel that was defiled by a tevul yom, or by one possessing corpse-impurity<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">GR"A strikes the phrase "or by one possessing corpse-impurity"</i>, reverts to having [the impurity status of a] tevul yom. One who fashions a vessel from the [same] mass of metal that was used to weigh down a ship (i.e., an anchor), or from a large vessel that was used to steal<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>לגנוב</b> not <b>לגבות</b> ("mount") (GR"A)</i> taxes (i.e., a safe), Rabbi Meir renders it impure, and the Sages render it pure. Rabbi Yosei says, even one who fashions [vessels] from metal strips, they are impure. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, one who fashions vessels from metal filings, they are impure. Said Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about nails that are known to have been fashioned from impure vessels, or about nails that are not known to have been fashioned from pure vessels. About what did they disagree? About ordinary [nails], which Beit Shammai render impure and Beit Hillel render pure (Kel. 11:3).
One who fashions [metal] vessels from shards of old vessels, [whether] from the Land [of Israel] or whether from outside the Land, they are impure. Rabbi Yehuda says, one who fashions [metal] vessels from shards of old vessels from outside the Land, they are pure.  Pure vessels which one lined with unclean glaze (onyx) are pure, [but] one who fashions vessels from unclean glaze are impure. A hatchet that was fashioned from the impure, and the pure was added onto it; or that was fashioned from the pure, and the impure was added onto it: Everything follows after [the purity status when it was capable of] performing [its intended] function. [If] they fashioned it from the pure: Even though its glazing (or polishing) was from the impure, it is pure. A ladle that was fashioned from the impure, and its rims from the pure, it is pure. [If] they fashioned it from the pure and its rims [were] from the impure, it is impure. Everything follows after [the purity status] of the receptacle. A <i>k'veret</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"a large round vessel, receptacle of grain, water, etc." (Jastrow)</i> that was fashioned from cement, and its rims from dung, it is pure. [If] they fashioned it from dung and its rims from cement, everything follows after [the purity status] of the rims, the words of Rabbi Natan. [Rebbi] says<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">MS Vienna</i>, the receptacle was formed before the rims. Cement and dung that were mixed with one another, and one made vessels from [the mixture], if the majority was from the impure, it is impure, and if the majority is from the pure, it is pure. Half and half, Rabbi Eliezer says,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Half and half, it is impure. Rabbi Eliezer says, etc." (GR"A)</i> they may burn terumah on [such vessels], and they are not liable on their account  in connection with the impurity of the Temple and consecrated food. Said Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri came to the place of Rabbi Chalafta (i.e., Rabbi Yosei's father). He said to him, "What do you say about a metal spindle-knob?" He said to him, "It is impure." He said to him, "Even I say so. However, Akiva renders it pure."
Regarding a "klustra" (door bolt): Rabbi Tarfon declares it impure, but the Sages declare it pure. Beruriah says, "[One may] remove it from this doorway and hang it on the neighboring doorway on Shabbat." When these words were spoken before Rabbi Joshua, he said, "Beruriah has spoken well (i.e., correctly)." § A [metal-]coated double-flute is pure, [but if] one made a receptacle from wings (or "for wings"), it is impure, but only the one who uses it for its purpose is impure. A [metal-]coated flute is pure, but if one made a receptacle from cups (or "for cups"), it is impure, but only the one who uses it for its purpose is impure. And its cups are impure and they are not [considered] connected to [the flute]. [If] a metal-coated vessel was connected to the mouthpiece of a trumpet [with multiple] sections (i.e., which can be disassembled and assembled), behold, that is impure. [If] it was disassembled, the upper [section] is impure and the lower [section] is pure. A nail that one uses to extract a candlewick, and tongs that one uses to flatten a candlewick, are impure. A nail that one uses to raise and lower a branch of a candlestick to and from the base [of the candlestick] is impure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>טמא</b> not <b>טהור</b> (GR"A)</i>, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel renders it pure. [If the nail] was plated with tin, or with a mixture of lead and tin, it is [considered] joined [to the base] for purposes of impurity and for sprinkling. [If the nail] was driven [into the base], it is [considered] joined for purposes of impurity but not for sprinkling. [If] it was removed and [then] replaced, it is neither joined with its impurity nor with its sprinkling (and see Tosefta Kelim Kamma 2:2 (same)). § A reptile-shaped ornament (<i>rachosh</i>) which broke [out of its setting], or whose point was broken off, is pure, but if the hooks remain on both sides, it is impure. A necklace with links of red coral supported by metal hooks, behold, they are pure, for they were only made to provide support. [If] it broke apart, each and every one is pure on its own. Rabbi Eliezer says, the [detached] hook of an earring<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b> נזם</b> not <b>כוס</b> ("cup") (Jastrow at <b>II צִנּוֹרָא</b>)</i> is pure on its own.
All masks (<i>partzufot</i>) are impure, but a mask [that has been] ground into powder<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הדקה</b> alt., "a <i>thin</i> mask" (i.e., a leather mask worn to scare little children (GR"A)); and see Avodah Zarah 42b:17 ("all [figures of] faces are permitted, except for a human face")</i> is pure. Its metal shoe<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the metal shoe of a statue suspected of idolatrous use (Zar Zahav); see also Tosefta Kelim Batra 2:4 ("[a sandal] of metal or of an animal possesses corpse-impurity")</i>, behold, it is defiled with corpse-impurity. All signet rings are pure, and they cannot be defiled, except for a metal signet ring that is used for imprinting a seal. A metal amulet, behold, it is defiled with corpse-impurity. [If] it was separated into sections, the lower section is impure and the upper section is pure. The leather used to wrap an amulet is impure, [but if it] is flat, it is pure. It may become defiled and purified even ten times. A plate upon which he wrote the incantation is pure. [If] he cut off a piece of it and fashioned it into a link (or ring) for a piece of jewelry, it is impure. A pot-stand containing metal, behold, it is defiled with corpse-impurity. All ornaments used for animals, such as bracelets, nose-rings, chains, and rings, are pure, except for a [cattle-]bell that creates a sound [that is beneficial] for people. One who makes bells (i.e., bell-shaped objects) for a spice mill, for a cradle, for book-covers, and for children's diapers, they are [all] pure. [But] if he made clappers for them, they are impure. [If] he removed the clapper [afterwards], it is pure. A doorbell is pure, a cowbell is impure. A doorbell that they made into a cowbell is pure, but a cowbell that they made into a doorbell -- even if it was attached to the ground, and even if it was affixed with a nail -- is impure.
Bells found in any place are presumed to be pure, except for those found in a fortified city, because most of them are doorbells (i.e., there are few livestock due to the lack of pastureland). [If] he said to a craftsman, "Make me two bells, one for a door and one for cattle," or "Make me two mats, one for lying down on and one for tents," or "Make me two sheets, one for embroidery and and one for tents," behold, they are [both] impure, up until the time that he separates them [and designates each one], and Rabbi Shimon renders them pure until the time that he separates them. But a craftsman who makes, and carries in stock, bells for cattle and for doors; mats for lying down on and mats for tents; sheets for embroidery and sheets for tents, if most of them are from the impure, they are [all considered] impure until he separates them (i.e., those intended for the "pure" purpose) for purity. If most of them are from the pure, they are [all considered] pure until he separates them (i.e., those intended for the "impure" purpose) for impurity.

Chapter 2

A ring that he uses to gird his loins, or which he binds between his shoulders, is pure, and no [ring] is impure except for a finger-ring. A [finger] ring, whether it is engraved or whether it is not engraved, is impure, but [if] it is plated, it is pure. Said one student among the students of the Upper Galilee before Rabbi Eliezer: "I heard that they distinguish between one ring and another ring." He said to him, "Perhaps you only heard about that matter in reference to Shabbat, that one who goes out with an engraved [ring] is liable, and if it is not engraved, he is exempt." A needle: Whether it has an eye or whether it does not have an eye, is impure, but [if] it is plated, it is pure. Another thing that one student among the students of the Upper Galilee said before Rabbi Eliezer: "I heard that they distinguish between one needle and another needle." He said to him, "Perhaps you only heard about that matter in reference to Shabbat, that one who goes out with a needle with an eye is liable, and if it does not have an eye, he is exempt."  
The chain of a double saddle-bag -- behold, it is pure, and [the chain] of a surveyor -- behold, it is impure, because he stretches out tents with it [and thus it is presumed to have corpse-impurity]. And [the chain] of a padlock, and of all other vessels, that which serves the impure is impure, and that which serves the pure is pure. The chain of the wholesale merchants is impure because it is made for tying up the cattle of homeowners (contra Kel. 12:1 ("A chain for tying up cattle is pure")). If one modified it for protecting [one's property] it is impure. Rabbi Yosei says, the same principle applies to a needle, a chain, and a rope. [If] he had two [doors to which he attached the chain], or if he attached a snail-shaped piece to the end [of the chain], it is impure.
The beam of a hatcheller's scale, if it has ounce-measures (<i>unkiyot</i>) but does not have hooks (<i>unklaot</i>), [or] it has hooks but does not have ounce-measures, it is impure. [If] its hooks were separated [from the beam], it is pure, and once he reattaches them, [the entire beam is considered] joined for purposes of impurity and sprinkling. The case of a lock and so too the fastening (<i>klaustra</i>) of a lock, it is joined for purposes of impurity but it is not joined for purposes of sprinkling. A steelyard balance (a type of scale used for weighing merchandise by sliding weights along a rod to balance the load suspended from hooks on the chains) that has a [hidden] receptacle for coins is impure, and it only defiles that which services the purpose [of deceit]. Its metal arches, whether they serve as receptacles, or whether they do not serve as receptacles, they are impure. And those of wood or of bone or of glass that serve as receptacles are impure, and those that do not serve as receptacles are pure. [If] he joined it to the beam and joined the beam to the steelyard balance, all of it is [considered] a single joined unit. A glass lantern<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>פנס</b> not <b>פיקטו</b> (MS Vienna, Zar Zahav)</i> that has a receptacle for oil is impure;  a receptacle for a candle, it is pure, and it only becomes defiled [when the receptacle acts] in service of [the glass lantern's] primary purpose. The supporting pillars<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>תמירות</b>; alt., <b>מגורות</b> ("compartments") (MS Vienna, GR"A)</i> of [a glass lantern], whether they have a receptacle or whether they do not have a receptacle, are impure, and those of wood or of bone or of glass with a receptacle are impure and without a receptacle are pure.
A candelabra that has a receptacle for oil is impure; a receptacle for a candle, it is pure, and it only becomes defiled [when the receptacle acts] in service of [the candelabra's] primary purpose. And a nail from which one hangs funnels is pure, and the funnels are impure, and they are not [considered] joined to it. Decorative arched vessels<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><i>akunb'yaot</i>, e.g., ornamental vases (see Jastrow, <b>אֲקוּנְבִּי</b>)</i> that are on a cupboard [or] that are on a four-post bed, and their [decorative] "galleries" and "colonnades"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>סובין</b> not <b>סופין</b> (Jastrow); alt., <b>סוגין</b> ("large provision chests") (GR"A)</i>, behold, they are pure, for they are only made for ornamentation. The hook of a strongbox is impure, but if it was oversized, it is pure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, for what reason is the spice-peddlers' [hook] that is in front of him impure (Kel. 12:2)? Because he suspends [merchandise] from it. And of [the hook] behind him, it is pure, because it is only made for protection. § The metal cover of homeowners' baskets (Kel. 12:3): Rabban Gamaliel says it is impure, and the Sages render it pure. And a wooden [cover] is pure.  If it had a concave [receptacle] up to half its size, or up to a third of its size, it is impure, because it is like the lid of a cauldron. Less than that, it is pure, because it is like the cover of a clothing chest (see Kel. 16:7). And for what reason is the door of physicians' cupboards impure? Because he places medicinal compresses on it, and he hangs his scissors on it. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says, because he molds [the limbs of] a baby on it. They said to him, if so, it would have midras-impurity.
And these are the "unfinished metal vessels that are pure" (Kel. 12:6): All that he intends to sand over, or to saw off [a portion], or to form a rim, or to adorn with designs, or to beat with a mallet. [If] they were missing a rim or a handle or a knob, they are pure. [If] they were missing their cover, they are impure. These are the "tongs" (Kel. 12:3): Those that the shopkeepers use to stir the pot. What are the "crushers"? Those which are attached to the portable stoves<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כירים</b> (MS Vienna)</i>. A shopkeeper's bowl studded over with nails: Even if all of them are of wood and one is of metal, it is impure, and of homeowners, even if all of them are of metal and one of them is of wood, [it is pure,] for it was only made to service the earth. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, a scraper's nail<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., which is fastened to a smith's block (Jastrow)</i> is pure because it was only made to service the earth.<br>Said Rabbi Natan, Rabban Gamaliel and the Sages did not disagree about the hanger of the strigil<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מגרדות</b> (a curved metal tool used to scrape off dirt and oil prior to bathing)</i> (Kel. 12:6) of public bath attendants, that it is pure, for it was only made to service the earth (i.e., the dirt on one's body). About what did they disagree? About metal basins<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ספות</b>; alt., <b>חבית</b> ("jar") (Zar Zahav, Rash MiShantz to Kelim 12:6)</i> of homeowners that are fashioned like an arch<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ככיפה</b> (Rash MiShantz to Kel. 12:6), not <b>כמפה</b> ("like a towel"); alt., <b>ככפיפה</b> ("like a wicker basket") (GR"A); alt., <b>בכפיפה</b> ("<i>in</i> a wicker basket") (Zar Zahav)</i>, for Rabban Gamaliel renders it impure because the servants rub [their feet] with it, and the Sages render it pure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, Rabban Gamaliel and the Sages did not disagree about  [an earthenware tray] that is divided into two parts, one of which is twice as large as the other, that the large one is impure and the small one is pure. About what did they disagree? About [a tray] where one part is not twice as large as the other, and where both of them are equal [in size], for Rabban Gamaliel renders it impure and the Sages render it pure.
A nail that they bent in order to unlock and lock (i.e., to pick a lock) is impure. [If] they modified it to provide protection, it is pure. [If] they modified it to be used in a shoe or a sandal (see GR"A), it is pure. [If] they placed it in a sickle so that the blade does not loosen, it is impure, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel renders it pure. [If] they placed it in a hand-millstone, or in a donkey-millstone, it is impure. Pivots that are added to the upper millstone, behold, they are pure, for they are only made to strengthen it. A workbench and a block of metal are impure. Weights that broke: Even if they bring them back (i.e., after repairing them) and weigh with them, they are pure. If he designated [the broken pieces] as weighing a half-liter, a third-liter, or a quarter-liter, they are susceptible to impurity.<br>And these are the "unfinished wooden vessels that are impure" (see Kel. 12:8): All that one intended to smooth, to to scrape, to hollow out, or to plane<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ולהקיש בקורנס</b> (Bartenura to Kel. 11:3)</i>. [If] they lack a cup, a rim, an ear, or a hand, they are [nonetheless] impure. [If] they lack being hollowed out, they are pure. A seah-measure that one intends to level off from below is impure; from above, it is pure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, wooden vessels are not susceptible to impurity until their manufacture is complete, and a seah-measure, once the ropes are attached to it. All unfinished wooden vessels are impure except those of boxwood, because they do not require boiling [before being used]. Rabbi Yehuda says, one who fashions vessels from olive branches -- they are pure because they do not require boiling, and they cause whatever is in them to become bitter.

Chapter 3

A spear, and a cuirass (a piece of armor consisting of a breastplate and backplate fastened together), and a dagger, and a helmet, and greaves [whose parts] became separated, behold, they are pure. A coat of mail that became separated along its length is pure; along its width, if it can still serve its original function, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. And from what point does it become pure? From the time that it is worn out, and it can no longer be used for its [original] function. [If] it wore out but the upper half remains [in serviceable condition], it is impure, [but if only] the lower half remains [in serviceable condition], it is pure. [If] he cut off a piece of it and fashioned it into a link (or ring) for a piece of jewelry, it is impure. 
A scissor that comes apart, behold, this [half] is impure on its own, and that [half] is impure on its own. And once he joins them, it is [considered] joined for purposes of impurity but it is not [considered] joined for purposes of sprinkling. A pair of scissors that became separated into two, Rabbi Yehuda renders it impure because he trims the trees with it <i>ab initio</i>, and now he [still] trims the trees with it. And the Sages render it pure.
A stylus whose writing point was removed is impure on account of its eraser (Kel. 13:2). [If] the eraser was removed it is impure on account of the writing point. [If] it was separated into two, and there remained a sufficient amount of the stylus [to be gripped] by the joints of his fingers, or of the eraser [to be gripped] in the flat of his hand, it is impure. Less than that, it is pure.
A painting staff [for applying eye makeup] whose pointed side was removed (cf. Kel. 13:2 ("whose <i>spoon</i> was removed")), even if its receptacle was full of rust, it is impure. [If] he removed its receptacle, if its pointed side was full of rust, it is pure, because it would scratch the eye.
A large soup ladle<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>זומא לסטרון</b> (see GR"A and Tos. Shabbat 14:1); such a ladle has a spoon on one end and a fork on the other</i> whose spoon was removed is impure on account of the fork; [if] the fork was removed, it is impure on account of the spoon. [If] it was separated into two, if it is still capable of performing its original function, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. A baker's shovel whose flat portion was removed is impure on account of the hook [on the other end]; [if] the hook was removed, it is impure on account of the flat portion. [If] it was separated into two,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the printed text at this point is corrupt; the translation from "if it is" until "A plough handle" follows the GR"A's emendations</i> if it is still capable of performing its original function, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. A plough handle that was separated in two: If there remained at least seven handbreadths on the blade, and at least four handbreadths on the goad, it is impure. Less than that, it is pure. And if <i>ab initio</i> they fashioned it in that way, it is impure [with] even less than that. And regarding a hatchet, even though they removed its steel-edge, it is impure.
A strigil whose mouth was removed, and there remained on its face at least the width of a handspan, the whole thing is impure. [If] they removed all of it: Said Rabbi Natan ben Yosef, in respect to this, Beit Shammai render it impure, and Beit Hillel render it pure. The knife of trimming shears is impure on its own. Once it is joined to it, it is [considered] joined for impurity, but it is not [considered] joined for sprinkling. A fuller's needle whose point was removed is impure on account of the eye; [if] its eye is removed, it is impure on account of its point. [If] it was separated into two, if it is still capable of performing its original function, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. The sword and the knife that became rusted are pure. [If] he polished them and sharpened them, they revert back to their former state of impurity. The tube of glassmakers or goldsmiths or blacksmiths or glaziers, which split in two along its length is pure; along its width, if it can [continue] to perform its original purpose, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. The tongs of barbers or doctors or those who make glass vessels that split in two are pure, and [the tongs] of blacksmiths that broke in two are impure, because from the start he stirred the coals with them, and now he [still] stirs the coals with them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, because from the start he <i>cleaned</i> the coals (i.e., removed the soot) with them, and now he [still] cleans the coals with them. A nail clipper is impure. [If] it was split in two, it is pure. A siphon<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., which has two mouths, one in the middle and one on top (Mitzpat Shmuel)</i> is impure. [If] it was split in two, it is pure. The nails and the pieces that are attached to [the siphon] are [considered] joined for impurity and for sprinkling.
A funnel which is broken into or the pipe of which is off<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Jastrow (<b>מטריד</b>)</i> is pure. [If] it was separated into two, and there remained at least a handbreadth, it is impure.
A metal ring and its coral-wood seal: Rabbi Nehemiah renders it pure, for Rabbi Nehemiah would say, regarding a ring, they follow after the [purity status of the] seal; regarding a yoke and the carved ends of a yoke (סִמְלוֹן), they follow after [the purity status of] the majority; regarding a ladder and a grappler, after [the purity status of] the connectors; [and] regarding [wooden] scales, after [the purity status of] the nails. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yosei, regarding a ladder, after the rungs; and regarding a grappler, after the connectors; and regarding a funnel, after the bowl. A fuller's fork, and a pronged pole, and a ploughshare, and a cattle-bag (i.e., for collecting dung), one of whose teeth was broken off and replaced by one of metal, behold, they are impure. And about all of these, Rabbi Yehoshua said, the scribes have introduced a new legal principle, and I have no explanation to offer.
A flax comb that had every other one of its teeth removed is pure. [If] one tooth was removed from it, it is pure (Kel. 13:8). Rabbi Shimon renders it impure because he can write with it. And if he [intentionally] modified it to be able to write with it, all agree that it is impure. And a wool [comb] that became separated, whether on its length or its width, it is impure. A gold tooth is susceptible to impurity, and they sprinkle on its account in its place, and they go out with it on the Sabbath. 

Chapter 4

Oversized metal vessels, such as oversized chests, arks, and cupboards, are impure (i.e., susceptible to impurity). [Those] such as as a table<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "<i>Flat metal vessels</i>, such as a table, etc." (GR"A; see Kel. 11:1)</i>, or a slab, or a <i>delphica</i> (a three-legged table) of metal, are impure, and their minimum size [for purposes of impurity] is a handbreadth. They stated a general rule: A metal vessel which lacks the trimming [of its rough edges] is impure, and one that lacks polishing is pure, the words of Rabbi Akiva (Kel. 14:1), and the Sages say, [as to] metal vessels that became defective, if from the start they can be used for the general nature of their [intended] work<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מעין מלאכתן</b> (see Shab. 17:5); the Sages' view is reflected in the Mishnah not as a counterpart to Rabbi Akiva, but as a separate halacha</i>, they are impure, and if not, they are pure. How so? A bucket: if it is capable of being filled [with water] to drink from it. A kettle: if it is capable of being heated to drink from it. And a cauldron: if it is capable of serving guests with it. A washbasin: if it is capable of putting one foot inside it. [If] they punctured a small kettle, [it is impure if it the hole is] large enough to have hot water poured into it. [If they punctured a regular-sized] kettle, large enough to receive selas. A cauldron: Large enough to receive ladles. Ladles: Large enough to receive perutahs inside them. The measure of [containers of] wine and oil: Their size [for purposes of impurity] is that of liquids, and Rabbi Eliezer says, of perutahs. A candle: Its size [for purposes of impurity] is that of liquids, and Rabbi Eliezer says, of perutahs.
A [wooden] staff to which one attached a nail at the top (lit., "head") for the sake of taking hold of the threshing floor is pure, but if it is so that the ground will not wear away [the staff], it is impure. [If] he attached [a nail] to the top for the sake of striking with it, it is impure. For ornamentation, it is pure. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, [if] it had one row (דור) [of nails], it is impure, and two rows, it is pure.  A whip to which one attached a nail at the top for the sake of striking with it is impure. For ornamentation, it is pure.
[A metal] comb to which a sting is attached, behold, it is [considered] defiled with corpse-impurity. The carpenter’s tongs with which he pulls nails <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>המסמרים</b> not <b>המספרים</b> ("scissors") (see GR"A)</i> is impure.  A cup which one put under a door [as a pivot]: Even though it is used with it, it is clean. [If] it became impure and he placed it under the door, it [remains] impure until it is purified. And when is its purification? Beit Shammai say, once it becomes damaged, and Beit Hillel say, once it becomes attached, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, Beit Shammai say, once it becomes damaged and attached, and Beit Hillel say, once it becomes damaged <i>or</i> attached.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah (Kel. 14:2) reflects the view of Rebbi Meir.</i> Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says, a builder's auger is clean (MS Vienna), for it is only made to be used with the ground. Every tool of a stone-cutter is impure, and the ploughshare is among them. Rabbi Yehuda says, <i>except</i> for the ploughshare. A metal amah [measure] and a leveling rod are impure, and the <i>metzophin</i> (tubes for measuring distances) are pure. A halter is impure because it is like a bridle. Three things on a horse [are impure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>טמאין</b> (see MS Vienna, Ohr HaGanuz)</i>]: The reins, the bit, and the bridle. The bridle of a horse is impure by itself. [If] a cord or a strap are sewn with it, they are [considered] attached; and knotted, they are not [consided] attached. A teethed strigil and the links of trap<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מצודה</b> (see MS Vienna, Ohr HaGanuz)</i>, and everything similar on account of being ringed (משום מטבע) [?], behold, they are impure. A teethed strigil that was made inside a house, if it is for sharpening (לחוד), it is impure, and if it is for decoration, it is pure. And if it is in order that a cup or a plate be placed on it, it is impure, because it is [considered to be] like a three-legged table. A lamp-chain is [considered] joined with the comb (see Jastrow (מסרק)). [But] there is no comb that is joined with a ring. The chain of a large bucket must be four handbreadths [to contract impurity], and of a small [bucket], and of those who go up during the pilgrimage festivals, ten [handbreadths]. [If] a rope or a cord was tied to it, whether from above or from below, even one hundred amahs, everything is [considered] attached.
A saw whose teeth were placed into the slit of a lintel: Even though he makes use of it, it is pure. [If] it was impure and [a tooth] was placed into the hole of a door, it is impure until he affixes it with a nail. [If] he turned it over, whether from above, from below, or from the sides, it is pure. The lid of a round metal pot (<i>kabia</i>) or a kettle, the cover of a traveling box or an inkpot, are [all] impure, and all other types of covers are pure.
Rings fashioned to receive straps -- behold, they are pure, for they are only made for decorative purposes. [But if] they were made to weigh down the straps, or so that the straps are suspended from them, they are impure. An iron [ring] that is under the neck of an animal, or on top of the neck of an animal<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">to prevent it from being choked by the rope (see Rambam to Kel. 14:4)</i>. § A nail with which one connects a wheel so that it does not slip is impure, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel renders it pure. In this regard, Rabbi Yehuda agrees with the Sages: With regard to metal traveling box that one made into a mirror, and it broke and its utility ceased, it is pure (alt., "impure" (GR"A)). And the Sages say, either way, it is impure. A mirror that is broken: If it can still be used for its initial purpose, it is impure, [and] if not, it is pure. [If] it was scratched: If it still reflects the majority of one's face, it is impure, and if not, it is pure.
Rabbi Eliezer says, a metal vessel that became impure and [then] was broken and melted down: He sprinkles [the waters of purification] upon it that same day and [sprinkles] a second time on the fourth day. And [a metal vessel] that became impure and he sprinkled upon it and it [then] broke and he melted it down, [he sprinkles] a second time upon it that same day. Rabbi Yehoshua says, one may not sprinkle any less than on the third and the seventh day. Rabbi Natan says, Rabbi Eliezer says, a metal vessel that became impure and was broken and melted down, and he sprinkled upon it, and it was broken and melted down and [he sprinkled] a second time upon it that same day [is pure], [and] Rabbi Yehoshua says, one may not sprinkle any less than on the third and the seventh day.
A knee-shaped (jointed) key that was broken inside its joint: Rabbi Meir renders it impure and Rabbi Yehuda renders it pure, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, their words should be switched (and see Kel. 14:8, switching them). A mustard-strainer that became separated along its length is pure. Along its width: If it is [still] useful for its original purpose, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. Said Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about a mustard strainer as to which three bottom holes broke, one next to the other (i.e., forming one large hole), that it is pure. About what did they disagree? About two: That Beit Shammai renders it impure and Beit Hillel renders it pure. A jug whose mouth one intends to reforge and make it like a tube is only impure once he reforges the mouth. 

Chapter 5

Vessels of dung and vessels of stone and oversized vessels of clay: Rabbi Meir says, behold, they are [treated] like [other vessels], but the Sages say, behold, they are [treated] like tents. Rabbi Nehemiah says, large baskets and large <i>sugin</i> (another type of basket) that have  rims and can hold 40 seahs of liquid, which are two kors of dry -- [behold, they are not impure, for] even though they are not moved [when they are full, they are moved when] there are remainders in them.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: the bracketed language follows the GR"A, as the Tosefta is defective at this point.</i> And how large are they? One cubit by one cubit by the height of three cubits, resulting in six hundred forty-eight handbreadths. The proof of the matter is [derived] from the dimensions of the Table (i.e., on which the showbread was placed). [On the topic of dimensions,] Rabbi Yosei says, regarding the "sea" that Solomon made, it says (2 Chron. 4:5, Koren tr.), "it held and contained three thousand <i>batim</i>." In another place it says (1 Kings 7:26), "it contained two thousand <i>batim</i>." It is impossible to say "two thousand" when it has already said "three thousand." And it is impossible to say "three thousand" when it has already said "two thousand." [Rather,] it was said, from now on, two thousand in wet is [equivalent to] three thousand in dry. § The tables that are [set next to] the dining couches [which] the homeowners eat upon -- even though they are as smooth as fingernails, they may contract impurity because they are like a slab, and it so happened with one homeowner who kept boards<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נצרים</b>, cf. Kel. 8:1 (<b>נְסָרִים</b>)</i> inside [his house], and they would ask him to send them to funeral meals and wedding feasts, and the matter came before the Sages, and they held them to be impure.
For what reason are bakers' baking-boards<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ארובות</b> not <b>ארונות</b> (see Ohr HaGanuz and Kel. 15:2)</i> impure? Because they are specialized vessels. Those of homeowners are pure unless they are made into specialized vessels<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עד שיחדום לכלי</b> (Zar Zahav and Minchat Bikkurim)</i>. Rabbi Shimon says, for what reason are bakers' frames (סרוד) for loaves of bread impure? Because he cuts [the dough] on it and he casts [dough] from the cuttings into the oven. And those of homeowners, if they modified them them so that they could cut [dough] upon it and cast [the dough] from the cuttings into the oven, they would be impure.
A frame with a rim [of plaited ropes]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Jastrow (<b>צפירה</b>)</i>: If it has handles, it is pure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "If it has handles, it is impure, and if it lacks handles, it is pure" (MS Vienna, GR"A)</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, even if it lacks handles, it is impure. And the sieve (נפה [see GR"A, Kel. 15:3]) of flour-dealers is impure because he turns it back into a vessel, and that of homeowners is pure unless he turns it back into a vessel. Rabbi Yehuda says, [the sieve] of a hairdresser possesses seat-impurity because it is still a vessel, [because] the girls sit inside it while their hair is dressed.
All perforated hangers combine [for purposes of impurity], and Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, even the split (between the perforations) are added upon them. The hangers of the <i>zini</i> and the <i>saftani</i>, because they provide assistance during work, the receptacle for flasks and the receptacle for cups of the tailor, are [all] impure. [If] they were bound and tied, they are pure. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, all hangers are impure, [and] they only rendered pure the hangers of the sifter and sieve of a homeowner (see Kel. 15:4), and only when they possess two "heads" on one side. All hoops are pure, [but] the hoop of the plough is impure. All cuts [of fish] are susceptible to impurity, but a cut of the Iltith fish is pure.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Per GR"A, other fish remain wet at the moment of death and thus are rendered impure by the seawater on them; the Iltith fish, however, is a fish that survives long enough out of water to no longer be susceptible  to impurity.</i>
All carcasses are pure, and the carcasses of a <i>sheretz</i> (נבלי שרץ) are impure.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, "All <i>harps</i> [in the Temple] are pure, but <i>harps for [secular] music</i> (<b>נבלי השירה</b>) are impure (see GR"A, Kel. 15:6)." Per Zar Zahav, most instruments have a receptacle for receiving tips, rendering them susceptible to impurity, but the instruments in the Temple lacked such receptacles. Mishnat Eretz Yisrael, however, prefers the version as printed in the Tosefta, and attested in MS Vienna.</i>
All liquids are impure, but the liquids of the [Temple] slaughterhouse are pure, and these are the liquids of the slaughterhouse: Blood and water. [If] they were defiled within, even though they were brought outside, they [remain] pure. [If] they were defiled outside and brought inside, they [remain] impure.
A scroll of the Azarah (Temple Courtyard)<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., <b>ספר עזרא</b> "the Torah Scroll of Ezra" (MS Vienna; see M.K. 3:4)</i> that was taken outside [of the Temple] defiles the hands, and not only of a scroll of the Azarah did they speak; rather, even [scrolls of] the prophets and [individual scrolls of the] Pentateuch. But another scroll that is brought into there (i.e., the Temple) defiles the hands. Coverings<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per the GR"A, the coverings (<b>מטפחות</b>) and the rectangular frames (<b>מלבני</b>) (see next) of the Levites were used for protecting/storing Temple instruments when not in use</i> of the Levites are pure; similarly, [as to] a homeowner who made coverings to drape over walls or pillars, [the coverings] are pure. Rectangular frames of the Levites are pure; similarly, [as to] a homeowner who fashioned a rectangular frame to be placed from bed to bed, or from crib to crib, [the frames] are pure. [If] he connected it to [only] one bed, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda render it impure, [while] Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon render it pure, for work is not performed on it for its own sake (rather, it serves the primary vessel, the bed).
Rabbi Yehuda says, the <i>markof</i> (a stationary musical instrument) of a musician is pure, for it is only made to be used [while connected] with the ground. [If] a nail was placed on its head for the sake of taking hold of the threshing floor, it is pure, and Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says, a mousetrap that has a receptacle is impure. A deep bowl, and a platter, and an <i>anfola</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אונפולה</b> (<b>אַמְפְּלַי</b>) ("a merchant’s money-chest into which receipts are dropped through a slit") (Jastrow); alt, <b>האנטיל</b> (a vessel used for washing hands) (GR"A, Zar Zahav)</i>, and a tray, which were divided up, even though they can still hold [liquids] on their sides like an <i>ilphis</i> (a tightly covered pot), they are pure. A bed, and a chair, and a stool, and a chair with a curved back (<i>k'tidra</i>), and a kneading-trough that broke apart -- they are pure. A bed that broke apart -- each and every "limb" is impure on its own. The Sages agree with Rabbi Meir that the ropes [used to connect the sides] are not connected to the bed until three rows [of ropes] are plaited onto [the bed] in each direction.
A kneading-trough: From when is it susceptible to impurity? From the time that its manufacture is completed, and if in the future [one plans] to convert it into a wagon, it is pure. A flask-holder and a cup-holder of palm-fronds, once their rims are rounded off and rough ends are smoothed out<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שחיסם וקינב</b> (Kel. 16:2, Kulp tr.)</i> from the outside; for even if their rims are not rounded off and their rough ends are not smoothed out from the inside, they are susceptible to impurity because they may remain in that state [and be used]. Small reed baskets and [regular] baskets [are susceptible] once their rims are rounded off and their rough ends smoothed off.  Large reed baskets and large partitioned baskets (סּוּגִין) [are susceptible] once two rows have been fashioned around their girth, aside from that which is is on the woven part. The <i>arak</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ערק</b> ("a long and flat vessel made of rush") (Jastrow); alt., "a sieve" (Rambam)</i> [is susceptible] once he has woven one round [rim] around it, apart from the rims on the woven part.  A camel's saddle-baskets that were loosened are pure; tied, they are impure, and they may be rendered pure and impure even ten times a day. Wickerwork baskets (Kel. 16:5) that have not been trimmed<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., by pinching off the projecting pricks (see Jastrow, <b>קנב</b>)</i>, and which he uses temporarily, are impure. [If] he intended to make a rim and trim them, even though he uses them temporarily and discards them [after use], they are pure, as long as he does not employ artifice. And if employed artifice, behold, they are impure.
Papyrus vessels are more stringent than vessels made of branches, for [vessels of branches] only become susceptible to impurity once their manufacture is completed, but [as to] papyrus vessels, as soon as one hole is made on top of their wider side, they are impure.

Chapter 6

Leather vessels: From what point are they susceptible to impurity (Kel. 16:4)? A sandal, once the straps are attached. A shoe, once it is placed on the [shoemaker's] mold, and if he intends to varnish it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>לכרכב</b> (Jastrow); alt., <b>לכרכם</b> ("dye it yellow") (Mishneh Torah, Vessels 7:1)</i>, [it is not susceptible] until he varnishes it; and if he intends to make designs [on it], [it is not susceptible] until he makes designs. A leather coat, before it is scalloped. A leather hide [used as a bedspread], before it is moistened<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ישרטב</b> (Zar Zahav)</i>. The leather [cover] of a crib that he intends to make into an infant's naval string (<i>tibur</i>), it is pure until he makes it into an infant's naval string. Rabbi Yehuda says a leather cushion [becomes susceptible if] not less than five [handbreadths remain open],  and a leather mattress [becomes susceptible if] not less than three [handbreadths remain open] (contra. Kel. 16:4 (five each)).<br>Bone vessels: From what point are they susceptible to impurity? From the time that their manufacture is completed. [If] they lack their outer covering, they are impure. A shofar is pure, [but] if he cut a horn into pieces [to use as a vessel], it is impure. A horn that he uses and then discards it is pure, [but if] he thinks about [using it as a vessel], it is susceptible to impurity from that point onward.  A mat for dates that he intends to throw away once the dates are eaten is pure, [but if] he thinks about carrying it in and out of his house, or [in and out] of his field, it is impure.
All vessels that are woven with a needle, such as a pouch or a felt shoe, are not susceptible to impurity until their manufacture is completed. Rabbi Yehuda says, as to a pouch, [it is not susceptible] until it can hold a perutah (a small coin), and [as to] a felt shoe, until it can hold a wood chip. All vessels that are woven on top of a needle, such as a <i>gargutni</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>גרגותני</b> ("a wicker net used in a wine or oil press" (Jastrow))</i>, or a snare, as soon as he made a receptacle in them [sufficient for them to perform] their function, they are impure. Baskets double-bags [to be loaded on] camels, and <i>pipyarot</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>פיפיארת</b> (<b>אַפִּיפְיָירוֹת</b>) ("[papyrus] frames for hangings to which reeds were fastened from the bottom upward (crosswise) for support" (Jastrow))</i> into which they fashioned receptacles for pomegranates -- they are impure. Rabbi Shimon says, <i>pipyarot</i> that cannot be lifted up by the walls [that were fixed onto them], and to be taken out of the door, are pure (see Kel. 17:3). A new [leather] flask [that is not completely sewn up]: Even though it can hold pomegranates, it is pure. [If] he sewed it and it tore, the measurement [of the hole for purposes of impurity] is the size of a pomegranate. Rabbi Eliezer<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov (Hul. 138a:2)</i> says, the measurement is [the equivalent] of a ball of warp, each being one-quarter of a maneh of forty sela. A wringer on hinges, behold, it is impure because he places [another one] on top of it before the first one is finished. [If it] broke apart, the lower one is impure and the upper one is pure, and its measure [for purposes of impurity] is a handbreadth.
Rabbi Yehuda says, among these are three categories [of vessels], in the name of Rabbi Akiva: Those which were made to [exclusively] serve man, such as a ladder, [and those made to exclusively serve other] vessels, such as a <i>kolav</i> (a shopkeeper's rack to display merchandise), a candelabra, and an <i>anchuta</i> (a wooden board), are pure. Those made to service [both] man and [other] service-vessels of man, such as a table, a plank, and a <i>delphica</i> (a three-legged service table), are impure.<br>A wooden basket for flasks or for cups (Kel. 16:2)<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">such a basket is comprised of a single row of receptacles, each one joined to the next, similar to the "double inkpot" of Kel. 2:7 (Zar Zahav)</i>, where one of [the receptacles] broke off: [The broken section] is pure and is not [considered] joined to [the basket]. [If] the second broke off, it is pure and is not [considered] joined to it. [If] all three broke off, all are pure. Four baskets [in a square configuration] that are in a bath, where one of them broke: [The broken basket] is pure and is not [considered] joined to [the other three]. [If] the second broke, it is pure, and is not [considered] joined<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ואין חבור</b> (MS Vienna)</i> to it. [If] two broke from one side, the [adjoining] wall that is between them is divided: That which services the impure is impure, and that which services the pure is pure. [If] two diagonal [baskets] broke off, the entire [adjoining] wall that is between them is impure.<br>[If] the center of a wicker crate used to spread fertilizer is upraised and its sides are lower, it is still susceptible to impurity if one side is broken, because it can still contain fertilizer from the other side, [but] if the other side is broken, it is clean.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Mishneh Torah, Vessels 6:10</b> (Touger tr.)</i> And as to all other vessels [whose apertures] are not large enough to receive olives, such as a reed tube and a reed basket, the measure [of their holes for impurity] is the majority of them (i.e., of their width), the words of Rabbi Meir (Kel. 17:4). Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says, with respect to spice-boxes that burst open, their measure is that of the spices [that they carry]. [If] they split apart, their measure is their full width. Said Rabbi Yehuda<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">cf. Kel. 17:5 (attributing the following statement to Rabbi Yosei)</i>, they only mentioned pomegranates of Badaan and leeks of Geba of Beit HaKutim in order that they tithe them as certain everywhere.
Rabbi Yehuda says, [in order to determine which is the intermediate size], he brings the largest of the large, and the smallest<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>וקטנה</b> not <b>או קטנה</b> ("<i>or</i> the smallest) (GR"A; see Kel. 17:6)</i> of the small, and brings a cup filled with water, and he brings foods that are not absorbent, and he places them inside [the cup], until the water returns to the way it was, and then he replaces it, and splits [the difference between the volume of water dislodged in each of] them. Rabbi Yosei said, even you are giving a [subjective] measure to the measurements, and who will let me know which one is "big" and which one is "small"? Rather, everything goes according to the one who sees it. § As to a reed, [the measurement for impurity is according to] the medium-sized one. As to a baker's shovel, the one with medium thickness. A plough handle: That with a thickness of two fingerbreadths and the circumference of a handbreadth. A fingerbreadth is one of the four fingerbreadths in a handbreadth. A handbreadth is one of the six handbreadths in a cubit. The handspan (<i>zaret</i>) spoken of in the Torah (1 Sam. 17:4) is half a cubit of six handbreadths. The "middle cubit": That is a cubit of five handbreadths.
Rabbi Meir says, all measurements that the Sages stated about a vineyard (see Kilayim 7:3), such as an empty patch in a vineyard, and the space between the vineyard and the fence, and the gaps in an <i>aris</i>, and the papyrus-ropes [of a trellis], all of them are [measured] with cubits of six handbreadths,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the translation "six handbreadths" follows the GR"A; the printed text, "five handbreadths," is inconsistent with the discussion that follows</i> except for the golden Altar, and the horns [of the Altar], and the surrounding [area], and the foundation, which are [measured] with a cubit of five handbreadths, as it is said (Ez. 43:13, JPS tr.), "And these are the dimensions of the Altar, in cubits where each is a cubit and a handbreadth]" -- that there were two measurements for the Altar. But perhaps all of them were [measured] with a cubit of five handbreadths? Thus the verse states, "With a cubits, each cubit [being] a cubit and a handbreadth," [meaning] with a cubit that is larger than its counterpart by a handbreadth.

Chapter 7

The "ladleful of corpse-mold" that they spoke of (see <i>Oholot</i> 2:2): [It defiles if] it is [the equivalent of the area] from the joints<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מקשרי</b> (GR"A)</i> of his fingers and upwards, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, a fistful (Lev. 16:12). A "clod of earth from an area of a doubtful grave" and "a clod of earth from the land of the Gentiles" (Toh. 5:1): Their measure is the size of a large stopper [used] by sack makers, which is the equivalent [size of] the seal of packing bags. And this [size] is [also found] on the upper side of the seal of a Bethlehem jug. Rabbi Tarfon says, the dust of a doubtful grave area [imparts corpse-impurity] if it is of sufficient size to cover up a bone the size of a barleycorn. The "fist" that they spoke of (<i>Oholot</i> 13:1): Rabbi Tarfon straightens out the tips of his fingers and shows [the measurement to his students]. Rabbi Akiva closes up the tips of his fingers and shows it. Rabbi Yehuda rests his fingers on top of the biggest one (i.e., the thumb), folded, [and] he goes back and measures<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מודד</b> not <b>מוריד</b> ("brings it down") (GR"A)</i>. Rabbi Yosei says, it is the size of the head of a big sheep from Tzippori. Others said in his name, "a handbreadth and a third of a handbreadth." And so they went on measuring before Ben Batiach came along (Kel. 17:12). § The measures of wine and and oil: Their minimum size is like a large stopper for them (i.e., their containers). And what is "a large stopper for them"? One that enters through their mouths (i.e., of the containers). When do these words apply? From below, but from the side, behold, they are impure because they receive from the drainage point downward. § [Regarding leather vessels,] in their initial state, they are not susceptible to impurity until one has blown it up and scraped it (i.e., polished the leather surface). [If] they were scraped, their minimum size [for impurity] is the same as their [actual] size. Rabbi Shimon says, the measure of their minimum size is that of liquids.
One who fashions vessels from that which grows in the sea, [the vessels] are impure (alt., "pure" (GR"A)). [If] he joined to them that which grows on the land, in the same way that they are joined together [are they judged] for impurity, even vessels of cattle dung, vessels of stone, and vessels of clay. An object whose vessel is susceptible to impurity is impure, and an object whose vessel is not susceptible to impurity is pure. Rabbi Yehuda says, vessels<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כלים</b>; alt., <b>כלי ים</b> ("vessels of the sea") (MS Vienna)</i> that are fit to contract impurity and he purified them: If some deceptiveness<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>עילא</b> (MS Vienna), see Kel. 17:16</i> is found in them [thereafter], they will revert to impurity. One who fashions vessels from bones of birds, they are pure. [If] he joined to them that which grows on the land -- even a thread, and even a cord -- a thing that is susceptible to impurity, it is impure. § Said Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, for what reason is the wing of a black eagle  (or "vulture") different from all other wings (Kel. 17:14)? In order to be stringent. Rather, let all the wings that serve as receptacles be impure, and let those that do not serve as receptacles be pure! A plated chicken-egg is pure since it can only stand [upright with the plating]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">whereas an ostrich-egg, which is deemed impure, stands upright either with or without the plating (see Bartenura to Kel. 17:14)</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, even a plated chicken-egg that can hold even the smallest amount [of liquids] is impure, and they only mentioned the "wing of a black eagle" and the "egg of an ostrich" since these are the usual cases.
One who fashions vessels from an object that he stands upright -- it is impure; from an object that is not of [something that] stands upright -- it is pure. A turnip and an etrog and a dry gourd that little children hollowed out to measure dust with them, or which they converted into a scale -- they are pure. A pomegranate and an acorn and a walnut that little children hollowed out, or which they converted into a scale -- they are impure. § The mortar of a charcoal burner that has a receptacle for lead is pure [if the receptacle is used] in its normal manner; [but] from above, it is impure. A tube that was cut open and a mezuzah placed inside, and afterwards he placed it on the wall, even if it was not done in the normal manner of its receptacle<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the "normal manner" would be for the open part to face upward, and the mezuzah inserted from above (see <b>Mishneh Torah, Vessels 2:6</b></i>, it is pure. [If first] he placed it on the wall, and afterwards inserted a mezuzah in it, [even if it was done] in the normal manner of its receptacle, it is impure. If he affixed it to the wall, even in the normal manner of its receptacle, it is pure.
The beam of a scale and a level that contain a receptacle<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">specifically, a <i>hidden</i> receptacle, and so too for each of the following cases (Zar Zahav)</i>  for metal; and a carrying-stick that contains a receptacle for coins; and a poor person's cane that contains a receptacle for water; and a stick that contains a receptacle for a mezuzah and for pearls: The whole [vessel] is only impure if it services the needs [of the receptacle]. And about all of these said Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, "Woe to me if I mention it, and woe to me if I don't mention it! If I mention it, [they will say that] now I am teaching the swindlers how to swindle. And if not, I am withholding [knowledge from] the students, and rendering impure that which is pure." Another version: "That the swindlers will not say that the Sages lack expertise in their activities."<br>For what reason did they say that "the base of the goldsmiths' anvil is impure" (Kel. 17:17)? Because he puts scrap-iron inside it. And a blacksmiths' [anvil], behold, it is pure, but if they modified it to put scrap-iron inside it, (all agree) it would be impure. A whetting board that contains a receptacle for oil, and a writing tablet that contains a receptacle for wax (ibid.): The whole [vessel] is only impure if it services the needs [of the receptacle]. A mat: From what point may it contract impurity? From the time that its edges are rounded off and its rough ends are smoothed out. Rabbi Yehuda says, from the time that its ends are tied into knots so that it does not appear disorderly. If they emerge from it, anything that [serves] the needs of the knots is impure, and anything that does not [serve] the needs of the knots is pure. A reed tube: From what point may it contract impurity? From the time that its edges are rounded off and its rough ends are smoothed out. Rabbi Yehuda says, from the time that he removes the pulp (lit., "the marrow") from within it. The horn [of an animal]: From what point may it contract impurity? From the time that its manufacture is completed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, from the time that he removes the marrow from within it. A pumpkin-shell [used to draw water]: From what point may it contract impurity? From the time that its manufacture is completed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, from the time that he removes the pulp (lit., "the guts") from within it. And any of them that are found cut into pieces or punctured are impure. [If] he found them in an unfinished state, they are pure, for it is known that they are not [considered] vessels.

Chapter 8

A chest whose compartments are on the inside: They are measured with it [to determine whether it holds forty seahs (Kel. 18:1)]; on the outside, they are not measured with it, but the cavity [of the chest] is measured. And Rabbi Yehuda says, the space inside (i.e., the total space, including the compartments) is measured.  Said Rabbi Shimon, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about the thickness of the legs or about the thickness of the rims, that they are not measured with it. About what did they disagree? About the area between them, for Beit Shammai say, they are not measured, and Beit Hillel say, they are measured. Its carriage is slipped off and measured.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The previous sentence is not contained in MS Vienna.</i> The railing attached to a spice-box and the cupolas thereon: Whenever they are attached, they are measured with it, and when they are unattached, they are not measured with it. The sides of small bed-chambers (<i>kitliskai</i>), behold, they are pure. The bed-frames of small bed-chambers, even though they are [disassembled and then] deposited and left in the four corners of the house, they are impure. The four legs that are on the four bed-frames and its other legs are pure. The bedstead-stand that is under the frame and the long boards that are under the legs are pure. <i>K'futim</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כפותים</b>, also <b>קבותים</b>, "pickle pots lined with pitch up to the rim (so that the lid does not touch the body off the vessel itself" (Jastrow)</i>that are under the legs, even though they are hollow and can act of receptacles, they are pure, and they are not [considered impure] on account of having receptacles. The [wooden] frame for a bed and a kneading-trough, a bed pole, and planks for a straw-mattress<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>סטיכס</b> (MS Vienna)</i>, and the legs of a table, and the handle of a knife: Whenever they are attached, they are [considered] joined together for purposes of impurity and sprinkling. [If the wooden attachment] was removed , and placed back again, they are not [any longer] considered joined together, either for impurity or for sprinkling. The frame of a kneading-trough that is capped and has legs is impure.  [If] it is tied with cords and has no legs, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda render it impure, [and] Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon render it pure, for no work can be performed with it by itself.
Originally they stated, "A bed that had two props at diagonal corners cut off, or two legs at diagonal corners, or which was cut down to be a handbreadth by a handbreadth in its diagonal corners, is pure" (see Kel. 18:5). Our Rabbis [now] say, one may cut it down from below, or raise it [from the floor], until it is reduced to being less than a handbreadth [from the ground]. A bed whose two props were made from planks on one side is impure. [If] all four were made from planks, or [if] two diagonal [props] were removed, it is pure. [If] the short side was removed and two legs [remain], it is impure, because the bed is still fit for sleeping, but if initially it was made that way, it is pure, because it is like a folding-stool (<i>adina</i>). The long side and two legs [removed]: Rabbi Nehemiah renders it impure because it can be placed on the side of the bed or on the side of a feeding-trough, and one can [still] sleep on it, and the Sages render it pure. A bed that had a part removed from it, and he placed it in the corner and replaced it [with a new part], and likewise with the second, and likewise with the third, and likewise with the fourth, and likewise with the fifth, and likewise, with the sixth, and likewise with the seventh, still imparts midras-impurity by touch, but if he replaced the eighth part, it is pure from midras. When do these words apply? When he started from the last , but if he started from the first, even if he did not exchange the eighth [part], it is pure. 
A bed contracts impurity when its parts are bound together, and is purified when its parts are bound together, the words of Rabbi Eliezer, and Sages say, it contracts impurity part-by-part and is purified part-by part (Kel. 18:9). How so? A leg that was removed along with the long side and with the short side, Rabbi Eliezer says, behold, it is joined, and if it is immersed, behold it interposes. And the Sages say, it is not joined, and if it is immersed, behold, it interposes, the words of Rabbi Shimon. And Rebbi says, Rabbi Eliezer says, a bed is only considered bound together when it is complete. Once the bed is divided into eight parts, it is impure, because one will return it [to its former state]. [If] the parts are attached together with nails, it is pure.

Chapter 9

A tailor's box is [considered to be] defiled with corpse-impurity. [If] one piece was separated from it, it is impure, but two pieces, it is pure. A cradle for girls, behold, is defiled with corpse-impurity. [If] it was used for sitting, behold, it is defiled with midras-impurity. [If] they sell vessels on it, behold, it is defiled with corpse-impurity. [If] it was used for sitting or for lying upon, behold, it possesses midras-impurity. A bed whose stuffing came out and had no ropes holding it together, but there [still] remained enough [stuffing] in it for sitting or lying down, behold, it possesses midras-impurity. [If] there were lumps of upholstery coming out of it, behold, they are impure because he puts them back inside. A rope that is hanging out from the bed (Kel. 19:1): Less than five handbreadths, it is pure. From five to ten, it is impure. From ten and above, it is pure. From ten down [and five up, it is impure (see GR"A)]. [If] he sprinkled on the rope within ten handbreadths, it is pure, and when he immerses the the bed he needs to immerse ten handbreadths of the rope and it is pure. And when he immerses the bed, he needs to immerse the rope ten handbreadths.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The  previous sentence, "And when ... ten handbreadths" is omitted in MS Vienna.</i> The leg [of the bed] that was defiled with midras-impurity, and it was [then] joined to the bed: The leg is pure, and so too with the <i>mizran</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מזרן</b> ("a strap of cloth wound over the bed to keep the covering in position") (Jastrow)</i>, and so too with the tooth of a mattock.     
The rope that straps together the bedstead: Even if it one hundred cubits, all of it is [considered] a single joined unit. [If] he tied another rope to it: From the knot and inward, it is joined, [and] from the knot and outward, it is not connected. [If] he brought it into three houses, even one hundred cubits, all of it is a single joined unit. A rope that is tied to earthenware, even one hundred cubits, all of it is a single joined unit. [If] he tied another rope to it: From the knot and inward, it is joined, [and] from the knot and outward, it is not connected. Said Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, in what case does this apply? Going up, but going down, even if it was tied with a knot, all of it is a single joined unit. The thread that they drew through the needle: Even if it was tied on both sides, behold, it is not [considered] joined [with the needle]. [If] it was brought (i.e., stitched) into the garment, the thread is [considered] joined with the garment and the needle is not [considered] joined with the thread. The bands and the straps that are in the wrappings<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שבמטפחות</b> (GR"A)</i> of a scroll, or that are in the swaddling of infants: [If] they are sewn in, they are [considered] joined, [and if] they are knotted, they are not [considered] joined. And those which are on the handles (lit., "ears") of earthenware vessels: Even if they are sewn in, they are not [considered] joined, for [the laws of] "joining" do not apply to earthenware vessels. The remnants [of material] (see Kel. 19:3) that are on the legs of a bed: [If] they are bound tightly, they are [considered] joined; loose, they are not [considered] joined. And those which are on the ears (alt., "in the hands" (GR"A)) of one with an unnatural flow: Even if they are bound tightly, they are not [considered] joined.
This is a stringency with midras over one with an unnatural flow: A <i>mizran</i> (see above) that wraps around a bed, and one brings it into a house with a corpse inside, even though there is only the smallest "tent" [over it], the bed is impure. Ropes that touch a corpse, and which were treaded upon by one with an unnatural flow, within ten handbreadths, he is impure and the bed is pure. A <i>mizran</i> that wraps around a bed, and a corpse touched them: They are defiled with seven-day impurity. [If] a sheretz touched them, they are defiled with evening-impurity. [If] they separate those that were defiled with evening-impurity, [and] unfit liquids touched them, those that were separated are unfit. This is the general rule: Every impurity as to which a bed and a <i>mizran</i> are the same, such as corpse-impurity, and an unnatural flow within ten handbreadths, they are [considered] joined for [purposes of] impurity. More than that, they are not joined. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Tzadok says in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, until seven handbreadths.

Chapter 10

A cupboard that is full of vessels and one affixed a covering to it is impure. [If] it was empty and one affixed a covering to it, it is pure. To what is this similar? To empty jugs, which are filled with wind, which is pure. A cupboard that possesses corpse-impurity and he affixed a treading-place to it is completely pure of all impurity, but it is susceptible to impurity from that point forward. A cupboard that is half-open and half-closed imparts midras-impurity and possesses corpse-impurity. [If] the top of it was cut off, it is is impure because the lower portion acts as a receptacle. [If] the bottom of it was cut off, Rabbi Meir renders it impure and the Sages render it pure, because once the primary purpose ceases, the secondary purpose ceases. A goatskin pouch that was cut open<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שנפחתה</b>; alt., <b>שנפתחה</b> ("that opened up") (MS Vienna)</i>, behold, it is impure, for from  the beginning it was used for sitting and for laying upon along with its function [of holding liquids], and now it is [still] used for sitting and for lying upon, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages render it pure<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מטהרים</b> (GR"A)</i> because once the primary purpose ceases, the secondary purpose ceases. The Sages agree with Rabbi Meir that regarding a leather bolster or cushion that was torn, that even though it can [no longer] hold that which was inside it (i.e., the stuffing), that it is impure, and needless to say, as to bolsters of fabric or sackcloth (GR"A), it is not that they are impure on account of having a receptacle; rather, on account on their fabric (Kel. 20:1). Rabbi Yosei says, the cupboard of the bath attendants that is higher than ten handbreadths and has a rim is impure, for from the beginning it was made for the purpose of ascending and sitting on top of it.
A cupboard from which they sell oil in a public bath possesses corpse-impurity and midras-impurity. [If] one brought a beam and affixed it from rim to rim in order to be able to sit on it, it is impure, but it only defiles one who uses it for that purpose. Four planks that are [affixed] on four rims: [If] their width was a handbreadth they are impure. The upper board upon which they pile up coins: Even if it has a pure rim, [if] they brought another plank and affixed it to the rim to be able to sit on it, it is impure, but it only defiles one who uses it for that purpose. A tailor's shelf: [If] it has sides, it is impure, [and if] it does not have sides, it is pure. [If] he brought a beam and affixed it from rim to rim to be able to sit on it, it possesses midras-impurity, but it only defiles one who uses it for that purpose. The tables of large cities that are eaten upon, even though they are affixed with a nail, they are impure. [If] he brought a chair and affixed it to [the table] from rim to rim to be able to sit on it, it is impure, but it only defiles one who uses it for that purpose. Chairs that are on a stand, behold, they are pure, for they were only made to be used with (i.e., when attached to) the ground. And the stocks [of prisoners]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בדדין</b> (Jastrow); alt., "the olive-pressers' [seats]" (Zar Zahav)</i> are pure, for they are nothing but seats of suffering.

Chapter 11

A kneading-trough that is less than two <i>logs</i>, behold, it is like plate, and its measure [for purposes of impurity] is in olives, and from two <i>logs</i> until nine kavs, even men and women with unnatural discharges, and menstruants, and women who have recently given birth may sit or lay on it and [the trough] is pure. [If] it was split and it cannot stand on its legs, and it only holds enough water to rinse one of a person's feet, behold, it is treated as possessing corpse-impurity, and it is susceptible to midras-impurity, the words of Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda. Rebbi says, once he reconsiders. Rabbi Yosei says, it may become impure and pure even ten times in a day. How so? [If] it was raining, and it swelled up, it is pure. [If] there was strong east wind (בקדים), [and it split], it is impure, and it may be purified [again] even [ten] times in a day. [If] it swelled up to the size of olives, it is purified from all impurity. [If] he reconsidered, Rebbi renders it impure and the Sages say, before he did work with it; more than that, if it splits, even men and women with unnatural discharges, and menstruants, and women who have recently given birth may sit or lay on it and it is pure. [If] it swelled up large enough that pomegranates could fall through it, it is pure from all impurity. [If] he reconsidered it, Rabbi Akiva renders it impure and the Sages render it pure until he cuts off [the defective portion]. Said Rabbi Yosei, it so happened that they brought from K'far Aris more than sixty kneading troughs before Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, and he would measure those that were larger than a seah as being a seah (i.e., in terms of purity), and the smallest ones as being two <i>logs</i>. And close are their words regarding the seah, [since] a seah<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the large troughs that held more than a seah, but which Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel issued a blanket determination that their purity status be determined as though they held a seah</i> has the presumptive status of nine kavs (which is one and a half seahs).
The trough of mortar-masons that are between two <i>logs</i> and nine kavs, Beit Shammai say, it possesses midras[-impurity], and Beit Hillel say, it possesses corpse-impurity. And a jar, Beit Shammai say, [it is impure if] it is filled and it can stand up [on its own], and Beit Hillel says, [if] it is filled and bound<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "[if] it is filled and <i>stands up</i> and is bound" (GR"A)</i>. Rabbi Yosei b'Rabbi Yehuda says, reverse their statements. The handle of an axe is joined [to the axe] for purposes of impurity, whether or not it is being used, and if it was not fully attached, behold, it is not [considered] joined. A staff that was placed in an axe (i.e., to serve as a handle) to chop with it for a short time, whenever it is in use it is [considered] joined, [but] when it is not in use, it is not [considered] joined. 
The long side of a bed that was made into roof-beams is impure, and the bed is impure. [If] he affixed it, it is pure and the bed is impure. Two long sides of a bed that were made into roof-beams: They are impure and the bed is impure. [If] he affixed them, they are pure and the bed is pure. A [poor-man's] bark mat (<i>mapetz</i>) that was made into roof-beams is impure unless it is affixed with a nail. When do these words apply? From below, but from above, they are [considered] attached. [If] he attached it but did not apply roof-plastering to it, [or] if he applied roof-plastering to it but did not attach it, it is impure. [If] he attached it and applied roof-plastering to it, it is pure. From what point is its purity? Beit Shammai say, from the time it is made into a bundle, and Beit Hillel say, from the time it is joined together, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, [Beit Shammai say,] from the time that it is made into a bundle and joined together, and Beit Hillel say, from the time it is either made into a bundle or joined together.
A sheet that is defiled with corpse-impurity and converted into a curtain, behold, it is treated as possessing corpse-impurity, but it is not susceptible to midras-impurity, the words of Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda. And Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon says, it is completely pure from all impurities, but it is susceptible to impurity from that point forward. And from what point is it pure? From the time that it is has deteriorated and is no longer used for its purpose. [If] it has deteriorated, but the majority of the upper part remains, it is impure; [if] the majority of the lower part remains, it is pure. And if it was large and he shortened it by trimming, it is susceptible to impurity from that point forward. A sheet that is defiled with corpse-impurity and converted into the sail of a ship, behold, it is treated as possessing corpse-impurity, but it is not susceptible to midras-impurity, the words for Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda. And Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon says, it is completely pure from all impurities, but it is susceptible to impurity from that point forward. And from what point is it pure? From the time that it is has deteriorated and is no longer used for its purpose. [If] it has deteriorated, but the majority of the upper part remains, it is impure; [if] the majority of the lower part remains, it is pure.  And if it was large and he shortened it by trimming, and converted into the sail of a small ship, it is susceptible to impurity from that point forward.
Sheets and woolen blankets that were placed on the ground in order to be walked on: [If] it was attached with a nail, it is impure. [If] they were converted to be coverings for door-frames, or pillars, or walls, or windows, they are defiled with tent-impurity, and if it was a mat, behold, it is pure. There is nothing that comes from wood that is defiled with tent-impurity, except for flax. A mat that was being made for tents, and he changed his mind to use it for lying down, is pure. [If] it was being made for lying down, and he changed his mind to use it for tenting: Before he tied the [knots at] the ends of the rows of matting, it is pure; once he tied the ends of the rows, it is impure, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, it may become defiled and purified [in this manner] even ten times in a day. How so? He unties it [and it becomes pure], [then] he ties it, and it becomes impure, even ten times in a day. [If] he separated it along its length, it is pure; along its width, and there remain three rows [of matting] that are six handbreadths, [and there are two handbreadths (see MS Vienna)] between one row and another row, one handbreadth on this side and one handbreadth on that side, it is pure. And if from the start he made it for that purpose (i.e., for a tent), even less than that, it is impure. Rabbi Natan says, the measure for a mat [to be susceptible to tent-impurity] is seven handbreadths, the measure of a [poor-man's] bark mat is six handbreadths.
