Tosefta Mikvaot



Chapter 1








Said Rabbi Shimon, it so happened with a certain  the water-reservoir of Discus in Yavneh, that it was measured and found to be lacking, and Rabbi Tarfon had rendered it pure, while Rabbi Akiva had rendered it impure.  [Rabbi Tarfon said,] "Since this mikveh always had the presumption of purity, it remains in its pure status until it is known that it became impure." Said Rabbi Akiva, "Since this mikveh always had a presumption of impurity, it remains in its impure status until you are informed that it is pure." Said Rabbi Tarfon, "To what can this be likened? To someone (i.e., a Priest) who was standing and sacrificing on top of the Altar, and it became known that he is the son of a divorcee, or the son of a chalutza, that his service is [nonetheless] valid." Said Rabbi Akiva, "To what can this be likened? To someone who was standing and sacrificing on top of the Altar, and it became known that he is blemished, that his service is disqualified." Rabbi Tarfon said to him, "You compare it to to someone with a blemish and I compare it to the son of a divorcee and to the son of a chalutza. Let us see to whom it is similar. If it is similar to one with a blemish, it will be learned from one with a blemish. If it is similar to the son of a divorcee and to the son of a chalutza, it will be learned from the son of a divorcee and to the son of a chalutza." Rabbi Akiva says, "A mikveh renders itself disqualified, and one with a blemish renders himself disqualified with his body, and it cannot be proven with the son of a divorcee or the son of a chalutza, who are disqualified through the actions of others. [Moreover,] a mikveh can be disqualified by an individual and one with a blemish can be disqualified by an individual, while the son of a divorcee or the son of a chalutza must be disqualified by the Beit Din." They deliberated over it, and rendered it impure. Rabbi Tarfon said to him, "Akiva! Anyone who separates himself from you is like someone who separates himself from life itself!"

Chapter 6

The land of the Samaritans is pure, [and] its mikvehs and its dwellings and its paths are pure. The land of the nations is impure, [and] its mikvehs and its dwellings and its paths are impure. The mikvehs of the nations that are outside the Land [of Israel] are fit for those who had a seminal discharge, and unfit for all [other] impurities. And those of the Land of Israel, which are outside the entrance [of a city], [are fit] for every impurity and, needless to say, for those who had a seminal discharge. And those inside the entrance [of a city] are unfit for those who had a seminal discharge and, needless to say, for any [other] impurity (contra Mikvaot 8:1). These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, they are fit for those who had a seminal discharge because one who had a seminal discharge may immerse in forty seahs [of water] in any place. And that which is outside the entrance is is fit even for menstruants. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, I do not have any halacha [on this point]. However, it so happened with [a mikveh] in the garden of a certain tax collector in Rimon<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מעשה בגינתו של מיצק ברמון</b> (MS Vienna)</i>, that priests would climb over the fence and descend and immerse within it. (Said Rabbi Yehuda,) it so happened that there was a mikveh between Usha and Sh'far'am, and Rabbi Dosa settled two Torah scholars by it so that [they could ensure] forty seahs of water would be gathered together in it. There was another incident in Rome on a fast day<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ברום בתענת</b>; alt., <b>בבית ענת</b> ("in Beit Anat") (MS Vienna, GR"A)</i>, that more than two thousand kor [of water] were gathered together, and they came and asked Rabbi Chananiah ben Teradyon, and he disqualified it, for [he reasoned that] "I could say that idolaters entered and poured [the water] out of it at night, and then returned and filled it up with a pump." And there was another incident with Rabban Gamaliel and Onkelos the Convert, that they were in Ashkelon and Rabban Gamaliel immersed himself in a public bath, and Onkelos in the sea. Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefusai, I was with them, and Rabban Gamaliel only immersed himself in the sea.

Chapter 8






A heifer that drank [water from a mikveh] and was slaughtered within twenty-four hours: Such an incident occurred, and Rabbi Yosei HaGalili ruled [the flesh] clean and Rabbi Akiva ruled it unclean. Rabbi Tarfon supported Rabbi Yosei HaGalili [and] Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas supported Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas dismissed Rabbi Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Yosei HaGalili dismissed Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas. Rabbi Akiva dismissed Rabbi Yosei HaGalili.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows MS Vienna, as the printed text is defective.</i> After some time, he found an answer [to support his position]. He said, "May I return?" He said to him, "I permit every man to return. Should I not permit you, being that you are Rabbi Yosei HaGalili?" He said to him, "Behold, it says (Num. 19:9), 'And it shall be for the assembly of the Children of Israel for safekeeping, as waters of undefilement.' [They keep the waters of the mikveh safe] in the same way that they keep the waters of undefilement safe, and not in the same way that the heifer that drank them [keeps them safe within its intestines]." This was the incident, and they counted [the votes of] thirty-two elders in Lod, and they rendered it pure. At that very moment, Rabbi Tarfon read this verse (Dan. 8:4, JPS tr.), "I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no beast could withstand him, and there was none to deliver from his power. He did as he pleased and grew great." That is Rabbi Akiva. It says (Dan. 8:5), "And I was watching, and behold, a he-goat came from the west, over the face of the entire earth, and it did not touch the ground. And as I looked on, a he-goat came from the west, passing over the entire earth without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between its eyes." That is Rabbi Yosei HaGalili. And its response (Dan. 8:6-7), "He came up to the two-horned ram that I had seen standing between me and the river and charged at him with furious force. I saw him reach the ram and rage at him; he struck the ram and broke its two horns." That is Akiva and Shimon ben Nanas. "And the ram was powerless to withstand him." That is Akiva. "He threw him to the ground and trampled him." That is Yosei HaGalili. "And there was none to deliver the ram from his power." Those are the thirty-two elders from Lod who were counted and rendered it pure.
