Tosefta Parah



Chapter 1

A bull of twenty-four months and one day, behold, that is a "wholly sound bull," and Rabbi Eliezer says, we give him thirty more days after twenty-four months, for wherever it says "a young bull of the herd" (see Lev. 4:3), it means a two year-old. If it just says "bull," that is a three year-old, up until a five year-old. Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, bulls must be two (<i>sh'tayim</i>) years old, as it is said (Num. 8:8), "And a bull <i>sheni</i>, a young of the herd, take for a sin-offering." They said to him, it doesn't mean <i>sheni</i> as in "two"; rather, <i>sheni</i> as in "second" [in comparison] to the "first." Just as the first [bull] is not eaten, so too the second bull is not eaten. Said Rabbi Shimon, why is a sin-offering like an intercessor (<i>p'raklit</i>)? For it enters [the palace] to appease [the king]. [After] the intercessor has appeased [the king], the present (i.e., the burnt-offering) follows.   
Rebbi says, what is the verse coming to teach (Num. 8:8), "And a second (<i>sheni</i>) bull, a young of the herd, take for a sin-offering"? If it is to teach that there are two, behold, it already says (Lev. 15:15), "And the Kohen shall make them, one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering." [Rather,] you might have thought that the sin-offering precedes the burnt-offering in every [sacrificial] act, thus the verse says, "And a second bull, a young of the herd, take for a sin-offering." Or, you might have thought that "a second bull, a young of the herd, take as a burnt-offering" comes to teach that the burnt offering precedes the sin offering in every [sacrificial] act. Thus the verse states (Num. 8:12), "and he shall designate one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt offering, to God" (i.e., switching the order). <i>How so?</i> The blood of the sin-offering precedes the blood of the burnt-offering, because it appeases, and the bones of the burnt-offering precede the limbs of the sin-offering, because they are entirely burnt (Zev. 10:2). Rabbi Shimon says, what does it come to teach, "and a second bull, a young of the herd, take as a sin-offering"? You might think that the sin-offering is eaten by the Levites; thus the verse states, "second," as in "second to the burnt-offering." Just as the burnt-offering is not eaten, so too the sin-offering is not eaten. Similarly, said Rabbi Yosei (Ezra 8:35), "The exiles who returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for the sake of all Israel, ninety-nine<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">note that the received text of Ezra 8:35 has "ninety-six rams"</i>, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he-goats as a sin-offering, all these as a burnt-offering to God." Is it possible that the sin-offerings were offered up as burnt-offerings? Rather, just as a sin-offering is not eaten, so too a burnt-offering is not eaten. And so too Rabbi Yehuda would say, is was [as atonement] for idol worship [during the exile] that they brought them.
Rabbi Shimon says, wherever the Torah says "calf" without any modifier (סתם), [it means] a one year-old, [as it is said] (Lev. 9:3), "and a calf and a lamb, [each] one year old." [Wherever it says] "a young of the herd," [it means] a two year-old, as it is said (Lev. 9:2), "Take for yourself a calf, a young of the heard, as a sin-offering, and a ram as a burnt-offering, <i>temimim</i>." <i>Temimim</i> [means] "whole" as to years, and "whole" from any blemish. Rabbi Yosei says, three atonements are effected from bulls, and three from rams, and three from goats. And the three from bulls: The bull that is brought for the [unwitting transgression of] any of the commandments (Lev. 4:2-4:3), the bull of Yom Kippur (Lev. 16:6), and the the calf whose neck is broken (Deut. 21:6). The three from rams: The certain guilt-offering and the suspended guilt-offering (Lev. 5:15-19), and the lamb brought by the individual (Lev. 4:32). The three from goats: The goat of the pilgrimage festivals (Num. 28:22-29:38), the goat of Yom Kippur (Lev. 16:10), and the goat of the "prince" (i.e., a euphemism for Azazel) (see Ramban to Lev. 16:8).
The "one year-old lambs" that are spoken of in the Torah are three hundred sixty-five [days old], corresponding to the days of the solar year, the words of Rebbi. And the Sages say, [their age is reckoned] from the first of Nissan to the first of Nissan, from the ninth of Av to the ninth of Av (i.e., according to the lunar year), and if they declared a leap year, the extra month is included [in the count].
The "year" that is spoken of regarding [redeeming] houses sold in walled cities (Lev. 25:29), and the "two" that are in regards to an ancestral field (Lev. 25:15), and the "six" that are in regards to a Hebrew slave (Ex. 21:3), and the remainder of all the "years" of the son and of the daughter -- all of these are calculated from day to day. And the obligatory burnt offerings of an individual are fit from the thirtieth day and upwards, and even on the thirtieth day [itself], and if they offered them up on the eighth day, they are fit. Rabbi Eliezer says, the Passover offering is not fit from the thirtieth day and upwards. This is the general rule that Rabbi Eliezer stated: Anything of which it is said, "one year old" (<i>ben shanah</i>), it is fit from the day that it enters [?] and upwards, and if they offered it up from the eighth day, it is fit. A first-born as to which a blemish formed -- they may slaughter it and eat it, even if it is one day old.

Chapter 2

Rabbi Eliezer says, [the red heifer] may not be purchased from idolaters. They said to him, it so happened that they did purchase one from among the idolaters in Sidon, and Doma was his name. Rabbi Yehuda says, we watch over her so that no one performs any work with her. They said to him, if so, there is no end to the matter -- behold, she is presumed to be fit. Rabbi Meir says, a heifer whose eyeball is black -- if there is no other heifer similar to her, she is disqualified. If they removed the horns and the hooves, and the marrow was [removed] with them, she is disqualified. If she was born via Caesarean section, she is disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems her fit. If she was [purchased] for the hire [of a whore] or the price [of a dog], she is disqualified, and Rabbi Eliezer deems her fit, as it is said (Deut. 23:19), "Do not bring the hire of a whore or the price of a dog into the House of the Lord your God," and this (the red heifer) is not brought into the House.  
All work that render them liable as to consecrated animals [cause] the heifer to be disqualified. If he brought her into (i.e., roped her with) the team [of cattle], and she threshed with her mother, or she is yoked, then she is disqualified [whether the intention was] for work or not for work. She is redeemed for any disqualification. If she died, she must be redeemed. If she was slaughtered, she must be redeemed. If he found another more suitable than her, she must be redeemed. [But once] she has been slaughtered upon her wood pile, she can no longer be redeemed. If she was [originally purchased using] appropriation funds from the treasury, the [redemption] money goes back into the appropriation funds of the treasury.
There is a stringency with the heifer that there is not with consecrated animals, and with consecrated animals that there is not with the <i>eglah</i> (i.e., the calf whose neck is broken), that the <i>eglah</i> is disqualified with years (i.e., if she is over a year old), and work disqualifies her, which is not the case with consecrated animals.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The Tosefta appears defective here, given the jump between the red heifer and the <i>eglah</i>. The GR"A provides the following emendation: "There is a stringency with the heifer that there is not with consecrated animals, and with consecrated animals that there is not with the heifer. The stringency with the heifer is that black hairs disqualify the heifer, and labor disqualifies her, which is not the case with consecrated animals.  The stringency with consecrated animals is that consecrated animals may not be redeemed [etc. (see Tos. Parah 2:4)], and one who does so receives forty lashes, which is not the case with the heifer. There is a stringency with the <i>eglah</i> that there is not with consecrated animals, and with consecrated animals that there is not with the the <i>eglah</i>. The stringency with the <i>eglah</i> is that she is disqualified by years."</i>
The stringency with consecrated animals is that only consecrated animals with a blemish that prevents them [from being offered up] may be redeemed, and they may not be brought out to be sheared or to work, and one who sheers them or performs work with them, behold, he receives forty lashes, which is not the case with the <i>eglah</i>. There is a stringency with the heifer that there is not with the <i>eglah</i>, and with the <i>eglah</i> that there is not with the heifer. [The stringency with the heifer is] that the heifer is only fit if she is red, and blemishes disqualify her, and that if work was done with her she is disqualified, which is not the case with the <i>eglah</i>. The stringency with the <i>eglah</i> is that the <i>eglah</i> is disqualified by years, which is not the case with the heifer.
If she had two black or white hairs within a single follicle, she is disqualified. Inside two follicles, she is fit. Rabbi Yehuda says, even [if they are] within two follicles adjacent to one another, she is disqualified.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Following MS Vienna and GR"A.</i> Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam, one cuts off the tip<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., where the tip is black and the root is red (see Par. 2:5)</i>, and need not be concerned on account of [the prohibition against] shearing.

Chapter 3

What is the difference between the Kohen who burns the heifer and the Kohen of Yom Kippur? The Kohen of Yom Kippur: he is separated for [purposes of] sanctification, and his brothers the Kohanim may come into contact with him. The Kohen who burns the heifer: he is separated for [purposes of] purity, and his brothers the Kohanim may not come into contact with him, except for those who assist him, because [only] he sprinkles [the waters of purification]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "because they do not sprinkle" (see GR"A)</i>.
Courtyards were built in Jerusalem on top of the [foundation] stone, and beneath them was an empty cavity [in order to prevent contamination] due to a grave of the depths, and they brought pregnant women and those who recently gave birth there, and they raised their children there until they were eight years old. And they would bring in oxen with doors on their backs, and the children would sit on top of them. Rabbi Yehuda says, oxen with wide bellies, so that the legs of the children would not protrude out, and thereby become contaminated by a grave of the depths. And everyone agrees that the children require immersion. They said before Rabbi Yaakov: Cups were suspended from the horns of the oxen, so that when the oxen lowered [their heads] to drink [from the Shiloah spring], they would be filled. He said to them, "Do not give others an opportunity to rule!"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In the Mishnah (Par. 3:3), a similar statement ("Do not give the <i>Sadducees</i> an opportunity to rule!") is attributed to Rabbi Yosei.</i>
They came to the gate that goes out from the women's courtyard to the rampart (לחיל, see Middot 1:7), and stone vessels [containing the ashes of the red heifer] were fixed to the wall leading up from the women's courtyard, and their lids were [also] of stone. These [vessels] were seen on the rampart, and inside them were the ashes of each and every [red] heifer that had been burnt, as it is said (Num. 19:9), "And it shall be for the congregation of the Children of Israel for safekeeping, as waters of impurity; for purification it is." § He struck the male [sheep] and it startled backwards, and its ashes (i.e., that it was carrying) would spill. He would take and sanctify and sprinkle that which had spilled. These measures were [only] instituted after they ascended [to Israel] from the exile, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says, their ashes descended with them to Babylonia, and came back up [with them]. They said to him, did they not become defiled in the land of the nations? He said to them, no. [The Sages] only instituted the decree regarding defilement in the land of the nations after they ascended from the exile.
Rabbi Yishmael ben Pi'abi [prepared the ashes of] two [red heifers]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see MS Vienna; alt., "taught [that the ashes of] two [red heifers must be prepared]" (Mishnat Eretz Yisrael)</i>: One with a <i>tevul yom</i> and one with one upon whom the sun had set. That which was prepared with a <i>tevul yom</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, "prepared with one upon whom the sun had set" (Zar Zahav). As noted by Zar Zahav (based on the GR"A), Yishmael ben Pi'abi and the Sages were actually arguing about the ashes that had already been prepared by one whom the sun had set, which resulted in those ashes being discarded and new ashes being prepared with a <i>tevul yom</i>. Alternatively, the printed text can be understood as, "That which was <i>ultimately</i> to be prepared with a <i>tevul yom</i>, etc."</i>, the [whole] day they were arguing with him about it. He said to them<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אמר להם</b> (GR"A); alt., <b>אמרו לו</b> ("They said to him") (MS Vienna)</i>, "Tithes may be eaten by a <i>tevul yom</i> and terumah are [only] eaten by one on whom the sun has set. [As to] tithes, which may be eaten by a <i>tevul yom</i>, would they not reason that eating them would thereby increase their sanctity? [Similarly,] foods of greater sanctity are eaten on one day, and foods of lesser sanctity are eaten over two days, to increase their sanctity."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the GR"A and Zuckermandel cite a fuller version of the foregoing argument, as follows: "Tithes may be eaten by <i>tevulei yom</i>, and terumah may [only] be eaten by one upon whom the sun has set; [thus, as to] tithes that are eaten by one upon whom the sun has set, would it not increase their sanctity all the more so? [Similarly,] foods of greater sanctity are eaten within the curtains, [while] foods of lesser sanctity are eaten outside of the curtains; [thus, as to] foods of lesser sanctity that are eaten within the curtains, would that not increase their sanctity all the more so? [Moreover,] foods of greater sanctity are eaten in one day, and foods of lesser sanctity over two days; [thus,] as to foods of lesser sanctity that are eaten in one day, would that not increase their sanctity all the more so?"</i> They said to him, "If we allow this to stand, we will end up giving a bad name to the earlier ones (i.e., the ashes of the earlier red heifers), about which they (i.e., the Sadducees) would say, 'they were impure.'" And they issued a decree over it, and he spilled out [the ashes prepared by one upon whom the sun had set], and he went back and prepared [ashes from] another [red heifer] with a <i>tevul yom</i>.
They erected a ramp from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives. Arches upon arches, and domes over the foundations, [in order to prevent potential contamination] due to a grave of the depths. Rabbi Eliezer says, there was not a ramp there; rather, there were marble columns with cedar beams on top of them, and the heifer would not need to go out [using] a ramp. And they would contaminate the Kohen who burned the heifer so that the Sadducees would not say that [the burning] was performed by one upon whom the sun had set. And it so happened that there was one upon whom the sun had set for him, and he came to burn the heifer, and Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai found out about it, and he came and he placed both of his hands on him (thereby contaminating him), and he said, "Sir, High Priest, how pleasing it is that you are the High Priest. Now go back and immerse yourself one time."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>רד טבול אחד</b> (GR"A and Ohr HaGanuz)</i> He descended and immersed himself and ascended. After he had ascended, [Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai] tore his ear<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., thereby inflicting a disqualifying blemish (see Zar Zahav here)</i>. He said to him, "Ben Zakkai! When I have time for you...!" He said to him, "When you have time." It was not even three days before they put him in his grave. His father came before Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai. He said to him, "My son did not have time for the sun to set on him."<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See GR"A.</i> § Its pit and its wood pile and the place of immersion were hollow<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ומערכתה ובית הטבילה היו חלילין</b> (Ohr HaGanuz)</i> due to [potential impurity arising from] a grave of the depths (see Par. 3:8).
They bound her with a rope of reeds and placed her on the wood pile,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See Par. 3:9 (Kulp tr.).</i> and there are those who say that she ascended with a mechanism. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, they erect a ramp for her, and she ascends it with her head toward the south and her face toward the west. <i>How would he perform the slaughter?</i> With his right hand, and he would collect [the blood] with his left hand, and he would sprinkle with the finger of his right hand, and if he deviated, [the sprinkling was] disqualified. Rabbi Yehuda says, he would slaughter with his right hand and place the knife in front of him<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See GR"A.</i> or to one who stood at his side, and he would collect [the blood] with his right hand, and transfer it to his left hand, and sprinkle with the finger of his right hand, and if he deviated, [the sprinkling was] disqualified. When he sprinkled, it was either outside the pit or outside the wood pile. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, [if] outside the pit, it is disqualified, and [if] outside the wood pile, he should not return, and if he returned, it is valid. And [if] the blood [inadvertently] spills out of his hand and he returned it, it is valid.
If a part of [the red heifer's] skin, or of her hair, or of her flesh [leapt] outside of the pit [during the burning], he returns it, and if he does not return it, it is disqualified.  Outside of her wood pile -- behold, he piles up wood on it and burns it in its place. Rabbi Eliezer says, an olive's bulk [escaping] prevents [the fulfillment of the mitzvah]; less than an olive's bulk does not prevent. A part of her horn, or her hoof, or her dung -- there is no need to return it, for anything that is not [required for a] sacrifice is not required for her burning. § [The Mishnah, Par. 3:10, says that the Kohen asked three times about each and every thing that was done. The Tosefta comments:] Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tzadok adds, [the Kohen said], "Should I throw it back? Should I throw it back? Should I throw it back?"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, "Was it thrown back? Was it thrown back? Was it thrown back?" (<b>השלך השלך השלך</b>) (see Rash MiShantz to Par. 3:10)</i> And they said "Yes" three times about each and every thing. Whether he tore it off with his hand, whether he tore it off with a knife, whether it was torn off by itself, whether he threw all three of them (i.e., the cedar, hyssop, and crimson wool) all together or one after another<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בין שהשליך שלשתן כאחד בין שהשליך שלשתן זה אחר זה</b> (see Rash MiShantz, ibid.)</i>, it is kosher. 
He added [wood] to it until the fire was kindled on most of [the fuel], or [until] the ashes became disqualified<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., until the ashes of the wood predominated over the ashes of the heifer</i>. [If] he removed bones or a black [coal] (see Par. 3:11) and sanctified with it, behold, [it is like] he has done nothing. If there was any amount of dust on it, if it was from the body, he crushes it and sanctifies it and it is fit. And they divide it into three parts: one was placed in the Hel, one was placed on the Mount of Olives, and one was divided among the [priestly] watches. That which was divided among the watches, Israel would sprinkle from it. That which was placed on the Mount of Olives, the priests would sanctify [themselves] with it. That which was placed in the Hel, they would watch over it, as it is said (Num. 19:9), "And it shall be for the community of the Children of Israel for safekeeping."      

Chapter 4

The [red] heifer is not disqualified by [being left] overnight, and even if it is slaughtered [today] and burned tomorrow, behold, it is valid. If he sprinkles at night, his sprinkling is disqualified. And even if all of them are in the day and one is at night, behold, his sprinkling is disqualified. If he sprinkles with a utensil, his sprinkling is disqualified. And even if all of them are by hand and one is with a utensil, his sprinkling is disqualified. If he sprinkles with his left [hand], his sprinkling is disqualified. And even if all of them are with his right and one is with his left, his sprinkling is disqualified. If seven Kohanim sprinkled at once, their sprinkling is disqualified. If this one sprinkled after that one, their sprinkling is valid. A sprinkling that [he performed] with the [blood of the] heifer, whereby he sprinkled not in its name, or where he did not have [any] intention, or where he omitted one of them, or where he dipped once and sprinkled twice, [or] dipped twice and sprinkled once, behold, all of these are disqualified.
Eight [sprinklings] out of seven (Par. 4:2): If he is the Kohen that performed the service with it, it is disqualified, and if it is another Kohen, it is valid. If the burning [is performed by] an <i>onen</i> or one who lacks atonement<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">an "<i>onen</i>" is a mourner whose close relative has not yet been buried, while "one who lacks atonement" is one who has not yet brought the sacrifice required to complete his purification; in both cases, the individual is in a state of impurity</i>, Rabbi Yosei the Babylonian says, the one who lacks atonement [renders the burning] disqualified. If the burning [is performed by] one who has not washed his hands and feet, it is disqualified, and Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon deems it valid, as it is said (Ex. 30:20), "When they come to the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water and they will not die." Thus, one need not sanctify one's hands and feet except when appearing [in the Temple].
Rabbi Yosei HaGalili says, the burnt offerings that our forefathers brought on Mount Sinai did not require flaying and cutting [into pieces]; rather, from the giving on the Torah and thereafter. The burning of the heifer and her sprinkling [are performed] by the High Priest, and the remaining [rituals are performed] by an ordinary Kohen, as it is said (Num. 19:3), "And you shall give it to Elazar the Kohen." Elazar, who was the deputy [to Aaron, the High Priest], and [thus the rituals involving] the subsequent heifers [are performed] by an ordinary Kohen, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi [Yehuda] and Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov say, that one [was performed] by Elazar, who was the deputy, but [the rituals involving] all the subsequent heifers -- even the High Priest [may perform them].
The commandments [to be performed] with the four white vestments belong to an ordinary Kohen. If they were performed with the golden vestments or with profane clothing -- they are disqualified. The students of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked, "With which [vestments] did they perform the [rituals of the red] heifer?" He said to them, "With the golden vestments." They said to him, "You [previously] taught us, with the white vestments." He said to them, "Well said. If I have forgotten an act that my own hands performed, and my own eyes witnessed, how much more so one that I have [only] heard with my ears!" And it was not that he did not know; rather, it was that he was trying to stimulate his students. And there are those who say that they asked Hillel the Elder, and it was not that he did not know; rather, it was that he was trying to stimulate his students. For Rabbi Yehoshua says, one who teaches and does not exercise [the minds of his students] is like one who sows and does not harvest. One who learns Torah and forgets it is like a woman who bears children and buries them. Rabbi Akiva says, "Review<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>זמר</b>, "to review a lesson in recitative chant" (Jastrow)</i> it; continuously review it."
They may not burn two heifers at one time. [But] once the ashes have been made, another heifer may be brought and burned on top of it and there is no need to be concerned. If [one heifer] is burned in two halves, one after another, Rebbi says, I say, in that [situation], it is valid. A heifer that suffers an injury that disqualifies it: Before it becomes disqualified, it defiles the [priestly] garments; after it becomes disqualified it does not defile the garments. Rabbi Shimon says, either before it is disqualified or after it is disqualified, it does not defile the garments, because she is judged according to [what happens at] the end (cf. R. Hash. 13a:3). Said Rabbi Shimon, I found Chanina ben Gamaliel and he said to me, "A heifer that suffers an injury that disqualifies it, what is the ruling?" I said to him, "Before it is disqualified, it defiles the garments, but after it is disqualified, it does not defile the garments." He said to me, "But didn't they tell Rabbi Elazar in your name, that either before it is disqualified or after it is disqualified, it does not defile the garments, because it is judged according to the end?" I said to him, "I didn't say that. But whether I said it or whether I didn't say it, my words appear correct."
They may always add wood to it (Par. 4:4). Said Rabbi Yehuda, even when they were adding [wood], they were only adding bunches of hyssop, so that the ashes would be abundant and pleasing. Every ritual involving the heifer [is performed] during the day except for the gathering of the ashes, and the filling [of the vessel], and the sanctification. Each of its rituals [is performed] by Kohanim except for the gathering of the ashes, and the filling, and the sanctification. They may neither sanctify nor sprinkle from it until it is rendered into ashes. Each of its rituals may be disqualified by work, except for the gathering of the ashes, and the sprinkling from its waters [of purification].
Six distinctions apply to the [waters of] purification in every place. They sprinkle the waters of purification and the ashes of purification in every place. An am ha'aretz who said, "I am pure for [purposes of] purification," they accept him. "These vessels are pure for purification," they accept them from him. [If] he dipped [his finger] to sprinkle [the waters of purification] but he did not sprinkle, behold, he may eat terumah in the evening. [If] he had in his hand the waters of purification and ashes of purification, they may prepare tahorot (foods prepared in purity) over him, and over his clothes, and over his sandals.
An am ha'aretz who brought vessels for his purification, a chaver may purchase [them] from him for his purification or for his terumah. [If] he brought [vessels] for his terumah, a chaver may not purchase them from him for either his purification or his terumah. Of terumah, a chaver may not purchase from him for his purification or for his terumah. A chaver who tells an am ha'aretz to bring vessels for his purification, the chaver may purchase from him for his purification or for his terumah. [If] he brought for his purification and for his terumah, the chaver may purchase [the vessel] of the purification, whether it is for him, or whether it is for another, as long as he does not resort to artifice, and if he resorted to artifice, the chaver may not purchase from him for [either] his purification or for his terumah. An am ha'aretz who said, "I brought these vessels for my purification, and I changed my mind about them [to use them] for my terumah," since they had been kept privately in the domain of the am ha'aretz for [at least] one hour, behold, they are impure.

Chapter 5

One who brings an earthenware vessel for the [waters of] purification immerses [himself] and spends the night next to the furnace [in which the vessel is being smelted] (Par. 5:1). If he spent the night before he immersed, Rebbi [holds that he] defiles [the vessel]. Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says, if he spends the night and afterwards he immerses, if there was no presumption that [the vessel] was under guard, it is [deemed] impure. As for terumah, he may open the furnace and take it. If he found it open or if one of them was opened, Rabbi Shimon says, [he may take the vessel] from the second row. Rabbi Yosei says, from the third row. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, Beit Shammai say, from the third row, and Beit Hillel say, from the second row, and that is the first Mishnah (i.e., how the halacha was originally transmitted). Our Rabbis say, he opens and he takes it and he need not refrain. And the chaver may come even after three days, and if he removes the coverings<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חֳפָאִים</b> not <b>האפיס</b> (see MS Erfurt)</i> and finds dust on top of the vessels, behold, he may take one [even if] all of them were under the control of an am ha'aretz. 
In a place where they coat the nicer (<b>הנאות</b>) [vessels] with white plaster, and a chaver stands (i.e., watches) over the coating, the pile [of vessels] that he watches over are not impure; rather, that pile alone [is pure]. The chaver stands above and the am ha'aretz below and he pulls [a vessel] out and gives it to him. An am ha'aretz is believed to say, "I did not defile it," because he is presumed to have been watched over.
He filled a bucket to drink, and reconsidered it: Before he touches the water, he pours it out and needs to dry it. If once he touched the water he reconsidered it, he pours it out but does not need to dry it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, there is no need to pour it out. He lowered a bucket to fill it and the rope snapped out of his hand, if before it reached the water he reconsidered it, he pours it out and needs to dry it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, there is no need to pour it out.
A [reed] tube that was cut for [use as a vessel for the waters of] purification: Rabbi Eliezer says, it defiles and there is no need to immerse. Rabbi Yehoshua says, it defiles and he immerses it. [If] the waters of purification or the ashes of purification entered into it before he immersed it, it is impure, and Rabbi Shimon renders it pure, and the Sages render it impure.
Everyone is fit to sanctify (i.e., mix the ashes and the water), except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor. Rabbi Yehuda deems a minor fit. Rabbi Yishmael son of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor who mixed and others supervised them, their mixture is fit. [As to] a <i>tumtum</i>, his mixture is disqualified because there is a doubt as to whether he is uncircumcised, and the uncircumcised are disqualified from mixing. An <i>androgynous</i>, his mixture (קדושו) is fit, but Rabbi Yehuda deems it disqualified, because there is a doubt as to whether he is a woman, and women are disqualified from mixing. 
A wooden vessel, a bone vessel, a glass vessel, they may not [be used to] mix [the ashes and water]. An ostrich [egg], it is fit to mix in it. Whether [the vessel] is carved into a stream of water, or whether it is a receptacle, even though it is detached from the water or it was affixed to it, they may not fill with it, or mix with it, or sprinkle from it, it does not require a tightly fitting lid, and it does not disqualify a mikveh. [If] it was detached or affixed, and he reconsidered it after he detached it, they may fill with it, and mix with it, and sprinkle from it, and it requires a tightly fitting lid, and it disqualifies a mikveh.
A spring that descends into a mortar, and he intends to mix with it, he stops [the flow] and dries it off, and[then] he returns and continues the stream of water and mixes [with it]. A trough that is surrounded by <b>נממיות</b>, if [the waters] were mixed together [through a hole] the size of the mouth of a water skin, one may sanctify the rest, and if not, he needs to sanctify each one individually. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, if he made a rim (lit., "crown") of plaster in order that the water may rise to that point, then whether he can carry [the vessel] with it, or whether he cannot carry [the vessel] with it, it is fit (cf. Par. 5:7). A plaster trough, if he can carry with it, it is fit, and if not, it is disqualified. 
Two stones adjacent to one another (Par. 5:9), and he made them into a trough, and so too two kneading troughs, and so too a split kneading trough: Said Rabbi Yosei, regarding this halacha, I jumped up before Rabbi Akiva, and I said before him, "Neither of them may be used to mix [the ashes], for the water that is in the fissure [between the troughs] is not bound up like that of a vessel." And if one touches the sponge (inside the trough) so that water is squeezed out of it, it is disqualified (Par. 6:3). But if it only fell inside, they may mix with it, and carry it, and squeeze it, and the water is fit.

Chapter 6

One who is on his way to mix [the ashes with the living waters]: Behold, he carries a key and opens [a cabinet where the ashes are stored], or an axe and digs [to remove the ashes], or a ladder and transports it from place to place [to bring down the ashes], it is fit, because he is occupied with the mixing. But if once he takes out the ashes he [so much as] closes the [cabinet] door behind him, it is disqualified because he does work with it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">tr. follows MS Vienna, GR"A</i>. One who prunes an olive tree: If it is so that he can funnel [the ashes] into a reed tube (שפופרת) [used as a container for the mixture], it is fit. If it is in order to pick up a lot of ashes [at once], he is disqualified. [If] he stood [the container] upright on the ground, or he handed it to those standing next to him, if there are guardians [to watch over the ashes], it is fit, but if there are no guardians, it is disqualified. [If] he took the ashes and he saw that it is an excessive amount, and he put [some of] it back, it is fit. [If] he put the ashes [into a container] and he saw that it is an excessive amount, he takes from it and mixes it in [another] place. [If] the wind blew the ashes and they landed on top of the water, he dries them off and mixes with them, [and the mixture] is fit. [If] he put them to mix [but then changed his mind (see GR"A)], Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say, he dries and mixes, and the Sages say, whatever touched the water [before he changed his mind] may not be mixed. 
[If] he poured out [the ashes] with his hand or with his foot or with a clay-rimmed sink<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>חרסין של שוקת</b> (see Jastrow)</i>, it is fit because it was filled with a vessel. [If] he put the ashes [into a vessel] and afterwards put in the water, it is disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems it fit. Rabbi Shimon agrees that if he put in the ashes and afterwards put in the water, and he saw that there was an excessive amount [of ashes], and adds other water to it, he needs to mix [again], for the waters of purification may only be prepared by putting in ashes.
[If] he was standing and mixing and he trembled<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., causing some of the ashes to unintentionally fall into the mixture (see GR"A)</i>, or he got tired, or his friend bumped into him, or the wind pushed him, or another came and mixed<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., without the proper intention (see GR"A)</i>, behold, it is disqualified, as it is said (Num. 19:17), "And they <i>shall take</i> for the impure" -- [this implies] that he should have a specific intention to draw, mix, and sprinkle. He may draw [water] for himself with one hand, or mixed it for himself with one hand, and perform work with one (i.e., the other) hand. [But if] he draws and mixes, [or] mixes and draws, for himself with both hands at once, all of it is disqualified. He may draw for another with one hand, and perform work with one hand. [But if] he draws and mixes, mixes and draws for another with two hands at once -- if it is for him, it is fit, [but] if is for another, it is unfit. When is this? At a time that there watchers there. [If] there are no watchers there, the mixing for others is like the mixing for himself. A drawing for himself with two hands at once in a single mixing is disqualified. In two mixings, it is fit.
Every thing that is in his hand and he did work [with it], whether there are watchers there or whether there are no watchers there -- it is disqualified. Every thing that is in his hand and he did not do work [with it] -- if there are watchers, it is fit, and if there are no watchers, it is disqualified.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">tr. follows GR"A</i> He drew for himself and for another with two hands at once -- all are disqualified. He sanctified for himself and for another with two hands at once -- his is disqualified and the other's is fit. He drew [for himself] and sanctified for another with two hands at once -- his is disqualified and the other's is fit. He sanctified for himself and drew for himself for another [?] with two hands at once -- both are disqualified. He filled for himself with two hands, this one after that one -- the first is disqualified and the second is fit. He sanctified for himself with two hands, this one after that one -- the first is fit and the second is disqualified. He drew and sanctified for himself with two hands, this one after that one -- both of them are disqualified. He drew for another with two hands, this one after that one, [or] he sanctified for another with two hands, this one after that one, [or] he drew and sanctified, [or] sanctified and filled for another with two hands, this one after that one -- all of them are fit. He drew for himself and for another with two hands, this one after that one -- his is disqualified and his fellow's is fit. He sanctified for himself and for another with two hands, this one after that one -- his is fit and his fellow's is disqualified. He drew for himself and for another with two hands, this one after that one -- both of them are disqualified. He sanctified for himself and drew for another with two hands, this one after that one -- both of them are fit.
"Draw for me and draw for yourself," [or] "Sanctify for me and sanctify for yourself" -- all are fit. "Draw them for me and sanctify them for me," [or] "I will draw for you and I will sanctify for you" -- all are disqualified. "Draw for me and I will draw for you," [or] "Sanctify for me and I will sanctify for you," the first and the last are disqualified, and the middle ones are fit. And if there are watchers, all are fit. 

Chapter 7

An individual who filled up five casks to sanctify, one is sanctified. [If] he was taking out each and every one and [then] poured, even if he closed [the door] behind him, it is fit, because he is [continually] occupied with the sanctification, but if once he had taken out the last one he closed the door behind him, it is disqualified because he did work with it; but if there are watchers there, only the one that is in his hand is disqualified. One who sanctifies them with five [acts of] mixing: [If] he had taken them out each and every one and [then] poured, if there are watchers there, that which he closed the door [while holding] is fit, and that which he did not close the door [while holding] is disqualified.
[If] he had set down his cask before him, and his fellow said to him, "Give me," and he gave it to him, both of them are disqualified, but if he said to him, "Take it yourself," his is disqualified and his fellow's is fit. [If] he had before him two casks both of them are fit<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שניהן כשרין</b> (see GR"A)</i>. [If] he had two casks before him and his fellow said to him, "Give me," and he gave his own to him, it is disqualified, but if he gave another's to him, it is fit. And if he said to him, "Take it yourself," they are both fit.
One who is drawing [water] for himself (i.e., for his personal use) and for the purification ritual, draws for himself first and and [then] fastens [the bucket] to the carrying pole, and afterwards draws [the water] for the purification ritual. [If] he wanted to drink but it was impossible for him unless both of them [were connected to] the carrying pole, then whether he drew for himself first and afterwards drew for the purification ritual, or whether he drew for the purification ritual first and afterwards drew for himself, he places [the bucket] for his own use behind him and [the bucket] for the purification ritual in front of him, and if he placed [the bucket] for the purification ritual behind him, it is disqualified.
One who transports the rope [with the buckets of water attached] along his normal route, [the water is] fit, but if he goes out of his way, it is disqualified. As to this halacha, the residents of Asia presented it on three [consecutive pilgrimage] festivals to Yavneh. On the third festival, they held that [the water] was fit, as a temporary ruling. Said Rabbi Yosei, it was not as to this that they ruled, but rather as to one who raised up the rope and went back and afterwards wound it in circles [around his hand]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>וכננו</b> (see Par. 7:7, Rash MiShantz)</i>, they ruled that it is fit as [applied] to the past, but disqualified it for the future.
Whoever had both himself and his waters [of purification] in a tent with a corpse, and his waters were sealed with a tightly fitting lid -- just as he is pure, so too his waters are pure. [If] he is from inside, and his waters are from outside, just as he is impure, so too his waters are impure. [If] he is from outside and his waters are from inside, just as he is pure, so too his waters are pure. Said Rabbi Shimon, for this [reason], one says to him, "Guard yourself so that your waters will be pure."
One who had his waters on his shoulders and [a woman made] a declaration of refusal before him, or performed halitza before him, or he dislodged a stone for another, or he showed another the way -- if he stood still, it is disqualified,  but if he didn't stand still, it is fit. Said Rabbi Yehuda, this is the general rule -- something done on account of work, whether he stood still or did not stand still, it is disqualified; something not done on account of work, if he stood still it is disqualified, and if he didn't stand still, it is fit. 
Rabbi Eliezer says, one who gives over his waters to one who is impure, or the owners performed work -- they are disqualified.  Rabbi Yehuda says in his name, if the impure person did work, [the waters] are fit because they were under the domain of their owners, [but] if the owners did work, they are impure, because they were under the domain of the impure person. 
Rabbi Yosei says, one who breaks a fence in order to repair it, and he stipulated to it, even though he repaired it, [the water] is fit. One who eats [figs] in order to store [some of them], and he stipulated to it, even though he stored them, it is fit. 
The one who burns the [red] heifer and the bulls<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">e.g., the bull of the High Priest, the bull of the congregation, and the bull of Yom Kippur (Zar Zahav)</i>, and the one who sends away the goat [to Azazel] all defile their clothing. The heifer and the and the bulls and the [goat that is] sent away do not themselves defile clothing, but they defile foods and liquids, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, the heifer and the bulls, which are burned, defile foods and liquids, [but the goat, which is only] sent away, does not defile foods and liquids. Rabbi Shimon says, the heifer defiles foods and liquids, for it had a period of time in which it was fit [for eating<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., after it is slaughtered but before it is burned, it could be redeemed and eaten, even up to the point that it is placed on the wood pile (Zar Zahav (citing B.K. 77b:1))</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda says, [as to] the heifer, as soon as it is slaughtered it defiles through carrying, just like its ashes.

Chapter 8

There exists one who says, "You were defiled and you defiled me<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "You were defiled, and I was not defiled, but you defiled me" (MS Vienna, GR"A).</i> How so? When pure water was drawn into a defective vessel, and an impure defective vessel was turned over on top of it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שמלאה משקין טהורין לגיסטרא וגסטרא טהורה כפויה על פיה</b> (Zar Zahav)</i>. Liquid flowed from the bottom one and became defiled in the airspace of the upper one, and it [thereby] defiled the lower one. Behold, this one says, "You were defiled, I was not defiled, but you defiled me."  
[As to] a zav who sits on top of a heavy stone, foods and liquids that are under it are pure. [But] an object upon which one can lie or sit that are under it are impure. Behold, this one says, "You were defiled, I was not defiled, but you defiled me."
Rabbi Yehuda says, there exists one who says, "My impurity defiled you but did not defile me, but you defiled me." [How so?] A dish that is filled with pure liquid and its underside [had contact with] impure [liquid], and it is placed on top of a table, and a wrapped-up loaf of terumah is on top of the table, and water flowed from its inside and touched its outside -- it is defiled, and it defiles the table and the table goes back and defiles the loaf. Behold, this one says, "My impurity did not defile me, but you defiled me." There exists one who says, "It defiled me, and I defiled it". [How so?] A tevul yom who had in his hand terumah flour and pure chullin liquid, and mixed them -- it is impure. Behold, this one says, "It defiled me, and I defiled it."
A cooking pot that is filled with pure liquid, and impure lupines of less than the size of an egg's bulk are placed inside it. [If] they swelled up (i.e., absorbed the water) and became the size of an egg's bulk, they are impure. Behold, this one says, "It defiled me, and I defiled it." A pure person upon whose head or the majority of his body fell three <i>logs</i> of drawn water: Even if he is pure and they are pure, they defile him, and they become defiled. Behold, this one says, "He defiled me, and I defiled him."
And there exists one who says, "It defiled me, and I purified it." How so? A patch that was attached to a basket defiles one and disqualifies one. [If] it was separated from the basket, the basket defiles one and disqualifies one, but the patch [itself] is pure.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishneh Torah, Vessels 23:8</i> Behold, this one says, "It defiled me, and I purified it."
And there exists one who says, "It purified me and I defiled it." How so? A mikveh that has exactly 40 seahs [of water], he descended and immersed inside of it -- he is pure and the mikveh is impure. Behold, this one says, "It purified me, and I defiled it."
And there exists one who says, "It purified me, and I purified it." How so? A closet that is impure with corpse impurity, and someone brought a nail that was impure and made a hole [in the closet] with it -- the closet becomes pure and the nail becomes pure. Behold, this one says, "It purified me, and I purified it." Three mikvehs: In this one twenty [seahs of pure water], and in that one twenty [seahs of pure water], and in [the third] one twenty seahs of water drawn from the side<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., rendering the third mikveh invalid for immersion (see Zar Zahav)</i>. Three [people] descended and immersed in them and [the water] became intermixed. The mikvehs are [all] pure and those who immersed are [all] pure. Behold, this one says, "It purified me, and I purified it."

Chapter 9

All the rivers are disqualified to sanctify the waters of purification with them. And Rabbi Yehuda concedes that regarding a spring that flows out from two places and returns back and mixes in one place, it is fit. And so too would Rabbi Yehuda say, a person may draw from this spring into a jar, and from that spring into a jar, and pour them into a single trough and sanctify [the combined waters]. And so too would Rabbi Yehuda say, a person may fill a flask from this jar, and a flask from that jar, and pour it into a single trough and sanctify. And so too would Rabbi Yehuda say, one who goes down to Tzalmon is forbidden [to draw water], because they [are waters which are known to] have failed in times of war. They said to him, all the waters of Creation failed in times of war. Shiloah had ants crawling in it<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>נמלה מהלכת בו</b> (see Rash MiShantz to Par. 8:9)</i>. But a spring that would flow out in one year from this side and in another year from that side, or that was abundant in the rainy season and decreased in the sunny season, is fit.
All agree that regarding a well into which descended a flow of rainwater, that one must wait until [its appearance returns] to how it had been. A newly emerging spring needs to become clear [before its waters can be used], the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Sages say, there is no need. [If] he had put a jar down in front of him, and a flow of rainwater descended into it, it is disqualified. [If] dew descended into it at night, Rabbi Eliezer says, he should let it remain in the sun and the dew will evaporate. And the Sages say, dew only evaporates from fruits.
Waters of purification into which fell waters from a spring, or waters from a mikveh or fruit juices: If the majority are waters of purification, they impart impurity by carrying; [and] if the majority are fruit juices, they do not impart impurity by carrying. Half and half -- they impart impurity by carrying. In any of these cases, they are disqualified from sprinkling from them. Said Rebbi, according to the words of Rabbi Eliezer, a sprinkling in any amount is fit [to purify], and [even if the sprinkling is] half from fit [waters] and half from unfit, the sprinkling purifies in any amount.
[If] a spider fell into them, or the water-drawer drew up a fish, or a frog, and they split open and changed their appearance (i.e., the appearance of the waters of purification), they are disqualified. [If] they did not split open and did not change their appearance, they are fit. Rabbi Yehuda says, even if they did not split open and did not change their appearance, they are disqualified, because they are runny (מורירין<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alterations in this halacha follow MS Vienna</i>). And all agree that as to a locust, that it disqualifies because it it is runny, but all agree that if it splits open, it does not disqualify. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, the words of Rabban Gamaliel (Par. 9:3) are preferable as to a snake, and we teach according to his words. Said Rabbi Yosei, and is it not so that that the words of Rabbi Eliezer in connection with the heifer (בפרה) are nothing but leniencies, for Rabbi Eliezer says, "When he tips the flask (כשיטה)" -- but Rabbi Yehoshua says, "Only when he drinks," for he drinks with his mouth<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">and thus merely tipping the flask with one's hands does not demonstrate an intention of drinking sufficient to disqualify the waters of purification</i>. And if [it is poured directly] into his throat, it is valid (see Par. 9:4).
Waters of purification that changed their appearance on their own account are fit; on account of smoke or into which fell woad or safflower or madder (i.e., plants used as dyes) are disqualified. This is the general rule: Whatever disqualifies a spring with a change in appearance disqualifies a flask. Ashes of purification that changed their appearance on their own account or on account of smoke are fit. [If] they changed on account of dust or if lime or plaster fell into them, they are disqualified. Waters of purification that froze and then melted again are fit. If they were melted by fire, they are disqualified, but if by the sun, they are fit. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, anything that can be immersed in for Shabbat is fit, and anything that cannot be immersed in for Shabbat is disqualified for the purification [ritual]. Water that is viscous or that has been discarded (נזרקין not נגררין) is disqualified.
A person does not transport waters of purification and ashes of purification while he is riding on the back of his fellow or on the back of an animal [in] a place where his feet do not touch the ground. But they may carry him over a bridge [and there is no concern]. It is the same with the Jordan and with all the other rivers. Chananiah ben Akiva says, they only stated this [leniency] as to the Jordan.  

Chapter 10

[Regarding] the waters of purification and the ashes of purification that are mixed together, whether they are impure or whether they are pure, they render the pure impure for purposes of touching or carrying terumah. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said, [regarding] waters of purification that became impure, behold, they are like wood ashes. Disqualified ashes that were put on top of the waters [of purification], whether they are fit for mixing or whether they are not fit for mixing, they render pure hands impure for purposes touching or carrying terumah. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, ashes of purification that became impure, behold, they are like wood ashes.
[Regarding] anything that is susceptible to become impure with corpse-impurity, even [that which becomes] impure does not possess madaf impurity<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אינו מדך</b> (see MS Vienna and GR"A)</i>, and whatever does not have madaf impurity for terumah does not possess madaf impurity for the purification ritual, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. It so happened with Shamaiah,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">tr. from "the words" to "Shamaiah" follows MS Vienna and GR"A</i> a man from Kfar Otney who had in his hand a flask full of waters of purification, and shut a door which had a key that was impure with corpse-impurity attached to it, and he came and asked Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, and he said to him, "Shamaiah, go and sprinkle your waters." And Rabbi Yehoshua says, even what which is pure possesses madaf impurity. And it so happened with Rabbi Yishmael, that he was walking after Rabbi Yehoshua, and he said to him, "One who is pure for the purification ritual, who moves a key that is pure for terumah -- what is he, impure or pure?" He said to him, "Why [would he be impure]?" He said to him, "Lest it possess old impurity<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., impurity retained by metal vessels after they are recast (see Shab. 16b:2)</i>, or lest he forgot and moved something impure." [Rabbi Yehoshua then] diverted him to another topic. He said to him, "Yishmael, my brother, how do you read [the verse] 'your love is more delightful than wine'<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., should the word "your" be read masculine or feminine</i> (Songs 1:2)?" He said to him "Your (fem.) love is more delightful than wine." He said to him, "That is not so. For behold, its companion-verse (Songs 1:3) is instructive thereon: 'The fragrance of your (masc.) ointments is sweet.'" And the Sages say, that which is impure possesses madaf-impurity, and that which is pure does not possess madaf-impurity. For the impurity that they spoke about was corpse-impurity and not madaf-impurity. Rebbi says, one who is pure for the purification [ritual] who [indirectly] moves the spit or the urine of one who is pure for terumah is impure. One who [indirectly] moves his blood, behold, that one is pure. One who [indirectly] moves a <i>sheretz</i> or a carcass or a seminal emission, Rabbi Eliezer renders him pure, and Rabbi Yehoshua renders him impure.
A jar of purification [waters] that was placed on top of a <i>sheretz</i>: Rabbi Eliezer renders it pure and the Sages render it impure. To what case does this refer? To a situation where if the <i>sheretz</i> moved but the jar stood still, and even if a corpse or a carcass touch it from the outside, it is impure. And if it was placed on top of something that was laid upon or sat upon, or on top of an impure earthenware [vessel], it is impure. If it was placed on top of food or liquid, or on top of a Sefer Torah, Rabbi Yosei renders it pure and Rabbi Meir renders it impure. One who passes it over [the airspace of] an oven or over a carcass or over a <i>sheretz</i>, Rabbi Akiva renders it impure. Rabbi Akiva concedes that if the sprinkling passed over something that was laid upon or sat upon, or on top of an impure earthenware vessel, that it is pure, except for an olive's-bulk of a corpse, or from a tent [covering a corpse], in which case [the sprinkling] is impure, from above as from below.
A jug containing [ashes of] purification and a stone jug containing terumah which touched one another -- both of them are pure. With two handles -- both of them are impure. Rabbi Yehoshua says, [only] that of the [ashes of] purification is impure. A jug and a flask containing terumah that touched one another, both of them with the two handles that are on them, are pure. Rabbi Yehoshua says, that of the [ashes of] purification is impure. In what case does this apply? As to a stone [jug], but as to an earthenware [jug], all agree that as to the one containing [ashes of] purification, it is pure.
A flask containing [the waters of] purification and a flask containing terumah which touched one another -- both of them are pure. With two handles, both of them are impure. With two [wrapping] papers that are on them, they are impure. Rabbi Yehoshua says, [only] that of the [ashes of] purification is impure. This is the general rule: That Rabbi Akiva says, anything that can impart impurity to the waters of purification by touch [also] imparts impurity by carrying, and anything that cannot impart impurity by touch cannot impart impurity by carrying.

Chapter 11

Hyssop that is fit and vessels that are pure for the purification ritual are protected by a tightly fitting cover. Any doubt as to purity for terumah renders one pure for the purification ritual except for the hands, because they [create] a doubt<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., <b>פסול</b> ("a disqualification") (GR"A)</i>  as to [the purity status of] the body (see Par. 9:8). A doubt as to <i>hakaphtzin</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ספק הקפצין</b> ("levitical uncleanliness based on contact with one's legs") (see Jastrow)</i> renders one pure as to terumah [but] impure for the purification ritual, because it [creates] a doubt as to disqualification<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., <b>מפני שהוא פסולו בגוף</b> ("because it disqualifies him through his body") (GR"A)</i>. Wooden mats [on which a <i>zav/zavah</i> has sat] are pure for consecrated foods, for terumah, and for the purification ritual, but Rabbi Eliezer says, they are impure for the purification ritual and pure for consecrated foods and for terumah. [Said Rabbi Yehuda,<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see MS Vienna, GR"A</i>] even I said this, but my colleagues decreed against me that I must concede to them as to the purity [of wooden mats in regards to one performing the purification ritual].
[A pressed fig cake<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>דבילה</b> (see MS Vienna, GR"A)</i>] of terumah that fell inside the waters of purification [and] were taken out and eaten: Even if it was the size of an egg-bulk, whether it was pure or impure, [the waters remain] pure (contra. Par. 11:3). If so, there is no such thing as "pure for the purification ritual," for I say, the one who sprinkles was defiled through the waters [of purification], and the one sprinkles went back and defiled the waters. The hyssop was defiled, and the hyssop went back and defiled the waters. Said Rabbi Meir, to what case does this apply? To one who inserts a reed or a wood chip [into the vessel containing the waters of purification], but [as to one who] removed [the waters] with his hand, he becomes defiled, and he defiles the waters of purification. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say, one who is pure for [purposes of] terumah cannot defile the waters of purification, or the ashes of purification, or the one who sprinkles the waters of purification.
Anyone who requires immersion in water, whether according to Torah law or whether according to rabbinic law, before he enters the water, he defiles the waters of purification and the ashes of purification and the one who sprinkles the waters of purification via touch and carrying. Rabbi Eliezer says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon, an impure person may transport vessels that are pure for the purification ritual on a pole on his shoulder and need not be concerned.
Hyssop of a sacred tree or of idolatry or of a beguiled city is disqualified, and one should not sprinkle [with hyssop] of pure [terumah], but if he sprinkled it is fit. One should not sprinkle with young shoots or with bare stalks [of hyssop]. [If he sprinkled with young shoots] and entered the Temple, he is exempt, [but if he sprinkled with] bare stalks and entered the Temple, he is liable, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [if he sprinkled] with bare stalks and entered the Temple, he is exempt, but with young shoots and entered the Temple, he is liable. What are "young shoots"? [They are] stalks as to which [the buds] have not ripened, and "bare stalks" are those as to which [the buds] have not sprouted whatsoever, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, "young shoots" are those in which [the buds] have not sprouted whatsoever," and "bare stalks" are stalks as to which [the buds] have not ripened.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: The translation of Rabbi Meir's and the Sages' positions follows MS Vienna</i> They did not disagree as to the halacha; rather, as to the meaning of the words. One who reaps [hyssop] for the purification ritual is like one who reaps for food, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon say, like one who reaps for kindling.

Chapter 12

Hyssop: When is it fit to sprinkle? From the time that it has shed its blossoms. [If] one sprinkled before it shed its blossoms, Rebbi disqualifies it and Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon renders it fit. Rabbi Yosei concedes that as to hyssop that had two [blossoms] at the beginning and shed one of them, that it is disqualified.
Severed hyssop branches are fit, and severed [strings of] tzitzit are fit. He lowered it and immersed it and brought it up -- if there is on it a flow of rainwater and he sprinkled, his sprinkling is disqualified, but if there is dripping moisture on it (i.e., caused by a source of water pouring from above (see Gittin 16a:1)), and he sprinkled, his sprinkling is fit. Rabbi Yehuda says, if there is liquid from his legs on it and he sprinkled, his sprinkling is disqualified. Hyssop that he dipped its branch along with its capsules -- even if when he sprinkles the water runs from the branch to the capsules -- it is valid. [He may sprinkle] in his normal fashion and need not be concerned lest [the water] came out from the wood. Hyssop that he dipped [only] part of it -- Rabbi Yehuda renders it valid, for Rabbi Yehuda says, "One  may dip part of it and go back and surround it [completely with water] until he has immersed all of it." One who immerses all of it may not perform a second sprinkling [with the same hyssop] until he dries it.
A flask whose mouth is narrow -- they may sprinkle from it the second sprinkling, but not the first sprinkling because the water squeezes out, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Three things said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Kahana: In their days, the priests never refrained from sprinkling with hyssop that had [previously] been dipped; or [dipping] with a flask whose mouth was narrow; or cracking open terumah nuts with unclean hands, and [the Sages] were not concerned for them on account of impurity.
One who says to his fellow, "Sprinkle on me and I will sprinkle on you," Rabbi Akiva renders him impure and the Sages render him pure. Those who watch over the waters of purification, even up to ten days, behold, they retain their presumption [of purity] and need not immerse.
All are fit to sprinkle except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, and Rabbi Yehuda renders a minor fit. Rabbi Yishmael the son of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, [as to] a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor who sprinkled and others supervised them, their sprinkling is valid.
[If] he intends to sprinkle in front of him, and he [inadvertently] sprinkles behind him, his sprinkling is valid (contra Par. 12:2 ("disqualified")). [If] he sprinkles on a person and [also] on his fellow, whether he mixed up the sprinklings, he may sprinkle a second time. Or [if he sprinkled on a person and] on vessels, whether on their insides or on their outsides, [the sprinkling is valid] -- except for the additional part of the olive cookers' boiler (Kel. 5:5), for it defiles the sprinkling in the airspace opposite the additional part, for he sprinkles on it from its outer side. [If] he dipped the hyssop in the name of something that is fit to be sprinkled, the water that drips [from the hyssop] is impure, but valid for sprinkling, and if any remains on the hyssop, he may sprinkle a second time. [If he dipped the hyssop] in the name of something that is not fit it be sprinkled, since at the outset its dipping was disqualified, so too its sprinkling is disqualified. And so too would Rabban Gamaliel say, "They tell him, sprinkle <i>perush</i> behind you lest you become defiled." They said to him, "But isn't it so that they would slip [on the waters of purification] in front of a window [facing] the public domain, [and nevertheless] they would tread [in that spot] and not refrain, because they said, 'The waters of purification that performed their mitzvah do not become defiled.'" And how much water must there be? There should be enough [water for] sprinkling, [which is] enough to dip the tops of the capsules [of the hyssop branch and sprinkle therewith]. [However,] this amount should be apart from the amount required for sprinkling, for the hyssop absorbs [the water]. Rabbi Yehuda says, we view it as though the capsules are made of bronze, which does not absorb. 
A pure person for [purposes of the waters of] purification whose hands became defiled: His body becomes defiled [via his hands], and he defiles his fellow, and his fellow [defiles] his fellow, and [he defiles] the outer part of the flask [containing the waters of purification]. A flask used for [the waters of] purification that was defiled via its airspace: Its inside is thereby defiled, and it defiles its fellow, and its fellow [defiles] its fellow, and [it defiles] the one who sprinkles, for they did not say concerning the [waters of] purification, "this is first-degree impurity," and "this is last-degree impurity"; even if they are one hundred, they are all [treated] like the first, for they do not count [degrees of impurity] for purposes of the waters of purification.  Batches of dough that were made on top of [waters of] purification and a <i>sheretz</i> touched one of them: Even if they are one hundred, they are all [treated] like the first, for they do not count [degrees of impurity] for purposes of [the waters of] purification.
A reed [spindle] used for spinning coarse material is [considered] connected for [purposes of] impurity and for sprinkling. Of flax or of leather strips, behold, he should not sprinkle [with it], but if he [nonetheless] sprinkled, it is sprinkled (i.e., the sprinkling is deemed valid). All drilled handles of vessels are connected. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, even the spittle and excrement that are on a chair are [considered] connected for sprinkling, but they are not connected for impurity, [the words of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili, and Rabbi Akiva says, everything that is [considered] connected for sprinkling is connected for impurity,]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the preceding bracketed portion is omitted from the printed text but contained in MS Vienna</i> but there exists that which is is [considered] connected for impurity but which is not connected for sprinkling. A kettle is [considered] connected for impurity and for sprinkling. The lid of a kettle that is connected [to the kettle itself] with a chain: Beit Shammai say, everything is [considered] a single connected unit, and Beit Hillel say, a sprinkling on the kettle is [considered] a sprinkling on the lid, but a sprinkling on the lid is not [considered] a sprinkling on the kettle. Said Rabbi Yosei, [those are] the words of Beit Shammai, and Beit Hillel say, everything is [considered] a single connected unit.
[If] he dipped the hyssop at night, it is not that the water becomes disqualified, but that he needs to dip a second time (i.e., during the day). [If] he sprinkled at night, the sprinkling is disqualified and the water is impure for purposes of the waters of purification.
