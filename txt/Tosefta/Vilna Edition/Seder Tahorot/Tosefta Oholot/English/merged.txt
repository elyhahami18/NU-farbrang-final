Tosefta Oholot



Chapter 1



Chapter 2




A skull that has a long puncture-wound, or that had many puncture-wounds: They combine together [to constitute] the size of a drill hole. Said Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam, it so happened that in Ein Bul, there was one whose skull had [a piece] broken off, and the doctor brought him a patch made of a pumpkin shell, and he survived. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said to him, that is no proof. Even though he survived all the days of that year, once there was a rainfall, he caught cold on it (i.e., the patched skull), and he died.

Chapter 3




The tombstone and the frame supporting the tombstone defile by touch and by a tent, but they do not defile by carrying. Rabbi Eliezer says, they defile by carrying, from a logical deduction (<i>kal v'chomer</i>), for if they defile by touch, which is light, should they not defile [by carrying], which is stringent? Rabbi Akiva said to him, "If they defile by touch, which is more common, should they defile by carrying, which is less common?" Rabbi Eliezer said to him, "What is this, Akiva? For isn't it true that tent-impurity is less common than both of them, yet behold, they defile in it. And if they defile in a tent, which is less common, should they not defile by carrying, which is more common?" Rabbi Akiva was dismissed. Then Rabbi Yehoshua jumped up. He said to him, "Tent-impurity is more common than carrying-impurity, for one who tents over a corpse with a sukkah is impure, while one who moves it is pure." Said Rabbi Shimon, this is how it is judged: If there is a sukkah with an entryway, behold, it interposes on top of [the corpse], and if there is a sukkah without an entryway, that is itself a "tombstone." Rather, this is how it one should consider it: Tent-impurity is more common than carrying-impurity, for everything is defiled in a tent, and only a person is defiled by carrying. § It so happened in Beit Dagan in Judea that there was someone who died on the evening before Passover, and they went to bury  him and the women<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הנשים</b> (Zar Zahav)</i> entered and they tied the rope to the tombstone. Then the men pulled from outside [and lowered the body into the grave] and the women entered to bury him, and then the men left and made their Pesach offerings in the evening [in a state of purity].

Chapter 4



Chapter 5

Rabbi Yishmael b'Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Natan: A tent that is less than four handbreadths, its opening [for purposes of impurity] is its full capacity and its roof is pure. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir, a corpse that is more than four handbreadths, its opening is its full capacity. Rabbi Yosei says, the spinal column and the skull are the equivalent [of the volume] of a corpse [for purposes of impurity]. Others say in the name of Rabbi Natan, all the impurities that are learned out from a corpse are like a corpse, and its opening is four handbreadths.





Said Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri came to the place of Rabbi Chalafta. He said to him, "What is your opinion about the eye of an oven?" He said to him, "It is impure." He said to him, "Even I say that, but Akiva holds that it's pure." The eye of an oven that is higher than a handbreadth but is not wider than a handbreadth, or which is not higher than a handbreadth, is pure. [If] he placed a board on top of a cleft, it is impure. The board is defiled and it defiles the oven.

Chapter 6

Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua, just as vessels save with respect to tents that have walls, so too they save with respect to tents that have no walls. Wooden vessels and earthenware vessels are both pure [and thereby save food, liquids, and other vessels within them (see Kel. 5:1)]. When do these words apply? With a vessel that has a handbreadth by a handbreadth [cavity] within it, but with a vessel that does not have a handbreadth by a handbreadth [cavity] within it, it does not save. When do these words apply? At a time that it is tightly sealed from the outside on one side, or from the inside on two sides; but if it was [only] tightly sealed equivalent to half a handbreadth on this side and   equivalent to half a handbreadth on that side, behold, it does not save.

Chapter 11











An olive-bulk of a corpse in the mouth of a raven, and one who erects a tent on top of the aperture [of a roof] whose width is less than a handbreadth: The house is impure. Rabbi Yosei renders it pure until there is impurity of a handbreadth's width across.

Chapter 16

The mounds that are nearby, between one town and another town, or between roads: Whether they are new or old, they are impure, because women bury their stillborn fetuses there, and lepers bury their limbs there. New [mounds] that are far [from a town or road] are pure; old ones are impure, for I could say, "lest there was once a road or a town there." And what are these "mounds"? These are mounds of dirt that are on top of a cleft [in the earth]. One who erects a tent on top of part of [a mound] is impure and, needless to say, [one who pitches a tent] against all of it. Its dirt is impure on account of being "dirt of a mound." One who dug (חתר) dirt from it, and packed [more dirt] on it, it is not subject to the laws of "dirt of a mound." A mound that was impure and was purified, behold, it is pure, and one need not be concerned lest it revert to impurity
It is the same whether one finds three corpses, or whether one finds three sepulchers, or whether one finds a sepulcher and a cleft grave and a hastily dug grave [at the same time], or whether one found ten and they do not have between four and eight cubits in between them: They all are subject to [the laws regarding the impurity of the] "surrounding earth," but they are subject to [the laws regarding the impurity of] a "graveyard site" (i.e., a cemetery) (see <i>Oholot</i> 16:3), the words of Rabbi Shimon. And the Sages say, one looks at the middle ones as if they were not there, and the outer ones join together from four to eight cubits. [If] he found a [corpse's] head next to its legs, it is not subject to [the laws of] "surrounding earth," and it is not subject to [the laws of] a "graveyard site." The head of this one next to the body of that one, and the head of that one next to the body of this one: They are subject to [the laws of] "surrounding earth," but they are not subject to [the laws of] a "graveyard site." And that which is missing is subject neither to "surrounding earth" nor to a "graveyard site." And what does "missing" mean? Anything that would cause someone to die if it was removed when he was alive. [If] he found two [corpses] for the first time, and one [more] is known [to exist], they are subject to "surrounding earth," but they are not subject to a "graveyard site." It so happened with Rabbi Yeshevav, that he inspected and found two for the first time, and one was known. He made (i.e., designated) for them [an area of] "surrounding earth," [and] he made for them [an area of] a "graveyard site." When he came to the place of Rabbi Akiva, he said, "All your work was in vain. You would have had to inspect every known burial site in the Land of Israel (i.e., according to your logic). They only ruled regarding one who finds three [corpses] for the first time."
[If] one [grave] was found on one side of a public thoroughfare, and two [were found] on the other side, he inspects one side and the other side, and he leaves [a cubit] of the public thoroughfare [unchecked] (see <i>Oholot</i> 16:4). Two on one side of a fence, and two on the other side of the fence: He inspects the area of the fence, for it is the [normal] way of a builder to inspect until he reaches the rock (i.e., the rocky substrata), or virgin soil. And what is "virgin soil"?  Anything that does not have clods of fresh-broken ground, and does not have loose earth below it. [If] he inspected and reached water [below the surface], behold, that is virgin soil. [If] he inspected and found clay there, behold, that is like virgin soil. The one who inspects: Beit Shammai say, he checks two [cubits] and leaves one cubit [unchecked], and Beit Hillel say, he checks one cubit and leaves one cubit, the words of Rabbi Yaakov. And the Sages say, Beit Shammai say, he checks two [cubits] and leaves one cubit, and Beit Hillel say, he checks one cubit and leaves two.
One (i.e., a priest) who finds dust from an impure area  eats from his <i>dema</i> (i.e., terumah mixed with chullin). Rabbi Yehuda says, he piles this dust on top of that dust, but our Rabbis said, the dust is pure. One who inspects eats from his <i>dema</i>. The students of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai asked him, "The inspector -- what should he eat?" He said to them, "He does not eat." They said to him, "You taught us that he does eat." He said to them, ""Well said. If I have forgotten an act that my own hands performed, and my own eyes witnessed, how much more so one that I have [only] heard with my ears!" And it was not that he did not know; rather, it was that he was trying to stimulate his students. For Rabbi Yehoshua would say, one who teaches and does not exercise [the minds of his students] is like one who sows and does not harvest. One who learns Torah and forgets it is like a woman who bears children and buries them. Rabbi Akiva says, "Review it; continuously review it."
It turns out that one can say that there are three graves: A grave that is discovered: They may remove it, [but once] it is removed, the area is impure, and forbidden to derive benefit from. A grave which endangers the public: They may remove it, [and once] it is removed, the area is pure and permitted to derive benefit from. A grave which is known: They may not remove it, [but] if they did remove it, they area is pure and permitted to derive benefit from. A field in which a grave was lost (i.e., its location was forgotten) is pure, [but] one who enters [the field] is impure. [If] he examined [the field] and found a grave inside it: One who enters [the field] is pure, for I could reason, "The grave that was lost is the grave that was found." [If] he examined and found three graves inside it: One who enters [the field] is pure, and one need not be concerned lest they are subject to [the laws of] a "graveyard site" (i.e., a cemetery) (see <i>Oholot</i> 16:3). One who removes his grave (i.e., a grave on his property) to the public thoroughfare, and a person was walking there, he removes one bone [at a time], and everything is pure. One who dug out his grave inside his field, they say to him, "Collect it bone by bone, and everything is pure." It so happened with the brothers<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אחין</b>, not <b>אחיו</b> ("his brothers") (Zuckermandel)</i> Yehuda and Hillel, the sons of Rabban Gamaliel, that they were walking on the border of Oney, [and] they found a certain man who had dug up his grave inside of his field. They said to him, "Collect it bone by bone, and everything is pure."
One whose burial is unauthorized is not [considered] part of a "graveyard site" and is not subject to [the laws of] "the surrounding earth of the grave." Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, a stillborn does not acquire a grave and is not subject to "surrounding earth," and one whose burial is unauthorized is subject to "surrounding earth." Rabbi Yehuda says, a pit into which stillborn are dropped is pure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, it so happened with a certain [Roman] tax collector in Rimon, that he dropped a stillborn into a pit, and a certain priest came with his front plate (<i>tzitz</i>) to determine what was dropped [into the pit], and that incident was brought before [the Sages] and they rendered it pure, because weasels and hyenas can be found there, and [it is presumed that] they would drag [the stillborn] from there (see <i>Oholot</i> 18:8).
A grave that was sealed: [If] he opened it, it does not import impurity in any of the surrounding area. [If] he broke open its boards, and went back and sealed it, it imparts impurity on its surrounding area. [If] he made a breach in it, one breach of four handbreadths, whether above or below, it only imparts impurity opposite the breach. [If] he had opened one aperture to the north, and opened another aperture to the south, the south purifies the north.

Chapter 17

One who plows a grave, behold, he must do (i.e., plow) one hundred cubits in each direction.  One who plows on top of a grave, and so too one who plows on top of a coffin, even if he submerged it with chains or with stones, and even on top of holes that were twice a man's height, behold, that creates a <i>beit haperas</i>. One who plows up body of a dead person does not create a <i>beit haperas</i>; rather one who only plows up the grave. And Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, even the mound. Said Rabbi Yosei, when do these words apply? With regards to one who descends, but regarding one who ascends, he does not create a <i>beit haperas</i>.
The "three vetches" that they spoke about (<i>Oholot</i> 17:1), are those that are placed there in their normal manner in a dry place, but not in a muddy place. And one who plows from a field full of scales (i.e., where refuse is deposited), or from a a sloping field, behold, he creates a <i>beit haperas</i>. The builder is pure and one who sows on top of it is pure. Rabbi Meir says, one who plows up the size of a large bone, behold, he creates a <i>beit haperas</i>.
Partners, and sharecroppers, and guardians [of orphans] do not create a <i>beit haperas</i>. One who plows inside his own [field] or inside that of his fellow: His [field] becomes a <i>beit haperas</i>, but that of his fellow does not become a <i>beit haperas</i>, but it ascends to the status of a <i>peras</i>.
The presumption is that [fields] in the Land of Israel are pure except for [those containing] heaps of stones. A field that they presumed to be a <i>beit haperas</i>: Even if it has an area [large enough to grow] four kors [of grain], even if it is adjacent to an impure place, and even if a pure field surrounds it on all sides, behold, it is presumed to possess the status of a <i>peras</i>.
Two fields of a <i>beit haperas</i>, this one on top of that one, and [the owners] had a partnership in rainwater: [If] there are are three handbreadths between the lower one and the upper one, both of them are impure. Rabbi Yosei says, even though there is no direct line between the entryway of the upper [field] and the upper house, it is pure.
A <i>beit haperas</i> that they purified: Behold, it is pure, but it must stand on the backs (i.e., the testimony) of two Torah scholars. Said Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages did not disagree about dirt that comes from a <i>beit haperas</i> that comes in with vegetables, that it is pure unless there is in one place [an amount of dirt] equivalent to the bulk of a packing-bag seal<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כחותם המרצופין</b> (Kulp tr.)</i>. About what did they disagree? About dirt that comes in from the land of the nations with vegetables, that Rabbi Eliezer says, it combines, and the Sages say, it does not combine unless there is in one place [an amount of dirt] equivalent to the bulk of the seal of a letter.
One who brings chests or ovens or basins or earthenware vessels from outside the Land into the Land before they have been fired -- they are impure on account of the laws regarding the "land of the nations," but they are pure on account of the laws regarding earthenware vessels. Once they have been fired, they are impure on account of the laws regarding earthenware vessels, but they are pure on account of the laws regarding the "land of the nations." Consequently it is said, "Whenever [vessels are deemed] impure on account of [being produced in] the lands of the nations, they are pure on account of being earthenware vessels, and whenever [vessels are deemed] impure on account of being earthenware vessels, they are [deemed] pure on account of [being produced in] the lands of the [Gentile] nations."
One who brings dirt from an impure place and piles it up in a pure place, or from a pure place and piles it up in an impure place, it is impure. [If] he piled it up on top of a rock, even in an [im]pure place, it is pure. One who applies whitewash to a <i>beit haperas</i> in an impure place is impure, and in a pure place is pure. Rabbi Shimon says, even the whitewash from a <i>beit haperas</i> from an impure place is pure, for [the Sages] only decreed concerning a clod of earth in its natural state. The dirt of a <i>beit haperas</i> that they smear a roof or an oven with is pure because it is nullified.
A <i>beit haperas</i> (i.e., a field in which a corpse is suspected to be buried), which a dung-heap higher than ten handbreadths was made, and he is able to move it, is pure. [If] its area was made barren, it is impure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel renders it pure. A <i>beit haperas</i> that they paved over with pavement or with stones that cannot be moved is pure. [If] their area was made barren, it is impure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel renders it pure. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, a <i>beit haperas</i> that they piled up with piles of stones that cannot be moved is impure. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, [if] they broke the ground [without finding a corpse], there is no better inspection than that. One who walks in a <i>beit haperas</i> lower than three fingerbreadths and removes dirt from there is pure.
One who walks in a <i>beit haperas</i>: He should not walk in another <i>beit haperas</i>, but if he did so walk, he is pure. [If] he harvested grapes in a <i>beit hapares</i>, he should not harvest grapes in another <i>beit hapares</i>, and if he did so harvest, he is impure. These are the words of Beit Hillel.
One who burns consecrated foods and terumah burns them in their place. Rabbi Yehuda says, he burns them outside the Land. And so too would Rabbi Yehuda say, [as to] a field in which a grave was dug up<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>שחפר בה קבר</b>; alt., <b>שאבד בה קבר</b> ("in which a grave was lost") (MS Vienna, GR"A)</i> they may not plant any planting, and they may not sow any seed, and they dig up [the earth] inside it for vegetables, and they may not let [any vegetables] remain inside of it, and they may sprinkle [the waters of purification] and immerse [inside of it]<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>מזין וטובלין</b> (GR"A)</i>, and they may not plant cucumbers or gourds inside of it, in order that a man's foot not become accustomed to going there.
A "field in which a grave has been lost," it is a "field of sepulchers"; a field of sepulchers is a field in which a grave has been lost. And what is a a field of sepulchers? Any that are dug into the earth it absorbs the sepulchers on their sides. He found a field that was marked (i.e., indicating boundaries of some impurity), and it is no longer known what the nature [of the impurity] was: If had has a tree in it, it is known that a grave was ploughed in it. [If] it does not have a tree in it, it is known that a grave was lost in it. Said Rabbi Yehuda, when do these words apply? At a time that there is an elder or a Torah scholar, for not every person is an expert in these matters. Rabbi Yosei says, there is a presumption that bones that have been covered up are those of a human, until it is known [with certainty] that they are from an animal. [If] they are exposed, behold, they are [presumed to be] from an animal, unless it is known [with certainty] that they are from a human. Beit Shammai agrees with Beit Hillel that [a <i>beit haperas</i>] is not checked for [one who intends to eat] terumah; rather, it is burned.

Chapter 18

There is a stringency with the land of the nations that there is not with a <i>beit haperas</i>, and with a <i>beit haperas</i> that there is not with the land of the nations: That with the land of the nations, virgin [soil] that has not been defiled, and then becomes defiled when one enters it, and it cannot be purified from its defilement, which is not the case with a <i>beit haperas</i>. The stringency with a <i>beit haperas</i> is that even if the four sides surrounding it are pure, behold, it still has the presumption of a <i>beit haperas</i>. The land of the nations: If one is able to enter it in a state of purity, it is pure. And how close must one be to be able to enter it in a state of purity? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, even one furrow, behold, that interrupts. Said Rabbi Shimon, I could feed priests foods prepared in purity in a tannery that is in Tzidon (i.e., north of the Land of Israel), or that is in the towns that are in Lebanon, because they are adjacent to the sea or to the river. They said to him, behold, the idols interrupt. § The presumption of the roads of those who come up from Babylonia: Even though they are absorbed within the land of the nations, they are pure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, up until a place that a person can turn to the right and the left without embarrassment. Towns that have been absorbed within the Land of Israel, such as Susita and its neighbors, [and] Ashkelon and its neighbors, even though they are exempt from tithes and from the [laws of] the sabbatical year, they are not considered [part of] the land of the nations.
One who enters the land of the nations in chest or in a cupboard is pure. In a coach, in a wagon, or in a boat, or on a raft, he is impure. One who inserts his head and the majority of his body into the land of the nations is impure. An earthenware vessel that entered the airspace of the land of the nations is impure. Benches and <i>cathedras</i> (a cushioned chair with a back) whose majority entered the land of the nations are impure.
Everyone can convert [an Israelite dwelling] into a "dwelling places of the nations," even a slave, even a maidservant, and even a eunuch, and even a minor of nine years and one day. <sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The following sentence ("An idolater...") follows the GR"A, as the printed text is corrupt.</i>An idolater that is married, and a Samaritan that is married, an idolater whose slaves are Samaritans, and a Samaritan whose slaves are idolaters, make a "dwelling place of the nations." Regarding "suspending" the laws of dwelling places of the nations (i.e., in connection with eating terumah and consecrated foods), Rabbi Yosei b'Rabbi Yehuda says, they only burn it. And how long must [a Gentile] stay in [a dwelling] in order that it requires inspection? Aba Yudan a man of Tzidon in the name of Rabbi Eliezer [says], forty days, even if he does not have a wife, and the halacha is according to his words. [If] this one was entering and that one was leaving, and [neither] remained there for forty days, it is pure, and if [one of them] remained there for forty days, it is impure with corpse-impurity.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">After forty days, a Gentile is suspected of having buried a dead fetus under the ground of a dwelling (Rambam).</i> A [Gentile] watchman: [If] he remains there for forty days [without leaving], it is impure. When he is one that [is permitted] to come and go, even though he remains there forty days, it is pure because he has the presumption of one who watches<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per the GR"A, since he has come and gone during those forty days, rendering his dwelling impermanent, the Israelite's residence is not conferred the status of a dwelling place of a Gentile</i>. Everyone is trusted to watch [the dwelling], and even a slave, and even a woman, and even a eunuch, and even a minor of nine years and one day.
Sewer-pipes that travel from the land of the nations into the Land of Israel: He makes two<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"two" is omitted in MS Vienna</i> grates for them and he reduces [their circumference] until it is less than a handbreadth.
How do they inspect a dwelling place of the nations (<i>Oholot</i> 18:8). An Israelite enters first, and afterwards a priest. Even if they found that [the dwelling place] was inlaid with alabaster or with mosaic (פספס) (see GR"A), it is impure.
A store is not subject to the laws of "dwelling places of the nations" (<i>Oholot</i> 18:10). Even if it was destroyed, behold, it is impure and is not [subject to the laws of] dwelling places of the nations.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "A store is not subject to the laws of "dwelling places of the nations" unless [a non-Jew] resides within it. A colonnade is not subject to the laws of "dwelling places of the nations unless [a non-Jew] resides within it. [Regarding] a dwelling-place of the nations, even if it was destroyed, etc." (MS Vienna, GR"A)</i> And a <i>beit haperas</i> outside the Land [of Israel], horse-mangers<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הריות</b> (GR"A)</i>, and workshops, and public baths, and a gate-house, and a reservoir, and the open spaces of the courtyard, the <i>marganin</i> (המרגנין), and the way stations, and the temporary huts (succot), the field-huts, and the tents, are not subject to the laws of dwelling places of the nations. Armories and wineries [of gentiles]: Rabbi Yehuda renders them impure and Rabbi Yosei renders them pure. A gate-house and the open spaces of the courtyard: At a time that they are intermingled with dwelling places of the nations, they are impure on account of the laws of dwelling places of the nations. And double-rows of colonnades: Even if they become intermingled with dwelling places of the nations, they are not subject to the laws of dwelling-places of the nations.
And what is the "east of Caesarea" (<i>Oholot</i> 18:9)? From opposite its <i>titraphlon</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">lit., "mansion-house," the name of a prominent building in Caesarea (Jastrow)</i>, until opposite its wine press. Yehuda the Baker testified about the northeast<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ספונו המזרחי</b>; alt., <b>םטיו המזרחי</b> ("the eastern colonnade") (MS Vienna)</i>, that it is [considered] pure, and the remainder of all of it is impure on account of [being part of] the land of the nations.
One who travels from Akko to Cheziv in our days: The road is [considered] pure on account of being [part of] the land of the nations, and it is liable in tithes and in [the laws of] the sabbatical year, unless it is known [with certainty] that it is exempt. From the left-hand side to the west of the road is impure on account of being the land of the nations, and exempt from tithes and from [the laws of] the sabbatical year, unless it is known [with certainty] that it is liable, until Cheziv. Rabbi Yishmael b'Rabbi Yosei says in the name of his father, until Laclabi<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Lablabo" (Jastrow)</i>.
Originally, they would say that the borders [of Ashkelon (MS Vienna)], from Kever HaGadol<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">lit., "the large grave"; per Zar Zahav, this is a place name</i> until the Negev, and until Tar'in, were impure. And the Sages voted on them (i.e., the borders), and rendered them pure. Rabbi Yehuda ben Yaakov from Beit Guvria, and Yaakov b'Rabbi Yitzchak from Beit Gufnin, testified about Caesarea, that [the Israelites] had always had it in their possession, but that the Sages permitted it, that it no longer be counted [as part of the Land of Israel<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., for purposes of tithing and impurity</i>]. Said Rabbi Chanin, that same year was the sabbatical year, and the idolaters went to their circuses, and they left the marketplace full of produce, and the Israelites came and plundered it. When [the idolaters] returned, they said, "Come, let us go to the Sages, lest they permit pigs to them." Said Rabbi Zerika, on the fifth day of the second Adar, twenty-four elders voted on it and they permitted it, for everyone was entering inside it.
It so happened with Rebbi and Rabbi Yishmael b'Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar (Bar Kappara), that they spent the Sabbath in the store of an idolater<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "the store of Pazi" (MS Vienna, Zar Zahav)</i> in Lod, and Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was sitting before them. They said to him, "Ashkelon, what is your (pl.) ruling about it?" He said to them, "They sell wheat in their <i>basilicas</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בסילקאות</b> ("building with colonnades for holding courts, also meeting place for merchants, exchange, forum") (Jastrow)</i>, and they join<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>וטופלין</b>; alt., <b>ותובלין ואוכלין</b> ("and they immerse themselves and eat") (GR"A)</i> their Pesach offerings in the evening." They said to him, "What is the ruling for one who traveled in it from the land of the nations?" He said to them, "Once he lingers in it forty days." They said to him, "In that case, come (pl.) and we will vote on it, whether to exempt it from tithes or not." Rabbi Yishmael b'Rabbi Yosei did not vote with them. When he removed [himself], he<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per the Yerushalmi (Yer. Yevamot VII:3.4), "he" is  Bar Kappara</i> said, "Rabbi, for what reason are you not voting with us?" He said to him, "Concerning one impurity that I [previously] rendered impure, I [have] rendered it pure. [But] not tithes. I am afraid of the Supreme Sanhedrin, lest they cut off my head!"
