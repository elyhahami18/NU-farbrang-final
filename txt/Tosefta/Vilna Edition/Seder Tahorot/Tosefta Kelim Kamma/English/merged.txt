Tosefta Kelim Kamma



Chapter 1

There is a stringency with a sheretz that there is not with a seminal emission, and with a seminal emission that there is not with a sheretz (see Niddah 43b:14). The stringency with a sheretz is that the impurity of a sheretz is not differentiated, but the impurity of a seminal emission is differentiated. The stringency with a seminal emission is that a seminal emission imparts impurity regardless of amount and the sheretz does not impart impurity unless it is the size of a lentil.
There is a stringency with a neveilah (i.e., an animal carcass) that there is not with the waters of purification, and [there is a stringency] with the waters of purification that there is not with a neveilah.  That a small quantity of the waters of purification is impure, and a small quantity of neveilah is pure. A stringency with neveilah is that the waters of purification purify that which is impure and contaminate that which is pure, but they do not join together impurities, which is not so with neveilah. [Moreover,] the waters of purification that dried out, behold, they are [permanently] pure, [but] a neveilah that dried out, if it is able to be soaked and thus able to return to its former status and join [with an object susceptible to impurity], behold, it is impure.
There is a stringency with corpse-impurity that there is not with a ba'al niddah (one who has intercourse with a menstruant), and [there is a stringency] with a ba'al niddah that there is not with corpse-impurity. That [one contaminated by] corpse-impurity requires sprinkling on the third day and the seventh day, which is not the case with a ba'al niddah. The stringency with a ba'al niddah is that a ba'al niddah defiles the bottom [bedding] just as the top bedding, which is not the case with corpse-impurity. Rabbi Yosei says, the emission of a zav, his spit, his semen, and his urine, [and the blood of a menstruant (per GR"A)], and a revi'it of blood of a corpse [also defile both the top and bottom bedding]. Why did they say a "revi'it"? Because anyone who crosses the threshold of creation has [at least] a revi'it of blood. And regarding the blood of a menstruant and [contamination with] riding-uncleanliness (Lev. 15:9), there is a stringency with [a menstruant] that there is not with riding-uncleanliness, and with riding-uncleanliness that there is not with [a menstruant]. That [a menstruant] is equivalent to one who renders a person impure or clothing impure by contact or by carrying, which is not the case with riding-uncleanliness (Kel. 1:3). The stringency with riding-uncleanliness is that one who possesses riding-uncleanliness can impart impurity [even] under a heavy stone, which is not the case with [a menstruant].
There is a stringency with an olive's bulk from a corpse, which is that an olive's bulk from a corpse, an opening of a handbreadth [is enough to prevent the spreading of impurity], whereas [an entire] corpse [requires] an opening of four handbreadths [to prevent the spread of impurity] (see Oholot 3:6).  Rabbi Natan says, one who possesses corpse-impurity can impart second-degree impurity, and can disqualify [terumah] at an additional degree (i.e., third-degree impurity, see Toh. 2:8).
As to three things Syria (i.e., the border areas to the north-east of Israel) is equivalent to the Land of Israel, and as to three things [it is equivalent to] foreign lands. [As to the latter,] its earth imparts impurity like that of foreign lands; and one who brings a <i>get</i> (a bill of divorce) from Syria is like one who brings it from a foreign land; and one who sells his slave to [a resident of] Syria is like one who sells it [a resident of] a foreign land. The three things [that are equivalent] to the Land of Israel: That one who buys a field in Syria is like one buys a field in the outskirts of Jerusalem; and one is liable in tithes and in the Sabbatical year; and if one is able to enter it in a state of purity, they [maintain their] purity.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Per the GR"A, the Sages held that, unlike the earth, the air in Syria did not impart impurity as did the air in foreign lands.</i>
They may enter [the area] between Ulam<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>אולם</b>, the hall leading to the Temple interior (Jastrow)</i> and the Altar without having washed their hands and feet, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, they may not enter. Said Rabbi Shimon the Humble before Rabbi Eliezer, "I myself entered [the area] between the Ulam and the Altar without having washed my hands and feet." He said to him, "Who is [God's] beloved, you or the High Priest?" He was quiet. He said to him, "You are ashamed to say that [even] the High Priest's dog is [more] beloved than you." He said to him, "Rabbi, [it is as] you said." He said to him, "They even crack open the head of the High Priest with logs [should he enter the Ulam without washing]. What will you do so the Head of the Temple Guard (בעל הפול) doesn't find you?" Rabbi Yosei says, in the same way that everyone stays away from [the area] between the Ulam and the Altar at the time of the incense [ceremony], so too they stay away at the time of the presentation of the blood of the bull of the anointed Priest [in atonement for] an inadvertent communal sin, and the goats of [an inadvertent communal act of] idolatry, and the blood of the [sacrificial goat of] Yom Kippur. And [even] higher [in holiness than the area] between the Ulam and the Altar [is the area] between the Altar and the Holy. For whereas between the Ulam and the Altar, they may enter [both] to [perform the Temple] service and not to [perform the Temple] service, [between the Altar and] the Holy, they do not enter except to [perform] the service.
Abba Shaul says, the upper chamber of the Holy of Holies is more stringent than the Holy of Holies [itself], for [with regards to] the Holy of Holies, the High Priest enters into it each and every year for the Yom Kippur service, four times on [that] day, and if he enters a fifth time he is liable for the death penalty, but [with regards to] the upper chamber of the Holy of Holies, they may not enter it but once in seven years (following the GR"A), to determine what is needed. They said to him, "That does not make it of higher [sanctity]." [If] lepers entered within the wall [of Jerusalem], they are administered forty [lashes]. Zavim and zavot, menstruants, and women after childbirth, [who enter] the Temple Mount are administered eighty [lashes] (Kelim 1:8). One who is impure may enter the Temple Mount, but not one with corpse-impurity. [But] the Sages say, rather, <i>even</i> a corpse itself [may enter the Temple Mount], as it is said (Ex. 13:19), "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him." "With him" -- into the Camp of the Levites (the functional equivalent of the Temple Mount in the desert). Rabbi Shimon says, [with respect to] the Rampart and the Women's Courtyard in the Temple (lit., "the Eternal House"), the impure people who entered there were exempt.
The entire Temple Courtyard is suitable for eating from the most holy offerings, and for conducting sacrifices of lesser sanctity. But [as to] one who slaughters <i>chullin</i> within it -- it is forbidden to benefit from [that slaughter]. And [the equivalent of the Temple Courtyard] was the courtyard [surrounding the] Tent of Meeting that they had in the desert, from the hangings [separating the courtyard from the Tent of Meeting, see Ex. 38:9] and inward. All impure people that entered from the Gate of Nicanor and inward -- even those who have not [yet brought an] atonement [offering to complete their purification] -- behold, they are liable for excision [if they entered] intentionally, and for [bringing] a sin offering [if they entered] inadvertently, and needless to say, a tevul yom<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., one who has immersed himself but will remain impure until sunset</i> and all the rest of the impure people that entered within the partitions, behold they are subject to a warning, [but] if they entered into the Holy, behold they are liable. Rabbi Yehuda says, if they [presented themselves] before the Holy, [they are liable] for the death penalty, and the remainder of the Temple<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"הבית" not "המת" ("the dead"), see MS Vienna)</i> are subject to a warning.
All may enter to build, or to repair, or to remove any impurity. [Where there is] a commandment [that it is incumbent upon] Priests [to perform], [if] there are no Priests, Levites may enter [to perform it], [and if] there are no Levites, Israelites may enter [to perform it]. [Where there is] a commandment [that it is incumbent upon] those in a state of purity [to perform], [if] there is no one in a state of purity, impure people may enter [to perform it]. [Where there is] a commandment [that it is incumbent upon] those without a blemish [to perform], [if] there is no one without a blemish, those with a blemish may enter [to perform it]. [Where there is] a commandment [that requires one to enter Holy portions of the Temple] inside crates [so as not to gaze at the Holy, see Middot 4:5], if there are no crates, they may enter [by walking] through the doorway, and thus it says (2 Chron. 29:16): "And the Priests entered the House of the Lord to purify it, and they took out all the impure things, [etc.]." Rabbi Yehuda says, the storage areas that are under the Heichal possess no sanctity, but the roof<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>ובגגו</b> not <b>ובגנו</b> ("but the garden")</i> of the Heichal does possess sanctity, [and] they do not eat holy offerings there, and they do not conduct sacrifices of lesser sanctity [there], but impure people that enter there, behold, they are exempt.
And just as when they were in the desert, there were three camps -- the Camp of the Divine Presence (<i>Shekhinah</i>), the Camp of the Levites, and the Camp of Israel, so too it was in Jerusalem: From the entrance of Jerusalem until the entrance of the Temple Mount was the Camp of Israel. From the entrance of the Temple Mount until the Gates of Nicanor was the Camp of the Levites. From the Gates of Nicanor and within was the Camp of the Divine Presence, and this was [the area within] the hangings that was in the desert. But at the time that they journeyed<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">"וּבִשְׁעַת מַסָּעוֹת" (see Bam. Rabbah 7:8)</i> [that area] did not have any sanctity [as God's presence arose from the Ark as it traveled], and the people did not incur liability on account of impurity. (And how much is required to promote healing? We look at it as if it was the branch of a fig tree that was broken off, but was still attached by a little bark. If it could [continue] living from that [little bark], it is impure, and if not, it is pure.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Note: Per the commentators, the section "And how...it is pure" is misplaced. It appears to correspond to Oktzin 3:8.</i>
Rabbi Menachem son of Rabbi Yosei says, cities surrounded by a wall are more holy than the Land of Israel because lepers  are sent out from inside of them, and their houses are [sold in] perpetuity<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>צמות</b> (see Zar Zahav here)</i> inside of them after twelve months, and a corpse may be carried around inside of them as long as they desire, [but once] it is taken outside [the walls], they cannot bring it back in. And thus it says (2 Chron. 26:23), "And Uzziah was laid to rest with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers, in the burial field of the kings, for they said, 'He is a leper.' And Yotam his son ruled in his place." [Returning to the theme of the previous section,] Rabbi Shimon says, just as there are no [zavim], zavot, menstruant, or women after childbirth that may enter the Temple Mount, so too that which they lie on and that which they sit on [may also not enter the Temple Mount].

Chapter 2

Vessels made of sodium carbonate (soda ash): Beit Shammai say, they impart impurity from their insides and from their cavity (the space inside the vessel), like earthenware vessels, and on their outsides are like a vessel that only requires rinsing [to regain the status of purity]. And Beit Hillel say, soda ash vessels, behold, they are like earthenware vessels in every respect. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says a different version: Beit Shammai say, they impart impurity like a half-vessel and [also] impart impurity like a complete vessel, and Beit Hillel say, soda ash vessels, behold, they are like earthenware vessels in every respect.  [Vessels<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., small intact earthenware vessels, or the bottoms and sides of larger but broken earthenware vessels (Kel. 2:2)</i> that can stand unsupported [are susceptible to impurity if they can hold] enough [liquid] to anoint the little finger of a child, up until a [vessel that originally could hold] a <i>log</i>; a <i>log</i> and anything smaller than that<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>כלמטה הימנו</b> (GR"A, Zar Zahav); in other words, "up to and including a <i>log</i>"</i>. [As to vessels that originally had a capacity of] one seah up until two seahs, [they are susceptible to impurity if they presently can hold] half of a <i>log</i>; two seahs and anything smaller than that. From two seahs up until three and up until five seahs, [if they presently can hold] one <i>log</i>; five [seahs] and anything smaller than that. Rabbi Akiva says, from [broken vessels the size of] Bethlehemite jars up until large stone jars, [if they presently can hold] a <i>log</i> (Kel. 2:2), [and] from that [size] and upwards, a <i>log</i>. [However,] these words were forgotten, and they are no longer spoken. And Rabbi Nehemiah and Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov [say], large stone jars, two <i>logs</i>. [Broken] Galilean flasks and small Judean flasks have bottoms but do not have sides. The culverts and roof-tiles in which a receptacle for [channeling] water or small stones was fashioned are impure. <i>Login</i> (i.e., flasks with the capacity of a <i>log</i>) that burst are pure; those which are sealed, behold, are impure. A chair and a bench and all [vessels otherwise susceptible to] midras-impurity are pure if made from earthenware. Rabbi Yosei says, even a boat and a [clay] bottle-stopper made by potters. Rabbi Nehemiah says, reverse the matters. A metal funnel: Whether it belongs to homeowners or spice-peddlers<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>רוכלין</b> not <b>דבלין</b> (GR"A)</i>, it is impure. And those made of wood or bone or glass: Of homeowners, it is pure, and of spice-peddlers, it is impure, because it is oversized, the words of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira. And Rabbi Akiva says, because he leans it on its side and the buyer smells [the spices] with it (Kel. 2:4). The covers of wine jugs or oil jugs, and the covers of papyrus jars (Kel. 2:5) that are used casually and then discarded are pure, and if one modified them to be able to use [on a permanent basis], they are impure. The cover of a stewpot: Whenever it is perforated or has a pointed knob, it is pure; [if] it is not perforated and does not have a pointed knob, it is impure, because she strains vegetables inside of it. Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Tzadok says, because she turns the contents of the pot over on it. This is the general rule: Anyone who makes use of a curved earthenware vessel is pure.
A damaged jar that had cracked in a furnace (cf. Kel. 2:6), how is it measured? If its shards are flat and its insides are red (i.e., the clay had been fired sufficiently to redden), it can be assumed that it broke before the work required [to render it a finished vessel] was completed. A wooden spice box made with many compartments and without a frame is impure. [If] one of them [came in contact] with liquid, it is impure and its fellow is impure (alt., "pure" (GR"A)), and with a <i>sheretz</i>, all of them are impure. [If] liquids fell on top of its wider side, Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, they divide its thickness (Kel. 2:7): That [side] which serves the impure [compartment] is impure, and and that which serves the pure [compartment] is pure. [If] the liquids fell on top of its outer edge, it is judged according to [the status of] its outer sides. [If] it was affixed with a nail, it becomes joined with its impurity and to its sprinkling.  [If the nail] was driven into it, it becomes joined with its impurity but it does not become joined with its sprinkling. [If] it was removed and [then] replaced, it is neither joined with its impurity nor with its sprinkling.
The lattice [cover] of a stone water cooler (<i>tzartzur</i>): Rabbi Eliezer says it cannot impart impurity through its airspace, and the Sages say, it does impart impurity through its airspace. If it was [able to be] used for this and for that, such as for a <i>kavkav</i> (an arched round vessel), and for a stewpot, and for a cooking pot, they impose upon it the stringencies [both] for receiving [impurity] and for causing impurity to issue forth upon others. [For example, it may receive impurity if it has a hole] large enough for water to seep through, but it itself is only pure [when it has a hole] through which olives can fall. Wineskins: Their minimum size [for being susceptible to impurity is an opening large enough] for liquids [to pass through], and Rabbi Shimon says, for seedlings. A damaged jar (<i>gis'terah</i>): Its minimum size is for liquids [to pass through, and a <i>petikah</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>פתיקה</b> not <b>עתיקה</b> ("ancient"); a <i>petikah</i> is a the name of a vessel that is used for pouring water, which was split in two (see Zar Zahav)</i>, behold, that is pure. A Galilean oil cruse that they use to transport oil to a bathhouse, and a stone water cooler and a wooden bowl: Before they are fired they are pure. An earthenware shard that became separated from a jar or from a cooking pot: If it can hold [liquid] of the minimum amount, it is impure, and if not, it is pure. [If] it was punctured and they covered it with pitch, it [remains] pure, for an earthenware vessel that is pure for [even] one hour will never again become impure.

Chapter 4



An oven that they fired in order to roast in it is impure. In order to keep bundles of wet flax in it is pure, for one does not perform work of the body with it. An oven that they fired before its manufacture was completed: Rabbi Yehuda says it is pure. Said Rabbi Yehuda, this was the incident that occurred with the ovens of K'far Signa (Kel. 5:4), and Rabban Gamaliel had declared them impure, and the Sages declared them pure.  For what reason is the "additional piece of a baker's oven impure" (Kel. 5:5)? Because he leans the spit on it, and Rabbi Yehuda says, because  he hangs a kettle<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>יורה</b> (GR"A)</i> on the spit and places it on it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Yochanan HaSandlar, the additional piece of an oven is a handbreadth. The additional piece of a kettle for seething olives is two handbreadths, and it does not impart impurity through airspace; rather, only opposite the additional piece. And from what time is it capable of imparting impurity? From the time that he begins to seethe [olives] with it.





An oven: From what point does it become  become susceptible to impurity? When it is heated sufficiently to bake sponge cakes in it (Kel. 5:1), and Rabbi Simeon declares it susceptible to impurity immediately. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Sheila: If they plastered it in purity and it [subsequently] becomes impure, from what time does it become pure? Rabbi Halafta of Kefar Hanania said: I asked Rabbi Simeon ben Hanania, who asked the son of Rabbi Hanania ben Teradion, who said: From the time one removes it from its place. His daughter [however] says: From when one removes its coating (literally, "strips off its garment"). When these words were reported to Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, he said: His daughter spoke better than his son!<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>יפה אמרה בתו מבנו</b> (see MS Vienna and GR"A)</i>

Chapter 5



Chapter 6









A blacksmith's furnace that stands on the earth, and he joined [its parts] with plaster in order to be able to place a cooking-pot on it: It is impure, but only that which serves its purpose is impure. A portable stove that is placed over the upper aperture [of the furnace], even though he places a cooking-pot on it, it is pure. [If] he fashioned pegs for it [to support the pot], it is impure. A large baking oven, behold, it is pure, for it is only made to service the ground. Rabbi Meir says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel, if it has a vertical rim, it is impure. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel, if it has a horizontal rim. Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel, if it has any rims whatsoever (either vertical or horizontal),  and they are all considered the same [for purposes of impurity].
