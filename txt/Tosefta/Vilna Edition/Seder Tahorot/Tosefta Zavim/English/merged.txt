Tosefta Zavim



Chapter 1

One who sees one issue of zov (i.e., an unnatural flow or discharge, discussed in Lev. 15:1-15)): Beit Shammai say that he is like [a menstruant] who observes a day for a day<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge (see Niddah 4:7)</i>. And Beit Hillel say that he is like a ba'al keri (i.e., one experiences a seminal discharge). Both sides concede that he may immerse and eat his Pesach offering in the evening. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai, "Do you not concede that he may immerse and eat his Pesach offering in the evening [like a ba'al keri]? Beit Shammai said to them, "Do you not concede that if he sees [an issue of zov] the next day, that he is impure? Behold, he is therefore like [a menstruant] who observes a day for a day, who would be [deemed] impure if she saw [blood] the next day." One who moves [the discharge] seen [by the zav]: Beit Shammai say, [his purity status] is contingent, [and] Beit Hillel say, he is pure. His beddings and his seats: Beit Shammai say, [their purity status] is contingent, and Beit Hillel say, they are pure. [If] he saw two issues, the one who moved both of them is impure, according to the words of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say, the one who moved the first one is pure, and the second one is impure. His beddings and his seats: Whether [he sat or lay on them prior to] the first or the second sighting, Beit Shammai render them impure, and Beit Hillel render them pure. [If] one sighting is of as great a quantity as two [normal sightings], the one who moved all of it is impure, the words of Beit Shammai, and Beit Hillel says, only the one who moved the last drop is impure. Said Rabbi Akiva, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about one who [on the first day] saw two, or one that was of as great a quantity as two, and then it stopped on the second day (i.e., he had no sighting of zov), and on the third day he saw one, [for both agree] that he is a full-fledged zav. About what did they disagree? About one who sees one [issue of zov] on the first day, and on the second day it stopped, and on the third day he saw two [issues of zov], [as to which] Beit Shammai say that he is a full-fledged zav, and Beit Hillel render his bedding and seating impure, and he requires immersion in living waters, and he is exempt from [bringing] an offering. 
When Rabbi Akiva was arranging the oral tradition (halachot) for his pupils, he said, "Anyone who heard the reasoning behind [a certain halacha] from his colleague, let him come forward and recite it." Rabbi Shimon said before him in the name of Rabbi Elazar bar Yehuda of Bartuta, "Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about one who saw one [issue of zov] on the first day, and on the second day it stopped, and on the third day he saw two, that he is not a full-fledged zav. About what did they disagree? About one who sees two, or one of as great a quantity as two [on the first day], and on the second day it stopped, and on the third day he saw one." He said to him, "Not everyone who jumps up is worthy; rather, only one who gives the <i>reasoning</i>." Rabbi Shimon [then] said before him, "Thus said Beit Hillel to Beit Shammai: 'What is the ruling when one sees two [issues of zov] at the beginning, and one at the end?' They said to them, 'When one sees one in the beginning and two at the end, his day of purity is nullified by the sighting, and he [now] has two sightings in hand. When one sees two in the beginning and one at the end, since seven days are joined in the count, the sighting nullifies his day of purity, and he [now] has three sightings in hand.'" Rabbi Akiva [then] went back and began teaching according to the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Elazar bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer Chisma before Rebbi: "Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about one who sees one [issue of zov] on the first day, and one on the second day, and it stopped on the third day, and on the fourth day he had one sighting, or about one who sees two or one of as great a quantity as two [on the first day], and on the second day it stopped, and on the third day and the fourth day he saw two, that he is not a full-fledged zav. About what did they disagree? About one who sees two, or one of as great a quantity as two [on the first day], and on the second day it stopped, and on the third day and the fourth day he saw one." Said one pupil from among the pupils of Rabbi Yishmael before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, "Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about one who sees a seminal emission on the second day, that it undoes that which preceded it; or about one who saw it on the fourth day, that it does not undo [the sightings] of the previous [days] -- rather, [it only undoes the sightings] on that day. About what did they disagree? About one who sees [a seminal emission] on the third day."
All seminal emissions that defile priests undo [previous sightings] in a zav. A zav is permitted to engage in sexual relations on the days that he is full-fledged, and [the seminal emission] only undoes [any zov experienced] on that day. How so? [If] he had a sighting on the evening of the eighth day, he counts from the beginning and he brings one offering. [If] he had a sighting on the eighth day [itself], he counts from the beginning and brings two offerings.
How much time is required in order to immerse and dry off [for purposes of purification]? As much time as it takes to to see [the emission] and to immerse and to ascend and to dry off. And how much is the measurement for a sighting of a great quantity? As much as the time [it takes to walk] from Gadyon to Shiloh (Sanh. 63b:10).  Rabbi Shimon says, as much time as it takes to walk around the Holy Temple from the inside. They related a parable: To what is this matter similar? To a rope of one hundred cubits. How so? [If] he saw [an issue of zov] at the beginning of the hundred and at the end of fifty or the end of the hundred (comparable to the first and second or first and third days), or at the beginning of the hundred and the end of the hundred (comparable to the first and third days), this is not a full-fledged zav. [If] he had stopped and sees [an issue of zov], all the more so, his impurity is upon him.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, "[If] he saw [an issue of zov] at the beginning of the hundred, and at the end of fifty, and at the end of the hundred, behold, this is a full-fledged zav. [If] he saw [it] at the beginning of the hundred and within fifty and within a hundred, or at the beginning of the hundred and after fifty and after a hundred, this is not a full-fledged zav. [If] the interruption was longer: All the more so, his impurity is upon him." (GR"A.)</i> This is the general rule: Whenever [the issue of zov] is of a great quantity, all the more so, his impurity is upon him. How so? He saw three sightings: If there was less time between the first and third for him to have immersed and dried off, he only has one [issue] in hand. [If] he saw one of as great a quantity as two: [If] from the beginning to the end, there is enough time for him to have immersed and dried off, he has two sightings in hand, and if not, he only has one sighting. And Rabbi Yosei says, he only has one sighting in hand [regardless]. And Rabbi Yosei concedes that if he saw one [issue] at twilight, even though there is not enough time [between that sighting and the sighting before twilight] to have immersed and dried off, he has two sightings in hand, because two [separate] days divide it. And so too would Rabbi Yosei say, [if] he saw one [issue] at twilight, he is of doubtful status for [purposes of] impurity, and he is exempt from [bringing] an offering, [but] two at twilight, he is of doubtful status for [both] impurity and an offering. One certain [sighting] (i.e., when it was certainly the previous day) and [then] two at twilight, or two certain, he is of certain status for impurity, and doubtful status as to an offering. Two [certain] and [then] one at twilight, or two at twilight and [then] one certain, he is of certain status as to impurity and certain as to [the bringing of] an offering.

Chapter 2

Idolaters and converts and resident aliens do not defile [an Israelite] through ziva, and even though they do not defile through ziva, they are impure like zavs in every respect. And [Israelites] must burn [impure] terumah on their account, and they do not render them liable for [causing] impurity to the Holy Temple and consecrated foods. A tumtum and an androgynous that saw [an emission of zov]: Whether it is a white or red [emission], they do not burn terumah on their account, and they do not render them liable for [causing] impurity to the Holy Temple and consecrated foods. [If] they saw a white and red [emission] at the same time, they burn terumah on their account, and they do not render them liable for [causing] impurity to the Holy Temple and consecrated foods. One who touches the white or red [emission] and enters the Holy Temple is exempt. He himself that touched the white or red and entered the Holy Temple is exempt. [If] he was counting [days until purification after experiencing] a white [emission] and he saw red, or red and he saw white, behold, that one does not undo [the previous sighting].
And what is the difference between a zov and an emission of seed? Zov comes from "dead flesh" (i.e., a flaccid penis, see Niddah 35b:5, Steinsaltz tr.), and an emission of seed comes from "live flesh" (i.e., an erect penis). Zov is runny, and similar to the white of an unfertilized egg.  And an emission of seed is viscous, and is similar in appearance to the white of an egg that is not unfertilized. An emission of seed is reddish and the woman may attribute [a bloodstain on her clothes] to it (see Niddah 8:2).
A zav attributes it to food and to any food. Rabbi Eliezer ben Pinchas says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteirah, milk and cheese and beef, oil and aged wine, pounded beans and eggs, fish pickling liquid, are [all] customary for the flow of the ziva [to be attributed]. [With respect to] a [flow in a] baby, they attribute it to five things -- to food, to drink, to carrying, and to jumping in his sickness and in his mother['s sickness]. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, just as they attribute [a zov] to a seminal emission during the past twenty-four hours, so too [do they attribute it] to a look and to a thought in the last twenty-four hours. But to food, and to drink, to carrying, and to jumping, they attribute [the zov] to all these things when they give him pain.
An idolater who saw a seminal emission and converted immediately [thereafter] defiles through ziva. In what case does this apply? When he converts [already] circumcised, but if he gets circumcised and afterwards [saw an emission], [the count] is suspended for him during the time that he is in pain, whether his is an idolater or an Israelite.
One who finds a corpse lying lengthwise across the path: For a nazir and one who is observing Passover (i.e., bringing his lamb to the Temple), it is [treated as] pure, and for one [eats] terumah, it is impure. In what case does this apply? When there is no room to pass around [the corpse], but if there is room to pass around [the corpse], it is even [treated as] pure for one who [eats] terumah. In what case does this apply? With regards to one is traveling by foot, but if he was carrying a burden or riding an animal, he is impure, for as to one who is traveling by foot, it is possible for him to avoid touching or creating a tent [by standing] over or moving [the corpse]. And if it is impossible for him not to touch or to create a tent over or move [the corpse], he is impure, but [if he does so] with his elbow, he is pure. In what case does this apply? In regards to the impurity of "impurity of the depths," but in regards to known impurity, he is impure. What is "impurity of the depths"? One that no one knows [the whereabouts of a corpse] until the end of the world, but if someone knows about it before the end of the world, that is not [considered] impurity of the depths. If he found it in straw or in dirt or in pebbles, behold, that is impurity of the depths. But one who is buried in water or in a dark place or if the cleft between [two] rocks, that is not a grave of the depths; rather it is only [considered to possess the typical impurity] of a corpse.  

Chapter 3

There is a stringency with a zav that there is not with a zavah, and with a zavah that there is not with a zav: That the zav requires immersion in living water, and the zavah does not require immersion in living water. The zav is defiled by an unnatural discharge for one day, and a zavah for ten days. A zav who sees three sightings in three days is [always] defiled by them, [while] there are times that a zavah can sees three sightings and is not defiled by them. As to a zav, his days do not stand before him, which is not the case with a zavah. A zav  joins to his counting of seven days with two sightings, which is not the case with a zavah.  The stringency with the zavah is that the zavah defiles her bedding and her seat with a sighting of any amount, she defiles her sexual partner, and she defiles from one 24-hour period to the next 24-hour period, and she defiles inside and outside equally, and she defiles rapists, and she defiles with red discharge, none of which is the case with a zav.
There is a stringency with a zav that there is not with one with corpse-impurity, and with one with corpse-impurity that there is not with a zav: That the zav makes his bedding and his seat [impure] from below him to render a person impure and to render clothing impure, and from above him [he imparts] madaf-impurity to defile foods and liquids. His unnatural discharge and his spit and and his urine defile with impurity of high stringency, and they defile foods and liquids and vessels requiring rinsing by touch and earthenware vessels by moving, and he is liable for an offering and he requires immersion in living water, which is not the case with one with corpse-impurity. The stringency of one with corpse-impurity is that one with corpse-impurity requires sprinkling on the third and seventh days, which is not the case with a zav.
There is a stringency with a zav that there is not with a leper and with a leper that there is not with a zav: A zav requires immersion with living water, which is not the case with a leper. The stringency with a leper is that the leper defiles one who enters [his house] and requires sprinkling, which is not the case with a zav. There is a stringency with a zavah that there is not with a leper, and with a female leper that there is not with a zavah: That the zavah defiles her sexual partner, which is not the case with a female leper. The stringency with the female leper is that the female leper defiles one who enters [her house] and requires sprinkling with living water, which is not the case with a zavah.

Chapter 4

The impure who strikes the pure (Zavim 3:3), and the pure who strikes the impure, the clothing of the pure are defiled, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, [as to] the pure who strikes the impure, the clothing of the pure are pure. The impure who strikes the pure, [he is impure,] for if the pure one drew back, the impure one would fall, [and] the clothing of the pure are defiled. Rabbi Shimon says, if he struck him with a blow, he is impure; if he knuckled him, he is pure. Rabbi Yehuda says, a <i>tetraki</i>, the two ends of which reach to the ground, and the central part rocks (i.e., is unsupported), and an impure person and a pure person sit on it, the clothes of the pure one are pure, and the Sages say, [he is not unclean] unless one was opening and one was closing, or unless the pure one lifts the impure [out of a pit], and Rabbi Shimon renders him pure. And Rabbi Shimon concedes that with two who were grinding with a hand-millstone or with a donkey-millstone or who were loading [a package onto their donkey] when the package was heavy: The clothes of the pure are pure. 
The tzitzit of an impure person on a pure person -- pure. The tzitzit of a pure person on top of an impure person -- if the impure person stood still, it is pure, and if the pure person stood still, it is impure. The tzitzit of an impure person on top of the tzitzit of a pure person: If the pure person stood still, it is impure. The tzitzit of a pure person on top of the tzitzit of an impure person: Whether the impure person stood still or whether the pure person stood still, it is pure.
Three things Rabbi Eliezer Chisma renders impure and Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages render pure. A menstruant who sat with a pure woman on a bed: Her head covering, Rabbi Eliezer Chisma renders impure and Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages render pure. She carried a kneading trough full of clothes at a time when she had a heavy load: Rabbi Eliezer Chisma renders her impure and Rabbi Yehoshua and the Sages render her pure.
A zav who lay across five chairs widthwise: All of them are pure because not a single one of them supports most of him, but if the middle one was higher [than the rest], it is impure because it supports most of him. And Rabbi Shimon concedes that if he sat on a bed-frame and there were four cloaks under two legs of the bed-frame, they are impure. And so too with an animal: [If the cloaks were] under two forelegs and a hind leg, or under one foreleg and two hind legs, [they are impure].
A zav who struck a frail tree and a spout of fluids fell from it, or leaves with drops of moisture [on them], they are impure. [If] he struck the top of an oven and a loaf of terumah fell from it, it is pure, and if earthenware was stuck in it, it is impure. On a chest or on a box or a tower: Even though they are not of the requisite measure [for impurity], they are impure. And Rabbi Nehemiah and Rabbi Shimon render it pure as to the tree, but if they moved [on account of his striking], they are impure. This is the general rule: Whatever from his power (i.e., of the zav's strike) moved is impure, and [whatever] from his power [only] trembled is pure.
A zav on the cup of a balance, and lays down or sits on the second cup: [If] the zav put the knee of the balance down, they defile two [degrees] and render unfit in one [degree]. If they were outweighing the zav, they defile one and render unfit one. A zav on the cup of a balance and foods or drinks on the opposite side, and even if they were only slightly above the ground, we give them the stringencies of that which carries and the stringencies of that which is carried.
[If] he sat on top of a <i>catedra</i>, vessels that are on the curved part are impure; on the vice of a press, at a time that it is laden with stones, the vessels that are under it are pure, [and] at a time that he returns with vessels, the vessels that are under it are pure, and Rabbi Nehemiah renders them impure.

Chapter 5

There is a stringency in the Torah on the foods and liquids and madaf that is on zavim; on foods and liquids and madaf that are under the zav; on the bedding and the seat that is under the zav; from a person that is under a zav; on a person, whether under or over the zav; from bedding or a seat that is over the zav.
If most of something that is impure is on top of something that is pure, or on part of it, whether it is the zav [himself], or whether it is the bedding, it is impure. Part of the impure on the pure, or on part of it, whether it is the zav, or whether it is the bedding, it is impure. Part of he pure on the impure, or on part of it, if it is the zav, it is impure, and if it is the bedding, it is pure. Rabbi Shimon says, if part of the pure is on the impure, then even as to a zav, it is pure.
And these are the "connectors" (Zavim 5:4): Their teeth, their fingernails, and their hair. And these are the "parts of them" (ibid.): The tips of the fingers of the hands and feet. His phlegm, his mucus, his slaver, and his nasal flow, behold, they are all like his spit. The tears of his eyes, and the blood from his wound, and the milk in regards to a woman, and the blood that comes out of his mouth or from the tip of his finger defiles with the impurity of liquids. His unnatural discharge and his spit and his urine defile with impurity of greatest stringency. Sweat, rotten secretions, and excrement are pure. His seminal emission: Rabbi Eliezer says that it defiles by carrying and Rabbi Yehoshua says it does not defile by carrying, for it is impossible to have a seminal emission without urine.
Vessels that touch a zav or a zavah or a menstruant or a woman who recently gave birth or a leper or bedding or a seat defile two [degrees] and render unfit one [degree] of the one who touches, carries, or moves; but not on account of that which [touches them] in the act of carrying. With regards to the issue of a zav, or his spit, or his seminal emission, or his urine, or the blood of a menstruant, they defile two [degrees] and render unfit one [degree]. And as that which touches them on account of being carried, they do not defile, for there is no such thing as something that does not have in it the breath of life that defiles by movement; rather, only something that has in it the breath of life.
One who touches the wool of a [sheep] carcass or the strands emerging from [the surface of an object used by a zav for] riding, or the waters of purifications that are less than an olive's bulk defile two [degrees] and render unfit one [degree], for it is impossible to touch it without moving it. [If] he separates from the [source of impurity], he defiles one [degree] and renders unfit one [degree]. As to one [who touches one] who has intercourse with a menstruant, or one who engages in idol worship, he defiles one [degree] and renders unfit one [degree].
Idol worship is like a sheretz, and the things that pertain to [the idol] are like a sheretz, as it is said: "You are to consider [carved images] abominable (<i>sheketz</i>), yes, abominable" (Deut. 7:26, Fox tr.; see Lev. 11:43). Rabbi Akiva says, [idol worship] is like a menstruant, as it is said (Is. 30:22:): "You shall cast them out like a menstruant. 'Out!' you will say to them." Just as a menstruant defiles by carrying, so too idol worship defiles by carrying.
One who causes his head and most of his body to enter into a house of idolatry is impure. An earthenware vessel whose airspace enters into a house of idolatry is impure. Benches and <i>cathedras</i> (a soft chair with a back), most of which are brought into a house of idolatry, are impure.
Wine that an idolater used for his libation: If there is at least an olive's bulk in it, its impurity is stringent, and if not, its only impurity is the [typical] impurity of liquids.
One who eats from the carcass of a clean fowl, from the bones, or from the sinews, or from a clutch of eggs, from the blood or the meat of a living animal is pure. From the ovary of its eggs, from the craw, or from the the intestines, or [if] he melted the heart (alt., the "fat" (Beitzah 7a:9)) and swallowed it, he is impure. [If] he wrapped it up (<i>karcha</i>) in lettuce and swallowed it, it is impure. [If he wrapped it] in bast (cf. Pes. 115b:6) and swallowed it, he is pure. [If] he vomited it and it stayed in the place of swallowing (i.e., the throat), it defiles one [degree] and renders unfit [one degree]. [If] he vomited it and went back and swallowed it again, and it stayed in the place of swallowing, he defiles one [degree] and renders unfit [one degree]. [If] he swallowed it and it did not have at least an olive's bulk, he is completely pure. [If] he took a bird and ate it: If it has at least an olive's bulk, he is impure, and if not, he is pure. 
[One who touches] the carcass of an animal with his face or the inside of his mouth is impure, but [if it only touches] the place of swallowing (i.e., the throat), he is pure. [One who touches] the carcass of a fowl with his face or with the inside of his mouth is pure, and with the place of swallowing, he is impure. It comes out that you could say that wherever this one defiles, that one renders pure, and wherever that one defiles, this one renders pure. The carcass of a fowl [requires] an amount equivalent to half a piece of bread to render the body [of a priest] unfit [for service], and this is one of the thirteen rulings governing the carcass of a clean fowl (Toh. 1:1). It defiles in an olive's bulk, and in the place of swallowing, in an egg's bulk for purposes of the impurity of food, the words of Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Eliezer says, this one and that one are of an olive's bulk. And Rabbi Chaninah says, this one and that one are of an egg's bulk.
One who eats a limb from a living animal: [If he ate] from a clean domesticated animal or wild animal or fowl, [he is liable for eating] even the smallest amount.  And [fi he ate] from an impure animal, [he is only liable] if there is at least an olive's bulk. One who eats a limb from a living animal and [in the same sitting eats] from an unclean bird, behold, he receives eighty lashes, the words of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say, he only receives forty lashes.
