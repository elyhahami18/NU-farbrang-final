Tosefta Moed Katan



Chapter 1

They may irrigate a field that normally suffices with rainwater (<i>beit haba'al</i>) from a newly emerging spring, the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, they may not irrigate a field that normally suffices with rainwater from it; rather, a hand-irrigated field that had dried up (M.K. 1:1). Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says, they may not irrigate from it, and they may not fill up and irrigate with a swipe and bucket (<i>kilon</i>), and even from a pond that had [originally] been filled up with a swipe and bucket, but [as to] a pond that [was formed by water] trickling down from a hand-irrigated field, they may irrigate from it. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says, two pools -- this one above that one -- they may not pour [water] from the upper one to the lower one and thereby replenish it, but he may replenish [the water] from the upper one to the lower one. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, [as to] a groove [in the field], part of which is low and part of which is high, he may not pour from the lower part to the higher part, but he may pour from the higher part to the lower part, and thereby irrigate it. [And] one may sprinkle water on a hand-irrigated field on a festival.
What are "ugiyot" (cf. Moed Katan 1:1)? They are [circular ditches] around the base of the trees. They may string vines and spread them out on a beam. A matter that would cause a [financial] loss (i.e., if not performed promptly): One may do it on a festival. A matter that would not cause a loss: One may not do it on a festival. A person may sell his pool of water to a Gentile, and exchange with him from Shabbat to after Shabbat, and need not be concerned.
They may not dig cisterns, ditches, and caves on a festival, but they may prepare them and rectify them. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda are preferable as during a festival, and the words of the Sages [are preferable] during the sabbatical year. How so? Rabbi Yehuda would say, regarding a grain (lit., "white") field, he does not [perform work] in his normal manner; [rather,] he sticks it with a spear, hits it with an axe, and flattens the earth under it. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, and regarding which type of grain field was Rabbi Yehuda referring? Regarding a field that was adjacent to a hand-irrigated field, and not regarding a field that was adjacent to an orchard. 
One whose wall inclines [dangerously] toward the public thoroughfare: He may tear it down and rebuild it on account of the mortal danger. The wall of a city that was breached: They may erect a fence around it. They erected a fence and it was breached: They may not erect a [second] fence. If it was adjacent to the [state] border, he may tear it down and rebuild it in his normal manner.
They may look at marks of leprosy in order to be lenient, but not to be stringent, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says, if they are engaged in [looking at marks of leprosy] to be lenient, they will [necessarily] be engaged in it to be stringent. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Meir are preferable as to one who is quarantined (i.e., in a case of doubtful leprosy), and the words of Rabbi Yosei [are preferable] as to one who has been confirmed [to have leprosy]. § What is "readying a grave"? He deepens it and lengthens it. And what is a "temporary grave" (M.K. 1:6)? That is a cleavage. Rabbi Yosei agrees that regarding one who [whitewashes a grave with] lime, that he may complete [his work], for they may apply lime on it on a holiday.
They may not become betrothed to women on a festival. Rabbi Yehuda permits it, lest another one do it first. With mercy they may annul [a marriage to a minor], divorce, and perform chalitza, and perform levirate marriage on a festival.
A person may gather [produce from] trees and vegetation, whether his own or that of his fellow, as long as an expert does not do it. And they may grind [wheat] during a festival. Something that would constitute a [financial] loss [if not performed promptly], they may do it during a festival. Something that would not constitute a loss, they may not do it during the festival. When do these words apply? With loose [produce], but if it is still attached [to the soil], even something that would constitute a loss may not be done on a festival. [If] he has nothing to eat, he may harvest, and bind into sheaves, and thresh, as long as he does not thresh with cattle.
They may purchase from idolaters fields, houses, and vineyards, animals, male slaves, and female slaves, because he is like one who rescues  from their hands. And one may write [a document to that effect] and deposit it in the archives, and if he was a priest he may become impure for them (i.e., his relatives), and not only that, but even to render judgment on them outside the Land [of Israel]. And just as he may become impure outside the Land, so too may he become impure in a cemetery, and he may defile himself to study Torah, and he may defile himself to marry a woman. Rabbi Yehuda says, if there is someone else to study Torah, behold, this one should not defile himself, and if not, behold, this one should defile himself. Rabbi Yosei says, even if there is someone else who can study, behold, this one should defile himself, for not every person merits study; rather, from those who merit it.

Chapter 2

All those who said that [the people] may shave on a festival, it is permitted to cut one's hair during the thirty days of mourning. Even though they allowed him to cut his hair, he should not cut his hair in a public thoroughfare, but [instead] he cuts his hair in modesty inside his house.
All those who said that [the people] may launder their clothes on a festival, it is permitted to launder during the thirty days of mourning. Even though they permitted him to launder, he should not send his clothes to a professional launderer, but he launders them himself in modesty inside his house. Just as it is forbidden to cut one's hair or to launder, so too it is forbidden to cut one's nails, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Yosei permits it. And so too would Rabbi Yehuda says, those who come from the coast or from the lands beyond the sea are forbidden to launder or to cut their hair, but the Sages permit it. Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda are preferable when he did not seek permission, and the words of the Sages [are preferable] when he did seek it.
They may not write documents of engagement and surety contracts on a festival. Rabbi Yehuda permits it, lest another obtain priority. A person may write down his accounts on a festival and a person may calculate his expenses on a festival, and they may accept a contractorship on a festival to [perform] after the festival, as long as one does not measure or count or weigh in the manner that he does on a weekday.
One who buries his dead two days before a festival: He stops [counting] during the entire festival and he counts five days after the festival, and the public occupies itself with him, and his work is performed by others, [and] his male and female slaves act modestly in the homes of others. [If he buries his dead] three days before a festival, he counts seven days after the festival. The first four days, the public occupies itself with him, and the three last days the public does not occupy itself with him, because the festival is not counted for him, such that the public is occupied with him, and his work is performed by others [and] his male and female slaves act modestly in the homes of others.
[If he buried a relative] seven days<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "eight days" (MS Vienna)</i>  before a [pilgrimage] festival: He may cut his hair on the evening before the festival. If he had not cut his hair by the evening before the festival, he his prohibited from cutting it until thirty days pass, for even though the festival does not count for the seven days, it does count for the thirty days. Whoever fulfills [the custom of] overturning the bed thirty days before a festival should not overturn the bed after the festival. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, even one day. Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon says, Beit Shammai says, three days, and Beit Hillel say, even one hour, and on Erev Shabbat, he stands his bed upright, and after Shabbat, he overturns it, even though it has only remained [upright] for a single day. A mourner is not permitted to mourn during a festival but he comports himself with modesty inside his house.
They may drink water of <i>zevelim</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., manure-seepage, believed to have medicinal properties; cf. Shab. 110a:5 ("They may drink 'water of the legs (i.e., urine)'"); and see Minchat Bikkurim here</i>, and the water of palm trees, and a cup of root extract<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">see Shab. 110a:8 (created by combining "the weight of a zuz of Alexandrian gum, and a weight of a zuz of alum, and a weight of a zuz of garden saffron, grinding them together") (Steinsalz)</i> on a festival. For originally they said, they may not drink water of <i>zevelim</i> and the water of palm trees, and a cup of root extract on a festival, until Rabbi Akiva came along and taught that they <i>may</i> drink the water of <i>zevelim</i>, and the water of palm trees, and a cup of root extract. They may let the blood of a domesticated animal, a wild animal, or a fowl [for medicinal purposes], and they may not withhold any medical treatment from a domesticated animal on a festival. [If a female animal is] in heat, they may not [intentionally] bring [a male] to mate with her lest she cool down (i.e., no longer be in heat after the festival), but they may bring her down to the cattle-yard. A female donkey that is in heat: They may bring [a male] to mate with her lest she cool down. And as to all the other animals, they may bring them down to the cattle-yard, but they may not cause them to mate on a festival, and as to a first-born and those that are disqualified as offerings, they may not cause them to mate [even] on a regular day.
They may judge monetary cases and capital cases and cases involving financial penalties, and burn the [red] heifer, and behead the calf, and pierce [the ear of] a Hebrew slave, and redeem the appraisals, the expropriations, and the consecrated items, and second tithe. And they may remove the shoe from the block, as long as they don't return it. A press belonging to a professional launderer that they permitted [one to use] before the holiday: they may not return it to him, and needless to say, that they may not take it from him. [A press] belonging to a homeowner: They may take it from him and needless to say, they may return it to him. A shop having an entrance from a colonnade: He opens it and closes it in his normal manner. [If it has an entrance] from a public thoroughfare, he opens one [door] and closes the other.
[Before sunset falls on] the evening of the last festival day of Sukkot, one goes out and adorns the marketplace for the sake of the last day of the festival of Sukkot. They may sit on a bench (or stool) of the Samaritans on Shabbat, for originally they would say that they may <i>not</i> sit on the bench of the Samaritans on Shabbat. And it so happened with Rabban Gamaliel that he was sitting on a bench of the Samaritans on Shabbat in Akko. They said to him, "We are not accustomed to sit on a bench of the Samaritans on Shabbat." And he did not want to tell them, "You are permitted," [so] he stood up and went on his way. It so happened with Yehuda and Hillel, the sons of Rabban Gamaliel, that they entered a bathhouse in Kabul. They said to them, "We are not accustomed for two brothers to bathe together." They did not want to to say to them, "You are permitted"; rather, they entered and bathed once after the other. And there was another incident with Yehuda and Hillel, the sons of Rabban Gamaliel, that they would go out wearing golden slippers on Shabbat in Beiri. They said to them, "We are not accustomed to do this, to go out wearing golden slippers on Shabbat." They did not want to say to them, "You are permitted"; rather, they sent them by their slaves.
A Sage who dies: Everyone is [considered] his close relative. Everyone rends [their garment], everyone bares [their shoulder], everyone eulogizes, [and] everyone eats mourner's meal on his behalf, even in the public square. They may not bring flutes to a house of mourning; rather, to a house of a wedding feast or a house of feasting, in a place where the custom is to do so. What is a <i>hesped</i> ("eulogy")? That which is above the heart, as it is said (Is. 32:12), "Strike (<i>sofdim</i>) on the breasts." <i>Tipu'ach</i> -- [striking] with one's hands. <i>Kilus</i> -- spreading out one's arms.
