Tosefta Eruvin



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3





Gentiles who come against Israelite towns - go forth to do battle against them carrying weapons, and they violate the prohibitions of the Sabbath on their account. When?  When they come to kill.  But if they do not come to kill, they do not go forth against them carrying weapons, and they do not violate the prohibitions of the Sabbath on their account. If they come against towns located near the frontier, even to grab straw, even to grab a loaf of bread, they go forth against them carrying weapons, and they violate the prohibitions of the Sabbath on their account. At first, they would leave their weapons in the house nearest the wall.  One time, they ran about and were in haste to grab their weapons, and they ended up killing one another.  They established that each one should go to one's house.
