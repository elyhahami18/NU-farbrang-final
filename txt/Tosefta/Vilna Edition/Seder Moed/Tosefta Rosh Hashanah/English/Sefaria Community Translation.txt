Tosefta Rosh Hashanah



Chapter 1

Nisan is the beginning of the year for kings and for [the three pilgrimage] festivals and for months and for the collection of shekels and there are those who say even for home rentals. How is it the beginning for kings? If a king dies in Adar and they appoint a successor while it is still Adar, a year of reigning is counted for the former king and the current one.  [Similarly], if a king dies in Nisan and they appoint a successor while it is still Nisan a year [of reigning] is counted for the former king and the current one. [However], if a king dies in Adar and they appoint a successor only in Nisan, the first year is counted for the first king and the second is counted for the second king.
How so, "for [pilgrimage] festivals"? One who vows, one who valuates himself [by donating his value to the Temple], and one who consecrates his property, does not transgress the law of "do not delay" (Deut. 23:22) until all the festivals of a year have passed him by. Rabbi Shimon says, three festivals according to their order, and Festival of Matzah is first. And so too would Rabbi Shimon say, sometimes they are three and sometimes they are four, and sometimes they are five. How so? One who vows before Passover, [he has not transgressed the law of "do not delay"] until Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot pass him by. [If he vows] before Shavuot, [he has not transgressed] until Shavuot and Sukkot [of the current year], and Passover, and Shavuot, and Sukkot [of the next year] pass him by. [If he vows] before Sukkot, [he has not transgressed] until Sukkot [of the current year], and Passover, and Shavuot, and Sukkot [of the next year] pass him by.
How so, "for months"? Even though it says, "on the first month" and "on the second month"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., in various verses in the Torah (see, e.g., Num. 20:1 ("in the first month"), Gen. 8:14 ("in the second month")), in which the ordinals "first" and "second" do not refer to a specific month of the year, but rather indicate the first or second month after a specific event (see Lieberman)</i>,  they only begin to [formally] count from Nisan, as it says (Ex. 12:2), "This month shall be for you the first (lit., 'head') of the months."
How so, "for the collection of shekels"? Every public offering is offered up [starting] on the first of Nisan. If the new [collection of funds] arrived on time [to the Temple treasury], they offer it up from the new [funds], but if not, they offer it up from the old.
How so, "for home rentals"? One one who rents out a house to his fellow "for a year," he has rented it from him for twelve months, from day to day. [But] if he said "for <i>this</i> year," even if he only rented it out on the first of Adar, he only has it until the first of Nisan.
On the first of Elul is the New Year for cattle tithe. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say, on the first of Tishrei. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai, since these ones say "on the first of Elul," and those ones say "on the first of Tishrei," the "Eluls" will [only] tithe for themselves. How so? If five [calves] were born in Av and five in Elul, or five in Elul and five in Tishrei, they do not combine [to form ten]. [But] five in Tishrei and five in Av, behold, these do combine.
Tishrei is the New Year for years and for remissions and for jubilees, for planting and for vegetables and for tithes, and for vows. How so, "for years and for remissions and for jubilees"? They only begin to count for years [of the agricultural cycle] and for remissions and for jubilees on Tishrei. How so, "for planting"? It is the same whether he planted, bent, or grafted it: Thirty days before Rosh Hashanah, a year is counted toward it, and they are permitted to be kept for the seventh year. Less than that, the year is not counted toward it, and they are forbidden to be kept for the seventh year. And [as to] fruits, their planting is forbidden until Tu B'Shvat. If they are orlah, they are orlah. If they are [fruits of the] fourth year, they are [fruits of the] fourth year.
How so, "for vegetables"? [As to] one who picks vegetables on the eve of Rosh Hashanah before the sun goes down, and then goes back and picks after the sun goes down, they may not separate terumah and tithes from this one on behalf of that one, because this one is new and that one is old. If it was the second [year in the agricultural cycle] and the third [year] came in, the first [picking] is tithed as second tithe, and the second [picking] is tithed as poor tithe. [Similarly, as to] one who picks an etrog on the eve of Tu B'Shvat before the sun goes down, and then goes back and picks another one after the sun goes down, they may not separate terumah and and they may not separate tithes from this one on behalf of that one, because this one is new and that one is old. If it was the third [year] and the fourth [year] came in, the first [picking] is tithed as poor tithe and the second [picking] is tithed as second tithe<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>הראשון מתעשר מעשר עני, והשני מתעשר מעשר שני</b> (see Lieberman)</i>.
How so, "for vows"? [As to] one who vows [not] to benefit from his fellow "for a year," he vows [not to benefit] from him for twelve months, from day to day. [But] if he said, "in this year," even if he only vowed [not to benefit] from him [starting] on the first of Elul, he only has until the first of Tishrei. 
On Rosh Hashanah, all the people of the world pass before Him like <i>B'nei Maron</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>בְנֵי מָרוֹן</b> (variously translated as either "sheep" or "foot soldiers")</i>, as it is said (Ps. 33:15), "He who fashions the hearts of them all, etc.," and it says (Ps. 81:5), "Sound on the new month a shofar," and it says (ibid.), "For it is a law for Israel, etc." [If] the Beit Din sanctifies it, the Judge enters before him, and if not, the Judge does not enter before him, and so too you find that with the omer of the manna, if the month came at its [appointed] time, it immediately ceased, and if not, it was delayed for three days.
R. Akiva said, “The Torah said:” Bring an omer of barley on Pesah the season of barley so that the grain shall be blessed for you Bring wheat and first fruits on Shavuot the season of the trees so that fruit of the trees will be blessed for you Bring the water libation on Sukkot so that the water of the rains will be blessed for you Say before me: Malchuyot, Zichronot and Shofarot Malchuyot so that you will crown me before them Zichronot so that your memories will come before me for the good Shofarot so that your prayers will ascend with trumpeting 
Everything is judged on Rosh Hashanah and the decree of that judgment is sealed on Yom Kippur, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, everything is judged on Rosh Hashanah, but the decree pertaining to each and every judgment is sealed at its [proper] time: On Passover for crops; on Shavuot for fruits of the tree; on Sukkot for water; and the decree of the judgment of man is sealed on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Yosei says, man is judged every day, as it is said (Job 7:18), "And you inspect him every morning."
On six months the emissaries would go out [to inform those living in outlying areas of the date of the new month]. Rebbi enacted that they would even go out on the second Adar [of a leap year] because of Purim.
In the beginning, they would accept testimony of the new moon from any person. One time, the Baytusim hired two witnesses to come and trick the rabbis, because the Baytusim believe that Atzeret [Shavuot] can only be on the first day of the week. One [witness] came and said his testimony, and left. The second came and said, "I was going up to Ma'ale Adumim and I saw it [the new moon] crouched between two rocks. Its head was like that of a calf, its ears were like that of a goat, its horns were like that of a deer, and its tail was resting between its legs. I saw, and I was frightened, and I fell backwards. And [if you don't believe me] here are two hundred zuz wrapped up in my cloak." They said to him, "The two hundred zuz are given to you as a gift, and the one who hired you should be stretched out to be given lashes. What did you see that you did this?" He said to them, "Because I heard that the Baytusim wanted to trick the rabbis, and I said, better that I should go and let the rabbis know." 
If they don't know him, they send his witnesses with him<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., to testify that the one who saw the new moon is a kosher witness, and not a Boethusian</i>, even on Shabbat. It so happened with Rabbi Nehorai, that he came with his witness on Shabbat to Usha and he testified about him. At first they would light torches on the tops of the highest mountains [to signal the new month], on the Mount of Olives, on Sartaba, and on Tz'rophnah, on Tabor, on Haron, [and] on Beit D'lateha<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Beit Bilti" (MS Erfurt)</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, even on the Mountains of Machma, and Tabor, and her fellows (i.e., the neighboring mountains).<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">alt., "Cherim, and Kiyar, Gadur, and her fellows" (MS Erfurt)</i>
From what time do they light [torches to announce] the new month? From the "or" (evening) of the thirtieth day.  How so? If [Rosh Chodesh] falls on Erev Shabbat or on Shabbat, they light on its behalf from the time that Shabbat ends. And if [Rosh Chodesh] comes on time (i.e., on the twenty-ninth day), they light on its behalf, and if not, they do not light on its behalf. They would light torches on every Rosh Chodesh. § If one [who was testifying before the Beit Din] said, "I saw it before [the sun came up]," [it is as if] he did not say anything. If one said, "I saw it after [the sun came up]," his words stand. "To the north," he did not say anything. "To the south," his words stand. If one said, "I saw it two ox goads high above [the horizon]," and another said, "three," their testimony stands. If one said "three" and another said "five," [the testimony of] this one and that one do not join together, but he (i.e., one of them) may join together with others. If one said, "I saw [the crescent] upright," and another said, "I saw it reclining," this one and that one do not join together, but he may join together with others. "I saw half of it in a cloud" -- he has not said anything. "Half of it through glass" -- he has not said anything. "Half of it [reflected] in water" -- his words stand. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, if it does not appear at its time (i.e., on the twenty-ninth day), they do not sanctify it, for Heaven has already sanctify it. And so too would Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok say, the emissaries do not go out to Syria [to announce the new month] until they have heard it from the mouth of the Beit Din the following day.
<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">In connection with the conflict between Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Yehoshua as to the reliability of two witnesses who testified regarding the new moon, the Mishnah (R.H. 2:9), quotes Ex. 24:9, which states, "Then Moses and Aaron, Nadava and Avihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel ascended." The Mishnah then asks, "Why were the names of the 'Elders' not mentioned?" and answers that it is "To teach that each and every set of three [judges] who convened a court of law over Israel, behold, it is like the Beit Din of Moses."  The Tosefta now asks the same same question, but provides a different answer.</i>Why were the names of the 'Elders' not mentioned? So that not each and every person would say, "Behold, I am coming to compare Rabbi So-and-So with Eldad and Medad (Num. 11:26)," or "Behold, I am coming to compare Rabbi So-and-So with Nadav and Avihu (Lev. 10:1-2)." And thus it says (1 Sam. 12:6), "The Lord who appointed (lit., 'made') Moses and Aaron." and it says (1 Sam. 12:11), "And the Lord sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel." Jerubbaal -- that is Gideon. Bedan -- that is Samson. Jephthah -- as it sounds (i.e., that is his real name). And it says (Ps. 99:6), "Moses and Aaron among His priests[, and Samuel, among those who call His name]." Scripture thus compares three light ones of the world (Jerubbaal, Bedan, and Jephthah), with three great ones of the world (Moses, Aaron, and Samuel), to teach you that the Beit Din of Jerubbaal before the Place is like the Beit Din of Moses, and the Beit Din of Jephthah is as great before the Place as the Beit Din of Samuel, to inform you that anyone who has been appointed as the leader over the community -- even the lightest of the light -- weighs the same as the mightiest of the mighty. And so it says (Deut. 17:9), "You shall come to the priests, the Levites, and the judge [that there shall be in your days]" -- there is no judge other than that of your generation. And it says (Ecc. 7:10), "Do not say, 'How did it come to pass that the earlier days were better than these?'"   

Chapter 2

[If] they sanctified the new month at its time and discovered that the witnesses were scheming -- behold, it is [still] sanctified. [If] they sanctified it at night, it is not sanctified. [If] they sanctified it [in reliance upon witnesses who testified] by force, unwittingly, intentionally, or by being misled -- behold, it is sanctified. [If] they sanctified it before its time, or after the additional (i.e., thirtieth) day: Earlier than the thirtieth day, later than the thirty-[first day], you might think it can be sanctified; thus, the verse says (Ex. 12:6), "month" -- [the new month] may not [start] earlier than the thirtieth day [of the previous  month]. [If] the moon was not seen for two days, you might think it can be sanctified after two days; thus, the verse says (ibid.), "day" -- there is only one day.
On fast days, they sound three sets of three blasts each, and when breaking camp, they sound three sets of three blasts each, on each and every banner, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Sages say, three on each and every tribe. On what do they sound the blasts? On the trumpets that Moses fashioned. Rabbi Yehuda says, on Rosh Hashanah they sound the blasts with [the horns of] rams, and on the Jubilee year, with that of mountain goats. They instituted a common [obligation] for a common [right], and [they instituted] an uncommon [obligation] for an uncommon [right].
A shofar that they shortened is fit. [If] they scraped out, whether from inside or outside, it is fit. [If] they plated it with gold around the place [where he puts] his mouth, or if he added any amount to it, even of the same type (i.e., pieces of another horn), it is disqualified. [If] it was punctured and sealed, even of the same type, if it prevents it from sounding, it is disqualified, and if not, it is fit. [If] he placed one shofar inside another shofar and sounded them, if the sound of the inner one was heard, he fulfilled [his obligation], but if the sound of the outer one was heard, he did not fulfill [his obligation]. What size must a shofar be [to fulfill one's obligation]? Large enough for him to hold it in one hand and sound the blasts.
Everyone is liable in sounding the shofar: Priests, Levites, and Israelites, converts and freed slaves, halalim, Natinim, mamzerim, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, one who was castrated by man, one who was born castrated, one whose [testicles] are crushed or whose member is cut (Deut. 23:2) -- all are liable and may cause others to fulfill their obligation. A tumtum and androgynous are liable, but do not cause others to fulfill their obligation. An androgynous fulfills the obligation of "his" kind<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">the translation follows the Hebrew, which defaults to the masculine</i>,  but does not fulfill the obligation of those who are not of his kind. A tumtum does not fulfill either the obligation of those of his kind or those who are not of his kind. Women and slaves and minors are exempt and do not cause the masses to fulfill their obligation.
One who blows while he is occupying himself [with the shofar], or one who blows while teaching himself [how to blow], or one who teaches his son, or one who teaches his student -- if he directed his heart [to fulfilling the mitzvah], he fulfilled it, and if not, he did not fulfill it. A shepherd that is watering his flock behind the synagogue, and so too a sick person who was brought behind the synagogue, or one whose house is adjacent to the synagogue, and heard the sound of the shofar, or the sound of the Megillah [being read] -- if he directed his heart, he fulfilled it, and if not, he did not fulfill it. Even though this one heard and that one heard, [since] this one directed his heart and that one did not direct his heart, the one who directed his heart fulfilled and the one who did not direct his heart did not fulfill, for everything follows after the direction of the heart, as it is said (Ps. 10:17), "Prepare your hearts, [and] incline your ears," and it says (Prov. 23:26), "Give me your heart, my son, and let your eyes observe my ways, etc."
And in this too was Jerusalem greater than Yavneh: That [as to] every town that could see [Jerusalem] and hear [the sound of the shofar], and which was close, and [the people were] able to come, [if it] had these three attributes, they would blow in it. But in Yavneh, they would only blow in the Beit Din.
Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says, if [the moon] is not seen at its proper time, they do not sanctify it, for [the celestial court in] Heaven has already sanctified it. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, if it is not seen at its proper time, they do not sanctify it, for the new moon that is before them has already sanctified itself. Shimon the son of the Deputy High Priest says, if witnesses came from the [time of] minchah and thereafter, they would blow [the shofar], but they would not offer additional sacrifices until they sanctified the new month. Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha, these matters were instituted [provisionally] by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai from the time that the Holy Temple was destroyed. When the Temple is rebuilt -- speedily shall these matters be restored to their original state!
Rabbi Yehuda says [in the name of] Rabbi Eliezer: "A Sabbath of complete rest" (Lev. 23:3) -- that is the Sanctification of the Day; "a reminder" (ibid.) -- that is the Remembrances; "trumpet blasts" (ibid.) -- that is the Shofrot; "a holy convocation" -- that means to sanctify it [by abstaining from work]. Said to him Rabbi Akiva, for what reason does the verse not say, a "Shabbaton of rest"? Because it already mentions "rest"<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the root word for "rest" is already contained in "Shabbaton" and need not be midrashically derived</i>. Rather, "a reminder" -- that is Remembrances; "trumpet blasts" -- that is Shofrot; "a holy convocation" -- that is the Sanctification of the Day.
In a place where they were accustomed to recite according to the words of Rabbi Akiva, one recites according to the words of Rabbi Akiva. [If] according to the words of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, one recites according to the words of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, the [blessing of] sanctification of the day [is recited] with [the blessing of] remembrances. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, just as it turns out that in every place [the blessing for the sanctification of the day] is recited fourth, so too here it is recited fourth. Rebbi says, just as it turns out that in every place it is said in the middle, so too here it is said in the middle. And when they sanctified the year in Usha, on the first day, Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah passed  and recited [the Amidah] according to the words of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, we were not so accustomed  in Yavneh. On the second day Rabbi Chananiah the son of Rabbi  Yosei HaGalili passed and recited it according to the words of Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel said, this is what we were accustomed to in Yavneh.
They may not recite fewer than ten "Kingships," or than ten "Remembrances," or than ten "Shofrot," [but] if he said three of each, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. One may not recite a Remembrance or a Kingship or a Shofar of retribution. He begins with [verses from] the Torah and finishes with [verses from] the Prophets. Rabbi Yosei says, if it was [Divine] retribution against the Gentiles, he may recite it by itself. The one who begins, begins with [verses] from the Torah and finishes with [verses] from the Torah, and says [verses] from the Prophets and from the Writings in the middle. They may not say Kingships with Remembrances, nor Remembrances with Shofrot, and if he said it, [it is as if] he has not said anything, and he needs to say it a second time.
[Verses of] "Revisitings" (<i>pikdonot</i>) are equivalent to "Remembrances' (<i>zichronot</i>), as it is said (Gen. 21:1), "And the Lord revisited (<i>pakad</i>) Sarah, etc.," and it says (Ex. 3:16), "I have revisited, yes, revisited you (<i>pakod pakadti</i>), etc." Rabbi Yosei says, they are said [together] with Remembrances. Rabbi Yehuda says, they would not say them [together] with them. [A verse of] Remembrance that has with it horn-blasting (<i>terua</i>), such as (Lev. 23:24), "A remembrance of horn-blasting, a proclamation of holiness": Rabbi Yosei says, those are said with [other verses of] Remembrances and [also] with Shofrot. Rabbi Yehuda says, they would only say them with Remembrances. [A verse of] horn-blasting that does not have a Remembrance with it, such as (Num. 29:1), "A day of horn-blasting it shall be to you," Rabbi Yosei says, [it is said] with the [verses of] Shofrot, [and] Rabbi Yehuda says, they would not say it with them. [A verse of] Kingship that has with it "shofar," such as (Ps. 98:6), "With trumpets and the sound of the shofar [raise a blast before the King, the Lord]," Rabbi Yosei says, they say it with [the verses of] Kingship and with [the verses of] Shofrot [and] Rabbi Yehuda says, they would only say it with Shofrot. [As to] "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" (Deut. 6:4), [and] "And you shall know today, and lay it upon your heart, that Hashem is God, etc." (Deut. 4:39): Rabbi Yosei says, they say them with [verses of] Kingship, [and] Rabbi Yehuda says, they would not say them with [verses of] Kingship, because they do not have [any mention of] "shofar" with them.
The order of blowing [the shofar] is thus: three sets of three by three. The measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> blast is like three <i>teru'ah</i> blasts; while the measure of each<i>teru'ah</i> blast is like three sobs (<i>yevavot</i>). If one heard six <i>teki'ah</i> blasts and three <i>teru'ah</i> blasts - even at intervals, and even spread out over the entire day - the obligation is fulfilled. If one heard a <i>teki'ah</i> from one and a <i>teru'ah</i> from another, even at intervals, and even spread out over the entire day - the obligation is fulfilled. If one heard the shofar blasts and the blessings - whether the blessings preceded the blasts or vice versa, the obligation is fulfilled. If one blew a <i>teki'ah</i>, a <i>teru'ah</i> and then a <i>teki'ah</i>, and then completed the set with [only] a <i>teru'ah</i> and a<i>teki'ah</i> - this only counts as one set. And if one blew a <i>teki'ah</i>, a <i>teru'ah</i> and then a <i>teki'ah</i> in one breath - the obligation is not fulfilled. One can learn to blow the shofar on Shabbat. One does not prevent women and children from blowing on Shabbat, nor on festive days.
Yom Tov of Rosh Hashanah that falls out on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say, one recites ten (i.e., ten blessings during the Amidah), and Beit Hillel say, one recites nine. Yom Tov that falls out on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say, one recites eight, and says [the blessing] of Shabbat by itself, and of Yom Tov by itself, and starts with [the blessing] of Shabbat. And Beit Hillel say, one recites seven, and begins with that of Shabbat and ends with that of Shabbat, and says [the blessing over] the holiness of the day in the middle. Said Beit Hillel to Beit Shammai, "And was it not so that on the <i>ma'amad</i>, all of them were Elders of Beit Shammai, [and] Choni HaKatan descended and recited seven [blessings]? And all the people said to him, may grace be upon you." Beit Shammai said to them, "Because it was an appropriate time to shorten [the service]." Beit Hillel said to them,  "If it was an appropriate time to shorten, then he should have shortened all of them."
Rabban Gamaliel says, the prayer leader fulfills the obligation of the masses, and the Sages say, each and every person must fulfill his own obligation. He said to them, "If so, why do they bring him down before the ark?" They said to him, "In order for him to fulfill the obligation of whoever does not know how [to pray]." He said to them, "If so, why does each and every person pray for himself?" They said to him, "Because the prayer leader rectifies himself." He said to them, "If so, why do they bring him down before the ark?" They said to him, "To fulfill [the obligation of] whoever does not know." He said to them, "Just as he fulfills [the obligation of] whoever does not know, so too he fulfills [the obligation of] whoever does know."
