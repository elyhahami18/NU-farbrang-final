Tosefta Beitzah



Chapter 1

An egg that was laid on Yom Tov: Others said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer [that] both it and its mother may be eaten [on Yom Tov]. A calf that was born on Yom Tov: It is permitted to slaughter it on Yom Tov because it renders itself permitted. A chick that hatches on Yom Tov: It is permitted to slaughter it on Yom Tov because it renders itself permitted.
One who slaughters a chicken [on Yom Tov] and found fully developed eggs inside of it -- behold, they are permitted.
An egg where most of it has come out on the eve of Yom Tov -- even though it was fully out on Yom Tov, it is permitted [to eat on Yom Tov]. [If] it was laid on Shabbat, it may be eaten on Yom Tov. [If] it was laid on Yom Tov, it may be eaten on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, Still there are  arguments in that regard; just as it is prohibited to eat [the egg], so too it is prohibited to handle it. Just as [where there is] a doubt [whether or not] it is prohibited, so too [something] that has a doubt [of whether or not] it was "prepared" [before Yom Tov] is prohibited [on Yom Tov]. [If this egg] were to be mixed with even one hundred, all [the eggs] would be prohibited.
Beit Shammai say, [the prohibited measure for] sourdough is the equivalent of an olive's-bulk, and [for] leaven is the equivalent of a date with its pit. Beit Hillel say, [the prohibited measure for] this one and that one is the equivalent of an olive's-bulk. 
What is "sourdough" (<i>se'or</i>)? That which leavens other [foods]. "Leaven" (<i>chametz</i>) is that which becomes leavened through the agency of others. From what time is it called "sourdough"? From when it is no longer fit to feed to a dog. Ashes that were kindled on Yom Tov: One may not cover up [the blood of a wild animal with it] on Yom Tov, for they were not set aside for [that specific] use. [If] he had ash inside his house to plaster the roof with it, [or] lime to whitewash his house with it, he may not cover up [blood] with it. Rabbi Yosei says, [as to] a <i>k'vi</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">a hybrid species as to which the Sages were uncertain whether it was a domesticated or wild animal</i>, they may not slaughter it on Yom Tov because it is in doubt, and if they slaughtered it, they may not cover up its blood.
Said Rabbi Yosei, just as a circumcision in which [the eighth day] is known with certainty overrides Shabbat, but does not [even] override Yom Tov when it is in doubt; then, as to covering up the blood, in which certainty (i.e., that it is certainly the blood of a wild animal) does not override Shabbat, does not logic dictate that where there is a doubt, that it should not override Yom Tov?
They said to him, shofars that are [blown] in the outlying areas will prove it, for when it is a certain [obligation] it does not override Shabbat, but when there is a doubt it [nonetheless] overrides Yom Tov. This proves that with regards to covering the blood, that even though its certain obligation does not override Shabbat, when there is a doubt, it does override Yom Tov. Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar (i.e., Bar Kappara) responded: Given that with circumcision where its doubtful status does not override Yom Tov, and its certain status does not override the evening before Yom Tov, would you not say that with regards to covering the blood, in which its certain status overrides the evening before Yom Tov, logic dictates that its doubtful status overrides Yom Tov? Said Rabbi Abba<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">per the Jewish Encyclopedia (https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/127-abba-arika) this is a rare tannaitic reference to the amora Rav</i>, this is one of the things that Rabbi Chiyya said, "I have no response," and Rabbi Elazar gave a response.
Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Beit Shammai agree with with Beit Hillel that [people] may transport a ladder from dovecote to dovecote. About what do they disagree? About whether they can return it, for Beit Shammai forbids it and Beit Hillel permits it. Rabbi Yehuda says, Azariah says, they may carry a ladder. In what case does this apply? In regards to a a ladder of a dovecote, but regarding that of an attic, it is forbidden to carry, even within the attic [itself]. Rabbi Dosa says, they may tilt it from one window to another window (i.e., without moving its legs). Others say in the name of Rabbi Dosa, they may even shift [its legs].
Rabbi Shimon says, Beit Shammai say, a person may not carry a young pigeon unless he tied it [the previous day to designate it for slaughter]. Beit Hillel say, unless he shook it [the previous day], and one who tied it or shook it in a pit, in a ditch, or in a cave -- it is permitted, and in a tree -- it is forbidden. One who ties it or shakes it in any [other place] -- it is forbidden on account of robbery.
[If before Yom Tov] he set aside [birds for slaughter] inside the nest, and [on Yom Tov] found [them] in front of the nest, they are forbidden. At the entrance, they are permitted. Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that if [before Yom Tov] he set them aside inside the nest, and [on Yom Tov] found [them] in front of nest, that they are forbidden. In what case does this apply? In regards to doves of a dovecote and doves of an attic, and birds that build their nests in <i>t'fichim</i><sup>*</sup><i class="footnote"><b>טפיחים</b> ("a pitcher-shaped vessel put up in walls and cornices as bird’s nest") (Jastrow)</i> or in a well, but ducks and chickens and Herodian doves need not be set aside [before Yom Tov] because they are [all considered to be] under the domain of human beings. But a beast that built its lair in an orchard does need to be set aside because it is not under the domain of human beings.
Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that [people] may remove the straps of their sandals on Yom Tov. About what did they disagree? About reattaching them, for Beit Shammai forbid it, and Beit Hillel permit it. They agree that if one had carved [meat] on top of a large pestle, that it is forbidden for him to carry [the pestle on Yom Tov]. They agree that they may may not salt animal hides on Yom Tov, but they may salt [meat] for roasting on the hides.
Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that [people] may carry full vessels for their needs [during Yom Tov], and empty ones to fill. About what did they disagree? About empty ones that are not for their needs [during Yom Tov], for Beit Shammai forbid it and Beit Hillel permit it. A person may go out with his key that is [on a ring] around his finger in the public domain, and he need not be concerned. A door with hinges: They may open it and lock it on Shabbat and, needless to say, on Yom Tov. [If] the hinges broke, they may not open or lock it on Yom Tov and, needless to say, on Shabbat.
Said Rabbi Yehuda, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that [people] may transport the priestly gifts (e.g., the foreleg, cheeks, and maw) that they separated on Yom Tov with the priestly gifts that they separated from the evening before Yom Tov. About what did they disagree? About the priestly gifts that they separated from the evening before Yom Tov on their own behalf, for Beit Shammai forbid it and Beit Hillel permit it. Beit Shammai said, "There is a <i>g'zeirah shava</i> (verbal analogy) between challah and priestly gifts. A priestly gift is for the priest and terumah is a gift for the priest. Just as terumah may not be transported, so too, the priestly gifts may not be transported." Beit Hillel said to them, "No. If you are speaking of terumah,  which one does not have the right to separate [on Yom Tov], what would you say regarding priestly gifts, which one does have the right to separate [on Yom Tov]?" Rabbi Yosei relates [a different version of this exchange]: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that they may transport the priestly gifts on Yom Tov. About what did they disagree? About terumah, for Beit Shammai say, they may not transport, and Beit Hillel say, they are permitted. Beit Hillel said, "There is a <i>g'zeirah shava</i> between challah and priestly gifts. Priestly gifts are for the priest and terumah is a gift for the priest. Just as they may transport the priestly gifts, so too may they transport terumah." Beit Shammai said to them, "No. If you are speaking of priestly gifts, which one has the right to separate [on Yom Tov], what would you say regarding terumah, which one does not have the right to separate [on Yom Tov]?" Others say, "Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that they may not transport terumah to a priest on Yom Tov. About what did they disagree? About the priestly gifts, that Beit Shammai forbid, and Beit Hillel permit.
One who kneads dough on Yom Tov, whether impure or pure, it is permitted to carry it and permitted to separate challah from it. One who kneaded from the evening before Yom Tov and forgot to separate [challah]: It is forbidden to carry and forbidden to separate challah from it [on Yom Tov].
Said Rabbi Meir, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that spices may be crushed in a wooden mortar, and salt is among them. About what did they disagree? About salt by itself, for Beit Shammai say, [salt may be ground]  in a small cruse or with a wooden pot ladle for roasting, and Beit Hillel say, with any [utensil], and as for pepper, behold, it is like [other] spices. Beit Shammai say, they may transport spices and pestle to a mortar, but not a mortar to them, and Beit Hillel say, they may transport this one to that one, and that one to this one, and need not be concerned.
Beit Shammai say, they may transport a knife and a butcher to an animal [to be slaughtered], but not an animal to him, and Beit Hillel say, they may transport this one to that one, and that one to this one, and need not be concerned. They may not prepare barley-groats and they may not crush them with a mortar on Yom Tov, and they may not crush salt with a wooden pestle, but one may crush it with the handle of a knife or with a wooden pot ladle, and he need not be concerned. One may not mash fig-cakes or dry figs or carobs before elders (i.e., who have difficulty chewing them otherwise) on Shabbat, but one may pound them with the handle of a knife or with a wooden pot ladle, and he need not be concerned. One who husks kernels of grain from Erev Shabbat may winnow [the chaff] from hand to hand (i.e., a little bit at a time) and eat it, but not with a basket nor with a large vessel. One who husks kernels of grain from Erev Yom Tov may winnow [the chaff] with a basket or with a large vessel, but not with a board and not with a sieve and not with a sifting basket, like the way that he does it on a weekday.
One who separates legumes on Yom Tov: Rabbi Yehuda says, Beit Shammai say, if there were more pebbles than food, he may separate the food and leave the pebbles, and Beit Hillel say, he may separate whichever of them he desires. Said Rabbi Elazar b'Rabbi Tzadok, those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel would fill a pitcher with lentils, pour water on them, and the pebbles would sink to the bottom and the food (i.e., the lentils) would rise to the top.
Rabbi Yosei says, they may transport a black shoe but not a white one, because that requires an expert. Rabbi Shimon says, they may send wheat because it may be eaten as a dish, beans because they are [considered] food for the residents of Lod, and barley because it is fit for cattle. 

Chapter 2

A Yom Tov that falls on Erev Shabbat<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase "Erev Shabbat" as used in the Tosefta generally refers to the day before Shabbat, i.e., from Thursday night to Friday afternoon, rather than Friday evening. Similarly, the phrase "Erev Yom Tov" generally refers to the day leading up to a Festival, rather than the Festival itself.</i> they may not make either a courtyard eruv (i.e., to permit carrying within a courtyard on Shabbat) or a boundary eruv (i.e, extending the Shabbat boundaries of a city), the words of Rebbi. And the Sages say, they may a courtyard eruv but not a boundary eruv with bread for Shabbat, and with a cooked dish for Yom Tov. The "cooked dish" of which they spoke is even roasted, even boiled, even a <i>kolias</i> (a type of fish), on which they poured hot [water] from Erev Yom Tov.
One who prepares a cooked dish from Erev Yom Tov may bake and cook on account of Shabbat, and insulate the hot [water] on account of it, and one is permitted to eat it the same day, and one is permitted to give it as a present, and there is no start or end time [when it must be eaten]. The residents of a courtyard are permitted to prepare a cooked or baked dish and to cook on account of it for Shabbat, and they are permitted to create a partnership for [carrying in] an alleyway with it. Behold, one who forgot and did not make an eruv: Others who did make an eruv are permitted to make one one for him. The one who forgot and had not made an eruv: It is permitted to fill a jar of water for him and to light a candle for him. 
Said Rabbi Shimon, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that there [must be] two cooked dishes. About what did they disagree? About the fish and the egg that are placed on top of [a cooked dish], for Beit Shammai say, those form a single dish, and Beit Hillel say, those form two dishes. They agree that if he cooked two types of food in one cooking-pot or crushed an egg on top of a fish, or cut up porrets under the fish, that those are two cooked dishes. They may not bake on Yom Tov for [the sake of] the day after Yom Tov, but one may fill a cooking-pot with meat, as long as he eats a bit of it [on Yom Tov], or fill a kettle with water, even if he only drinks a cup of it [on Yom Tov]. One who bakes may only bake for his needs [on Yom Tov]. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, a woman may fill up the oven with bread because bread is good [for eating] whenever the oven is full.
They may neither prepare food for Samaritans, nor food for dogs on Yom Tov. It so happened with Shimon the Yemenite that he did not go out on the night of Yom Tov to the study hall. In the morning, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava found him. He said to him, "Why didn't you come to the study hall?" He said to him, "One mitzvah fell on me, and I performed it. Gentile troops entered the city and they terrified us, lest they become hostile toward the residents of the city. We prepared a calf for them and they ate and drank, and we arranged things so that they did not become hostile to the residents of the city." He said to him, "I wonder if your reward was not outweighed by your loss, for behold, [the Sages] said, 'They may neither prepare food for Samaritans nor food for dogs on Yom Tov.'"  
Said Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, Beit Shammai agreed that a priest may not immerse for the sake of [eating] terumah on the same day, but he may immerse to [change] from one intention to another intention or from one company to another company on Yom Tov. How so, "from one intention to another intention"? One who wants to prepare [vessels for] his winepress in addition to [vessels for] his olive press, or [vessels for] his olive press in addition to [vessels for] his dough, behold, he may immerse on the same day. How so, "from one company to another company"? [If] he did not want to prepare [vessels for] his olive press in addition to [vessels for] his fellows' dough, behold, he may immerse his vessels. § They may not immerse [a vessel together with] its water on Yom Tov, and they may not pour water into a stone vessel to purify [the water] on Shabbat, the words of Rebbi. And the Sages say, they may immerse [the vessel and] the water on Yom Tov, and they may pour water into a stone vessel to purify [the water], but not to immerse them.
Vessels that were defiled by a father of impurity may not be immersed on Yom Tov and, needless to say, on Shabbat. But one may fill his, cup, his pitcher, or his jug for drinking, and then reconsider, and immerse them. And he immerses in his normal manner [to purify] from severe forms of impurity and, needless to say, from light [forms of impurity].
They may not shower with hot water that was heated on Yom Tov and, needless to say, on Shabbat, but he may wash his face and hands with hot water that was heated from Erev Shabbat and, needless to say, from water that was heated from Erev Yom Tov, on Yom Tov. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, [regarding] a banquet room that was heated from Erev Yom Tov, one may entertain company in it on Yom Tov. [If] it was not heated from Erev Yom Tov, he may not entertain company in it on Yom Tov. However, they may skin an animal from its feet on Yom Tov, but they may not skin an animal from its feet on a weekday, with regards to first-born animals and those disqualified as sacrifices  (cf. Bekh. 33a:12). And they may prepare anything needed for a circumcision. Things that may not prepared for [a circumcision] on Shabbat but that may be prepared for it on Yom Tov: They may grind cumin for it, and they may mix wine and oil for it (see Shab. 134a:2-3). Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, as long as he did not tear rags (i.e., to dress the wound after the circumcision) at the beginning. 
Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel would not erect a candelabra on the night of Yom Tov. And it so happened with Rabban Gamaliel and the Elders that they were reclining in Rome and candelabra fell over on the night of Yom Tov, and Rabbi Akiva stood up and stood it up [again]. Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "Akiva! How dare you stick your head into this dispute!" He said to him, "Rabbi, you taught us to incline after the majority; even if you yourself forbid it and they permit it, the halacha follows the opinion of those that form the majority." Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel, they may move the candelabra on Yom Tov but they may not erect it.
Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel would sweep up between the beds. Said Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Tzadok, "Many times we ate in the house of Rabban Gamaliel and we never saw them sweeping up between the beds; rather sheets were spread [on the floors between the beds] from Erev Yom Tov. Once the guests entered [the house], they removed them." They said to him, "Rabbi, in that case, it would be permitted to do so on Shabbat." 
Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel would place incense on burning coals. Said Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Tzadok, "Many times we ate in the house of Rabban Gamaliel and we never saw them placing incense on burning coals; rather perforated coal pans (<i>ardaskaot</i>) were smoking [with incense] on Erev Yom Tov. Once the guests entered, they would stop up their holes." They said to him, "In that case, it would be permitted to do so on Shabbat."
What is a "helmeted kid" (see Beitzah 2:7, <i>g'di m'kulas</i>)? They would roast the whole thing, with its entrails over its head. [If] they cook a small portion of it [or] seethe a small portion of it (i.e., to distinguish it from the Passover offering in Temple times), that is not a helmeted kid. They prepare a helmeted kid on the first day and the last day of Sukkot; [and] a helmeted calf on the first day of Pesach, but not a helmeted kid. Said Rabbi Yosei, "Theodoros, a man of Rome, accustomed the people of Rome to take lambs on the nights of Passover and to prepare them 'helmeted.'" They said to him, "Even that is very close to [the forbidden] eating of consecrated foods outside [the Temple], because they would call them 'Paschal lambs.'"
Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel would grind pepper in their mill. Said Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok, "One time my father was reclining before Rabban Gamaliel, and they brought before him <i>anigron</i> (a sauce of oil and fermented fish) and <i>achsigaron</i> (a sauce of vinegar and fermented fish), and on them ground pepper, and my father withdrew his hand from them. They said to him, 'Don't be concerned about them, for they were ground from Erev Yom Tov.'" These are "ground." What is "curried"? That [which is done] with a small[-toothed comb] that makes a wound. "Scraped": That [which is done] with a large-[toothed comb] that does not make a wound. Rabbi Shimon says, a person may drag a bed, chair, bench, or <i>cathedra</i> (a soft-cushioned chair with a back) by himself on Shabbat and, needless to say, on Yom Tov. A door that is dragged, a mat that is dragged, and latticed gate that are dragged [and used to close up openings]: They may open and close them on Shabbat and, needless to say, on Yom Tov. 

Chapter 3

In an enclosure for wild animals or for fowl or for fish, they may not trap them on Yom Tov, nor may they place food before them; however, they may trap them from Erev Yom Tov, and they may place food before them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, not all enclosures are the same. This is the general rule: [If] the trap is inadequate (i.e., the animal must still be pursued), it is forbidden; [if] the trap is not inadequate, it is permitted.
  They may slaughter animals from <i>n'garin</i> (small ponds) but not from traps or large nets or small nets. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, anyone who spread out [the trap/net] from Erev Yom Tov, and came [on Yom Tov] and found it ruined, the matter is permitted, for it is is known that it was trapped from Erev Yom Tov. [If] he found it in the same condition that it was [when he spread it out], the matter is forbidden, [for] it is known that  that it was trapped on Yom Tov. 
"It and its young" (Lev. 22:28) that fell into a pit: Rabbi Eliezer says, he may lift out the first [on Yom Tov] on condition that it be slaughtered [that day], and the second one he may give food in its place so that it not die. Rabbi Yehoshua says, he may lift out the first on condition that it be slaughtered, but not slaughter it, and engage in deceit (i.e., purport to change his mind) and lift out the second on condition that it be slaughtered. If he wants to slaughter one of them, or not slaughter one of them, the decision is in his hand.
A first-born animal that fell into a pit: Rabbi Shimon says, even though its blemish was known from Erev Yom Tov, [if] an expert had not [yet] rendered it permitted, they may not slaughter it on Yom Tov, because it is not from that which was prepared (i.e., previously designated for consumption on Yom Tov). They may make a feeding-place for a swarm of bees so that they not escape, but they may not trap them from the outset. How so? They may not be counted [as having a share] in an animal at the outset on Yom Tov. One shall not say to [another], "I am hereby [partnering] with you [in this animal] with this sela," or "I am hereby [partnering] with you with these two [selas]." Rather, he says to him, "I am hereby [partnering] with you for half, or for a third, or for a quarter [of this animal]." And the Sages say (Beit. 3:6), one may not gaze at a scale whatsoever, but he may weigh [an animal by hand] and set it down, and if there was a butcher [who was] an expert at weighing by hand, [he may not do so] because his hand is like a scale. But he may cut it with a utensil and give [the cuts of meat] to this one and to that one.
A person may walk to the usual butcher where he lives and say to him, "Give me a foreleg" [or] "[Give me] a hind leg"; or to the usual baker  and say to him, "Give me a loaf" [or] "[Give me] a roll"; or to the usual animal-dealer where he lives and say to him, "Give me a chick" [or] "[Give me] a chicken"; or to the usual shopkeeper where he lives and say to him, "Give me fifty walnuts" [or] "[Give me] ten eggs" [or] "[Give me] ten pomegranates," as long as [the seller] does not tell him the total amount (i.e., the price) of his purchase. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, as long as he does he does not tell him the total amount of his account. 
A person may not place [any food] before his children or before his animals either by measure or by weight or by number, but he may cut a hole in a seah-measure or in a <i>tarkav</i> measure and place  it before his animals, or cut a hole in a ladle and place it before his children, as long as he does not intend [to measure with it]. They said about Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok and Abba Shaul ben Botnit, that they were shopkeepers in Jerusalem all the days of their lives, and they would fill their measuring vessels from Erev Yom Tov and set them out for the buyers on Yom Tov. Rabbi Chananiah ben Antigonos says, even on the intermediate days of the festivals they would do so on account of the neglect of the study halls [on those days]. And the Sages say, even on weekdays days they would do so for the sake of draining the measures (see Beitzah 29a:12-13). One of them even brought three hundred jugs of oil and the other [brought] three hundred jugs of wine for the sake of draining the measures, and they brought [the wine and oil that had dripped out] up to the [Temple] treasurers. [The treasurers] said to them, "You need not do this." They said to them, "We do not desire [to keep] it." They said to them, "Since you were stringent on yourselves, let this belong to the public, and let it be used for the public need."
They may not remove wood from a sukkah even on the last Yom Tov of Sukkot. If he said [beforehand], "When I wish to, I will remove it," behold, this is permitted. They may not bring wood, either with rope or with a basket or with a mat, but they bring it with an apron or in the fold of a garment (i.e., in an unusual manner).
Said Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about gathered [wood] that is in a <i>karpef</i> (an enclosure outside the Shabbat boundaries), that they may bring it in, or about scattered [wood] that is in a field, that they may not bring it in. About what did they disagree? About scattered [wood] that is in a field, for Beit Shammai say they may not bring it in, and Beit Hillel say they may bring it in. Said Rabbi Natan, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about scattered [wood] that is in a <i>karpef</i> or about gathered [wood] that is in a field, they they may bring it in. About what did they disagree? About scattered [wood] that is in a field, for Beit Shammai say they may not bring it in, and Beit Hillel say they may bring it in.
A bed and a chair and a bench and a <i>catedra</i> and a kneading-trough that broke apart, and so too a beam that broke, and so too a pile of beams that broke, they may not kindle from them on Yom Tov because they are not from the prepared. Walnuts and almonds that he ate from Erev Yom Tov: They may kindle their shells on Yom Tov. The walnuts and almonds themselves may not be kindled on Yom Tov, for they are not from the prepared. The Sages agree with Rabbi Meir that in regards to marked enclosures on the ground, they may untie, loosen them, or unravel them, but they may not cut them, or on Shabbat they may unravel or loosen them but not untie them, nor cut them, and as to those that are on vessels, it is permitted, and needless to say, on Yom Tov. A person may tear the leather that is on the mouth of a wine jug or [a jug of] fish brine, as long as he intends to make a spout.
They may not open a tightly covered stewpot, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel permits it. They may not extinguish a log to save it; but to prevent the house from filling with smoke or the stew from burning, it is permitted. A person may not place a stone (אבן) on top of log in order to break it, but he may throw it into a hole to break it. They may not make a charcoal on Yom Tov even for the same day (Beitzah 4:4), but they may sweeten mustard with a burning coal. They may not blow on (i.e., fan) a fire with a bellows, but they blow on it with a reed tube. They may not make a spit, and they may not sharpen it. They may may not split open a reed to roast salted [fish] with it, but they may split open a walnut with an apron and need not be concerned on account of tearing.
An new oven or portable stove, behold, they are like any other vessel, and they may transport them [on Yom Tov], but they may not rub oil on them, and they may not wipe them down with strip of cloth, nor may one wipe them with cold water in order to harden them, [but] if it is in order to bake with them, it is permitted. Neither men nor women may be carried out on a sedan chair, nor a blind person with his cane, nor a shepherd with his traveling bag. Rabbi Eliezer bar Yishmael says, they even may not drive the livestock with a staff on Yom Tov.
Rabbi Eliezer says, a person may pick up a chip to pick his teeth with it (Beitzah 4:6), and the Sages say, he may only take it from the manger that is before the livestock, as long as he does not cut it off to pick his teeth with it. If he cut it off on Shabbat, he is liable for a sin offering; on Yom Tov, forty lashes. Rabbi Eliezer says, he may gather [kindling material] from a courtyard and light it, as long as he does not arrange it into piles, and Rabbi Shimon permits it, as everything in a courtyard is [considered] prepared.
They may not scald the head or legs [of an animal that is being cooked], and they may not smear it with clay or earth [to remove its hair], but they may singe it with fire. And they not trim [the hair] of its head or its legs, and they may not trim vegetables with garden shears, but he may trim the horns [of an animal] and of <i>achbiyot</i> (edible thistles). And they may kindle and bake in a large baker's oven, and heat water [in a kettle suspended] on a kettle-stand, but they may not kindle a large baker's oven to bake in it for the first time.
They stated six matters regarding a wick, three to be stringent and three to be lenient. These are the three to be stringent: They may not make it <i>ab initio</i> [on Yom Tov], and they may not singe it with fire, and they may not cut it in two. These are the three to be lenient: They may soak it in oil, and crush it by hand, and cut it with fire for two candles.

Chapter 4

One who eats figs from Erev Yom Tov and brings the leftovers up to the top of the roof to make them into dried figs, he may not eat from them on Yom Tov because they are not from the prepared. One who eats grapes from Erev Yom Tov and brings the leftovers up to the top of the roof to make them into raisins, he may not eat from them on Yom Tov because they are not from the prepared.  [If there were] branches of a fig tree with figs on them, [or] branches of a date palm with dates on them, and he brought them in for kindling, they may not eat from them on Yom Tov. [If he intended to use them] for animal fodder, he may eat from them on Yom Tov.
There are four things [for which one may be liable that are] optional, and four things [for which one may be liable that involve] commandments. One who weaves two threads, whether for sacred garments or regular garments, and one who writes two letters, whether for sacred writings or regular writings, on Shabbat is liable for a sin offering; on Yom Tov, he receives forty lashes. And one who weaves one thread, whether for sacred garments or regular garments, or writes one letter, whether for sacred writings or for regular writings, on Shabbat is liable for a sin offering, and on Yom Tov, he receives forty lashes, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say, whether on Shabbat or Yom Tov, he is only liable on account of [the positive commandment] to rest.
These are [the matters for which one may be liable] on account of [the decree] to rest (Beitzah 5:2): They may not climb a tree or ride on top of an animal, and they may not swim in the water. And they may not clap hands, nor slap their thighs, or dance. And these are [the things for which one may be liable] on account of being optional: They may not judge and they may not betroth, and they may not perform <i>chalitza</i> and they may not perform levirate marriage. And these are [the matters for which one may be liable] on account of being a commandment: They may not consecrate, and they may not engage in valuations, and they may not make a vow of prohibition, nor may they separate terumah and tithes. And all of these [apply] on Yom Tov, and it can be logically deduced [that they apply] on Shabbat. And there is no difference between Yom Tov and Shabbat except for the preparation of food.
Animals and vessels [have the same restrictions] as the legs of their owners (Beitzah 5:3). One who gives over his animal to his son or to a shepherd, behold, [the animal] is like his legs. Specialized vessels [designated] for one of his brothers that is in his house, behold, they are like his legs, and those are not specialized [can be taken] to a place that everyone goes to. He may travel in the north according to the [Shabbat boundary] in the south, and in the south according to [the Shabbat boundary] in the north. If they divided the boundary [between them], he may not move from his place.
A donkey: Like the legs of a donkey-driver. A cow: Like the legs of a farmhand. Livestock: Like the legs of a shepherd. Rabbi Dosa says, one who purchases livestock from his fellow on Erev Yom Tov, even though he may only give it over to him on Yom Tov, behold, it is like the legs of the buyer, and one who gives over livestock to a shepherd or from a shepherd, even though he has not informed the shepherd, behold, it is like the legs of the shepherd. One who purchases an animal from his fellow from Erev Yom Tov, it is like the legs of the buyer; on Yom Tov, like the legs of the seller.
One who purchases meat from a butcher from Erev Yom Tov, it is like the legs of the buyer, and on Yom Tov, like the legs of the seller. One who borrows a cloak from his fellow from Erev Yom Tov, it is like the legs of the borrower; on Yom Tov, like the legs of the lender. Two that borrowed cloak, one to walk with it in the morning to the house of study, and one to walk with it to an evening feast on Yom Tov: It is like the legs of the lender. A woman who borrowed spices, water, or salt from her friend from Erev Yom Tov: They are like the legs of the borrower; on Yom Tov, like the legs of the lender. [If] she gave them for [her friend to use] for her dough, behold, they are like the legs of both of them. Rabbi Yehuda exempts in regards to water, because it is absorbed into the dough.
The burning coal is like the legs of its owners, and the flame, in any place. Five things they stated regarding burning coals: A burning coal of the Holy may be benefited from [for non-sacred purposes]; a flame, they may enjoy it but they may not benefit it. A burning coal of idolatry is forbidden; a flame is permitted. One who takes a burning coal out of the public domain is liable; a flame, he is exempt. One who vows not to benefit from his fellow: His burning coal is forbidden, and his flame is permitted. They bless over the flame and they do not bless over the coal. 
A pit [on the border] of two tribes: One may draw [water] from it [with a bucket] and fill it on Shabbat. A pit that is between two borders: They may not fill from it on Shabbat unless they built a partition higher than ten handbreadths [over it]. Rivers and flowing springs: Behold, they are like the legs of every person.
Whoever had his produce in another city and they residents of that city made an eruv for him to bring [his produce] to his place (Beitzah 5:6), they may not bring any of his produce to him unless their legs [were permitted to travel] on account of the eruv to there. And if in that place there is a guardian [of an orphan] they may bring it on the word of the guardian. Whoever feeds guests in his place: They should not take [the food] with them unless he assigned their portions to them from Erev Yom Tov (Beitzah 5:7). What may they take out from a house of feasting (מבית המשתה (Lieberman))? A cut of meat, a loaf of white bread, and a seasoned egg (ביצה מתובלת (Lieberman)). Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, in a place that they were accustomed to divide up walnuts or roasted grains, he may take them [with him]. His son and his daughter and the small children: He may take them to a house of mourning or a house of feasting or a house of celebration. In a place where it is not the custom for [guests] to give some of their food to the son or daughter of the host, [they should not do so] on account of enmity.
They may not clean nor scrape on Yom Tov, and they may not polish silver vessels with chalk, and they may not wash vessels with soda ash on Yom Tov, but they may wash them with salt or with coarse bran on Shabbat and, needless to say, on Yom Tov. § What are the "prairie animals" (Beitzah 5:7): that go out on Passover and return with the rains. What are the "domestic animals"? Those that sleep within the [Shabbat] boundary. Rebbi says, these ones and those ones that go out of the boundary, even though they only reentered the boundary after nightfall, it is permitted to slaughter them on Yom Tov. What are the "prairie animals"? Those that always graze in pasture-land [outside of town].
