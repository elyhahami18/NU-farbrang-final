Tosefta Yoma (Lieberman)



Chapter 1


All of the chambers in the Temple were exempt from [having] a mezuzah except for the Chamber of Parhedrin, because that was a place of residence for the High Priest seven days a year. Rabbi Yehuda said, "Was there no place of residence there besides only that one? Rather, anything that is a place of residence is obligated and anything that is not a place of residence is exempt."
