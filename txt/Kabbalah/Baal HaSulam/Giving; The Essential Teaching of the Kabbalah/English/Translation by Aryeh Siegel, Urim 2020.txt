Giving; The Essential Teaching of the Kabbalah

Foreword

To R’ Aryeh Siegel,
Your great effort in the course of many years to cleave to the teachings of Baal Hasulam, and to put it into practice in your daily life, bears fruit at this time – a sweet and succulent fruit. You have translated, for the sake of the nation of Israel, a portion of the essays of Baal Hasulam’s book <i>Matan Torah</i>. And whoever brings merit to others receives great reward in this world and the next.
I hope that the people of Israel will be uplifted by the important principles in this book. It is for this that God awaits – that we will rise above the ashen life of self-love and will begin to put into practice the principles of loving the other. The book <i>Matan Torah</i> is a contemporary reflection of the holy <i>Zohar</i>, of which it is said that through it will Israel be mercifully redeemed from exile. This means that our souls will be redeemed from our exile in the depths of self-love, from our fits of anger and our fears – all of which derive from a lack of faith in God.
Best wishes to you, and may your work continue to bear fruit and bring merit to the general public. I pray that God will grant you and your family long-lasting health and the joy pursuant to the holiness found in fulfilling the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>.
From your friend,
Avraham Mordechai Gottlieb

Preamble

Rabbi Chaim Halberstam – the Tzanzer Rebbe – interpreted the following verse from Proverbs [25, 2]:
<i>“It is the honor of God to conceal things, but the honor of kings is to examine things.”</i>
<i>If a person wants to learn the wisdom of Kabbalah in order to know how many worlds and sefirot there are – that is called “the honor of God” – and even when this is in order to know the greatness of God’s glory – regarding this, the verse says “conceal things.”</i>
<i>However, if one wants to learn this wisdom in order to know how to accord kingship to God; how to worship Him with proper intention; how to sanctify</i>
<i>the 248 organs of the body; and how to become a vehicle for holiness – this is the “honor of kings” and regarding this, the verse says “examine things.”</i>
The above statement regarding the proper intention for “examining things” – that is, learning Kabbalah – appears in the introduction to the book “The Sayings of Yosef ” written by Rabbi Yosef Meir Weiss, the Spinka Rebbe. Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag inscribed it on the binding of his book “<i>Birkat Shalom.</i>”
Translator’s addition:
All of the above is a translation of the inside cover on several of Rabbi Gottlieb’s books. This is how I would briefly state the message: <b>Seeking intellectual knowledge of the Kabbalah without working toward a transformation of character brings dishonor to God. That is, it reduces God to the level of any other object of intellectual inquiry.</b>

Translator's Introduction

Fruitful study of Kabbalah is not dependent on one’s knowledge, intelligence, or talent. It requires only a desire to work on one’s character, sincerity of intention, and faith. So the intended audience of this book includes any human being with that desire. The Torah teaches that every person is destined to take part in the service of God.
<b>What is the approach of this book?</b>
This is not the typical book on Kabbalah. It does not provide details of the systems of Kabbalah or its practical use. Nor does it give a guide to meditative techniques, or outline the history of Kabbalah.
Instead, Rabbi Ashlag inspires us. He boldly and succinctly states the purpose of the Kabbalah, and our spines tingle. His message resonates even with readers that have no prior knowledge of the subject. For that reason, this book is an excellent place to begin when learning Kabbalah. The book also offers many subtleties of wisdom that experienced students of Kabbalah can appreciate.
According to Rabbi Ashlag, the Torah has one single purpose. The purpose of every element and aspect of the Torah is to enable us to acquire the desire to give to others without any intention of receiving a reward. To embrace and adopt this character is to attain the state of cleaving to God.
The teachings of the Kabbalah expose the inner wisdom in every detail of the Torah. Learning and practicing these teachings transforms our nature in the way the Torah intended. In this way, the Kabbalah transmits the essence of the teaching of the Torah.
In plain language, God asks of us to love. This may sound simple, but it turns out that it doesn’t come naturally; and it takes time and effort to learn to do it. To love others, we must uncover hidden forms of our self-interested concerns. Only then can we direct our thoughts, feelings, and actions toward giving to others. In addition, we need to recognize the aspect of divinity in each human being we encounter. When we see the greatness of others, this awakens within us our love for them. In particular, the greatness in their aspect of divinity connects our love of them to a love of God.
The divine is also within ourselves, and thus a certain form of self-love is a worthy trait. But “self-love” generally implies the preference we give to ourselves over others. So throughout this book, “self-love” refers to this undesirable love of the ego. Spiritual progress consists of moving from self-love to loving the other.
As individuals internalize loving the other, the world will draw closer to its destiny of mutual love and responsibility. Our societal focus will shift from identification with our group’s values towards identification with God’s will. The dynamics of this individual and societal transformation are spelled out in detail in the Kabbalah.
There is no shortcut to this lofty level of selflessness. Progress is gradual and not always easy. At first we will continue to seek reward, but we can refine our desire to receive, and increase our desire to give. This gradual process of refinement also brings significant rewards along the way. Yet, a crucial element of this wisdom is that we continue to aspire to the highest goal. And at the same time, we keep a clear, honest accounting of our current distance from the ideal.
Here are the words of Rabbi Gottlieb about our spiritual path: “We need to refine our desire to receive. But we need to be honest with ourselves. Our individual digestive systems cannot immediately adjust to the healthiest food. We need to change our diet step by step. In the same way, we must sense what spiritual message we are capable of digesting at each point in our development. We must move forward one step at a time in attunement with our spiritual sensitivities. On the one hand, we need to recognize the great distance between where we are and where we should be. But there’s no necessity to be in despair over the long road ahead. We should nourish ourselves with spiritual enrichment only in a way that assures we keep the strength to correct our failings.” [“Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” V – Levels of Self-love]
The open “secret” of this path is the joy that awaits one who works to develop the character of selfless giving. Why is this a secret? Because if we seek the <i>joy</i> of giving – and not just the giving – then our goal is to please ourselves. So the joy will remain hidden from us. Only after we reach a state in which our only desire is to give, will we then experience the joy.
The key is to stay on the path. I hope this book will be one of the steps along the path in the reader’s spiritual journey. Ideally, it will also show the way towards further progress. The bibliography provides suggestions of sources for further study.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda Lev Ashlag</b>
Rabbi Ashlag wrote the essays in this book with the intention of introducing the path of the Kabbalah to the general populace. An authentic spiritual path can be learned only from people of advanced spiritual development who have been blessed with an ability to communicate their experience and knowledge to others. Rabbi Ashlag met these conditions perhaps more than anyone in the modern era. Through his genius and intensity in learning, as well as complete devotion and integrity in spiritual work, he merited knowledge and revelation of the greatest heights to which a human being can aspire. His teachings and voluminous writings display clarity and systematic organization in a field rife with vagueness and confusion. These qualities have enabled him to inspire countless men and women – religious and secular, Jewish and non-Jewish – to draw closer to their Creator by means of the Kabbalah.
Rabbi Ashlag was born in Poland in 1885 and lived in the land of Israel from 1922 until his death in 1954. More details of his life can be found in the excellent biography <i>The Master of the Ladder</i> (Nehora Press, 2019). One of the two monumental works of Rabbi Ashlag is his Hebrew translation with commentary of the many volumes of the <i>Zohar</i>, which is considered to be the central text of the Kabbalah. Rabbi Ashlag titled the work <i>Hasulam</i> – Hebrew for “The Ladder” – and since its publication he has become known as “Baal Hasulam,” which means both “author of ‘Hasulam’” and “master of the ladder.” The ladder is a reference to the patriarch Jacob’s dream of a ladder connecting heaven and earth, the classic metaphor for the spiritual climb, step by step, from our earthly, selfish character toward an internalization of the divine, loving character of our Creator. Rabbi Ashlag both delineated in writing the details of the steps on the “ladder” and actually mastered the climb – hence the appropriateness of his distinctive name “Baal Hasulam.”
Since the 16th century, the teachings of Rabbi Isaac Luria – known as “the Ari” – have dominated the study of Kabbalah. However, Baal Hasulam was disappointed to find that even revered Kabbalists had failed to perceive that the intricacies of the Ari’s metaphysical system are actually a detailed guide for spiritual transformation. In <i>Talmud Eser Hasefirot</i> – the second monumental work of Rabbi Ashlag – Baal Hasulam reorganized the teachings of the Ari and clarified with extraordinary precision the definitions of Kabbalistic terms and their logical relationships – all without reliance on imagery of time or space or anything physical – only in terms of the desire to give or the desire to receive in various mixtures and levels. This element of the heart – the intention that directs our desire – provides the key to understanding the Kabbalah and to fulfilling its purpose. Baal Hasulam lived every moment in the Kabbalistic reality he described. All his life he slept very little, preferring to study, teach and write throughout the night. When working on <i>Hasulam</i>, he sometimes wrote for eighteen hours a day. The depth and breadth of Baal Hasulam’s writings take on a further dimension when we consider that, for the most part, they were published as they were written, without changes from the first draft. Apparently, he was simply systematically describing the spiritual world as he directly perceived it.
Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Gottlieb
Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Gottlieb is a disciple of the firstborn son of Baal Hasulam – Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag. After Baal Hasulam left this world in 1954 on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Rabbi Baruch Shalom was among those who continued to disseminate Baal Hasulam’s teachings. When he first encountered Rabbi Baruch Shalom, Rabbi Gottlieb felt spellbound and electrified. According to his report of that moment, Rabbi Gottlieb sensed he was in the presence of a man of God – a person with an extraordinary strength of will that was put to work in service of the Creator.
Although he was only a young teenager, and the students of Rabbi Baruch Shalom were extremely advanced, Rabbi Gottlieb became accepted as a regular participant in the classes that Rabbi Baruch Shalom gave throughout the night, as well as during part of the day. However, at the same time that Rabbi Gottlieb was absorbing the wisdom of Kabbalah, his rebbe – Rabbi Baruch Shalom – expected Rabbi Gottlieb to excel also in the traditional learning of a young Torah scholar. And Rabbi Gottlieb did indeed become recognized as an outstanding student in the study of the Talmud and the other standard areas of Torah study. This, of course, was in addition to his acquiring an extraordinary depth and breadth in his knowledge of Chassidic and Kabbalistic teachings.
It quickly became clear to Rabbi Gottlieb that his connection with Rabbi Baruch Shalom and the study of Baal Hasulam’s teachings were to constitute the single direction of his life; and so from a young age he began to devote himself whole-heartedly to this purpose. Over the course of about 14 years, Rabbi Gottlieb spent many hours daily studying with Rabbi Baruch Shalom and assisting him in a variety of capacities until Rabbi Baruch Shalom departed this world in 1991.
Since that time, in accordance with the wish of a group of students of Rabbi Baruch Shalom, Rabbi Gottlieb himself has taken on the role of a transmitter of the teachings of Baal Hasulam and Rabbi Baruch Shalom. He has already published dozens of books that elucidate their writings. A community of followers from diverse locations is centered on Rabbi Gottlieb’s <i>bet midrash</i> in Kiryat Ye’arim. Classes are given there and throughout Israel, and can also be watched online at the website: www.birkatshalom.org.
Baal Hasulam had many devoted students of great stature. Yet, due to his filial, as well as spiritual, connection perhaps none could reach Rabbi Baruch Shalom’s level of devotion and understanding. Also Rabbi Baruch Shalom had many students of a very high level. Yet, perhaps none were blessed with the single-minded devotion to his rabbi that Rabbi Gottlieb developed from an early age. Baal Hasulam himself was on a level that bars comparison to anyone. But the devotion and genius of Rabbi Baruch Shalom and Rabbi Gottlieb qualify them to be among the few that continue the authentic teachings of Baal Hasulam. Both have demonstrated an integration of heart and mind in the course of intense, ceaseless holy work. Their writings and teachings have made it possible to present the inspiring outlook of Baal Hasulam in this book.
<b>History of the Essays</b>
The main portion of this book consists of the first four essays from Baal Hasulam’s <i>Matan Torah</i> (“The Giving of the Torah<i>”</i>). These essays were written in the summer of 1933 in response to the increasing estrangement of Jews from their tradition, as well as the lack of familiarity, even among many Torah-observant Jews, with the inner meaning of Torah and its observance. Baal Hasulam saw this as “a time to act” to heal this spiritual emptiness.
In order to reach the widest possible audience, his essays were written in a language that would be readable also to people with little knowledge of Judaism, and they were distributed as pamphlets throughout the land of Israel. Although the clarity of his expression and the significance of his message did succeed in making a strong impression on his readers, at some point Baal Hasulam decided that the time was not ripe to continue publication of the pamphlets. However, in 1974 the essays were collected for the first time in the book <i>Matan Torah</i> which has since been published in several editions. This book has transformed the lives of innumerable people and merits the standing of a classic of Jewish thought.
A fuller history of the essays can be found in the highly-informative introduction to a recent Hebrew edition of <i>Matan Torah</i> (titled <i>Maamaray Hasulam – Sefer Matan Torah Hamurchav</i>), published by the organization Or Hasulam (www.orhasulam. org/) as part of their project of making available all of the writings of Baal Hasulam.
<b>The structure of this book</b>
At the end of each essay, I have added basic questions for review that are intended to assist the reader in capturing the essential points of the essay. Two of Baal Hasulam’s essays – “The Giving of the Torah” and “The Mutual Guaranty” – are divided into numbered sections. I have included bulleted highlights for these two essays at the beginning of each numbered section with its essential points. Another feature that makes this publication reader-friendly is that I have researched the sources that are quoted by Baal Hasulam and Rabbi Gottlieb and have added their references in brackets.
Rabbi Gottlieb’s notes and clarifications are critical to understanding the text and getting a wider perspective on the Kabbalistic outlook according to Baal Hasulam. Therefore, in order to enable the reading of Rabbi Gottlieb’s notes together with the text of Baal Hasulam, they have been placed immediately at the end of each paragraph to which they refer. <b>The text of Baal Hasulam remains distinguished by its indentation and by a vertical line alongside the text</b>.
In addition to his running commentary on the essays, Rabbi Gottlieb included some expanded notes on significant issues that are touched upon by Baal Hasulam. (Although some of these notes were actually written by a student, his writing was of course under the guidance of Rabbi Gottlieb.) I have created a separate section after the essays, called “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” which includes ten of these topics. This section will be helpful to those who are interested in the practical application of the approach described by Baal Hasulam.
It should be emphasized that Rabbi Gottlieb’s commentary has never before been translated into English (apart from isolated quotations in Avraham Loewenthal’s highly-recommended book, <i>Inner Work</i>). The commentary’s presence here is a unique opportunity for the English reader to benefit from a living master of the teachings of Baal Hasulam.
<b>Translation conventions</b>
At the end of the book, there is a glossary for some non-English words that appear italicized in the text. Square brackets [ ] are used for all references. For example, [Lev. 19, 18]. There are also occasional interpolations and explanations by the translator, wherever this was considered necessary for the purpose of clarity. These additions by the translator also appear within square brackets.
Permission was received from Rabbi Gottlieb and the Ohr Baruch Shalom organization to base this translation on the Hebrew book <i>Matan Torah</i> published by Ohr Baruch Shalom. The Hebrew text in the appendix is also from the Ohr Baruch Shalom edition. The commentary that appears in this book is a revised selection from Rabbi Gottlieb’s Hebrew commentary. In translating the words of Baal Hasulam, care was taken to retain the form and manner of expression as much as possible. However, regarding Rabbi Gottlieb’s comments, the essential concern was to faithfully transmit the ideas to English readers, with less strictness regarding preserving the order and form in which the ideas were expressed. Rabbi Gottlieb was consulted only regarding general issues of the translation, and of course the translator alone is responsible for any inaccuracies that may exist.
Conventional Hebrew uses the male gender form to refer to men and women collectively. However, in order to emphasize that everyone is being addressed regardless of gender, and in accordance with current practice, the translation avoids using the male gender form in this way.
<b>A personal note</b>
The work on this translation required personal reflection on the meaning behind the words of Baal Hasulam and Rabbi Gottlieb. For that reason, it seems appropriate to describe briefly my connection to spiritual wisdom.
I was first awakened to the reality of the spiritual domain via the abstract metaphysics of the philosophy of logic. Subsequently, several inspiring adventures of a mystical nature led to a universalistic faith. In the search for a means of retaining a sense of the miraculous within the routine of daily life, I participated in myriad psycho-spiritual workshops, meditations and trainings. However, the study of the Torah was unquestionably the most authentic path. My studies quickly developed into a commitment to serve God through the discipline of studying Torah and living according to its guidance. After many years of Torah study and observance, the revelation of Baal Hasulam’s teachings via Rabbi Gottlieb (more than twenty years ago) connected the astounding depths of the Torah with an uncompromising path toward self-transformation. Today my life is centered on continued study of Baal Hasulam and contact with Rabbi Gottlieb in classes and other contexts. For all this, and much more, I thank God.
I thank the many special souls that have inspired me. In particular, I thank Rabbi Gottlieb – first, for authorizing the undertaking of this translation; but more importantly, for continuing to illustrate by his example what it means to serve God with integrity and authenticity – “with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.” May God bless the Rebbe with ever-increasing success in connecting the world to the Creator by means of the teachings of Baal Hasulam and Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag. I hope that this book makes some meaningful contribution towards that goal.
I also express my gratitude to all those who have given encouragement and assistance along the way to the completion of this project, with special thanks to Avraham Loewenthal whose detailed, sensitive comments were invaluable.
Putting a twist on Descartes’ maxim, I declare:
<b>I thank therefore I am.</b>

Rabbi Gottlieb's Preface to Matan Torah

<b>“How can I repay God for all His benefits to me?”</b>
[Psalms 116, 12]
Our heart rejoices in working with the authentic Torah; the teachings of our holy rabbi Baal “Hasulam,” the living Torah.
The book <i>Matan Torah</i> was arranged by our rabbi Baal Hasulam in the form of general essays that were originally published as pamphlets, a sort of handbook for the layman. Their overall purpose was to give to reflective individuals a perspective and an authentic outlook that draws from the wisdom of the Kabbalah – on themselves and their world; on the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>; on their duties and their rights; and on what is taking place in the world in general. This book includes within it many of the foundational principles of service to God, and it is truly the beginning book for one to enter the gates of life according to the path of truth. . . .
For a number of years we have dealt with this book in the framework of classes, in the course of which new understandings and clarifications came to light. These have been collected and are presented here at the request of students who desire to enjoy and benefit from them. Our hope is that God will assist those who learn this material to acquire an authentic outlook and way of thinking that follows in the path of our rabbis. . . .
With blessings for great success to all the house of Israel.
Your friend, Avraham Mordechai Gottlieb

Essays by Baal Hasulam with Commentary by Rabbi Gottlieb

A Time to Act

<span class="poetry indentAll">For a long time now, qualms of conscience have been pursuing me daily, pushing me to make an exception to my usual conduct by writing and disseminating a fundamental essay on the soul of Judaism, religion, and the knowledge of authentic Kabbalistic wisdom. I do this so that people will gain a proper recognition and understanding of the true character and nature of these exalted matters.<sup>1</sup></span>
1. Baal Hasulam has stated elsewhere that true Kabbalistic wisdom – that is, its instruction regarding the service of God – needs to be disseminated among all strata of the people before God’s final revelation in history. Otherwise, the world will not have the sufficient preparation that makes this revelation possible. It will not suffice to absorb the wisdom that religion has already revealed to the general public, for only the authentic Kabbalah can lead to the complete spiritual development of the individual.
<span class="poetry indentAll">In bygone days in Jewish society, before the printing press was invented, there were no such things as spurious books purporting to describe the soul of Judaism, because there were almost no irresponsible authors. The reason for this was quite simple. An irresponsible person is generally not a well-known figure.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore even if someone had dared to author such a composition, it would not have been worthwhile for a scribe to copy it, as no one would give him compensation for his work that generally would cost a considerable sum. Thus the manuscript would, of necessity, have become lost. And in those days, people who were knowledgeable of matters pertaining to the soul of Judaism also would have had no interest or demand to write books of this sort, since the masses did not sense a need for knowledge of such matters. On the contrary, those who had knowledge were interested in completely concealing the matters known to them for the reason expressed in: “The honor of God is in the concealing of matters.” [Proverbs 25, 2] For we are commanded to conceal the soul of the Torah and spiritual work from those who have no need for it or are unworthy of it. This material is not to be demeaned by exhibiting it in shop windows before those who are filled with a base desire to peer at chimneys<sup>2</sup> or to speak with pride of their knowledge. For God’s honor obligates us [not to cheapen the soul of the Torah in this way].<sup>3</sup></span>
2. People who “peer at chimneys” are those who merely gaze at the heights of wisdom, but do not attempt to apply it to their lives.
3. When someone is loved, the beloved’s honor is dear in the eyes of the lover who would therefore not want it to be defiled. Similarly, here we have those for whom God is dear, and therefore they are careful that God’s treasures will not come into the hands of the unworthy or into the hands of those who have no need of them.
Baal Hasulam does not intend to say that once there was no such thing as forgery or that once there was no phenomenon at all of disseminating inauthentic teachings among the masses. Instead, earlier times are depicted in contrast to the possibility of printing today, where everyone has a computer and can print a book, and also the cost is relatively not great. Therefore, there are many books today that are from people who are not sincere, and yet these books are disseminated among the general public. Because of this, Baal Hasulam was stirred to write his books so that the masses could be exposed to the authentic Kabbalah and not just to teachings of nonsense and falsehood.
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, now that there are printing presses everywhere and authors have no need of copyists, and the high price of books has been reduced, the way has been paved for irresponsible authors also to produce whatever books they fancy for whatever motive – be it for money, for honor or the like. They do not stop to consider the nature of their work, nor even glance at its consequences.<sup>4</sup></span>
4. Since these irresponsible authors do everything only to fulfill their selfish desires, naturally they are not interested in the consequences of their actions or the authenticity of their deeds. For them, “the end justifies the means.”
<span class="poetry indentAll">And from the time such books began to multiply, their authors – without any learning or personal instruction [literally, “receiving mouth to mouth”]<sup>5</sup> from a qualified rabbi,<sup>6</sup> and even without any knowledge of those ancient texts that have connection to matters of this sort – put together ideas from themselves alone or from all kinds of nonsense. They [irresponsible authors] then claim that their words are derived from exalted matters by which can be depicted the soul of the nation and its grand treasure. And like fools, they do not know to exercise caution. Indeed they have no way of knowing that they have bequeathed distorted ideas for generations to come. And in exchange for the satisfaction of their minuscule desires, these authors are sinning and leading astray the masses for generations to come.</span>
5. This needs to be understood: What is the concept of “mouth to mouth,” for surely it would seem that the transmission of wisdom would be from mouth to ear!? The source for this is in Numbers 12:7–8: “Not so My servant Moses. He is faithful in all My house. With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in riddles, and he beholds the form of God.” The holy Or Hachaim [Rabbi Chaim ben Atar] explains that the spiritual and the material are two complete opposites, for the one is characterized by giving and perfection and the other by receiving and lack. If a prophet is not prepared for both these opposites, the prophet can go insane. In this case, there is a difference between something coming from the mouth of God and something coming out of the mouth of the prophet [who is still influenced by the material world]. This was not so in the case of Moses who was extremely refined, and whose physical form was equal to his spiritual form. Thus there was no gap between an idea coming from God’s mouth and an idea coming from Moses’s mouth, so that his speech was truly equal to God’s speech. And that is the intention behind “mouth to mouth” – that is, that there is no gap between this mouth and the other [the mouth of the transmitter of wisdom and the mouth of the receiver].
6. For a “qualified” rabbi we find two definitions: (a) “If the rabbi is similar to an angel of the Lord of hosts, then seek to learn Torah from his mouth” [<i>Moed Katan</i> 17a; “an angel of the Lord of hosts” is from the prophet Malachi 2:7] – that is, if the rabbi’s effort is to be giving, and he doesn’t want to receive in any way.
(b) If he can clearly explain, even partially, the hidden secrets and underlying purposes of Torah in a manner that is uplifting and inspires people to serve God.
<span class="poetry indentAll">And lately, the stench of such people has been growing, for they have also sunk their fingernails into the wisdom of Kabbalah without their being aware that this material is locked and bolted with a thousand seals which are still in place. Thus, anyone who attempts to delve within the Kabbalah will be unable to understand the proper significance of even one word, and certainly not the connection between one word and another. For all the true books of Kabbalah that have been written up to this very day consist only of subtle hints, and they are barely adequate for a pupil who does have prior understanding to receive the interpretation of the hints directly from a qualified Kabbalah sage. Here also “There will the great owl make her nest, and lay and hatch and brood under her shadow” [Isaiah 34, 15]<sup>7</sup>, and in our time there have multiplied the conjurers [in Hebrew, the word for “conjurers” is similar to the word for “authors”] that, by using Kabbalah, concoct such potions that are disgusting for anyone who observes them.<sup>8</sup></span>
7. The great owl is a bird of prey that nests and breeds. The prophet Isaiah wants to express that this is the situation after the destruction of the Temple – that in the most significant places, birds of prey are nesting. The parable is saying that in the soul of Judaism – that is, in the wisdom of Kabbalah – are dwelling, even today, birds of prey that haven’t the faintest knowledge of the inner meaning of things and who are destroying and trampling everything.
8. What is disgusting is that people who know nothing and have no authentic inner perception of spiritual levels by way of self-refinement make a pretense by posing and dressing themselves as those who know and understand the inner meaning of the Torah. They deliver rulings and guidance to those who would serve God and are even considered authorities regarding higher levels, and they are regarded as the “greats of the generation.”
<span class="poetry indentAll">And some of these people go so far as to set themselves on high as would be fitting for the leaders of the generation and pretend to know how to distinguish among the books of the ancient and early masters, so as to instruct the public regarding which book should be studied and which book is not to be dealt with because it is full of imaginings (God forbid). For this they are deserving of contempt and wrath, for until now such discernment was reserved only for one out of ten leaders of the generations; and today ignorant fools abuse it.<sup>9</sup></span>
9. Baal Hasulam makes a sharp attack on some of those who are called “the greats of the generation” and who make a show by giving rulings to the public regarding what to learn and what to teach, etc. – thereby actually deserving contempt and wrath. These people know absolutely nothing about the inner meaning of the Torah, yet they even feign to lead the masses in these sublime matters. Even in worldly matters, it’s seen that one who suffers from headaches would not go to a foot specialist, so why is it that in spiritual matters people rely on rabbis who have no real knowledge of such things? At the most, they could ask these rabbis regarding some matter in Jewish law which is their area of expertise, but not – as is generally accepted today – that a person who has knowledge in the Talmud is thereby certified also to make rulings and give guidance regarding inner matters.
<span class="poetry indentAll">And for this reason, the comprehension of these matters in the public mind has been greatly confounded. And what’s more, an atmosphere of disrespect has been created. Everyone considers it enough to flick through this material in a spare moment in order to reflect and comment on these lofty matters. They hurriedly cover the entire exalted world of wisdom and the authentic soul of Judaism in a single swoop (like the angel [Gabriel]) and then arrive at conclusions, each according to his current state of mind.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And these are the reasons that have caused me to behave contrary to my usual rule, and I have decided that it is time to act for God to save that which can still be saved. So I have taken upon myself to reveal a certain measure of the authentic wisdom of Kabbalah in order to disseminate it among the populace.<sup>10</sup></span>
10. Baal Hasulam was provoked to open up a small portion of the wisdom of Kabbalah (that is, only the amount fitting to be revealed) so that people could clearly see the difference between a forgery and the truth. In recent times this wisdom is very urgently needed due to the inability to maintain a minimum of the Jewish way of life without the light of the inner meaning of the Torah. This is in contrast to earlier generations, where there were higher souls and the global situation was entirely different, and therefore it was possible to maintain the Jewish way of life without reliance on the inner meaning of the Torah. Thus, in current times, there is a need for the inner meaning of the Torah due to a lack of choice – for it is impossible to perceive any authentic direction and to have the strength to follow any authentic direction without the inner meaning of the Torah. This indeed is the meaning of the ancient saying [<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Naso</i> 124b] that the redemption will come only by means of the wisdom of the Kabbalah.
<b>Questions for Review</b>
1. What is the subject of true Kabbalistic knowledge? (See note 1)
2. Why is it sometimes necessary to conceal the soul of the Torah and spiritual work? (See the essay’s fourth paragraph and note 3)
3. What does it mean for people to “peer at chimneys?” (See note 2)
4. What is the required character of a qualified teacher of Kabbalistic wisdom? (See note 6)
5. Why did Baal Hasulam feel that the time had come “to act” – a time to disseminate some of the hidden Kabbalistic wisdom? (See note 10)

Revealing a Handbreadth and Concealing Two

<span class="poetry indentAll">A familiar saying of great and renowned people, as they are about to reveal something deep, is: “<b>Behold, I am revealing a handbreadth and concealing two</b>.”<sup>11</sup> In general, our ancestors were extremely careful never to utter or write an unnecessary word, as our sages instructed us [<i>Megilla</i> 18a; Introduction to the <i>Zohar</i> with the commentary Hasulam, 18]: “A word for a <i>sela</i> [coin], silence for two.” This means that if you have something valuable to say that has a certain worth (a coin), refraining from saying it is worth twice as much. This is directed against those who spout forth superfluous words lacking content or practical use, and only do so for the audience’s pleasure in their literary quality.<sup>12</sup> This manner of speaking was strictly forbidden in the opinion of our ancestors, as is obvious by examining their words, and as I shall prove in the essays that follow. We must therefore carefully consider this oft-repeated maxim.<sup>13</sup></span>
11. The original source for this saying deals with modesty in marital relations. [Nedarim 20b and Nachmanides in “<i>Igeret Hakodesh</i>”] However, the expression has come to be used generally to say that when revealing something, you should hide more than you reveal.
12. This means that if you have something valuable to say that has a certain worth (a coin), refraining from saying it is worth twice as much. However, this needs to be understood: If you have something valuable to say, why not tell it to another person?
(a) The idea is apparently based on Proverbs 23:23: “Buy truth and don’t sell.” In Kotsk (the Chassidic dynasty founded by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Morgenstern) they interpreted this: “Any time that you can buy, don’t start to sell.” That is, if you have not yet acquired knowledge or character that will perfect your soul in accordance with the purpose of your coming to this world, you do not have permission and justification to start to cultivate others or give them spiritual healing. According to this, it follows that if you wish to acquire knowledge, you must be careful to do so from a rabbi who has already perfected all the aspects of his soul, and this is called a true rabbi. However, if we followed this principle, the world could not continue to exist; for no one today would ever consider himself as authorized and fit to teach. Therefore at this time, one should seek a rabbi that at least attempts to reach the truth, even if he has not attained perfection. In other words, when one seeks a guide, it is wrong to take whoever comes along or to rely on some external indication or public opinion. Rather one is to rely only on this attribute – that the rabbi attempts to perfect his soul.
(b) However, the verse in Proverbs can be interpreted alternatively according to the principle used by Baal Hasulam that wherever scripture writes “don’t” or “it is forbidden,” the intended meaning is that it is impossible. Therefore the interpretation of “buy truth and don’t sell” is that it is impossible to sell the truth. For the truth is not merchandisable, but belongs only to a special breed of persons who have a spiritual inclination to truth. There will be no use in any effort to impart truth to someone who is not sufficiently spiritually developed to receive it.
(c) One must be silent so as not to deliver the soul of the Torah to those who peer at chimneys and to those who are ruled by their cravings, as Baal Hasulam stated in the previous essay.
13. Since our ancestors were so careful not to speak superfluous words, certainly there is deep meaning to the words in their maxim: “Revealing a handbreadth and concealing two,” and it is to this that Baal Hasulam alludes. For if they were not precise in their words and wanted only to declare the general idea that a certain portion should be revealed and a certain portion concealed, then they could have said, “revealing two handbreadths and concealing four handbreadths,” or something to this effect. Thus, on the contrary, in these exact words is certainly hidden some deep meaning.
<b>Three Types of Concealment in Wisdom</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There are three categories of secrets of the Torah, and each category has its own reason for concealment. They are called by these names: (a) “the unnecessary,” (b) “the impossible” and (c) “a divine secret for those in awe of God.” Even the smallest detail of this wisdom can be divided into these three categories,<sup>14</sup> and I will explain each one in turn.</span>
14. Just as we see that the form of the whole universe exists within any physical particle that is considered, so in the spiritual realm, every “particle” of wisdom includes the whole system in miniature. Therefore in any spiritual matter, there are these three types of concealment, for the rule is that the particular and the general are equal. The root of the idea is that the Creator is enclothed in any particular of the world, and thus there is no difference among the particulars in this regard, as the Creator exists within each one. Some people err in thinking that since the Creator is a universal whole – His glory fills the world – therefore it’s impossible for His glory to be in one person. Rather they think that a portion of the Creator is in one person, and another portion is in another person. However, when the soul merits to be attached to the Creator, it sees that there is no such thing as parts within the Creator. Thus, within each particular is included the entire whole.
<b>The Unnecessary</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“Unnecessary” means that no one will reap any benefit from its revelation. Of course, there is no great harm in revealing such a thing. It is rather a matter of purity of mind – taking care to avoid actions based on the corrupting “so what?” mentality. That is, thinking: “So what if I do this, since it causes no harm or loss?”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Know that “so what?” is considered by our sages to be a corruptor more terrible than any other; for all the destroyers of the world who have been created or have yet to be created are none other than this type of person who indulges in thinking “so what?” That is, they involve themselves in unnecessary matters and cause others to do so. For this reason, no pupil was accepted before clearly ascertaining that the pupil would be watchful in his dealings so as not to reveal anything deemed unnecessary.<sup>15</sup></span>
15. The significance of this category is that those with the attitude of “so what?” have separated themselves from the Creator. Addressing the Creator, the liturgical poem “Song of Unification” says: “In Your work You have not forgotten even one thing, You have not given preference nor left out anything.” Every act of the Creator is true, balanced and measured for a completely absolute purpose, and must be executed until complete attainment of its goal. Thus, anyone whose approach is “so what?” has a different character from the Creator. And not only this, but in addition, the existence of the Creator is thus denied, for any act or occupation that is unnecessary constitutes complete disregard of the Creator.
The distinction between necessary and unnecessary is quite simple. Anything that is a command of the Creator, or somehow leads to attachment to the Creator, is necessary. Anything that does not lead to this is unnecessary. Therefore some of the teachers of wisdom would examine those who came to learn Torah from them in order to determine that they had nothing “unnecessary” about them – not in deed, nor in speech, nor in thought.
<b>The Impossible</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The meaning of “impossible” is that language is incapable of expressing anything of the character of these ideas due to their extremely ethereal and spiritual nature.<sup>16</sup> Therefore any effort to enclothe them in words is likely only to deceive those who delve into them and lead them down a worthless path, which would be considered an unbearable sin. Therefore, in order to reveal something of these matters, one must have permission from heaven, which is the second aspect of the concealment of wisdom. However, this matter of permission requires further clarification.</span>
16. There are divine revelations that can enter a person’s feeling within his or her mind and heart, yet cannot be expressed externally because of their great loftiness. However, in other places, Baal Hasulam claims that Kabbalists discovered a readily accessible language that enables them to express their perceptions, and this language is the language of “branch and root.” The series of worlds from higher to lower are like a series of a stamp that creates an impression of the stamp, which in turn creates an impression of the impression of the stamp, and so on. The highest stamp is the root and the impressions are the branches. In this way, all the phenomena of this physical world are emanated with complete precision from spiritual worlds. Therefore the Kabbalists can express their perceptions – even though they are completely spiritual and abstracted from all materialization – by referring to the physical branches that are related to those spiritual roots that are perceived by the Kabbalists. And if this is so, then: Why is this language not sufficient to express even the most subtle spiritual perceptions? In reply, it can be said that there are different ways to use the language of the branches, and one needs permission from heaven in order to use the language of the branches in a manner that will not cause anyone to err.
<b>Permission from Heaven</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This matter is explained in the book “Gateway to the Sayings of Rashbi”<sup>17</sup> authored by the Ari<sup>17</sup> (discussing volume 4 page 100 of the <i>Zohar</i> on the Torah portion <i>Mishpatim,</i> under the heading “The Son of Yochai Knew to Guard his Way”). These are the words of the Ari there: Know that some souls of the righteous have the quality of surrounding light and some have the quality of inner light (whose explanation can be found in my book <i>Glowing Countenances</i> [<i>Panim Meirot</i>], in the chapter “Those that Surround,” Section 48). All those who come from the aspect of surrounding light have the capacity to speak of concealed matters and secrets of the Torah by means of masking and great hiding so that only those who are fitting to understand them will comprehend.<sup>18</sup> Now, the soul of Rashbi was from the aspect of surrounding light, and so he had the capacity to enclothe matters and expound them in such a way that, even should he express them publicly, only those who were fitting to understand his words would comprehend them. He was therefore given “permission” to author the <i>Zohar</i>, and “permission” to write a book on this wisdom was not granted to his teachers and predecessors, even though they were certainly more familiar with this wisdom than he was. The reason for this was that they did not have the capacity to enclothe matters as he could. And therefore it is stated, “The son of Yochai knew to guard his way ” [<i>Zohar Mishpatim</i> 100b] From this, you can appreciate the great degree of concealment in the <i>Zohar</i> that Rashbi wrote, for not just any mind can grasp his words. (Here ends the quote from the Ari.)</span>
17. “Rashbi” is the acronym for Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and “the Ari” refers to Rabbi Yitzchak Luria.
18. [Divine light can be so pleasing that it will be tempting to receive it in order to get the pleasure, instead of receiving it with the pure intention of fulfilling God’s purpose for creation.] Those that have a screen [filter that discerns what light can be received with proper intention] will be able to receive only that portion of the divine light – called the “inner light” – that can be received with the intention to give. However, the “surrounding light” is what cannot be received at this stage with the intention to give. The surrounding light is the much greater light that illuminates from afar, and reaches even those who are banished to a great distance from it. Each person receives something from this light in accord with that person’s spiritual state, and the more we work to follow the path of attachment to God (even while still dominated by defilement), the greater will be our illumination from the surrounding light.
The soul of Rashbi was from the surrounding light which is much greater than the inner light as previously noted; for the surrounding light is not limited by the soul’s vessels, but the inner light is limited by them. Thus Rashbi revealed the <i>Zohar</i> to the whole community of Israel with great sagacity, and each person can get some feeling from it, some illumination to his soul. However, a true understanding of the <i>Zohar</i> – that is, when the surrounding light shines within as inner light – is still only for those who struggle to perfect themselves, each according to his or her level. The path of spiritual work is to invest effort in learning as a means to draw down the light of the Torah from this surrounding light. Each person merits according to his or her level until the light of the Torah perfects him or her, and the surrounding lights become inner. This is the purpose of learning the inner meaning of Torah: To draw from the surrounding lights whatever is relevant to the soul of the individual.
<span class="poetry indentAll">The essence of his words is that the matter of clarification of issues within Kabbalah is not at all dependent on the greatness or smallness of the Kabbalist involved. Rather it is a matter of the special illumination of the soul with respect to this specific task, and this illumination of the soul constitutes “permission” from heaven to reveal the higher wisdom.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We thus learn that someone who has not been awarded this permission is forbidden to put forth clarifications of this wisdom, being unable to enclothe these delicate matters in suitable language such that students will not stumble in it.<sup>19</sup> For this reason, there is no organized book of Kabbalah that preceded the <i>Zohar</i> of Rashbi. All prior books of this wisdom are not to be considered explanations of wisdom but rather general hints, and they do not contain any logical order, as is clear to anyone familiar with the subject. This is the end of our explanation of the words of the Ari.</span>
19. In general, secrets of the Torah are the teachings regarding divine revelation and regarding the preparation required in order to merit such revelation. Clarifications of this wisdom must not be made by anyone without “permission.” How can someone know that he or she has merited this license or not? As a first step, you must feel that these matters are precious, and then you will naturally want to conceal them just as people hide their material treasures. This is similar to a person who has a very precious treasure in his or her house and hides it so no one will see it; because if care is not taken, disreputable people will try to steal the treasure and bring it into their unclean domain. Therefore before you reveal the existence of the treasure, you must check out very carefully who is there with you, and only if you find that they are completely honest can you reveal that you have this treasure. Furthermore, you should be capable of providing a hint – that is, you should be able to reveal this wisdom in a manner such that only those who have awe of heaven will understand, and others will not understand.
How can it be that people without superior character are able to perceive these matters, and what bad will come from their perceiving them? As Baal Hasulam explains in the introduction to <i>Panim Meirot,</i> we are dealing with people who, on the one hand, are high souls who indeed long for the perception of divine truths, and on the other, are not yet completely clean of the defilement of the desire to receive. Therefore they can do harm: In the best case, they may seek some gain from this wisdom in order to satisfy material lusts; and in a worse case, they may do spiritual harm by injecting corruption into the arrangement of spiritual worlds.
<span class="poetry indentAll">To this should be added – according to what I have received from Kabbalists and books on Kabbalah – that from the time of Rashbi and his students who were responsible for the <i>Zohar</i> until the time of the Ari, none of the authors of Kabbalah books during this period understood the <i>Zohar</i> and the <i>Tikunim,</i> as well as the Ari. All the works that preceded him, including those of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, are only hints to this wisdom.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">It is fitting to say the same about the Ari, as he himself said about Rashbi. That is, that before the Ari, permission was not given from heaven to reveal the explanations of the Kabbalah, and the Ari was given this permission. There is no distinction to be made here between greatness and limited understanding, as it is perfectly possible that the level of those who preceded the Ari was inestimably greater than his level. Nonetheless, they were not given permission to reveal this wisdom. Therefore they did not write explanations related to the essence of this wisdom but contented themselves with short and disconnected hints. For this reason, from the moment that the books of the Ari were revealed to the world, everyone involved with learning Kabbalah ceased to study the works of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero and of all the others who preceded the Ari – as is well-known to those involved with Kabbalah – and they focused all their energy exclusively on the writings of the Ari. Thus the principal works that are considered proper explanations of the Kabbalah are only the <i>Zohar</i> and the <i>Tikunim</i>, and after them, the works of the Ari.<sup>20</sup></span>
20. Also regarding Baal Hasulam himself, it is fitting to say the same things that he said regarding Rashbi and the Ari. Namely, that without doubt, he received a special soul from the aspect of surrounding light, which constitutes the giving of permission from heaven. Therefore he is the third in the order of generations that has written a true exposition of this wisdom and not just by way of hints. Apparently, this is according to the needs of the generation.
<b>A Divine Secret for Those in Awe of God</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This means that the secrets of the Torah are made clear only to those who have awe of His name and guard His honor with all their soul and might, so that they should never give rise to any profanation of God’s name.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is the third category of concealment of Kabbalah, and it is the most serious form of concealment for the reason that many have fallen as a result of such revelations. Those who rely on vows and amulets come from this category, as well as those who employ practical Kabbalah, thereby trapping souls with their craftiness. There are all kinds of mystics who use dried-up teachings that came from unworthy disciples [of Kabbalah masters], and derive from them physical benefit for themselves or others; and the world has suffered and continues to suffer greatly from their teachings.<sup>21</sup></span>
21. Baal Hasulam’s unwavering requirement is that the secret of God will be shown only to those that have awe of Him – that is, the Holy One blessed be He is dear to them, and they would never want His honor to be profaned by passing this secret to those who want to get physical benefits – such as money and power and ecstasies – from the divine wisdom. Since drops of wisdom do sometimes get to people still enslaved to selfish desires, these people use what they learn to make a pretense of being Kabbalistic masters. They claim to know how to use the holy names of God, as taught in practical Kabbalah, for the purpose of physical healing or to create supernatural phenomena.
All of this is a profanation of God, for the divine wisdom is intended for those who want to perfect themselves, to abandon self-love by means of the divine light. All their interest is to get to a state where they are serving the Creator in order to please Him, but these other individuals are only interested in themselves. They use the divine light for the opposite of its intended purpose. One must be careful of such people, and Baal Hasulam expressed disapproval even if they were using practical Kabbalah for worthwhile matters.
How does the above fit in with the fact that Rabbi Chaim Vital and other greats of Israel publicized different names of God that could be used to help with all kinds of practical matters? Apparently they believed that only people at the level of “the palace of the King” (a high level of closeness to God) would be able to really use this. For other people, the names would not work, and so they would not find any benefit in them; and people in “the palace of the King” would use the names properly – only in accordance with the will of God.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Know that the essential root of concealment of Kabbalah from its very beginning was completely on account of this third category alone. Out of this concern, the sages took strict precautions in examining prospective pupils, as the Talmud states [<i>Chagigah</i> 13a]: “Only to a head of court is transmitted an outline of the secrets of the Torah, and only if his heart trembles with concern.” Similarly, “we do not expound the matter of creation to two students, and the matter of the chariot not even to one.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">There are many similar statements, and all of this awe is based on what is explained above. For this reason, few are the exceptional people who have merited this wisdom, and even those who have met all the myriad criteria remain sworn with strict and awesome vows not to reveal anything at all of the three above categories. (See regarding this the introduction by Rabbi Moshe Botril to <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> [<i>The Book of Creation</i>].)</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now, do not misunderstand my division of three categories regarding the concealing of the Kabbalah. I definitely do not mean that the wisdom of truth is itself divided into three categories. My intention is that every detail in the vast realm of Kabbalah – even the smallest word – is subject to these three categories of restriction, for these are simply three styles of explanation that always apply to this wisdom. Understand this.<sup>22</sup></span>
22. It works out that, corresponding to the three forms of concealment of wisdom that are due to the three problems that Baal Hasulam listed, there are three manners of clarification for every subject in wisdom. Therefore if you do not stick to a certain manner of clarification, then you are liable to produce its corresponding problem. [Saying what is unnecessary can cause separation from God, so one must say only what is necessary for the generation. Saying what is impossible can mislead, so one must say only what is possible by virtue of having received permission from heaven. Saying secrets intended only for those in awe of God can harm the honor of God, so one must say these secrets in a way that only the God-fearing will understand.]
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, it makes sense to ask at this point: Given that the teaching of Kabbalah has been so seriously restricted by virtue of the above criteria, how can it be that thousands of books have been published on it?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The answer is that there is a distinction between the first two categories of concealment and the last one. The main weight of the task of concealment falls only on the last category for the reason explained above. However, the prohibition regarding the first two categories is not fixed. For example, something which is considered “unnecessary” may, as a result of changing conditions, become “necessary.” Similarly, something which is considered “impossible” may become “possible” for one of two reasons: either because a generation has progressed in its development; or because of the granting of permission from heaven – as happened in the case of Rashbi and the Ari and as happened (to a lesser degree) in the case of those who preceded them. It is for these reasons that all the authentic books on wisdom that have been written were produced and came to be revealed.<sup>23</sup></span>
23. The issue of “necessary” or “not necessary” is of course relative to souls. Therefore it can happen that wisdom becomes “necessary” due to the state of the generation that is in need of a certain illumination from the wisdom of Kabbalah for the purpose of serving God or for its spiritual development. Also the “impossible” can become “possible” due to the development of the generation. That is, things that were impossible to reveal in previous generations may need to be revealed in later generations now that they have developed the ability to assimilate such ideas. “Giving permission from heaven” also is related to the need of individual souls, but Baal Hasulam distinguishes this from the development of the generation. This is because a Kabbalistic sage may receive permission from heaven to reveal sublime matters, even when it is not fitting for the people of that generation, but it is needed for people in a period that is several generations after the life of the sage. The primary cause for the delay in receiving revelation is that the generations require a stretch of time to allow the enfolding of succeeding states in the process of their spiritual development – this depending upon the extent they feel afflicted and the conclusions they draw from their afflictions. The upshot of all this is that the switching of the “unnecessary” to be “necessary” and of the “impossible” to be “possible” is only for the benefit of the souls in their development.
<span class="poetry indentAll">And this is what the sages intended in their phrase: “I revealed a handbreadth and will conceal two.” Their intention was that a situation arose in which it became appropriate to reveal something that had not been imagined by those who lived prior to this situation. The single “handbreadth” refers to the one category of concealment that can now be revealed, while the other two categories continue to be concealed. This expression is their manner of indicating that something happened to remove one of the reasons for concealment – either the unnecessary became necessary or permission was granted from heaven as I explained above. This is what is expressed in the saying: I revealed “a handbreadth.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Those who study these pamphlets [the essays later published in “<i>Matan Torah</i>”] should know that my intention is to publish them in the course of this year. All of them are new, having not appeared as a whole, or with such precise and authentic content, in any book that preceded me. I received them directly as oral teachings from my master who was authorized to do so; that is, who himself received them as oral tradition from his teachers, and so on.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Know also that I received them with all the above-mentioned conditions of concealing and guarding. However, because of the necessity that I discussed in my article “A Time to Act,” the unnecessary has become necessary, and so I reveal this handbreadth with full permission as I have explained above. Nonetheless, I will continue to guard the remaining two handbreadths as I was commanded.<sup>24</sup></span>
24. Baal Hasulam revealed his teachings as a response to the continued cheapening of the wisdom of Kabbalah due to the increase in books authored by those who know absolutely nothing about the holy Kabbalistic concepts. Kabbalah has been mixed with opinions based on defilement and self-love, and this has caused it to become viewed by the public as empty of content and lacking all substance. The Kabbalah is divine wisdom, and it was forbidden to permit these people to profane it. Therefore Baal Hasulam was provoked to write his pamphlets in order to stop the activity of this defilement and to rescue God’s honor from being profaned.
Furthermore, we see from his words that he revealed his teachings because the “unnecessary” changed to “necessary” and not because of permission from heaven that causes the “impossible” to become “possible.” However, it’s clear to us that he did receive permission from heaven, for the whole character of his explication is not a man-made work but divine light. Without divine light, it would not be possible to clarify what he clarified. So apparently he wrote as he did out of modesty, because he did not want to say explicitly that he received permission from heaven and thus place himself at the same level as Rashbi and the Ari. But in another context [<i>Pri Chacham</i>, “The Teaching of the Kabbalah and its Essence”] our rabbi writes explicitly the following:
“I am glad that I have been born in such a generation when it is permitted to disclose the wisdom of truth. Should you ask, “How do I know that it is permitted?” I will reply to you that I have been given permission to disclose it. Until now, the ways by which it is possible to publicly teach and to fully explain each word have not been revealed to any sage. I too swore to my teacher not to disclose things, as did all the students before me. However, this oath and this prohibition apply only to those matters that are given orally from generation to generation, back to the prophets and before. Had these ways been revealed to the public, they would cause much harm, for reasons that are hidden from us.
By contrast, the way that I employ in my books is certainly a permitted way, and I have even been instructed by my teacher to expand it as much as I can. We call it “the way of enclothing things.” Check the writings of Rashbi to see that he calls this “giving permission,” and this is what the Creator has given me to a complete extent. It is accepted generally that the giving of permission is dependent not on the greatness of the sage, but on the state of the generation. This is why I said that my being rewarded with the manner of disclosing the wisdom is because of my generation.” [End of quote from Baal Hasulam]
The subject of “permission from heaven” divides into two opposite matters:
(a) From an “external” point of view, Baal Hasulam received the ability to explain things in a way that would give each person a connection so that it could effect a change in him or her. Thus, the meaning of “permission from heaven” is the teacher’s ability to reveal things.
(b) The perception of the inner meaning of things is dependent on the individual’s progress in (a) strengthening his or her faith and (b) restricting the desire to receive and increasing the desire to give. This also is part of the concept of “permission from heaven,” but from the opposite direction [the student’s ability to hear] – that is, the teacher was given permission to hint in coded language that can be decoded only by one who really lives by these teachings.

The Giving of the Torah



Chapter 1

<span class="poetry indentAll">“<b>. . . and love your fellow as yourself . . .</b>” [Lev. 19:18]</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Rabbi Akiva says: “This is a great general principle of the Torah.” [<i>Midrash Raba</i>, Genesis Ch. 24]</span>
<small>Love the other as yourself.</small>
<small>This is all of the Torah.</small>
<small>How does this principle include <i>mitzvot</i> regarding our relationship with God?</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">[Please see the glossary for the meaning of <i>mitzvot</i>.]</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This statement of our sages cries out for explanation. For the expression “general principle” [in Hebrew, <i>klal</i>] implies a number of particulars that come together to make up the general principle.<sup>25</sup></span>
25. The Hebrew word <i>klal</i> is ambiguous. It can mean “a principle” or it can refer to the entirety of something. For example, the expression <i>klal Yisrael</i> refers to all the people of Israel.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus, when Rabbi Akiva says that the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself” is a great general principle of the Torah, what he means is that the remaining 612 <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah – together with all its verses<sup>26</sup> – are no more than, nor any less than, all of the particulars that are included and assimilated within the single commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself.”</span>
26. The single goal of all of the Torah is to develop in us the character of loving the other. This includes the <i>mitzvah</i> to love the other as yourself and the other 612 <i>mitzvot</i> as well – and even all the verses in the Torah that contain stories which are not connected to the performing of <i>mitzvot.</i>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is surely a surprising statement, because, although it might be justified in the case of those <i>mitzvot</i> regarding interpersonal relations, how can the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself” include and support within it all the <i>mitzvot</i> between people and God – which are the essential principles of the Torah and the majority of its makeup?<sup>27</sup></span>
27. It makes sense that the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> with all their particulars – such as, “do not avenge;” “do not bear a grudge;” “do not disregard” (a lost object that can be returned); “do not steal;” etc. – all weave together one common thread. That common thread is the training to acquire a different nature – the nature to be considerate of the other and to truly acknowledge his or her existence. These interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> create the desire to give selflessly to the other. In plain language, they create love of the other, where loving implies perceiving in the most exaggerated manner the virtues and the significance of the other person. Just as we have high regard for our own significance, so we must recognize that each individual is a completely unique and valuable treasure. But how are the <i>mitzvot</i> between people and God – phylacteries [<i>tefillin</i>], Sabbath, sacrifices, blowing the shofar – connected to this transforming education that we are expected to undergo?

Chapter 2

<small>Hillel clearly said that loving the other is all of the Torah.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Even if we could strain ourselves and find some way to settle the difficulty in the above statement,<sup>28</sup> we have before us a second statement even more remarkable [from <i>Shabbat</i> 31a] regarding the prospective convert who came to Hillel and said to him, “<b>Teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one leg</b>.” Hillel replied to him, “<b>Whatever is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow – and all the rest is commentary. Go and learn</b>.”<sup>29</sup></span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Here we have a clear pronouncement that nothing has more significance in all the 612 <i>mitzvot</i> and all the verses of the Torah than the one commandment “and love your fellow as yourself,” because they come only to explain and enable us to fulfill the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself” to its full extent. For Hillel explicitly states: “All the rest is commentary. Go and learn.” That is, all the remaining contents of the Torah are an elucidation of this single commandment, and it is impossible to complete the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself” without them.<sup>30</sup></span>
28. Rabbi Akiva said “this is <b>a</b> great <i>klal,</i>” and indeed he shows it to be a general principle, but it still may not be unique, for there are other general principles. This particular general principle might be seen to include as its particulars the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i>, but not the <i>mitzvot</i> between each individual and God. Therefore Baal Hasulam quotes Hillel’s words to the convert, for there it is explicit that indeed “and love your fellow as yourself” is <b>the</b> general principle of all of the Torah. Then, after having brought the words of Hillel, we must interpret also Rabbi Akiva as having intended that “and love your fellow as yourself” is the general principle of all of the Torah.
29. There are two levels for the <i>mitzvah</i> of “and love your fellow as yourself,” two levels for consideration of the other person: The first – don’t do to your friend what is hateful to you. We usually fail to abide by this. For example, we preach to others, although we would not want them to preach to us. No one wants to be told what to do unless we are told by a great person. The second – do for the other whatever will make him or her feel composed. These two levels parallel “avoid evil” (the negative) and “do good” (the positive).
According to this, why did Hillel choose to present to the convert the negative side of “and love your fellow as yourself” – that is, don’t do to your friend what is hateful to you? Why didn’t he tell him directly the positive side? One answer is that the negative side is more understandable; it fits better into the usual mindset. For anyone can appreciate that whatever is hateful to oneself is certainly not something that one should cause another. However, it’s much more difficult to understand that I have to get up and do something for others the way I do for myself. And since we are dealing with a prospective convert who wants to take on the religion of Israel, Hillel started him out on the easy path. But he said to him: You’ve got to complete also the rest of the Torah, for the rest of the Torah is an elucidation of this. Hillel relied on the light of the Torah to gradually show the convert the required development of an individual to get to the complete realization of “and love your fellow as yourself.”
Regarding the convert’s saying, “Teach me all the Torah while I stand on one leg,” there are many meanings. The simple meaning: Teach me briefly the essential principle of the Torah. But there are other meanings: Human beings walk on two legs. One leg is called “afflictions” and the other leg is called “pleasure.” For afflictions push us away from one state to the next, and pleasures pull us toward them. Thus the concept of walking is a physical illustration of the abstract concept of transition from one state to another. In general, our development is dependent on our ability to operate with two opposite forces, but the convert, in accord with his nature as a novice, requests Hillel to teach only one side of “and love your fellow as yourself” – the more natural side. That’s the idea of “one leg,” and this is the leg of afflictions – namely, whatever afflicts you, don’t do to your fellow.
Similarly, our sages said [<i>Pesachim</i> 50b]: “a person should always learn even without pure intention [<i>lo lishma</i>]” – that is, you should start with the side within Torah that is more natural to you, while your direction should be to lift yourself up slowly from the nature of self-love.
Actually, the same convert went also to Shammai, whose defining nature is the attribute of judgment that allows no compromise. When the convert put to him his request for compromise [one leg], Shammai pushed him off with his measuring stick (used for building) that was in his hand. For Shammai’s building was founded on the basis of absolute truth [“truth” and “measuring stick” are spelled in Hebrew with the same letters], not relative truth that adapts to a certain situation.
This is actually the description in the <i>midrash</i> in which our sages teach: “In the beginning, the Holy One blessed be He created the world with the attribute of judgment. He saw that the world was not viable this way, so He brought forth the attribute of mercy and combined it with the attribute of judgment.” [<i>Midrash Raba</i>, Genesis 12:15; also Rashi’s commentary on “God created” in the first verse of the Torah.] The story of the convert illustrates this saying of our sages, for in the beginning the convert comes to Shammai – that is, he tries to convert on the basis of the aspect of judgment. But after he sees that this is not viable – that is, that he cannot receive direction of this sort from the start – then he turns to Hillel who represents the combining of the aspect of mercy with the aspect of judgment, by virtue of his willingness to accept a relative truth that matches an individual’s spiritual state.
According to Torah <i>dereshut hayachid</i> [the method of interpretation that sees all aspects of the Torah as descriptions of the inner workings of the individual soul], when we want to “be converted” – that is, to undergo a transformation from the character of a non-Jew to the character of a Jew – we must turn to the Hillel within ourselves. [Each of us, Jew and non-Jew alike, are born with an inclination to receive for ourselves – referred to as the “non-Jew” within us – and each of us has the potential of developing an inclination to give to others – referred to as the “Jew” within us. Rabbi Gottlieb is interpreting the encounter of Hillel and the convert as instruction regarding the manner of converting the non-Jew within to become a Jew within. See “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” VII – The Nations of the World.] Even a Jew who keeps Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> (and is careful with seemingly insignificant details), as long as he or she has not arrived at “and love your fellow as yourself” (which is dependent on advancement in faith), then he or she is nonetheless still considered a non-Jew. [Of course, Rabbi Gottlieb is writing from the point of view of inner meaning. He is not contradicting the approach of Jewish law.] Thus, the inner meaning of the symbol of a non-Jew and the symbol of a Jew is that a non-Jew does only what accords with natural self-concern, and nothing out of love for the other; and also he or she does only what accords with reason and nothing on the basis of faith. Whereas a Jew is one who becomes merciful and giving towards the other and is also able to operate on the basis of faith. Thus we are not discussing a historical story but a description of a spiritual process that each individual must undergo, for everyone must want to undergo this “conversion.” Everyone must want to turn to the Hillel within, which is that potential point of holiness within each person. Each of us must connect with that point, reveal its light, and begin to live according to the principles of that point.
30. It is possible to arrive at loving the other only if there is a foundation, preparation, and building by means of the rest of the <i>mitzvot</i>, and this is the only way to understand “and love your fellow as yourself” and to get to the state where we can fulfill it. The upshot of the matter is that we have no freedom to substitute or change any Torah or rabbinic <i>mitzvah</i>, or even the slightest bit of some custom founded by the great teachers of Israel. For this entire web, when taken together as a whole, is meant to change us; and it is a divine document that cannot be tampered with. It must be fulfilled in all its forms and levels in order to arrive at a spiritual uplifting above the prison of the desire to receive and toward the freedom of love of the other. A parable for this: Someone builds a building, and the building is made of many parts – the foundation, the pillars, the bricks, electrical tubing, etc.; each part with its particular official standard of quality – that is, a certain accepted standard that the contractor must abide by. If the contractor begins to change things according to the contractor’s understanding (which means according to the contractor’s own interest), woe to whoever would live in that building!
Thus Baal Hasulam states here that all of the Torah and all its <i>mitzvot</i>, all its sections, stories, and legends – all exist for the sake of transforming our nature from the nature of self-love to the nature of loving the other. The Torah comes to explain to us this idea on the level of thought and to cultivate a mental transformation, but it must conclude with a transformation also in our behavior.

Chapter 3

<small>How can I be obligated to fulfill the needs of every single person?</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Before we delve into the depth of this matter, we need to reflect on this commandment itself. When we are commanded “and love your fellow as yourself,” the expression “<b>as yourself</b>” implies that you are to love your fellow to the same degree that you love yourself and not to any degree less than that whatsoever. This implies that you are obligated to be on constant watch to fulfill the needs of every single person – at the very least, each one of the nation of Israel – to no less degree than you are alert to fulfill your own needs.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is a completely impossible task, for not many are able in their work-day to fulfill their own needs, so how can you obligate anyone to fulfill the wishes of the entire nation? Nor is it acceptable to suggest that the Torah speaks by way of exaggeration, for the Torah warns us, “Do not add and do not subtract etc. [Deut. 13:1],” and by this, it tells us that its words and principles are stated with complete precision.<sup>31</sup></span>
31. Baal Hasulam here wants to rule out the claim that “love” is dependent only on the heart, but is not a practical matter. He states that just as we do for ourselves whatever gives us pleasure, so we must do for the other. No one can come and say that the <i>mitzvah</i> of the Torah is only love in the heart and is not related to action. It must be expressed in action by taking care of the other’s needs. After making this point, then he goes on to ask: How is it possible to do this in reality?
[For more on this topic, see “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” I – Loving the Other as Yourself.]

Chapter 4

<small>I must even give precedence to others’ needs before my own.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">As if this weren’t enough, I point out that the straightforward meaning of this commandment to love others is even more demanding – for it requires us to give precedence to others’ needs before our own. Similarly, a <i>Tosafot</i> commentary [<i>Kiddushin</i> 20a] cites the Jerusalem Talmud on the verse regarding a Hebrew slave “for it is good for him with you” [Deut. 15:16] and states: “Sometimes a master of a slave has only one cushion; and if he lies on the cushion himself and does not give it to the slave, then he doesn’t fulfill the obligation of “<b>for it is good for him with you</b>,” since he is lying on a cushion and his slave is on the ground. If he does not lie on the cushion, but also does not give it to his slave, then he acts with the character of Sodom [where guests were not welcomed even though the Sodomites would not have lost anything by sharing with them]. Thus he must give the cushion to the slave, and the master himself must lie on the ground.” Examine carefully the <i>Tosafot</i> commentary at that reference.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We thus learn to apply the same ruling to our verse regarding the extent of loving others. Also here scripture has equated the fulfilling of your fellow’s needs with the fulfilling of your own needs. As in the example of the Hebrew slave in “for it is good for him with you,” if you have only one cushion and someone else has no cushion at all, the ruling of Jewish law must be that if you sit on it and don’t give it to the other person, you thereby violate the positive commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself,” as you have not fulfilled the needs of your fellow to the degree that you have fulfilled your own needs. If you neither sit on the cushion nor give it to the other person, then this is wickedness – as in that characteristic of Sodom. Rather, you must give the cushion to the other person to sit upon, and you yourself must either sit on the ground or stand. And it is self-evident that this rule applies to all cases where a person has something that someone else lacks. Now go and consider: Is it at all possible to fulfill this commandment?<sup>32</sup></span>
32. From the example of the Hebrew slave, we learn that the needs of your fellow take precedence over your own needs. The Jewish concept of slavery is very different than the way most people today think of slavery. Our sages state: “A person who acquires a slave is like one who acquires a master.” [<i>Kiddushin</i> 20a] The <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah are so potent that the slave is turned into a master and the master into a slave. If the master has a single cushion, the Torah obligates the master to give it to the slave, and the master lies on the ground. When the master has only one cushion, what takes precedence – that it be “good for him” (good for the slave) or “with you” (good for the master)? The <i>mitzvah</i> of the Torah is that “good for him” overrides “with you.” From this requirement of Jewish law regarding the Hebrew slave, Baal Hasulam draws a conclusion regarding the general character of the <i>mitzvah</i> “and love your fellow as yourself.” The two <i>mitzvot</i> have the same structure, for “with you” speaks of what is good for the master and “it is good for him with you” says that in whatever way it may be well with the master, so it must be well with the slave. This is also precisely the structure of “and love your fellow as yourself” – namely, just as “as yourself” you take care that you will have maximum pleasure, so for “your fellow” you must ensure his or her maximum pleasure. And just as <i>Tosaoot</i> concluded that the master must give preference to the other, so in general each of us must give preference to the other.
Practically speaking, if you have fresh food and also food that is not fresh, you must give your friend the fresh food; for you must give preference to your friend’s needs. When we have an ordinary guest, we are likely to prefer to give the guest the leftovers so we can get rid of them. However, we must be prepared to wholeheartedly give preference to the needs of the other, and always take for ourselves what has lesser quality and give our friend what has higher quality. Regarding gifts to the priest, the law requires giving the choice meat. (Again, since all of the Torah comes to clarify the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself,” we learn the requirement of giving our friend the best portion from the example of gifts to the priest.)
Question: From where can we get the motivation and energy to follow this pure path? Answer: We need to get used to thinking of each individual as a great person. Therefore we must contemplate the inner life of other people; to consider that each person is a portion of God and activated by God’s will. These thoughts can give us a push to operate according to the principle of selfless giving, since there is great pleasure in giving to a great person. Furthermore, the direction is to arrive at acquiring a God-like character. Just as God’s care and giving are concentrated only on what is good for us, and God receives nothing for His own benefit, so we are commanded to arrive at a state in which we are focused on the other, so that the other will be the center of our lives. Thus, if we go on this path, we will be connected with the Creator of all there is, and there is no source of energy greater than this.
Why do we really need to give preference to other people’s needs above our own? The verse seems only to <i>equate</i> our needs when it states “and love your fellow <i>as</i> yourself.” However, even the simple meaning of the <i>mitzvah</i> creates an obligation to be strict and give preference to the needs of our friend; for when you want to straighten a bent metal rod, you need to bend it to the opposite side.
We see that Judaism is not so simple, for it deals with something beyond our nature. It’s not just a matter of phylacteries [<i>tefillin</i>] that a man puts on each morning, or following the laws of using an automatic clock on <i>Shabbat</i> – that is, the simple execution of certain acts according to religious requirements. For it is in our power to perform religious actions, but in order to change our desires we need the help of God. So we see that these acts are not the goal, but the means to arrive at the goal – changing our nature from self-love to love of the other. In the Talmud [<i>Kiddushin</i> 30b] God is described as saying: “I created the evil inclination; and I created the Torah as a healing condiment for it.” The external form of fulfilling Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> is not the end of the trail; rather the end is attaining a change of nature by means of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>. This is the uniqueness of Judaism and the people of Israel. Thus, the people of Israel kept on going, because throughout their history they were more or less moving in this direction beyond the selfish nature of people. Regarding this it is said: “for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations.” [Deut. 4:6]

Chapter 5

<small>To understand the nature of our obligation we must understand why the Torah was given to Israel.</small>
<small>If it was only the nation of Israel who wanted the Torah, then they weren’t really “chosen” among nations to receive it.</small>
First of all, we have to understand why the Torah was given specifically to the Israeli nation, and not to all the people of the world equally. Is there an element of nationalism here, heaven forbid? Only people who have taken leave of their senses could consider such a thing.<sup>33</sup> Indeed our sages have already dealt with this question, for that was their intention when they said [<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 2b] that the Holy One blessed be He went around to every nation and dialect but they didn’t accept the Torah – as is well-known.
33. Only people who have taken leave of their senses could consider the possibility that God has some national preference – that is, that God prefers one nation over another. For it is possible for a person of flesh and blood to prefer one person over another, or one society over another, but regarding the Holy One who created every single created being, and illuminates and gives light to all, preference is completely inapplicable.
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, from this it’s hard to understand why we are called the chosen people, as is written “God chose you” [Deut. 7:6], since no one from another nation wanted it.<sup>34</sup> Furthermore, the story itself is questionable. Could it be that the Holy One came with His Torah in His hand and negotiated with the peoples of these wild lands? Nothing like this has ever been heard of, and it is completely counterintuitive.<sup>35</sup></span>
34. For choice is relevant only when there are several possible choices, and one chooses the most desirable among them. However, God had no choice, for none of the nations wanted the Torah besides Israel. So why is Israel called the “chosen” nation?
35. Here Baal Hasulam brings up the difficulty regarding the manner in which God offered the Torah to ignorant peoples, for Baal Hasulam assumes that they were weak-spirited and backward. So how could God offer them His Torah and negotiate with them?

Chapter 6

<small>To understand why the Torah was given to Israel, we need to understand the nature and purpose of the Torah, which is also the purpose of creation.</small>
<small>The purpose of creation is to make God’s divinity known to a being other than God. This is accomplished when what is created “cleaves” to God.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, we can understand all this once we have a sufficient grasp of: the nature of the Torah; its <i>mitzvot</i>; and the desired goal in the fulfillment of the <i>mitzvot</i> to the degree that our sages taught – this goal being the aim of all of the great creation laid out before us.<sup>36</sup></span>
36. That is, when we understand – What is the central purpose of learning Torah and doing <i>mitzvot</i>? What are we supposed to gain from Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>? – <i>then</i> we will understand everything. For the nature evoked by the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> is the purpose for which the Creator created all this great creation.
<span class="poetry indentAll">The first axiom is that no one acts without purpose, and there is no exception to this apart from the lowliest of the human race or babies.<sup>37</sup> And if that is indeed the case, then no one can doubt that the Creator (whose majesty cannot be fathomed) would perform any action – small or big – without purpose.</span>
37. Baal Hasulam is referring to people who are not sane, who act without any particular purpose. And also babies and small children may act only because of certain urges and feelings, not due to any purpose.
Question: On the one hand, we see that the Torah bequeaths a system and framework of cold rules that are forced upon us without any relation to feeling. On the other hand, “God wants the heart” [<i>Sanhedrin</i> 106b] – that is, he wants us to feel. Actually, there is no contradiction, for the Torah wants us to limit our feelings of desire to receive, on the one hand; and on the other hand, it wants us – by way of the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> – to slowly open up a divine system of feelings, which will include urges and desires to give selflessly. So the Torah wants us to arrive at feelings, but not feelings that derive from the impure material of the desire to receive, but rather feelings that derive from the lofty desire to give.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Our sages taught us that the world was created only <b>for the fulfillment of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i></b>. The explanation of the matter, as clarified by our early sages, is that <b>the intention of the Creator from the very beginning of creation was to make known His divinity to another</b>.<sup>38</sup></span>
38. According to this, so long as we are not aware of God’s divinity, we have not fulfilled our purpose. For each of us must get to a state of divine inspiration, by way of connection and dialogue with the Creator directly – face to face.
When we sit with friends, we have no doubt of their existence, for our five senses and our intellect witness and declare that the friends are here with us. However, regarding the Creator the situation is different, since the Creator is hidden even from our feelings, and certainly He has no bodily form, nor any relation at all to physical concepts. All this is done intentionally for the benefit of the created beings, so that they will have a choice to believe in His existence. Nonetheless, the goal of the Creator is as above – that this hiddenness should not remain, but rather that the created beings should know Him and feel Him.
God’s goal in creating the world was to make known His divinity to another – that is, that His creatures will sense the existence of divinity without any doubt, just as they sense all the physical reality around them. We should sense the hand of God in every single happening – whether in our private lives or in our societal relationships. Throughout our lives we should be cleaving to the Creator in our thoughts and feelings until we arrive at “Noah walked with God” – that is, he walked with God in every moment and every element of his life and formed a real connection and dialogue with the Creator. Noah’s communication with God was as real as the communication between two people.
God wanted to make known His divinity to His creatures, and only for this purpose created all that exists in the world. All of creation must arrive at this stage, each according to his or her level, as the future is described: “. . . for all will know Me from the least of them to the greatest of them” [Jer. 31:33] and the whole land will be filled with the knowledge of God. And certainly this has many levels, each person according to his or her abilities and work in self-development.
<span class="poetry indentAll">For the revelation of the Creator’s divinity at first reaches a created being as a small measure of the Creator’s pleasing abundance. Then the amount received continues to increase until it attains the ideally desired degree.<sup>39</sup> When this happens, the lowly are raised up via a true recognition [of God] to be a chariot for God and to cleave to Him<sup>40</sup> – until they reach their final perfection which is expressed by: “<b>No eye has seen God, other than You.</b>” [Isaiah 64:3]</span>
39. Consciousness of God’s divinity is revealed gradually. At first there is just a basic awareness, but nonetheless it is “as a small measure of the Creator’s pleasing abundance.” For even the smallest measure of God’s revelation contains more joy than all the pleasures of this world. Subsequently, the sense of this pleasant divine abundance increases in accordance with the individual’s spiritual work.
It is important to understand the following: At the time that God becomes known to an individual, he or she is filled with unlimited joy – a perfect spiritual joy – and it is this joy that the Creator intended to give to His creation when He created the world with the intention of giving goodness. All other pleasures that don’t ensue from the revelation of His divinity – categorized by our sages as lust, envy, and honor – although they do indeed have an element of pleasure, the holy <i>Zohar</i> refers to this feeling of pleasure as “a thin light.” This very small thin light is initially separated from the realm of the holy and intentionally provided in order to give sustenance to the realm of defilement and the outer shells – that is, for the sustenance of humanity even when it does not follow the path of faith and selfless giving. This is because progress in service of God takes place over the course of many years, and in the meanwhile it is impossible for a person not to have a life. So it was set up that people would base their lives on joys other than spiritual joy.
The machine that is called a person must feed on the fuel of pleasure. If we have no pleasure and have no hope for pleasure in the future, we cannot continue to live. Therefore in the meantime, we have the physical pleasures of envy, lust, and honor. Intellectual pleasure is a bit higher, but it’s not divine revelation. We must be clever and be fortunate in order not to become captive to the pleasures that were provided for humanity’s minimal existence; for we can easily bury ourselves in these pleasures, and then there is no hope that one day we can see true light.
40. What is the idea of the “chariot?” The concept of chariot appears frequently in Chassidic literature. Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag gave the following explanation: In the material world, a chariot is a vehicle in which a person sits, and the vehicle transports the person from place to place. Our sages said: “The forefathers are the chariot.” Each one of them “carried” a certain attribute and was a chariot for this attribute. Abraham was a chariot for the attribute of loving-kindness – that is, wherever he went he brought this attribute, and everyone in the world was able to learn from him the service of loving-kindness. Isaac was a chariot for the attribute of strength of character; he carried this attribute with him everywhere.
If you merit divine revelation, then you become a chariot for God. You merit a connection between God and yourself and then become a chariot which the Holy One enclothes and “rides” upon. God is revealed in your soul; and wherever the person who cleaves to God goes, he or she carries there the revelation of God.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Due to the greatness and beauty of this perfection, even the Torah and prophecy were careful not to speak a word about this extreme state. Our sages were hinting to this in their saying [<i>Berachot</i> 34b]: “All prophecy was directed towards the days of the messiah, but regarding the world to come ‘no eye has seen God, other than You.’ [Isaiah 64:3]”<sup>41</sup>, <sup>42</sup> This matter is well-known to those who have found spiritual knowledge, and here is not the place to expound on it.</span>
41. The verse “no eye has seen . . .” comes to define the tremendous perfection that is designated for each person in accord with his or her attributes. What is that perfection? It includes even the state that “no eye has seen.” Created beings themselves cannot attain this and see this final supreme level of connection between the created being and the Creator. This is a wondrous level, uplifted and supreme, and therefore none of the prophets expressed anything about it.
42. The time of the messiah is the completion of the fixing of the world that takes place during the six thousand years of this world, and this completion is considered as perfection in comparison to the years that preceded it. However, there is a more perfect state – not just in comparison to the six thousand years – but perfection in itself, and that is what is called “the next world.”
<span class="poetry indentAll">The Torah, the prophets, and our sages express this state of perfection only by the simple word: “<i><b>devekut</b></i>” [cleaving to God]. Due to this word’s widespread use among the public, it has almost lost all meaning. However, if you linger momentarily to reflect on this word, you will continue to be amazed at its marvelous height. For consider the nature of divinity and consider the value of the lowly created being, and then you can appreciate how extraordinary is the relation involved in one cleaving with the other. And then you will understand why we ascribe to this word the purpose of all this great creation.<sup>43</sup>, <sup>44</sup></span>
43. Divinity should be pictured as something eternal and completely unlimited by time or place or any element connected to physicality. So we find that divinity is nothing other than the Master of the universe who instantaneously brings into being and gives life to the entire universe in each and every moment and situation. In contrast to the viewpoint of divinity, we see a picture in which is painted the lowly state of the “flesh and blood” human, who is not eternal. We decay even as we live our lives, and we completely reek of lusts and desires. We are full of worry, distress, despair, and sorrow. We are limited by our place in time and space and the perception of our five senses. How can this lowly creature – that has no value whatsoever – make contact with the Creator? This is why Baal Hasulam says that the cleaving of the created to the Creator is the final purpose of all this great creation, and it is the greatest wonder of the creation.
44. What is the idea of <i>devekut</i> [cleaving to God]? Baal Hasulam explains this in several places. The meaning of <i>devekut</i> is connection – that is, equivalence of form; in other words, when the created being equates his or her attributes to the attributes of the Creator, in accord with: “Just as He is merciful, so are you to be merciful.” [<i>Shabbat</i> 133b] The more we advance in equating our nature and spiritual form to the Creator, the more we approach <i>devekut</i>. This is not a level that one can reach in one leap, but rather one tiny jump after another. To the degree that we advance, we merit a measure of sensing and understanding the Creator’s providence and a continually tightening connection with the Creator.
No doubt the Creator could have revealed His light – the light of divinity – also in our vessels for receiving, and then we would receive everything for our own benefit. However, the Creator wanted to enable people to merit having complete <i>devekut</i> with Him, and this can be done only on the basis of equivalence of form – that is, that one gets to the level of desire to give selflessly just as the Creator desires to give selflessly. Then God’s revelation will illuminate in a perfect manner in our vessels of giving – that is, through our intention to give contentment to the Creator, and not through our intention to receive benefit.
[For more on this topic, see “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” II – Cleaving to God (<i>Devekut</i>).]
<span class="poetry indentAll">It follows that the purpose of the entire creation is that the lowly creatures will be able, by keeping Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, to rise ever upward, ever developing, until they are rewarded with cleaving to their Creator, may He be exalted and blessed.<sup>45</sup></span>
45. Although there is a large community of people who observe Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, not many of them can boast of arriving at <i>devekut</i> with the Creator. So have Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> failed to do what they are supposed to do? This question was asked of Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag, and he answered with the following parable: A certain person arrived at the doctor’s office groaning in agony and complaining of pain all over his body. The doctor carried out the necessary examinations and then informed him that there is one medicine that can help him, and he must take massive doses three times a day. The patient rushed to buy the medicine and began to take it. After three days he came to the doctor with double the horrible pain he had before. He could hardly speak, but he asked the doctor why the medicine isn’t helping. The doctor asked him whether he took the medicine three times a day as he had prescribed. The patient replied: Certainly, three times a day I spread the medicine on my body. The doctor said to him: I told you to take the medicine within, and you spread it outside? The moral: Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> can have benefit if we internalize them and begin to change our manner of thought and feeling; our desires and aspirations; our speech and manner of behavior – all in accord with the policy delineated by the Torah. However, if we accept the Torah only externally – that is, we only follow certain external behaviors – and we pay no attention to the fact that the Torah guides us to make inner changes, then not only are we thereby not repaired, but we are liable to get more corrupted.

Chapter 7

<small>Why weren’t we created cleaving to God from the beginning?</small>
<small>We would be humiliated by receiving from God without deserving it, so we have Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> in order to earn it.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, here the Kabbalists paused and asked: “Why weren’t we created with the required lofty stature so we could be cleaving to God from the beginning? What reason did God have to shoulder us with this burden and trouble of the creation, and the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>?”<sup>46</sup></span>
46. The creation itself is a nuisance, for the fact that a person, who is actually a soul, must be enclothed in the material substance of flesh and blood – this is a great bother. Our need to deal with the body is a great bother, even for the body itself, and all the more so for the soul. For the stench of the body reaches the heavens, both in physical terms and also in terms of its value. For the end of the physical body testifies to its nature from the beginning: nothing but decay. The body of our spiritual self, which is our desire to receive, is also a great bother, for we will never be satisfied; whoever gets one measure of something will then want a double measure. Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> are also a great bother for the body, for “a slave prefers licentiousness” [<i> ittin</i> 13a] and does not want any limitation, any laws, or any subjugation. Thus the whole framework of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> is a great bother for us. So for what purpose did the Creator place upon us all this nuisance?
<span class="poetry indentAll">They replied: <b>Whoever benefits from another’s work is ashamed to look him or her in the face</b> [Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Orlah</i> chapter 1, <i>halachah</i> 3]. Explanation: If you eat and get benefit from the labor of another person, you will be afraid to look upon the image of his or her face; for you will become increasingly humiliated until you lose the character of a human being.<sup>47</sup> And since whatever comes forth from God’s perfection could never be found lacking, therefore God gave us room to earn for ourselves the desired goal [namely, cleaving to God] by virtue of our deeds in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.<sup>48</sup></span>
47. The difference between a person and an animal is only in one feature: our ability to function beyond our given nature of receiving and to arrive at a state of loving the other. By contrast, the animals are incapable of going against their nature, and are thereby enslaved to their nature of self-love. If we derive benefit for ourselves from another’s work as a free gift, and do not at all consider the other person’s welfare, then we are not worthy of the title “human being.” Therefore God provided the feeling of shame when people receive a free gift, so that no one would simply remain in this attitude, but everyone will eventually make a change to fix it.
48. Therefore the Creator did not create us perfect, for if He had done so, we would not have any need to do spiritual work. Thus we would be receiving from God the divine revelation (which is the eternal good and joy He intended to give) as a free gift without any work on our part. And then naturally there would be the defective element of shame; and since God is perfect, such an imperfect act would not be fitting for Him. So God arranged that we would earn our perfection through our labor; and then when we receive the eternal good and delight that He wants to impart to us, it will have a feeling of perfection.
Baal Hasulam asked regarding the above: How can work in this fleeting world entitle one to eternal joy? Although it’s true that when we get paid for our work, we usually don’t feel that we are in the role of a receiver at all and so we don’t feel ashamed; nonetheless, someone who receives a yearly salary for only one day’s work, would still feel a full measure of shame!
The answer to this is that our sages did not intend to say that our labor merits us to receive reward as an equal exchange for our labor; but rather that through the process of doing spiritual work we acquire the desire to give selflessly. So if you could attain the desire to give after work for only ten minutes, then even this would save you from the shame of receiving a free gift. For all the shame derives from the fact that a person is receiving selfishly. But if you completely restrict your receiving, and perform all your actions only in order to give to the other; then shame no longer applies; for shame does not apply to one who only gives. To state it in terms of our relationship with God: If you receive divine light due to your love of God – because you know that God’s desire is for you to receive – then you will have no feeling of shame in receiving.
Thus we have made clear that the significance of our spiritual work is different from what it seems superficially. It is not the exchange of labor for a reward of equal value, for this is impossible because the work is temporary and the reward is eternal. Rather the import of our labor is the desire of the Creator that the created being acquire the nature of giving selflessly; and at the moment that we attain this, shame is no longer relevant.
This explains the idea of “toil” in the saying of our sages: “If someone says ‘I toiled and did not find it,’ don’t believe it,” [<i>Megillah</i> 6b] That is, if someone says that he or she worked to attain the character of giving selflessly but did not find the light of God’s countenance, don’t believe it; for it is just an indication that he or she has not yet done the work fitting to attain the desire to give selflessly.
<span class="poetry indentAll">These matters are most profound, and I have already explained them fully in the first chapters of my book <i>Panim Masbirot</i> (commentary on <i>Etz Hachaim</i>), and in the first section of <i>The Study of the Ten Sefirot</i> (in the commentary titled “<i>Histaklut Pnimit”</i>). Here I will explain them briefly so that they will be understood by all.</span>

Chapter 8

<small>The receiver feels shame when receiving a free gift.</small>
<small>You can never completely fulfill the wants of other people, for you cannot give them a sense of independent acquisition.</small>
<small>God’s perfection requires that He give without causing shame, so God gave us a sense of independent acquisition by means of our actions in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This idea is like the story of a certain rich man who picks up someone from the street and gives him food and drink and showers him with silver and gold and all manner of delights every day. Day after day his gifts are greater than the day before. After some time the rich man asks him: “Tell me, have all your wishes been fulfilled?” He replies: “Not all of my desires have been filled. For how good and how pleasant it would be if all these possessions and precious things came to me through my own industry as they came to you, and I would not be receiving your gift as charity.” Then the rich man told him: “In that case, there has yet to be born a person who could fulfill your wishes.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is quite natural. On the one hand, he experiences greater and greater pleasure as his gifts increase each time. On the other hand, it’s hard for him to bear the shame from the abundant beneficence that the rich man increasingly bestows upon him. For it’s a natural law that the receiver feels a sort of shame and discomfort when he gets a free gift from one who gives him out of kindness and pity.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">From this follows a second principle – that it’s unimaginable that we can completely fulfill the wants of another, as in the end, we cannot give the other the character and form of independent acquisition, and only this could complete the contentment derived from receiving everything that is desired.<sup>49</sup></span>
49. So, although we can give a free gift of the best of all material goods, there’s no way we can give the recipient the feeling that he or she has earned the gift and deserves it by virtue of his or her work. We find in the laws of charity that the most praiseworthy charity is when the giver does not know the identity of the receiver, and the receiver does not know who the giver is. In this way, our sages arranged that shame would be reduced to a minimum. However, this tactic does not completely eliminate the hurt of shame, for the poor person still knows that he or she is receiving. Even if the poor person doesn’t know who the benefactor is, just the feeling of being in need of others suffices to create an inner sense of shame.
But there is no other option. It’s impossible not to give at all – the giver must be trained to give, and the receiver needs the help. So our sages reduced to a minimum the shame in receiving charity, but this would not (so to speak) be a solution for God’s gift to His creation. For God’s giving must be with perfection. Therefore God gave us the toil involved in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, which makes the reward received for spiritual work appear to be the result only of independent acquisition. In this way, shame is eliminated completely. Here is a wondrous thing, for what our body calls “toil” in nature and in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> is actually designed for our benefit. And we have no reason to complain about this, but rather we should thank God for it.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Of course, the above applies only to created beings and not in any way to the complete perfection of God. And this explains why God has prepared for us the means to bring forth our exaltedness ourselves by way of toil and overcoming difficulties, and by way of occupying ourselves with Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In that way, all the pleasure and delight that we receive from God – meaning everything included in our cleaving to God – will have the character of independent acquisition by means of our own actions. Then we will feel ourselves as the owners, without which there cannot be an experience of completion, as has been explained.</span>

Chapter 9

<small>Why do we feel shame when receiving a free gift?</small>
<small>The character of a root determines what is agreeable to a branch connected to that root.</small>
<small>God is our root, so we are pleased by what flows from Him (in general, loving-kindness) and displeased by whatever is not His manner (in general, selfishness).</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">At this point, it’s appropriate for us to reflect on the root and source of this natural law, and who it was that gave birth to the insult of shame and discomfort that we feel upon receiving charity from another. Actually, this phenomenon follows from the principle familiar to natural scientists that <b>each branch has basically the same nature as its root</b>, and the customary manners of the root will also be agreeable to the branch. The branch will love and desire and get benefit from them. Conversely, the branch will also distance itself from whatever is not compatible with its root. It will not be able to bear it, and will also be damaged by it. This law holds good for each root and its branch, and it cannot be breached.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Here a window opens before us to understand the source of the universal principle underlying all the constant joys and afflictions in our world.<sup>50</sup> Since God is the root of all the creatures that He created, therefore we will sense as fragrant and pleasing all that is included within Him and flows to us directly from Him – for our nature is close to that of our root. And everything which is not God’s manner and is not drawn to us directly from Him – but rather is determined by the pivotal point of creation itself [the desire to receive] – will be against our nature and difficult for us to tolerate.</span>
50. Here is hidden the key to one of the central issues of our lives – why do some things give us joy and pleasure, and regarding other things we feel pain and affliction? The answer is that whatever is included in our root (namely, the Creator) gives us a feeling of pleasure and joy – for example, wisdom, bliss, humility, and good character traits. And we dislike foolishness, weakness, stupidity, and receiving a free gift from someone else, for in our root there is no receiving.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus, we love rest and detest movement to the extent that we move only in order to attain some rest. The reason for this is that our root does not have the character of movement, but rather God is at rest and has no manner of motion. Therefore movement is against our nature and repugnant to us.<sup>51</sup> In the same way, we very much love wisdom, strength, wealth etc., because all these are included within Him who is our root. And so we despise their opposites – such as foolishness, weakness, and poverty – because they are not at all to be found in our root. These give us a feeling of loathing and detestation and cause insufferable pain.<sup>52</sup></span>
51. Motion is not applicable to the divine realm, for all motion derives from some deficiency and there is no deficiency in divine reality. But there is motion in the human realm, for when we don’t feel well, we have to search to improve our situation; and so we move from place to place. Therefore when the Ari [Rabbi Isaac Luria] wants to define divine perfection, he says that the supernal light is in a state of complete rest. His intention is of course not physical rest, but perfection. The concept of “rest” is identical with “perfection,” for in a perfect reality there is rest and no need for motion. Thus the divine realm is defined as complete rest.
It follows that when a person gets to a state of cleaving with the Creator who is at rest within Himself, then the person will be at complete rest within his or her soul.
From this our rabbi, Baal Hasulam, deduces that herein lies the source of our thirst for rest. Each individual aspires to arrive at a state of inner calm and quiet that is similar to the fixed state of God. All our deficiencies derive from the essential starting point of the creation, which is the desire to receive. And it never allows us to rest; for however much we have, we always want more. It follows that we are unable to get to a state of rest due to this pivotal point of creation. Nonetheless, we long to get to such a state, and here is explained the reason for this longing.
52. But people do in fact enjoy receiving. How can that be?! How can we get pleasure from receiving when our source has no aspect of receiving? The answer is that people don’t really get satisfaction from receiving, because the body [the desire to receive] never allows a person to get all the pleasure it wants from receiving. And this is due to: “Whoever has one measure of something will want a double measure.” So if we build our whole lives on receiving, we are condemned to suffering. Receiving is the essential innovation in the creation, the single element that is not included in the Creator. The small amount of pleasure that the Creator imprinted in this element of receiving is the minimal amount of “oxygen” that has been given to humanity in order to survive until it recognizes that the correct path of life is founded on giving. Between this time and that, people continue to suffer greatly from a lack of satisfaction.
We are continually drawn to receiving because it is the pivotal point of creation; and if you are not prudent in guiding your actions, you will continue to deteriorate. For the desire to receive is a system that destroys itself. Only if you take the path of giving, which is the path loved by the soul, can you find true eternal and complete joy. Only then you are not just a passing phenomenon. One must also distinguish between the joy that comes from true giving and the joy that comes from giving when the giving is a means to receiving. The distinction turns on one point whose name is “love.” For if you love yourself alone, then you give to another only because you want to reap the profit of the pleasure and satisfaction you will receive by means of the giving, not because you’re interested in the other’s welfare. This is still considered receiving, and you remain on the road to self-destruction. Only when the giving comes in a pure manner, because you desire that it will be good for the other person and you’re not interested in your own welfare, then a feeling of supernatural joy will come to you – a feeling that is eternal.
There are those who have at least reached the conclusion that the happiness they seek requires that they occupy themselves with some form of giving. However, they don’t yet understand that, just as the nature of the Creator is pure absolute giving without the slightest element of receiving, so each of us must continue to develop until we reach this state. Then we will arrive at the eternal and complete rest, but until then we are condemned to extinction, for the divine reality does not sustain or tolerate compromises. The only solution for the survival of humanity is that we arrive at “What’s mine is yours; what’s yours is yours.” [Chapters of the Fathers 5:10]

Chapter 10

<small>Since God does not receive, so receiving is unpleasant to us.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is what gives us the foul taste of shame and discomfort when we receive something from others in the framework of charity. For the Creator there cannot be such a thing as receiving a favor, as from whom could He receive? And since the matter of receiving does not apply to our root, it is loathsome and detestable to us, as was stated previously. <b>Conversely, we feel joy and pleasantness and tenderness whenever we generously bestow something upon another – as such conduct befits our root who generously bestows upon all.</b><sup>53</sup></span>
53. There’s a good and pleasant feeling when we do some kindness with our money or physical effort; when we give attention to another; when we invest in energy and efforts of various kinds. This is the way our root behaves, for He generously bestows upon all, and His desire is to be beneficent to those whom He created. When God’s creations get to such a state of giving selflessly, they are connected to their root and arrive at their true divine nature. Then they have a great, wonderful feeling, for every branch wants to imitate its root.

Chapter 11

<small><i>Devekut</i> (cleaving to God) is just the similarity of the branches with their root.</small>
<small>Our hope depends on equating our character with our root.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now we have found an opening to look at the true face of the ultimate purpose of creation – <b>“and you will cleave to Him”. [Deut. 11:22] The entire concept of this exaltedness and devekut, which is guaranteed to us through our work in Torah and mitzvot, is no more and no less than the similarity of the branches with their root</b>.<sup>54</sup> All the pleasantness, refinement and sublimity that we feel are a natural result of this state,<sup>55</sup> as was explained above. Pleasure is simply the equivalence of the form to its maker. When we equate our conduct and character with that which is found in our root, then we experience pleasure.<sup>56</sup> And whatever happens to us which is not within our root becomes intolerable, disgusting, or outright painful – as follows from the concept of <i>devekut</i>. The corollary of all this is that all our hope hangs on the degree of <b>equivalence of our form with our root</b>.</span>
54. This idea of similarity matches the idea in the saying of our sages: “Just as He is merciful, so you too be merciful.” [<i>Shabbat</i> 133b] The joy of a person’s life must be in his or her success to give satisfaction to others, just as the Creator has nothing to do with receiving and is always giving. When a person gets to this state, then he or she is seen to be cleaving to the Creator. There is no other form of cleaving, for no bodily concept applies to the Creator; God is not limited by space or time; and He has no relation to the perception of the five senses. Therefore the concept of <i>devekut</i> is connection with the divine entity by means of incorporating His way of being.
55. When you connect with the Creator, all the pleasantness and good that the Creator wants to give you is naturally drawn down without the need for any effort.
56. Whatever you acquire by way of your desire to receive – such as pleasure from eating; or from honor that you received; or from wisdom – any such thing will in the end cause you afflictions and pains. And even when a person arrives at the goal of all existence in this world, also then, if it involves some measure of self-interest, it will thereby cause afflictions and pains. For this is the rule – that there is no element of receiving in our roots, and therefore afflictions are caused by receiving.

Chapter 12

<small>The <i>mitzvot</i> were given only in order to gradually purify people from a nature of receiving to a nature of giving.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And these are the words of our sages [<i>Midrash Raba,</i> Genesis Ch. 44] in their question: “What difference does it make to the Holy One if one slaughters from the throat or one slaughters from the back of the neck?<sup>57</sup> After all, the <i>mitzvot</i> were given only in order to purify people.” This purification constitutes <b>the refinement of the muddied body</b>,<sup>58</sup> which is the ultimate aim that results from the fulfillment of all the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>. “A person is born a wild young donkey” [Job 11:12], for from the moment that a person emerges and is born from the bosom of creation, the newborn is in a state of utmost contamination and degradation. This state is defined by the exceedingly great degree of self-love that is imprinted in us, for all our movements are compelled to pivot around this self-regard without the slightest spark of altruism. In this way, we are as distant as can be from the root – completely at the opposite extreme. The root is <b>entirely giving, without even the slightest spark of receiving</b>, whereas the newborn [that is, the created being] <b>is entirely in a state of receiving for itself without any spark of giving at all</b>. Therefore its position is discerned to be the bottom point of lowliness and contamination to be found in our human realm.<sup>59</sup></span>
57. Our sages wondered why we are required to observe all the details of the <i>mitzvot</i>, and they took as an example the requirements regarding slaughter of animals for food. What’s the difference to God whether we slaughter from the throat or from the back of the neck? The sages could just as well have asked regarding any <i>mitzvah</i>. For example, why wave an <i>etrog</i> [citron] on the festival of Sukkot instead of waving an avocado? Essentially their question is whether the form of observance is an end in itself or just the means to affect us in some way. If the form is an end in itself, then it’s irrelevant to ask why the <i>mitzvah</i> has a particular form. However, if the idea is that the <i>mitzvot</i> should have some effect, then it makes sense to ask whether there would be any difference if we would do them differently.
And the answer of the sages is that the <i>mitzvot</i> are a means and not an end, and really it is insignificant to God whether slaughter is from the throat or the nape. But the <i>mitzvot</i> are intended to purify us – that is, to cleanse us from the contamination of self-love. And the form that God set for the <i>mitzvot</i> is the best means for purifying people. The form in itself is insignificant, but all its importance derives from its effect on purifying us. However, we do not have the freedom to determine for ourselves what should be the form of the <i>mitzvot</i>, for the One from whom emanated the creation determined how best to refine the creation – how the <i>mitzvot</i> can light up our souls and can free us of the nature of selfish love.
The deeper truth is that each form of the <i>mitzvot</i> is precisely determined by its spiritual roots in higher worlds, and it is not at all incidental or insignificant. The whole system of the worlds is arranged for this purpose – that each of us can perfect our souls and become a chariot for the revelation of God. They are not imaginings but spirituality – ways of being that have no time or place or form. They are a wondrous variety of spiritual levels whose central theme is the revelation of God in differing hues, measures, and aspects. The central point of the Kabbalah is the connection between the spiritual worlds and daily life. When we begin spiritual work, we need help from heaven, and this help comes by fulfillment of the <i>mitzvot</i>. As we begin to understand the spiritual roots of the <i>mitzvot</i>, we can draw down the light of God’s revelation that will assist us in achieving the desired effect of the <i>mitzvot</i> – the purification of the soul.
58. “The muddied body” does not refer to the physical body, but to the bodily portion of a person’s soul, which is the desire to receive pleasure and joy. Refining the physical body or training the stomach is certainly not the issue here, but rather changing the person, for whom the physical body is just an external wrapping. For example, learning to live with minimal food may just increase one’s ego. Baal Hasulam insisted that the only measure of spiritual development is whether you seek to receive for yourself or you want to give to others.
59. Each of us needs to get to the realization that the words written here apply to him or her – that his or her condition is at the lowliest point of contamination in all of human existence. Until we get to feel that this is so, we cannot develop and advance from the level of an animal to the level of a person. It’s like a person who’s invited to take a trip and imagines climbing mountains and crossing rivers, but only when he or she actually tries to do those things, does it become apparent how unprepared he or she is. Similarly, until we attempt to take the path of selfless giving, we don’t realize how completely lowly and contaminated we are; for only then do we see that every move we make, without exception, revolves around the pivotal point of our desire to receive without even a tiny spark of true desire to give.
[For more on this topic, see “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” V – Levels of Self-Love.]
The more we continue to grow, the more we receive from our environment partial lessons of “giving to the other;” and this certainly depends on the values of development promoted in that environment.<sup>60</sup> At this stage also begins our initiation in observing Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> out of selflove – that is, for reward in this world and the world to come. This form of education is called “not for its own sake,” and it is employed because it is not possible [at first] to accustom ourselves to keeping Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> in any other way.
60. “Environment” means whatever nourishes us, and this includes: books, teachers, society, and culture. We are social creatures; and just as when a kettle is put on the fire, it has no choice but to boil, so we cannot decide not to be affected by the ideas and values of the particular society with which we are associated. Just as one can choose healthier food, so in spirituality we must carefully select our cultural environment. A society built on “what’s mine is mine and what’s yours is mine” [Chapters of the Fathers 5:10] will breed thieves. Members of a society founded on “what’s mine is mine and what’s yours is yours” tend to value material possessions. We can gradually begin to develop spiritually when we put ourselves in a community whose ideal is “what’s mine is yours and what’s yours is yours.”
A community is not just a collection of people that happen to get together for the necessity of communal prayer or work or other social activities. In a true community, there is an inner connection between its members that is created when each member recognizes the greatness and significance of the others and therefore chooses to connect with them. Such a community can gradually create an atmosphere of closeness and devotion according to the teaching: “What’s mine is yours and what’s yours is yours.”
<span class="poetry indentAll">As we grow and mature, we are taught how to approach the work of <i>mitzvot</i> for its own sake<sup>62</sup> – with only the specific intention of giving pleasure to our Maker, as stated by Maimonides [Laws of Repentance, Ch. 10]: Women and children should not be told of keeping Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> for its own sake, because they will not be able to bear it.<sup>63</sup> But as they grow and acquire knowledge and intelligence, they are taught to do it for its own sake.” As our sages said, “Through doing not for its own sake, one comes to do for its own sake” [Pesachim 50b] – that is, one comes to the intention of <b>bringing contentment to one’s Maker without any element of self-love</b>.<sup>64</sup></span>
62. Learning to act with pure intention is a gradual process which requires contact with others that have developed in this path. And in truth, we can receive a revelation of the meaning of “for its own sake” only if God opens our eyes and hearts.
63. I heard from my rabbi, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag, that “women” refers not to people with a certain biological makeup, but to people who are subjugated to their desire to receive. [The female in Kabbalah symbolizes receiving and the male symbolizes giving; which makes sense from a biological point of view, since the female receives the seed and the male provides it.] Also “children” [“small people” in Hebrew] refers to people with a large number of years of life, but who are small in terms of their conception of the world. A child expects his or her surroundings to nourish him or her. A child enjoys and receives, but doesn’t consider giving anything to his or her surroundings. In this way, many men may be considered to be “women,” and many adults may be considered “children.” So people who are considered “women” or “children” are incapable of hearing the truth that the purpose of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> is not to create a better life for them. And since we measure truth and falsehood in terms of their benefit to us, we tell them the falsehood that the purpose of the <i>mitzvot</i> is to please us, as this is considered truth for people at that stage. For a fuller treatment of this point – including Rabbi Gottlieb’s expression of regret regarding the use of the code-name “women” in this way – see “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” VI – Women and Children.
64. At what stage can we begin to tell someone about the spiritual work of observing <i>mitzvot</i> for its own sake? Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag said that the way to determine this is by measuring how much the person is in anguish. For when you begin to disassociate from a self-centered character, then you feel emptiness, because you cannot get satisfaction from all the nonsense and vanities of this world. The more you suffer in this way, the clearer the indication that you are growing and developing spiritually. Only after your development has progressed sufficiently, the secret of service outside the framework of the ego is revealed to you from above.
[For more on this topic, see “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” VI – Women and Children.]
<span class="poetry indentAll">Due to the special quality inherent in the engagement in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> for its own sake, we develop and stride upward to the degrees and levels of the exaltedness previously described, until we eliminate all the sparks of self-love within ourselves.<sup>65</sup> This special quality is known to the Giver of the Torah, as our sages stated [<i>Kiddushin</i> 30b]: “The Holy One says, ‘I created the evil inclination, and I created the Torah as a healing condiment for it.’”<sup>66</sup> Ultimately all the <i>mitzvot</i> that we do with our bodies are uplifted, and all their movements are done only as a means to give selflessly to others. Even what we will receive as a necessity [for survival], will be channeled to the intention of giving – that is, in order that we can give to others. This is what the sages meant in their saying: “The <i>mitzvot</i> were given only to purify human beings.”<sup>67</sup> [<i>Midrash Raba</i>, Genesis Ch. 44]</span>
65. This is the aspect of “depart from evil” [Psalms 34, 15], “fear of God” [Psalms 111:10], and the <i>mitzvot</i> regarding what not to do. This form of service involves constricting as much as possible the use of the desire to receive. Baal Hasulam calls this: “eliminating all the sparks of self-love within ourselves.”
66. So we see that learning Torah has no connection to memorizing information or acquiring knowledge or expertise. Its orientation is not to show cleverness, precise analysis or intellectual systems. Rather its one single direction is to constitute a condiment that “sweetens” our evil inclination – that is, tunes our inclination to the right direction, in the right measure and the right quality. This, of course, is not intended to contradict that learning Torah should be performed according to correct educational procedures such as reviewing, testing, etc.; for we certainly need to learn the concepts of the Torah.
67. This is the aspect of “do good” [Psalms 34:15] – that is, to develop within ourselves a second nature of loving the other so that our life’s pleasure is not to satisfy ourselves, but to satisfy others. This is the aspect of “Love the Lord your God” [Deut. 11:1] and the <i>mitzvot</i> regarding what we are to do.

Chapter 13

<small>Both <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God as well as interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> have the same aim – to bring us to a state of cleaving to God.</small>
<small>No difference is sensed in a true act of selfless love whether the act’s object is God or a person.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Though indeed there are two categories to the Torah – a) <i>mitzvot</i> that apply between a person and God; b) <i>mitzvot</i> that apply between one person and another<sup>68</sup> – nonetheless, they both have the same aim of bringing the created being to the final goal of cleaving to God, as has been explained.</span>
68. Here there is a hidden question. Now that we have learned that the purpose of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> is to separate us from the contamination of self-love and to develop love of the other, Baal Hasulam asks: Clearly, via the <i>mitzvot</i> between one person and another we get practice in reducing self-love and developing love of the other, but what do the <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God contribute to this? For example, what connection do the <i>mitzvot</i> of keeping the Sabbath and blowing the shofar have to annulling self-love?
<span class="poetry indentAll">Not only this, even the practical aspect of both of them is one and the same. For at the moment when you perform an act “for its own sake” without any admixture of self-love (which is to say without deriving the slightest benefit for yourself), then you don’t sense any difference in your action regardless of whether it is focused on love of your fellow man or love of God.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is so because it is a natural law that applies to every created being that it regards everything outside the boundary of its own body as completely empty and non-existent.<sup>69</sup> Every movement that we make toward loving another is accomplished with the help of returning light and some reward, which in the end will come round and serve to benefit us. Therefore such acts cannot be defined as “love of the other,” because they are judged by their end. This is similar to renting out something [which at first looks like giving] that pays off only in the end. Nonetheless, renting is not considered as expressing love of the other.<sup>70</sup></span>
69. Whatever is outside us we consider to be non-existent whether it be divine or human. Our nature is to treat anything that is outside ourselves [that is, that in no way impinges on our benefit] as insignificant.
But we each need to train ourselves to operate in the opposite direction – that is, that I am really non-existent, and the essence of reality is precisely the other’s existence. And this is the meaning of the statement of our sages: “The words of Torah are fulfilled only by killing ourselves for it” [<i>Berachot</i> 63b]. That is, we need to kill our self-love. From this we can see that there’s absolutely no difference between the two categories of <i>mitzvot</i>, for what difference does it make if you annul yourself before another person or you annul yourself before God? The orientation is identical – to annul oneself and make the other significant, whether the other be a person or God. [If by ignoring my self-interest I don’t work on the Sabbath – with only the intention of enabling the fulfillment of the Creator’s purpose for creation – then I have indeed annulled myself. And this is the same way that I annul myself when I ignore my self-interest in order to help a friend achieve a goal.]
70. Baal Hasulam wants to say that if someone works for a reward, this is not at all considered “love of the other.” He gives the example of renting, for Jewish law says that payment for rent is due only at the end of the rental period, and therefore one might think that a renter is a person with love of the other for allowing a tenant to live for free on the renter’s property. But when the renter requests payment at the end of the month, it’s clear that this is not a matter of love of the other. With this our rabbi teaches us that we are willing to work with all our strength and devotion because we want to get paid. However, Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> train us to truly work out of love of the other without payment, and regarding this there is no difference between the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> and the <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God.
Why do we really need the two paths of interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> and <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God? Why isn’t one path sufficient to train us to annul our self-love and work out of love of the other? The answer is that the final goal is actually to create a relation of love between ourselves and the Creator. However, the Creator is abstract and unchanging, and we need training that is more concrete and dynamic. For this reason, God gave us the interpersonal path, and here are the essential tests where we contend with daily challenges. Nonetheless, the orientation is always to create a connection with God.
<span class="poetry indentAll">But to take the trouble to make any kind of movement solely out of love for the other – that is, without any sparks of returning light and with no hope for any kind of recompense in return – is completely impossible by nature.<sup>71</sup> Regarding such, it is written in the “<i>Tikunei Hazohar</i>” [22a, 73b] about the nations of the world: “<b>Every act of kindness that they do, they do for themselves</b>.” This means that all kindness they show, either toward their friends or in the worship of their gods, is not because of their love for the other, but because of their self-love. And that is because love for the other is completely contrary to nature, as has been explained.<sup>72</sup></span>
71. Since the Creator created our essential nature as the desire to receive pleasure and joy, therefore we are not capable of going against the nature that God created. In a manner similar to the legal principle that only “the mouth that forbade [by making a financial claim on another person] is the mouth that permitted [by renouncing the claim],” so only the Creator who bound us in the chains of self-love is capable of freeing us.
72. The expression “the nations of the world” is not used here in its simple meaning as referring to the billions of people scattered around the globe. Rather any person without faith is considered in the category “the nations of the world,” and naturally whatever kindness this person does is actually done for his or her own interest. [See “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” VII – The Nations of the World.]
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore, only those who keep Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> get training for this, because in the course of accustoming themselves to keep Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> with the intention of pleasing their Maker, they gradually depart from the bosom of the natural creation and acquire a second nature, this being the love of the other as stated.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is what brought the sages of the <i>Zohar</i> to exclude the nations of the world from any possibility of being able to love others, when they said: “<b>Every act of kindness that they do, they do for themselves</b>.” [<i>Tikunei Hazohar</i> 22a, 73b] For they are not involved in keeping Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> for its own sake, and the whole purpose of service of their gods is for reward and salvation in this world and the world to come, as is known. Thus, their worship of their gods is also out of self-love, and they could never have an action outside the framework of their own body, by which they could lift themselves even a hair’s-breadth above the ground-level of nature.<sup>73</sup></span>
73. Each of us is by nature on this level of “kindness” of “the nations of the world.” But if we are conscious of this and try to attain true love, and request the help of God to rise up from the ground floor of our nature, then with the help of God we will be able to get to a state of true kindness that is not rooted in our self-interest.

Chapter 14

<small>Through great effort in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, one gradually attains a second nature of desire to give, and then immediately attains the final goal, which is the state of cleaving to God.</small>
<small>Interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> are more suited (than <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God) to bring a person to the final goal.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus we see with our own two eyes that a person, who is occupied with Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> for its own sake, senses no difference between the two categories of the Torah, even at the practical level. For until you become perfected in this, any act for another – whether for God or for people – will of necessity be felt by you as unfathomably empty. But through great effort, you slowly rise and attain a second nature, and then immediately attain the final goal, which is cleaving to God as has been clarified.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This being the case, reason dictates that the part of the Torah that applies between one person and another is more suited to bring us to the desired goal [cleaving to God]. For the spiritual work in <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God is fixed and specified, and has no critics. A person easily becomes accustomed to it, and whatever is done out of habit has no capacity to bring us [spiritual] benefit, as is well-known. This is in complete contrast with <i>mitzvot</i> between one person and another, which are not fixed and not specified, and critics surround us wherever we may turn. Hence, their suitability is more certain and their goal is closer.</span>

Chapter 15

<small>Fulfilling the <i>mitzvah</i> of “and love your fellow as yourself” is the final goal of the Torah.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now we can understand without difficulty the words of Hillel the <i>nasi</i> to the convert to the effect that the essential pivot within the Torah is “and love your fellow as yourself” and the remaining 612 <i>mitzvot</i> are a commentary and a preparation for this (as above in section 2). Even the <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God are also included in the preparation for this commandment,<sup>74</sup> since it is the final goal that comes out of all the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, as our sages said: “Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> were given only to refine Israel by means of them.” [<i>Midrash Raba,</i> Genesis Ch. 44] This refers to the purification of the body<sup>75</sup> until it acquires a second nature defined as love of the other. This is the singular commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself” which is the final goal of the Torah, at which point a person immediately merits cleaving to God.<sup>76</sup></span>
74. Both the <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God and the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> have as their goal to educate us to be conscious of the other. The “other” can be another person or God, but the goal is the same.
75. The “body” here refers to self-love and the inborn nature of desire to receive. This is refined by the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.
76. The Creator has the character of absolute love for the other, for God’s only interest is to give to the created beings. Therefore when we completely adopt the nature of loving the other, we become completely connected with the Creator.
<span class="poetry indentAll">And there’s no difficulty regarding why he didn’t define this with the verse: “and you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.” [Deut. 6:5] For this is due to the reason given above that with respect to a person who still has his or her original created nature,<sup>77</sup> there really is no difference at all between the love of God and the love of a fellow person, as anything outside of oneself is considered non-existent.<sup>78</sup> And the convert asked Hillel the <i>nasi</i> to explain to him the desired end of the Torah, in a way that his goal would be near and he would not have to walk a long way, as he said: “Teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one leg.”<sup>79</sup> Therefore Hillel defined it for him in terms of loving his fellow man, as its goal is nearer and is quick to be revealed (above, section 14); for it is protected from errors, and there are others who will make demands.<sup>80</sup></span>
77. That is, a person who still has the nature of desiring to receive pleasure and joy for self-benefit.
78. The only reality that I know is the reality of myself, for I sense a continual demand to satisfy my self-love. Therefore anything outside myself is significant only to the extent that I can exploit it for my own benefit, and otherwise it has no reality at all. For this reason, Baal Hasulam states that there is no difference between the love of God and the love of people. Whether the other is another person or God, the other is outside me and therefore insignificant.
79. The convert asked Hillel to explain to him briefly the essential principle of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>.
80. Our spiritual work is to educate ourselves to acknowledge the reality of the other, and it doesn’t matter whether the other is another person or God. However, Hillel wanted to shorten the spiritual journey of the convert, and therefore he told him to love other people, for this way is better suited to educate us. The reason for this is that other people are more concrete than God. We can look within ourselves and reflect whether we really love a certain person, and it’s very difficult for an honest person to deceive himself or herself about this. But regarding the Creator, not only is He not concrete, even His demands are not being expressed to us at the present moment (and therefore are not concrete). Since there is no concrete sign that could disprove it, we can just imagine that we love the Creator.
The demands of other people change daily – each time they vibrate our nerves with a different tone and with differing degrees of force. So there is a daily test of our relationship to other people, full of snares and full of struggles. By contrast, the demands of the Creator are fixed. For example, we are told to pray three times a day, and so the prayer becomes routine and the average person cannot breathe any life into it or into any of the other routine <i>mitzvot</i> between a person and God. So these <i>mitzvot</i> don’t continually test us and bring us to move against our nature. For these reasons, “and love your fellow as yourself” is preferable to “and love the Lord your God.”
In summary, Hillel and Rabbi Akiva defined “and love your fellow as yourself” as the goal, because other people make clear demands and we cannot deceive ourselves regarding this. But the truth is that loving other people is a means to learn to love the Creator, and not the end goal.

Chapter 16

<small>Only when each member of the nation commits to “and love your fellow as yourself” is it possible for us to fulfill the Torah. So the Torah was given only after all of Israel said: “We will do and we will hear.”</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">What we have now said provides the key to understanding that which we considered above (see sections 3 and 4) regarding the essential content of this commandment “and love your fellow as yourself:” How can the Torah obligate us to do the impossible?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Indeed, understand! It was for this reason that the Torah was not given to our holy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but was withheld until the exodus from Egypt. At that time they left and became a complete nation, including six hundred thousand men aged twenty years or more. For then each member of the nation was asked if he or she agrees to take on this exalted work. And once each and every one of the nation agreed to this with all of his or her heart and soul, and said: “We will do and we will hear,” then was created the possibility of fulfilling the Torah as a whole. It came out of the realm of the impossible and entered the realm of the possible.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For this is a complete certainty: If six hundred thousand people give up busying themselves with their own needs, and they have nothing to do in their lives apart from making sure that their comrades lack absolutely nothing – and moreover, they do it out of a mighty love with all their heart and soul, in accordance with the full meaning of the commandment “and love your fellow as yourself” – then it is clear without the slightest doubt that all need has been eliminated for any member of the nation to have concern for his or her own sustenance.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus each individual can easily fulfill the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself” in accord with all the conditions that have been clarified (in sections 3 and 4). For how could a person have concern for his or her own sustenance when at that moment six hundred thousand loyal lovers are standing by, at the ready, with great attention to ensure that he or she lacks nothing that is needed?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore, once all the members of the nation agreed to this, immediately the Torah was given to them, because now they were qualified to fulfill it. Indeed, before they had multiplied to the degree of a complete nation – and, needless to say, in the time of the patriarchs who were only a few individuals in [all] the land – they were not truly qualified to keep the Torah in its ideal form. For with a small number of people, it’s impossible even to begin engaging in the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> in the spirit of “and love your fellow as yourself” (as clarified in sections 3 and 4). Therefore the Torah was not given to them.<sup>81</sup></span>
81. However, even though we do not live in a society based on loving the other, this does not exempt us from doing the maximum we can to fulfill “and love your fellow as yourself.” For this is the critical point that enables us to progress spiritually, and as King Solomon states: “Whatever you are capable of doing, use your strength to do it.” [Proverbs 9:10]

(Continuation of the essay “The Giving of the Torah”)
<b>“. . . all of Israel are guarantors for one another.”</b> [<i>Sanhedrin,</i> 27b, <i>Shavuot</i> 39a]

Chapter 17

<small>How can it be that we are accountable for the sins of others?</small>
<small>How can it be that we are responsible for the whole world?</small>
<small>Before the giving of the Torah, we accepted a mutual guaranty to fulfill each other’s needs.</small>
<small>If anyone betrays the guaranty, then everyone will betray it.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And from the above [in the previous essay] we can understand one of the puzzling statements of our sages – namely, that all of Israel are guarantors for one another. This seems completely unjust. Could it be that someone sins and angers his Maker, and although you have no acquaintance or relationship with this person, the Holy One collects the sinner’s debt from you? In scripture it is written: “Fathers will not be put to death for children . . . every man will be put to death for his own sin.” [Deut. 24:16] So how can the sages say that you are accountable even for the sins of a person completely foreign to you, when you are neither familiar with this person nor with his or her place of origin?</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And if that’s not difficult enough, take a look at <i>Kiddushin</i> [40b]: Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, says, “Since the world is judged according to its majority, and the individual is judged according to his or her majority [of actions], someone who performs one commandment is fortunate, for that person has tipped the scale to the side of merit for himself or herself and for the whole world. Woe to someone who performs one sin, for he or she has tipped the scale to the side of demerit for himself or herself and for the whole world, as scripture says ‘. . . but one sinner destroys much good.’” [Ecclesiastes 9:18]</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, has made me responsible even for the whole world, for according to him everyone in the world is responsible for one another, and each individual’s acts create merit or demerit for the whole world. This is an additional astonishing statement on top of the other.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, according to what we have clarified above, their words are easily perceived to be understandable and acceptable. For we clearly demonstrated that every single one of the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> in the Torah revolves around the pivot of the one commandment “and love your fellow as yourself,” and this pivotal commandment cannot be fulfilled <b>without an entire nation whose every member is prepared to do so</b>. And this is the matter of <b>the mutual guaranty</b>, when all of Israel became guarantors for one another. Because the Torah was not given to them until each and every Israelite was asked if he or she agreed to take upon himself or herself the commandment of loving the other in the full measure expressed in the verse: “and love your fellow as yourself” (as explained in sections 2 and 3, examine each word carefully there). This means that each and every one of us in Israel will take upon ourselves to care about and work for each member of the nation to fill all of his or her needs to no less a degree than the measure imprinted in ourselves to care for our own needs.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Once the whole nation unanimously agreed and said, “<b>We will do and we will hear</b>”<sup>82</sup> [Exodus 24:7], each member of Israel became a guarantor that not a single thing will be lacking from any member of the nation. Only then did they become worthy of receiving the Torah, and not before; because with this collective responsibility, each member of the nation was liberated from worrying about the needs of his or her own body and could keep the commandment “and love your fellow as yourself” in all its measure. Each person knew for certain that he or she was surrounded by six hundred thousand loyal lovers, who were standing ready to care for him or her (as explained in section 16). Therefore each individual could freely give all of his or her possessions to anyone in need, since there was no need for concern regarding the maintenance of his or her own body.</span>
82. The meaning of “we will hear” is “we will understand and will accept the idea.” Thus “hearing” hints at perceiving the benefit of the idea. The people of Israel said in effect: “We are prepared to accept the spiritual work of “and love your fellow as yourself,” despite the ego’s opposition and depiction of negative images. We don’t see the benefit in the idea, but we’re willing to begin this spiritual work. We believe that we’ll definitely see the great benefit after we perform the deeds involved.”
The meaning of “we will do” according to Baal Hasulam is “we have faith and are willing to put aside our understanding.” This is the “secret” known to the angels, as said in Psalms [103:20]: “Bless God, you angels of His, you mighty ones who perform His bidding, hearkening to the voice of His word” [first “perform,” then “hearkening”]. Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag explained that the people of Israel were not stupid when they said “we will do and we will hear.” They were people with intelligence and capable of careful consideration and critique; and the more an individual has understanding, the more difficult it is for that individual to annul it and to choose to do the will of the Creator. Thus, Israel chose to be like animals, as in the verse in Psalms [36:7]: “God, you save man and beast.” The verse is explained in <i>Chulin</i> 5b: God saves “those who have clever minds befitting people but make themselves like animals” [in humility].
For this reason, they were not ready to receive the Torah from the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but only when they came out of Egypt and became a complete, independent nation. Only then was created a condition where everyone could feel secure regarding his or her needs without any care or concern at all. This is in contrast to the situation when they were still mingling with the Egyptians, when a portion of their needs was necessarily given into the hands of these wild foreigners who were full of self-love. Under this circumstance, the portion under the control of foreigners would not at all be guaranteed for each Israeli individual, because his or her friends would not be able to provide for those needs that are not under their control. And as has already been explained, so long as you are troubled with concerns for yourself, you are completely unfit even to begin to keep the commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself.”
<span class="poetry indentAll">So you clearly see that the giving of the Torah had to be delayed until they came out of Egypt and became a nation of their own, when all their needs were under their control without dependence on others. Then they were prepared to accept upon themselves the above-mentioned guaranty, and afterward they were given the Torah. For this reason, it follows that even after the receiving of the Torah, if a few people from Israel would betray the guaranty and return to the contamination of self-love without consideration of their friends, then the amount of need that was dependent on those few would become a nuisance for each individual Israelite to care for it himself or herself. Those few who betrayed will have no pity on the one who is in need, and consequently the fulfillment of the commandment of loving the other will be precluded for the whole of Israel (as explained above). In this way, those rebels cause also the Torah-observant to remain in their contamination – in self-love – for they will not be able to engage in the commandment “and love your fellow as yourself” and perfect their love for others without their help.<sup>83</sup>, <sup>84</sup></span>
83. If you fulfill one <i>mitzvah</i> and thus follow the path of loving the other, then you tip the scale in the direction of loving the other for the society in general. If you commit a sin and thus follow the path of self-love, then you tip the scale for everyone in favor of self-love.
84. The <i>mitzvah</i> “and love your fellow as yourself” can be fulfilled in a healthy social framework in which each person is prepared to serve the other with the intention of coming to love the other, for he or she understands that the optimal society for Israel and the whole world is one in which each loves the other. Each will offer himself or herself and his or her talents to the public without collecting any reward, and then no one will lack anything.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Question: Is there not still an element of self-love due to the fact that maximal fulfillment of “and love your fellow as yourself” is possible only on condition that everyone is assured of his or her minimal needs? For, after all is said and done, we must have our minimal needs satisfied. Only when this is assured we can begin to work for the sake of others!</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Answer: Minimal needs are not to be considered “selflove,” for “the necessary will not be condemned nor praised” [an expression frequently used in Jewish law]; and this of course is when indeed we are speaking only about the necessary. Furthermore, Jewish society is a society that went out of Egypt; and since Egypt symbolizes self-love, this means that in some general way, Jewish society has essentially abandoned the character of self-love [despite aberrations due to other factors]. Therefore this is a society of intrinsically righteous souls that are drawn to follow the path of “and love your fellow as yourself” and to give maximum consideration to the other’s needs. Another issue worth noting is that each individual has different needs, so the society will have to be conscious of this and prepared to take it into account when providing for the needs of everyone.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">In actual fact, the progress in the direction of societal cooperation is definitely only gradual; and the giving and the sacrifice for the other is gradual. For the individual’s will to receive does not free him or her to become a selfless giver instantaneously. Rather this is an internal battle; and slowly, step by step, an individual can conquer areas from his or her personal sphere for the benefit of selfless giving. And apparently this gradual progress takes place similarly on the social plane.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We see clearly that all of Israel are responsible for one another, both on the positive side and on the negative side. On the positive side, if they keep the mutual guaranty to the extent that each takes care to fulfill the needs of his or her friends, then due to this they become capable of fully keeping the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, which constitutes bringing contentment to their Maker<sup>85</sup> (as mentioned in section 13). Also on the negative side, if a part of the nation does not want to keep the mutual guaranty, but rather chooses to be absorbed with self-love, they cause the rest of the nation to remain immersed in their contamination and lowliness without ever finding any way out of their contaminated condition (as previously explained).</span>
85. For when people arrive at maximal selfless giving, then they are as children of God, walking in the ways for which their Maker brought them to the world. From this God “has contentment.”

Chapter 18

<small>The mutual guaranty is like the situation of two people on a boat.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore, the <i><b>tanna</b></i> [Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai] described the mutual guaranty as similar to the situation of two people on a boat. One of them began to drill a hole underneath himself, and his friend asked, “Why are you drilling?” He answered, “What difference does it make to you? I’m drilling under myself, not under you.” His friend replied, “Fool! We will die together in the boat!” [<i><b>Midrash Raba</b></i>, Leviticus Chapter 4]</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is similar to what we have been saying. Those who throw off the yoke of the mutual guaranty are sinking in self-love, and by their actions they build an iron fence that prevents the Torah-observant from even beginning to properly keep the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> according to the standard of “and love your fellow as yourself,” which is the ladder for attaining <i>devekut</i> [cleaving to God] as previously mentioned [section 6]. How correct were the words in the parable when he said: “Fool, we will die together in the boat!”<sup>86</sup></span>
86. The principle that those who act out of self-love spoil the society is true not only for an ideal society that has accepted a mutual guaranty; but in any society, if someone acts out of self-love, it will always project a message of indulgence, and it will strengthen to a certain degree the character of self-love in the society. Thus, if you act out of self-love, you not only cause damage to yourself but also to others.
This contradicts the entire foundation of Western culture which asserts that a person can do whatever he or she wants so long as it doesn’t bother or harm anyone else. The most abominable affairs are permitted on condition that they don’t hurt another person. According to Judaism, however, this is not acceptable at all. For, since all of Israel are guarantors for one another, when someone acts to fulfill his or her lusts without any explicit harm to others, he or she actually causes tremendous harm by transmitting a message of self-love that spoils the whole world. Furthermore, according to the inner meaning of the Torah, the matter is even more severe. Even without dealing with what are considered “abominations,” but even just by your sitting alone and eating an innocent breakfast – when it’s done out of self-love – one has thereby tipped the scale for the whole world to the side of demerit.
Therefore according to the Torah, there is no such thing as “individual liberty” as defined in Western society. For the Creator does not allow individual liberty. Rather “all of one’s deeds are written in the book.” Our deeds affect ourselves and influence the society, and we will have to give an accounting for every matter.

Chapter 19

<small>Although the guaranty initially includes only the nation of Israel, ultimately each individual in the world is responsible for the whole world.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, took the concept of the guaranty to an even greater extreme. He states that not only all of Israel are guarantors for one another, but that the whole world takes part in the guaranty. Actually, there is no dispute here, for all agree that, to begin with – that is, only as a start in the rectification of the world – a single nation is sufficient to make a foundation for the Torah. It was impossible to begin with all the nations at once; and so the sages said [<i>Avoda Zara</i> 2b] that the Holy One went from one nation to another with the Torah, but they did not want to receive it. That is, they were immersed above their noses in the contamination of self-love – some with adultery, some with robbery and murder, and the like – to the extent that it was inconceivable at that time to ask them if they agreed to abstain from self-love.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Therefore, God did not find any nation qualified to receive the Torah other than the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for the refinement<sup>87</sup> of their forefathers stood by them. As our sages said, “The forefathers observed the whole Torah even before it was given.” [<i>Berachot</i> 2b] That is, because of the loftiness of their souls, they had the ability to perceive and acquire all the ways of God which constitute the spirituality of the Torah that stems from attachment to God. This they achieved without first ascending the ladder of practicing the deeds of the Torah, for they had no possibility of fulfilling them at all [as stated in “The Giving of the Torah” section 16].<sup>88</sup></span>
87. [The Hebrew expression used by Baal Hasulam is “<i>zachut avotam</i>,” which is often translated as “the merit of their forefathers,” but “<i>zachut</i>” can also mean “refinement” and that seems to be the intended meaning here.]
88. They had no possibility of fulfilling the practice of the Torah, because they were few.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Undoubtedly, both the physical refining<sup>89</sup> and the spiritual exaltedness of our holy ancestors greatly influenced their children and their children’s children. Their refinement remained with those of that generation [that received the Torah], whose every member took upon himself or herself that sublime spiritual work, as each and every one stated wholeheartedly, “We will do and we will hear.”<sup>90</sup> And this is the reason we were chosen – out of necessity<sup>91</sup> – to be a treasured<sup>92</sup> people from among all the nations. Hence, only the members of the Israeli nation were admitted into the required guaranty and not the nations of the world at all, because they did not take part in it. This is the plain reality; so how could Rabbi Elazar disagree with it?<sup>93</sup></span>
89. In Egypt our forefathers went through a process of “physical refining” while enslaved to work with the physical material of mortar and bricks. [From an inner perspective, this represents the cultural refinement of first experiencing embitterment and recognizing the inevitable lack of satisfaction in a life of subjugation to materialist values; and then undergoing a release and revelation of spiritual values.]
90. The meaning of “we will do” is the preparedness to begin the work of “and love your fellow as yourself” without expectation of reward, solely on the basis of faith in the greatness of God as well as the greatness of people. The meaning of “we will hear” is the comprehension of the worthiness of the work. It’s not a condition for our service, but rather the trust that if we accept upon ourselves this difficult work – between one person and another, and between a person and God – then we will see its worthiness in the end.
The process of physical refinement and the choice of Israel takes place within each individual, for within each of us is the aspect of Israel, as well as the aspect of the nations of the world which are the lusts for illicit relations, money, honor, etc. If the aspect of the nations of the world dominates a person then he or she is not capable of accepting the Torah and is not at all interested in it. That person may be capable of studying the Torah as intellectual wisdom, but he or she really has no connection to God’s Torah which is the Torah of loving the other. Only when we recognize our lack of true interest in the Torah and begin to pour out our heart in prayer on this issue, then God can gradually illuminate us by means of the light of the Torah. Then the aspect of Israel can slowly begin to hear the idea of fulfilling God’s Torah.
91. He states that we were chosen “out of necessity” because the other nations did not want the Torah at all. In terms of its inner meaning, this expresses that our egocentric desires – known as “the other nations” within each individual – do not want to be subjugated to the Torah.
92. [The Hebrew word <i>segulah</i> is used here to describe the Jewish people and is usually translated as “treasured” or “specially fit for its purpose.” However, it also has the connotation of being a spiritual remedy, and this fits Baal Hasulam’s theme that the people of Israel are destined to heal the world of its selflove. As he says in section 28: “This means that you will be My treasure in the sense that sparks of purification and cleansing of the body shall pass through you to all the peoples and nations of the world.” The intention of “cleansing the body” is cleansing of the ego, which is considered the “bodily” portion of the soul.]
93. That is, Rabbi Elazar certainly accepts this truth that in the initial stage only Israel must occupy itself with this wondrous work of loving the other. His mention of the guaranty that applies to the whole world is due to his referring to the next stage.

Chapter 20

<small>The Israeli nation must continue to train itself and others until the world adopts the spiritual work of the love of others.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, the conclusion of the rectification of the world will come when <b>everyone in the world is included in the idea</b> [literally, <b>the secret] of God’s service</b>, as it is written, “And God will be king over <b>all the earth</b>; on that day God will be one and His name one” [Zechariah 14:9]. And the text specifies “on that day” and not before. And, similarly, the writings: “for the earth will be full of the knowledge of God” [Isaiah 11:9]; “and all the nations will stream to it [God’s house].” [Isaiah 2:2]</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, the role of Israel towards the whole world resembles the role of our holy fathers towards the Israelite nation. The refinement of our fathers enabled us to develop and become purified until we became worthy of receiving the Torah; for were it not for our fathers, who observed all of the Torah before it was given, we would certainly not be any more praiseworthy than the rest of the nations (section 19).<sup>94</sup> In the same way, it is incumbent upon the Israeli nation, via its occupation with Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, to train itself and all the people of the world until they develop to the stage that they take upon themselves the sublime work of the love of others, which is the ladder to the purpose of creation, that purpose being attachment to God (as has been explained).</span>
94. So we see that God has no sentiments at all for the people of Israel; rather God seeks within the world a species like His own. Since God is merciful and gracious, He seeks such a nature among His creatures. Because this quality has been developing within the Israelite nation, they have been brought closer to God. All this must be applied to each individual. That is, as long as the “nations of the world” within us are what controls our intentions, we cannot receive divine inspiration and there can be no contact between us and God. Only according to the measure of our progress toward loving the other, does the Creator form a connection with us. Although there’s also the divine aspect referred to as “I am God who dwells with them in their defilement,” this divine presence is found only within someone who has the potential to arrive at loving the other. For then God shows the person how his or her self-love is defilement, and in this way he or she slowly progresses toward arriving at loving the other.
<span class="poetry indentAll">In this way, each and every commandment that each individual from Israel performs with the intention to bring contentment to our Maker, and not for any payment of reward or self-love, promotes to some degree the development of all the people of the world. This is not done at once, but by slow, gradual development until these acts increase to such a degree that they can shift all the people in the world toward the desired purity. And this is what our sages call “<b>tipping the scale to the side of merit</b>,”<sup>95</sup> meaning that the desirable amount of purity has been filled. And they compare it to weighing on a balance, where the tipping of the scale is the indication of completing the measurement of what is being weighed.</span>
95. Again it should be noted that the Hebrew word “<i>zachut,</i>” translated here as “merit,” can also mean “spiritual refinement;” so the “tipping of the scale” refers to attaining a state where spiritual refinement is dominant.

Chapter 21

<small>When Rabbi Elazar states that each individual in the world is responsible for the whole world, he is referring to the situation when the people of the world become worthy of taking upon themselves the service of loving the other. The merit of each individual is seen as the amount that tipped the scale to the side of selfless love.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is the intent of the words of Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, when he says – <b>The world is judged according to its majority</b>. He is referring to the role of the Israeli nation to prepare the world to undergo a certain process of refinement, until the people of the world become worthy of taking upon themselves the service of God to no less than the extent to which the people of Israel were worthy at the time they received the Torah. This level of refinement is considered – in the language of our sages – that they have attained the majority of merits [spiritual refinements] so that they outweigh the side of demerit, which is the contaminated self-love.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Clearly, if the amount on the merit side of the scale – which represents the higher comprehension of the nature of loving the other<sup>96</sup> – is large and is greater than the amount on the side for the contaminated demerit, then the people with such merit are prepared to make the decision and give their assent by saying, “We will do, and we will hear,” as Israel said. But before that, before they obtain a majority of virtues, self-love certainly prevails and determines that they refuse to accept the yoke of [the service of] God.</span>
96. The “understanding” referred to here is not external, but rather an internal understanding, where we sense from our own central point of inner truth that loving the other is the true principle of life. Only this principle can move us forward toward attachment to God and eternity, and we need to apply it both to our individual selves and also to our society.
<span class="poetry indentAll">And this is what our sages intended when they said [<i>Kiddushin</i> 40b]: <b>Whoever does a single commandment is blissful for having tipped the scale to the side of merit for himself or herself and for the whole world</b>. That is, in the final accounting [when the world will be judged to be on the side of merit], the portion of merit of an individual member of Israel is included as the amount that tips the scale. Similarly, when weighing sesame seeds, one can add one seed at a time to one side of the scale until the point where it outweighs the other side. Here each seed surely provides a measure towards the tilting of the scale, and without that seed, the scale would have remained balanced. So this saying of the sages states that, in the same manner as the sesame seeds, a single act of an individual member of Israel tilts the scale for the whole world to the side of merit. When all is over and the scale that measures the whole world tips to the side of merit, then each individual will have had a part in the deciding weight; and without this part there would not have been the final reckoning.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus, you find that Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, does not dispute the words of our sages that all of Israel are guarantors for one another. Rather, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, speaks of the future correction of the whole world,<sup>97</sup> whereas our sages speak of the present when only Israel has accepted the Torah.</span>
97. The world is judged according to the majority, and the Holy One created an entire world. You can’t claim that only Jews are in the world; that they will merit to reach complete perfection; that they will attain the state of clinging to God and connection with Him – and that other peoples are like dust in the wind with no beginning and no purpose in the end. The Holy One created the world in its entirety so that every person would come to take part in the service of God.
The global service of God is gradual, just as an individual’s spiritual growth is gradual. We must daily train ourselves to have consideration for other people and for God. Little by little, we conquer a part of ourselves and then another part. And certainly the process is a gradual one also for humanity as a whole.
This vision seems like a dream, even with regard to the nation of Israel. When will the time arrive in which everyone will long to cling to God and follow the path of giving and faith? The basic truth is that each of us must focus on healing himself or herself and thereby hasten the process toward the general redemption. However, we must realize that everything is dependent on the will of God, and He determines the length of time it will take.
We see that when we are in distress, we search for the true meaning of our lives and stop dealing with nonsense. This is called the way of afflictions, by means of which God shortens the time of a person’s development. And a similar process must take place for the world as a whole.

Chapter 22

<small>When the <i>mitzvot</i> are performed without self-love, there is no difference between love of the Creator and love of other people. A single <i>mitzvah</i> performed without self-serving love has a general effect on all the people of the world to advance them toward loving one another.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This also explains the support for his view that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, finds in the verse: “One sinner can destroy much good” [Ecclesiastes 9:18]. It was already clarified above (section 20) that the sense of activation that comes over us from engaging in <i>mitzvot</i> between people and God is precisely the same as the sense of activation that comes over us when engaging in interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i>.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">For the performance of all the <i>mitzvot</i> must be <i>lishma</i> [for its own sake] without any hope for one’s self-love. That is, no receiving of light or hope will come back to him for his trouble – [no receiving] by way of reward or honor or the like. It is here, in this exalted point [of <i>lishma</i>] that the love of the Creator and the love of one’s fellow unite and actually become one<sup>98</sup> (see section 15).</span>
98. Explanation: As Baal Hasulam said above in section 13, anything which is outside of us is felt to be non-existent, and it makes no difference whether the other is God or another person. Therefore when someone focuses on performing actions with the sole intention of pleasing another, the natural feeling is that these actions are empty and meaningless. But when the miracle occurs, and God gives us a new heart which is the desire to give selflessly and love the other; then we truly love the other, and it makes no difference whether the other is God or another person. [The true performance of any <i>mitzvah</i> is done <i>lishma</i>.] Therefore the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> and the <i>mitzvot</i> between people and God are one and the same. Furthermore, the true goal of our living in this world is to attain a connection with God. The true source of loving another person is not the love of external features of the other, but rather the portion of God within the other – that is, it comes from loving God who is enclothed by the person.
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus one who acts <i>lishma</i> has a general effect on all the people of the world by advancing them a certain measure in climbing the ladder of loving the other. For the degree of influence caused by an individual’s actions, whether it be large or small, ultimately joins the future measure that will tilt the scale of the world to the side of merit, since his or her share has been added and joins the amount that shifts the balance (as above in section 21 – examine there the sesame seeds allegory).<sup>99</sup></span>
99. Our rabbi Baal Hasulam teaches us that our thoughts and desires are absorbed in the space of the world, and a person’s thoughts and desires get transferred from him or her to other people. Therefore, by virtue of how we conduct ourselves (including our thoughts and desires), we create a particular quality that gives direction to the whole world. And although our influence does not appear to be determinative, nonetheless each of us certainly contributes to the world in this non-physical way. A sesame seed is tiny and almost weightless, just as we can view ourselves to be very small and incapable of making a decisive impact on the world. Baal Hasulam says that despite an individual’s smallness, his or her minute act can tilt the individual’s scale to the side of merit – that is, to the side of loving the other and loving God – and then he or she transmits these messages to the entirety of the world, messages of love and anti-egoism, which eventually tilt the scale of the world.
The opposite is also true: Whenever a person tilts his or her scale to the side of demerit – that is, the side of self-love – he or she transmits to the world messages of self-love; and in this way, his or her particular quality tilts the scale of the world to the side of demerit. Here there are two possible situations: a) someone who relates to serving God but falls into self-love; is pained by this; and thus causes others in the world to be pained by their own self-love; b) someone who acts out of self-love and is fine with this; and in this way will affect the world so that people will accept their self-love.
Take note that the stronger the personality one has – that is, the stronger his or her will – then the more he or she will be able to affect the world with decisive actions. Furthermore, the more we are connected to God, then the greater our inner vitality; and consequently the greater will be our influence on others. Thus there is no need to run around the world, to transmit messages, to use the media, to cause people to repent, to distribute material, to make sure that one has as many students and followers as possible. Rather, according to the above, it would suffice that we straighten our intentions and actions, and in this way we will be effecting the greatest activity for the world’s sake. (See also the preface to the <i>Zohar</i>, section 65ff.) However, when someone has not worked on himself or herself, but already leaps to the role of trying to influence others, then he or she puts out vibrations that have to a large extent an external and false quality.
<span class="poetry indentAll">But someone who commits a single sin, which means that he or she cannot overcome and conquer his or her contaminated self-love, and hence impulsively steals or the like,<sup>100</sup> sentences himself or herself and the whole world to the side of demerit. For in the revealing of the contamination of self-love, the lowly aspect of creation regains its force. Thus, he or she subtracts a certain amount from the final measure that would tilt the scale of the world to the side of merit. This is just like a person removing from one side of the scale that single sesame seed that a friend had put there, and thereby he or she raises slightly the side of demerit. In this way the world is turned backward, as scripture states: “But one sinner destroys much good” [Ecclesiastes 9:15]. Because one person could not overcome a petty lust, he or she pushed back the spirituality of the whole world.</span>
100. Note that our sages said that Adam was a thief [<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> – Leviticus]. Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag explained that the idea behind theft is that the thief transfers from another’s domain to the thief ’s domain. And we see that Adam drew the divine light called “the tree of knowledge” into his private domain, his vessels of self-love (due to the extraordinary pleasure of eating the fruit). Therefore the idea of theft is not related to a particular kind of act, rather anything done out of self-love is called “theft.”

Chapter 23

<small>Israel became qualified to be a candidate to receive the Torah due to two factors: Their afflictions in Egypt and the spiritual purification of the nation’s ancestors.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">With these words is clarified what we discussed above (section 5) regarding the Torah being given specifically to the stock of the Israeli nation. For it is certain – and no one would disagree – that the purpose of creation applies to the whole of the human race – black, white or yellow – without any essential difference. However, because of the descent of human nature to the lowest level (as explained above), which is the self-love that unrestrictedly rules over all of humanity, there was no way to begin to negotiate with them and explain to them so that they would commit and agree – even with a mere promise – to exit their narrow framework and enter the wide world of loving the other.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The exception was the Israeli nation, because they were enslaved in the savage kingdom of Egypt four hundred years in horrible torments. As a well-known saying of our sages states, “Just as salt sweetens meat, so afflictions polish a person’s sins.” [<i>Berachot</i> 5a] That is, afflictions bring to the body great purification.<sup>101</sup> Furthermore, the spiritual purification of their holy ancestors stood them in good stead (see section 16); and this is the essential factor, as several verses of the Torah testify.</span>
101. Because of their afflictions, Israel had to unite and throw their self-love to the garbage heap. Similarly, in a time of war when we all share the same sorrow, we unite and cast away our disagreements and whatever separates us.
The Hebrew word for “Egypt” – <i>Mitzrayim</i> – hints to a double narrowness: <i>tzarut ayin</i> (narrow eye – i.e., narrow vision) and <i>tzarut lev</i> (narrow heart – i.e., narrow concern). So the spiritual meaning of subjugation to Egypt is subjugation to the self-love within us. The difficulty of the subjugation consists in the travail of the long struggle against one’s self-love, and it is due to this that one can merit to be redeemed from the “narrow vision and narrow heart” called “<i>Mitzrayim.</i>”
The source of the greatness of Israel is how they grew from the suffering they endured. We see from this that an individual also can become great by means of suffering. As the psalm says “Blessed is the person whom You afflict, God.” [Psalms 94:12] We naturally avoid suffering, but the truth is that one who is afflicted by God should feel joyful: First, because by virtue of our afflictions, we recognize the insignificance of our self-love and so get closer to God; secondly, afflictions show us the need for faith, since they are unbearable without it; thirdly, our afflictions enable us to feel the suffering of others.
The desire to receive works on a market basis: The amount we have to endure is weighed against the amount of pleasure we may profit. We can work hard to fulfill our lust; but after we get what we want, we realize that it wasn’t worth the effort. Our sages said that whenever we receive a measure of what we want, we then want to receive more. The suffering this entails can lead us gradually to spiritual advancement, because we see that this business is not profitable, and our suffering is getting us nowhere. After experimenting with different ways to fulfill our desire to receive, eventually we can see that the system based on the desire to receive is self-destructive. If we fail to enter the path of Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>, then the greatness of the desire to receive can cause us to continually increase our chasing after pleasure until we fall exhausted without a breath of life.
<span class="poetry indentAll">By virtue of these two prior factors, Israel became qualified for this [giving of the Torah]. And this is why the text refers to them in the singular form [of the Hebrew verb for “camped”] as it is written [Exodus 19:2], “And there Israel camped before the mountain,” which our sages interpret [that Israel was] “as one person with one heart.” This [unity] was because each and every person from the nation completely removed himself or herself from self-love, and his or her whole intention was only to benefit another, as we have shown above regarding the meaning of the commandment “and love your fellow as yourself” (section 16, examine this carefully). So we find that all the individuals in the nation united together and became as one heart and one person, for only then were they qualified for receiving the Torah (as was explained).<sup>102</sup></span>
102. For only after they accepted upon themselves loving the other as expressed in “we will do, and we will say” [Exodus 24:7], they became qualified for the practical fulfillment of the principles of the Torah, a lifestyle of “what is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours.” [Chapters of the Fathers 5:10].
What relevance do these matters have for us? It can be said that there are three stages in our development: a) We must study Torah so that the light of the Torah will enable us to feel the great corruption in our self-love; b) The light of the Torah should give us a continually greater readiness to annul ourselves and give selflessly; c) When this readiness has ripened, then we become worthy to receive the Torah.

Chapter 24

<small>Israel is a gateway by which the sparks of spiritual refinement flow to the entire human race.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Thus, because of the above-stated necessity [to choose Israel], the Torah was given specifically to the Israeli nation, solely to the stock of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for it was inconceivable that any stranger would take part in it.<sup>103</sup> Indeed because of this, the Israeli nation became set to be a sort of gateway by which the sparks of spiritual refinement would flow to the entire human race the world over. These sparks increase in number day after day, like donations to a treasury, until they fill up to the desired amount – that is, until people develop to such an extent that they can comprehend the pleasantness and the tranquility that are embedded within the kernel of loving the other. For then they will know how to tilt the scale to the side of merit and will place themselves under God’s yoke, and the side of demerit will be eradicated from the world.<sup>104</sup></span>
103. It may be asked: Haven’t other nations endured various afflictions and subjugations? Why didn’t their afflictions affect them so as to bring them to a state of fulfilling the Torah? Answer: Because the two above-mentioned factors are bound up one with the other. It is because Israel has the heritage of its nation’s fathers as its spiritual genetics that the afflictions in Egypt operated to improve the quality of this heritage. However, for a different nation without this heritage, afflictions do not similarly advance them in loving the other. It can be added as well that if Israel had only the heritage of the fathers without the afflictions, also then they could not have arrived at the situation of the giving of the Torah.
Given the above, the question arises: For what purpose are the nations of the world afflicted? The answer must be that the afflictions do advance them, but very slowly. Because they are not centered on the points of faith and charity, their afflictions do not naturally create a focus on improving these points. However, afflictions do certainly advance humanity, and without them the nations of the world would never seek a different basis for their lives and would never accept the way of life of Israel.
104. In the meantime, it is the nation of Israel that must be repaired. For at this stage the spirit that rules in Israel is the spirit of the nations of the world and not the spirit of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Therefore it’s not relevant at this stage that Israel occupy itself with pouring out sparks of refinement to the whole world. What matters first is that each of us is obligated to uncover the quality of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob within himself or herself. And by virtue of this, with God’s help, there will also be a general change in the face of the Israeli nation. Then, afterward, the Israeli nation can bring about a change also in the nations of the world.

Chapter 25

<small>Where do we find in the Torah that the children of Israel were requested before receiving the Torah to accept the <i>mitzvah</i> of loving the other?</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now there remains to complete what we explained (in section 16) about the reason the Torah was not given to the forefathers: The commandment “and love your fellow as yourself” is the pivot of the whole Torah and around which all the <i>mitzvot</i> revolve as they clarify and interpret this commandment. Since this commandment cannot be observed by individuals alone, but only through prior consent of an entire nation; therefore the matter [of the nation accepting it] extended until their exodus from Egypt when they were suited to fulfill the commandment. And then they were first asked if each and every one of the nation agreed to take this commandment upon himself or herself. And once they agreed to it, they were given the Torah. (Examine section 16 carefully.)</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, it still must be clarified: Where do we find in the Torah that the children of Israel were asked this question and that they agreed to it prior to receiving the Torah?</span>

Chapter 26

<small>It seems that God’s invitation to Israel to accept the Torah does not specify what is required of them and what reward is being offered; and it’s unclear what is intended by “a kingdom of priests” and “a holy nation.”</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Bear in mind that, in the invitation that God sent to Israel through our rabbi Moses prior to the receiving of the Torah, these things [the request and its acceptance] are clearly exposed to view to anyone who uses his or her intellect. [The invitation] is as written <i><b>(</b></i>Exodus 19:5): “‘And now, if you will indeed listen to My voice, and if you will keep My covenant, then you will be My treasure among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine. And you will be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you will speak to the children of Israel.’ And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which God commanded him. And all the people answered together, and said: ‘All that God said we will do.’ And Moses brought the words of the people back to God.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">[However,] these words appear to be unsuited to their task, because common sense dictates that if you offer a friend to do some work, and you want to get his or her agreement, you need to present to him or her an example of the nature of that work and also its reward. Only then is it possible for the receiver [of the offer] to examine it – whether to decline or to accept. But here, in these two verses, we seem to find neither an example of the work nor of reward in exchange for the work. For it says: “if you will indeed listen to My voice, and if you will keep My covenant;” and it does not make explicit what the voice or the covenant apply to.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">And following this it says: “then you will be My treasure among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine;” and it is not clear from this whether God is commanding us – that is, [telling us] to make the effort to become a treasure among all peoples – or whether this [being a treasure] is a promise that is beneficial for us.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">We must also understand the connection here to the end of the verse: “for all the earth is Mine.” All three translators – Onkelos, Yonatan Ben Uziel, and The Jerusalem Talmud – and all the interpreters – Rashi, Ramban, etc. – are pressed here to correct the plain meaning of this scripture. And Ibn Ezra says, in the name of Rabbi Marinos, that the word “כי” [usually translated as “for”] here indicates “although.” So he [Rabbi Marinos] interprets the verse as: “then you will be My treasure from among all peoples; although all the earth is Mine.” And Ibn Ezra himself also tends to agree with this.<sup>105</sup></span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, that interpretation does not correspond with our sages, who stated that “כי” is used [only] for four connotations: “or,” “lest,” “but,” and “that;” so how can it add yet a fifth connotation: “although”!?</span>
105. This interpretation is very reasonable. It says that although all the earth is Mine – that is, all the earth and all the peoples that live on the earth came into existence through the power of My creating them – nonetheless, only you will be for Me a treasure out of all the nations. [Nonetheless, this interpretation is unacceptable, because it employs an unrecognized meaning of “כי”.]
<span class="poetry indentAll">And then the scripture ends: “And for Me you will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” Here, also, it is not self-evident whether this is a commandment for which one needs to make an effort, or a beneficial promise. Furthermore, the words “a kingdom of priests,” have no interpretation or matching expression anywhere else in the Bible.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The essential thing is to define here at least the difference between “a kingdom of priests” and “a holy nation.” For, according to the ordinary significance of priesthood, it is the same attribute as sanctity, and it is thus obvious that a kingdom in which all are priests must be a holy nation. But then the words “holy nation” would be redundant!</span>

Chapter 27

<small>God’s invitation to Israel to accept the Torah actually does specify what is required of them and what reward is being offered. What is required is to be a kingdom of priests, and the reward is to be a holy nation.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">However, by applying what we have explained from the beginning of the essay until now, the verses become clarified together with their format. They serve the role (which is appropriate to them) of illustrating negotiation, including an offer and consent. That is, in these words God really does offer them the whole form and content of the service in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, as well as specify the giving of that reward which is fitting for them to hear about.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The form of the service in Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> is expressed in the verse, “<b>and you will be for Me a kingdom of priests</b>;” for “<b>a kingdom of priests</b>” means that all of you, from young to old, will be like priests. Just as the priests have no portion or inherited domain, nor any physical acquisition of land, because God is their inherited domain;<sup>106</sup> thus will the whole nation be aligned in its entirety, so that the earth and everything in it – all of it – will be dedicated to God (may He be blessed). And no individual will have any business with the world except to keep God’s <i>mitzvot</i> and to satisfy the needs of another to the extent that he or she will not lack any of his or her wishes. In this way, not one person will have to worry about his or her own needs.</span>
106. In contrast to the other tribes that each received a portion and inheritance in the land, the priests did not receive anything but rather were designated for the service in the holy temple.
<span class="poetry indentAll">In this manner, even non-religious tasks such as harvesting, sowing, etc., are seen to have the same character as the services of the sacrifices that the priests performed in the holy temple. What’s the difference if I am occupied with the commandment of sacrificing a burnt-offering to God – which is a positive commandment – or if I am fulfilling the positive commandment of “and love your fellow as yourself”? So it turns out that someone who harvests his or her field in order to feed another person is similar to someone who is presenting a sacrifice to God.<sup>107</sup> Not only that, but it’s logical to deem the commandment “and love your fellow as yourself” to be even more important than bringing a sacrifice, as we have shown above (sections 14, 15).</span>
107. It follows that the direction of Jewish society must be to arrive at the condition called “a kingdom of priests” – that is, where each individual does his or her work, according to his or her talents and expertise; but no one expects to receive any payment, but rather works only for the benefit of others. By moving in this direction, a nation is built completely on the basis of selfless giving and loving the other. When we arrive at this stage, no one will lack anything; as opposed to a situation where everyone looks out for his or her own needs – this is precisely the condition where the individual finds that he or she lacks a great deal [since his or her needs keep getting greater].
<span class="poetry indentAll">Indeed, this is not yet the end of it, because the whole of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> were given for the sole purpose of refining Israel, which is the refinement of the body (see section 12).<sup>108</sup> After this, one will merit the true reward because of the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>; and the true reward is the cleaving to God, which is the purpose of creation (section 15). And that reward is expressed in the words “a holy nation.” By cleaving to God, we become holy,<sup>109</sup> as it is written: “You will be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.” [Leviticus 19:2]</span>
108. “The refinement of the body” does not refer to the physical body, but to the bodily portion of a person’s soul, which is the desire to receive pleasure and joy.
109. The nature of spiritual work is called “a kingdom of priests,” whereas the nature of the reward is called “a holy nation.” Explanation of the reward: By means of the spiritual work and the effort to be someone who gives selflessly, we merit the true reward which is the state of cleaving to God. To cleave to God is to share in God’s nature. That is, just as God’s nature is only to give, so, “cleaving to God” means that we have merited the acquisition of this character of giving selflessly. And this is called “a holy nation” because the acquisition of this second nature causes us to be sanctified and separated from the first nature of wanting to receive for our own benefit.
Furthermore, by virtue of our receiving from Heaven a second nature, we merit an even higher level of cleaving to God than a giving nature. This higher level is the perception of the names of God, which are the deeper meanings of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. This is the perception of the loftiness of God’s holiness, and it is also included in the concept of “a holy nation.”
<span class="poetry indentAll">So you see that in the words “<b>a kingdom of priests</b>” is expressed the complete form of the service [of God] based on the pivot of “and love your fellow as yourself.” This means a kingdom which is entirely made up of priests; [instead of property] their inheritance is God; and they have no individual ownership of any physical possessions. And it must be admitted that this is the only definition by which can be understood the idea of “a kingdom of priests.” For you cannot interpret it as the bringing of sacrifices to the altar, since that cannot be said of the whole nation, for then who would be the ones bringing the sacrifices? Also, with regard to taking the gifts of the priesthood, who would act as the givers? And also, [it’s impossible] to interpret them [the words “a kingdom of priests”] as referring to the holiness of the priests, [since] it’s already stated “and a holy nation.” Rather, all its meaning can only be that God is their inherited domain; that they lack any material possession for themselves – that is, the level of “and love your fellow as yourself” that encompasses the whole of the Torah, as stated above.<sup>110</sup> And in the words “<b>a holy nation</b>” is expressed the full form of the [promised] reward, which is cleaving to God, as stated above.</span>
110. There are two other accepted interpretations of “a kingdom of priests”: a) Just as priests have a special role of being the ones who bless the people of Israel, so the people of Israel can bless the nations of the world; b) Just as the priests teach and give inspiration to the nation of Israel, so the nation of Israel is meant to inspire the whole world. Both of these interpretations are actually included in Baal Hasulam’s concept of “a kingdom of priests.” For it is only when you have merited the acquisition of the second nature of selfless giving and are cleaving to the living God, that then will others be blessed by you to also merit lives of giving selflessly. And only when the nation of Israel lives according to the principles of “what’s mine is yours and what’s yours is yours,” then they serve as a light to the nations of the world.

Chapter 28

<small>So long as the nations of the world are still incapable of cleaving to God, Israel must serve as a treasured nation.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">Now we can fully appreciate also our words prior to this, for scripture says: “<b>And now, if you will indeed listen to My voice, and if you will keep My covenant</b>,” which means making a covenant on what I am telling you here – that is, “<b>you will be a treasure for Me among all peoples</b>.” This means that you will be a treasure for Me, for you will cause sparks of refinement and purification of the body to pass to all the peoples and nations of the world. For the nations of the world are not yet ready for it [full purification] at all, and I need one nation at least to start with now, so it will become a treasure among all the nations [and remedy for them]. And therefore the verse ends, “<b>for all the earth is Mine</b>,” meaning all the peoples of the earth belong to Me just as you do; and they all are destined to cleave to Me (section 20).</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But now, so long as they are still incapable of performing that task, I need a treasured nation. And if you agree to be the treasured one among all the nations, I command you to be for Me “<b>a kingdom of priests</b>,” which is the quality of loving the other in its final form of “and love your fellow as yourself.” This is the pivot of the entirety of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. And “<b>a holy nation</b>” is the reward in its final form of “and to cleave to God,” which includes all the reward that can possibly be expressed.</span>

Chapter 29

<small>It requires courage to accept all at once the lofty level of the service expressed by “a kingdom of priests.” Nonetheless, God warned Moses not to restrain himself, but to disclose all the service that is required. Also, Moses was told to just say the words “a holy nation” without making explicit the tremendous reward that this implies, so as not to tempt the people of Israel from taking on spiritual work for the pleasure of its great reward.</small>
<span class="poetry indentAll">These are the explanations voiced by our sages in clarifying the verse’s ending “<b>these are the words that you will speak to the children of Israel</b>.” [Exodus 19:6] They interpreted the precise wording “<b>these</b> are the words” as “no more” and “no less.” This raises a difficulty: From where can you get the idea that Moses our teacher would add or subtract from the words of God to the extent that God had to warn him about it? We have found nothing like this in the entire Torah. On the contrary, scripture writes about Moses: “In all My house he is trustworthy”! [Numbers 12:7]</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">But from what we have said, it is well understood that, regarding the final character of spiritual service – as clarified in the words “a kingdom of priests,” which is the final definition of “and love your fellow as yourself” – it was indeed conceivable for Moses to consider restraining himself so as not to disclose all at once in a grand manner this [high] level of the form of the service. This would be due to the fear that Israel might not be reconciled [all at once] to detaching themselves from all material possessions and give all their capital and property to God, as instructed by the words “a kingdom of priests.”</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">This is similar to what Maimonides wrote – that it is forbidden to reveal to women and small children the nature of pure service to God, which must be done with the intention not to receive reward. Rather we must wait until they grow, become wise, and have the courage to carry this out<sup>111</sup> as explained above. Therefore, God gave Moses the above warning: “<b>no less</b>.” [Don’t restrain yourself, but] rather spread before them the true character of the work in all the lofty, grand scope expressed in the words “a kingdom of priests.”</span>
111. Why is there a need for courage? When we begin on the path of “a kingdom of priests,” our natural desire to receive will paint a black picture of unlimited deprivation, and we will fear that we cannot deal with this sense of lack and dissatisfaction. Therefore we need great courage to ignore this picture and continue to do the right thing in the direction of “a kingdom of priests.” At this stage, we are still referred to as “women and small children,” for this is a code name for someone (of any sex or age) without the required courage. [See “Insights for Living the Kabbalah,” VI – Women and Children.] However, the light of the Torah can enable us to gain wisdom and grow, and thereby acquire the courage to belittle the pictures depicted by our bodily desire.
A distinction must be made between the spiritual work of faith and the light of faith. The work of faith without light is done out of self-coercion and requires courage – that is, the strength to follow a path beyond one’s understanding. However, when the light of faith is shining, there’s no need for coercion. Apparently, “a kingdom of priests” refers to the work of faith, while “a holy nation” refers to the light of faith. Alternatively, “a kingdom of priests” is the perception of the light of faith, while “a holy nation” is the perception of the light of wisdom. And the second interpretation seems preferable.
<span class="poetry indentAll">And similarly, regarding the reward that is defined in the words “a holy nation,” Moses might have considered being explicit and elaborating further about the pleasantness and the lofty delight hidden within the experience of cleaving to God. [He might have done this] in order to prepare them and attract them so that they would be accepting and agree to this enormous extreme of completely detaching themselves from any worldly possessions, as do priests. So therefore he received the warning: “<b>no more</b>.” Just say the words “a holy nation,” and don’t make explicit the giving of the reward that is included in these words.</span>
<span class="poetry indentAll">The reason for this: If He had revealed to them the wondrous, extreme quality that is in the essential nature of the reward, then of necessity they would get confused and take on His spiritual work in order to attain this good reward for themselves. This would be considered working for themselves and self-love,<sup>112</sup> and thus all their intention would be distorted, as explained above (section 13).</span>
112. This is giving in order to receive.
<span class="poetry indentAll">So we see that regarding the [high] degree of the form of the work expressed in the words “a kingdom of priests,” he was told [to say] “<b>no less</b>.” And regarding the implicit degree of the reward expressed in the words “a holy nation,” he was told [to say] “<b>no more</b>.”</span>

Insights for Living the Kabbalah

I Loving the Other as Yourself

In order to comprehend the nature of the command to love the other, consider the statement of one of the greats of Israel, Rabbi Yitzchak Kalish of Vorki (known as the Vorker Rebbe). He said: “Until I reach the point that I love the worst sinner of our nation just as I love my own son, I haven’t yet fulfilled the <i>mitzvah</i> of ‘and love your fellow as yourself.’ To fulfill this <i>mitzvah</i> I must not feel any preference for my son over any other.” The love to which he aspired is something beyond what is natural. Love of offspring is natural and exists throughout the animal kingdom. So our humanity certainly isn’t defined by our loving our children. However, we are worthy of being human when we love another person as we love our own child – with the same dearness and the same automatic empathy and inclination to justify the child’s actions.
It’s impossible to reach the level of loving the other without the preparatory work of building a spiritual infrastructure by way of observing the <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah. Only by means of this spiritual growth can we come to comprehend the <i>mitzvah</i> of “and love your fellow as yourself” and arrive at an inner state where we are prepared to fulfill it.
The significance of this is that we are not free to switch or change any <i>mitzvah</i> whether of rabbinic origin or directly from the Torah. The network of the <i>mitzvot</i> as a whole is intended to alter our character, and this entire system is a divine document whose human alteration would distort its divine intent. It must be fulfilled in all its forms and levels in order that we may rise above the prison of our creaturely desire to receive, and in the end arrive at the lofty state of freedom defined by loving the other.
A parable for this: When a contractor builds a building, he must combine many components of a great variety that make up differing sections (foundation, walls, piping, etc.), all correctly assembled to create a solid, functioning building. For each element there is a certain professionally accepted standard that must be adhered to. If the contractor should begin to set his own standards – standards that inevitably will be in his own interest – woe to whoever ends up living in that building! In general, Baal Hasulam’s point is that all of the Torah – all of its <i>mitzvot</i>, its interpretations, its stories, and its anecdotes – exist for the single purpose of transforming our nature – from a nature of self-love to a nature of loving the other. All the subject matter of the Torah comes to explain this idea on the mental plane and to prepare us for a paradigm shift in thought; but the matter must conclude with a revolution in the practical sphere of our actions.
This is true both on the individual level and the communal level. “And love your fellow as yourself” should constitute the foundation of society. Each individual should see himself or herself as a form of community property, so that wherever his or her help is needed, that is precisely where he or she is prepared to devote time and energy. But how can we make of ourselves a machine that works for the community’s benefit, when we each have our own minimal needs? Baal Hasulam answers: If the whole society without exception elects to adopt the path of loving the other, then each person need not be concerned with fulfilling his or her own needs, since everyone else will be watching out for him or her.
The problem with this answer is that we are far from having a society with such preparedness to devote ourselves to the other. So what can a person do today who wants to fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of loving the other? You should form a group of a few close friends with whom you want to practice loving the other, but not with people who in their heart are just watching out for themselves. The purpose of forming a group is to be strengthened in one’s spiritual work. By connecting to people who are selfish, you may bring about the opposite effect. Therefore it’s preferable to create a group in which everyone explicitly wants to progress in the direction of annulling the ego.
And if God should bring your way the opportunity to assist someone outside of the group, you should do this only if one of two conditions is fulfilled: Either the assistance required will not create any personal connection with the other person; or you must be capable of relating to this person without his or her being aware of it. In this way, the connection will be only one-way, and you won’t be influenced by any bad elements in the other.
Another question: If our spiritual work is primarily within the confines of a small group of special souls, how can this bring about the healing that is necessary for society? Baal Hasulam answers that our efforts always must be directed to our inner selves. In each individual there is a holy center whose essence is expressed in loving the other and faith in God, and this is his or her inner core. In general, each of us must give significance to our inner core in preference over our outer shell. In this way, the inner is increased and strengthened. This is a lifelong task. And to the extent that someone succeeds in this, he or she radiates to the whole world a strengthening of the inner. Thus society is gradually healed, and the small circle of special souls is gradually widened to include other people who are willing to devote themselves to loving the other. In the course of time, this group can eventually include everyone.
We need to look out for the needs of the other just as we always stand ready to fulfill our own needs. So if you have, say, three friends, then you need on a daily basis to take an interest in their needs and provide for them. If they have financial problems, you should equally share your money. If they have medical problems, you need to take care of them and see that they get all the necessary treatment to get well. If they have difficulties in educating their children, you should persevere with the children just as you would take pains with your own children.
But how is this possible, asks Baal Hasulam. One only has 24 hours in a day in which to earn enough for his family and take care of their various needs, as well as learn Torah, etc. And here we are dealing with minimal needs, not luxuries. How then is it possible to be burdened also with the needs of others? Since we are speaking of working with a small group, not an entire society, then there is no guarantee that others will be able to ensure that each individual has his or her minimal needs fulfilled. In such a situation, one should make the maximum effort to do all that one can. That is the spiritual work that each of us must do in preparation for the eventual creation of an ideal society.
Let’s take a deeper look at the idea behind “and love your fellow as yourself.” When the Torah says “and love your fellow as yourself,” it means that just as you look out for your own needs, so you must look out for the needs of your fellow. However, the intention is not that when you need only a bit of bread to get by, then you need to give the other fellow only a bit of bread. For when you give the other that which is the right thing for yourself, then that expresses self-love and not love of the other. Rather, loving the other requires reflecting on the qualities of the other, accepting the other as he or she is, and not making him or her fit the way you are. And it means to provide for the other’s felt needs, and not what you think should be the other’s needs.
In general, our sages said: “Just as their countenances are unique, so their mindsets are unique.” [<i>Midrash Tanchuma</i>, Pinchas 10] We see from this that no two people have the same needs. Therefore I cannot love the other without respecting the difference of his or her needs from mine, and it is those needs that I must fulfill. For example, if matters regarding food don’t interest me at all, but to the other person this is significant, then I must take the trouble to learn what the other person really likes and how much is needed so that I can truly fulfill his or her needs.
In short, the point is not that I must provide for the other those things that I provide for myself; rather, just as I provide for <i>whatever</i> needs I have, similarly, I must provide for <i>whatever</i> needs the other has.
Our sages gave an extreme example of this. If a man lost his fortune and was accustomed to having a servant run before him, then I must supply him with this foolish thing. If necessary, I should even run before him myself. When I consider the matter, it seems stupid and worthless; but nevertheless if such a person lost his fortune and was used to this sort of servant as a minimum necessity, I am obligated from the principle of “and love your fellow as yourself” to provide him with this – even though I have no appetite for this strange desire. And not just to provide for him “externally,” but also to empathize with his psychological needs and to respect them. (However, if a person’s needs are perverted as defined by the Torah – due to stress, mental illness, or the like – then we need to help to heal him or her rather than support the perversion.)
In modern terms, this can be compared to a billionaire who lost his or her fortune and was used to a luxury car and a driver. From the point of view of loving the other, I am obligated to provide whatever he or she needs in this regard. Here our sages are trying to convey a deep message that is beyond the natural. It seems natural to us that everyone’s minimal needs should be provided for. If someone has a family with ten children and they don’t have their basic needs, then anyone can understand that we must make a supreme effort to give them a minimal living. This fits our logic for the reason that when we imagine ourselves in such a situation, we certainly would want to fix it. So it turns out that I’m not helping the poor family due to a divine command, but because this accords with the logic of my mindset – that is, it is due to a command of my ego.
Therefore our sages gave the example of someone who needs a servant running before him – in order to emphasize that the true <i>mitzvah</i> of “and love your fellow as yourself” must be subjugated to the divine will, and not to human understanding. So we advise that each person should select a small group of friends and work with them to fulfill “and love your fellow as yourself” – not people who are particularly needy, but people of similar stature.
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with giving to needy families. On the contrary, if God brings your way an opportunity to be of assistance in any manner, then you should assist. However, the true point of serving God is reached when you act contrary to your natural understanding – that is when it connects to the Creator. The point of the <i>mitzvah</i> “and love your fellow as yourself” is to connect you to the Creator who loves all of His creation. However, if you act only according to your understanding, it doesn’t connect you to the Creator. The gap between a <i>mitzvah</i> that is done in accord with human understanding, as opposed to performance of a <i>mitzvah</i> due to divine imperative, is unfathomable. For a <i>mitzvah</i> in accord with human understanding leaves you on the human level; and not for this were you brought into the world, but to act toward cleaving to God.
This is the spirit behind the following statement of Baal Hasulam in one of his introductions: “Just as a donkey was not created in order to serve other donkeys like himself, rather he was created to serve humans who are above him; so human beings were not created to serve other human beings like themselves, rather they were created to serve the Creator who is above them.”
We learn from this that when you simply follow your nature, you are not acting as a servant of God. And what is commonly labeled a “master of loving-kindness” or a “<i>tzaddik</i>” is a complete mistake, for this labeling is determined only by actions without regard to their intentions. A person who is completely giving and loving because of his or her inborn altruistic nature is not a master of loving-kindness. Instead, just as a monkey climbs trees, so this person is doing what his or her nature necessitates. Only when your rational understanding is opposed to performing a <i>mitzvah</i>, and you nevertheless force yourself to do it – for the reason that this is the divine will – only then can you be perceived as one who is connecting to the Creator.
Most people do not understand this at all, for they do not sense a lack of and a longing for closeness to God. So it’s enough for them to have as their goal the creation of a human society based on rational, ethical principles. However, experience has taught us that when this is the goal, we lack the motivation to fully attain it. It requires that each member of the society give up his or her self-centeredness, and people prefer to allow others to “make the sacrifice.” Therefore all attempts to create a just, human society have completely failed. However, once we all accept the goal of cleaving to the Creator of the world, then each individual will have the motivation to overcome whatever difficulties there may be.
In summary, if people do not take upon themselves the service of God, then a) they will not be able to create a just society; and b) they will not draw nearer to the essential goal which is attachment to the Creator of the world.
One last question regarding the rich man who lost his fortune: Wasn’t this the will of God, and if so, aren’t we going against God’s will if we continue to supply his needs? And the same question can be asked about a needy family in a really bad situation. If God brought them to this situation, who am I to try to change it?
Answer: This question appears in the Talmud [<i>Sanhedrin</i> Chapter 11], and the answer given there is that God brings people to poverty in order to educate the people around them to be giving. For a given poor individual, it may also be the case that that person’s poverty is a challenge that he or she must deal with in the course of his or her own spiritual work. Nevertheless, the divine will commands those in the poor person’s environment to do whatever they can to raise the poor person out of poverty. That is their spiritual work, and they must believe that the other person became poor only so that they would have the opportunity to grow from the experience in giving to him or her. Certainly, if they themselves had become poor, they would do all they can to get what they need and wouldn’t just accept the situation as God’s will. If this is the way we would act for ourselves, then we should act for others in the same way.

II Cleaving to God

What would it be like to be in a state of “cleaving” to God?
The more we have a longing to connect with God, the more God appears in our lives. The first step towards <i>devekut</i> is to develop the <i>aspiration</i> to reach a state of continual connection with God – a connection that is not static and abstract, but dynamic and tangible. We should contemplate that until we do reach this level, we have not yet achieved our purpose in being. There have been only a few people that concluded their individual work of perfecting their soul. They then continued to work for the benefit of the general soul – that single soul of which we all have a part and that originally was the soul of Adam. They did not preach to others with an attitude of superiority, but rather focused on the Creator and their relationship with Him. They worked on themselves out of a sense that their individual souls were in need of correction; and this attitude inspired others to work on correcting their souls.
In order to get to a state of cleaving to God, a person must undergo preparation. Although it’s rare to merit individual perfection, sincere devotion to the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> provides a process of correction that enables each of us to shift the focus from our own needs to the needs of others. This process itself is the path to <i>devekut</i> which has many levels.
Our natural state is to imagine that we are essentially alone and must continually seek our own benefit and pleasure. Because of this, our character is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the divine character of “selfless giving.” It is this distance in character that results in our feeling that God is not with us, and in our failing to see the beneficence in God’s management of the world. Just as people feel connected when they have a common attribute, so we need to acquire divine attributes in order to feel connected with God. As our sages have enjoined: “Just as He is generous and merciful, also you – be generous and merciful” [<i>Shabbat</i> 133b]. The Torah supplies a means to work towards this.
The holy <i>Zohar</i> divides the levels of <i>devekut</i> into two categories that relate to two distinct properties of the 613 Torah <i>mitzvot</i>: 613 <i>itin</i> [“advice”] and 613 <i>pekudot</i> [“deposits”]. The 613 <i>itin</i> are the differing forms of “advice” that the <i>mitzvot</i> provide regarding how to be released from subservience to our desire to receive. They enable us to recognize the many varieties of our intention to receive and how bad it really is. Gradually they prepare us to develop a second nature of loving the other. This is the level of <i>devekut</i> referred to by “Just as He is generous and merciful, also you – be generous and merciful.” However, this is not the final level.
The 613 <i>pekudot</i> refer to the unique quality of divine light that is “deposited” in each of the 613 <i>mitzvot</i>. The divine light is not a physical light, but rather it is the desire to give selflessly. There are qualities of this light that can only be revealed to one who has already developed a character of loving the other by having followed the 613 <i>itin</i>. Then the performance of each different <i>mitzvah</i> can reveal a quality of light that is specific to the <i>mitzvah</i>. The purpose of creation is that God should reveal these 613 “deposits” of light to the souls that He created, and this enables the ultimate realization of cleaving to God.
Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag often said that there are a variety of “tastes” in spirituality, no less than that found in the material world. Just as there are dozens of types of food where each item has a different flavor, so to each <i>mitzvah</i> there is a different light. However, so long as we are captive to our selflove, we sense no difference between the various <i>mitzvot</i>. For example, we feel no difference between wearing fringes on our garments and putting on phylacteries; because we actually feel nothing from either of these <i>mitzvot</i>.
The primordial serpent was cursed with “and you will eat dust all your life” [Genesis 2, 14], which our sages interpreted to mean that whatever the serpent will eat will have the taste of dust. The inner meaning of the serpent is the representation of our desire for pleasure even in spirituality, and this pleasure was the temptation in the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Eating this fruit creates the curse of our inability to taste the light in the <i>mitzvot</i>. However, when we read the <i>Zohar</i> and the writings of the Ari, we see, for example, that wearing fringes is connected to a particular, definable aspect of spirituality, and phylacteries is associated with a different particular quality of spirituality. We, however, cannot distinguish between them, and we feel nothing in this regard so long as we are under the rule of the serpent aspect within us.
As we continue to connect to God’s lights through the <i>mitzvot</i>, we reach higher and higher levels of refinement of soul. The single concern of a person at the highest level of loving the other is that God should be revealed to the world, with no interest for the benefit he or she individually receives from revelation. This is the level of complete devotion to the realization of God’s purpose in creating the world – the sharing of divinity.

III Taking and Giving

All of creation is God’s domain, for “there is nothing but God” [Exodus 4, 25]. However, God has created one reality that feels it is outside of God, and that is a person’s desire to receive. Since God is perfect and has no desire to receive anything, then the desire to receive is considered outside of God’s domain. From this perspective, therefore, there are only two things in existence: the Creator and the desire to receive.
The meaning of “taking” in Jewish law is that one transfers something from someone else’s domain to one’s own domain. When we transfer something into the domain of our desire to receive, then we have “taken” and the transfer need not be visible physically, but may be a spiritual transfer. For example, to give in order to be appreciated is a manner of “taking” the appreciation. Also, sometimes we can perform an act of giving, but we do it just because it is convenient for us, not due to a desire to fulfill a divine <i>mitzvah</i>. Only an act that is done out of true love for another person, or for the Creator, is not considered taking; and it doesn’t matter whether the physical act appears as giving or taking. Only such an act of true love does not constitute a transfer to the domain of the desire to receive. In truth, all the good in creation is given to us as a loan. This world is like an open store from which we can take whatever we want without any apparent need to pay. A borrower is obligated to return his loan, and therefore is less embarrassed by receiving it; and sometimes the borrower can return the loan in a different form from what was received. The general form in which we “pay” for what we take in this world is suffering. This is what our sages intended when they stated: “. . . the shopkeeper sells on credit, the ledger is open, and the hand records [Chapters of the Fathers 3, 16]. ”
Rabbi Akiva pointed out that it’s a mistake to think there’s no need to pay. Whatever we take in this world – whether small or large, whether material or spiritual – it’s all recorded. Where is it recorded? In our consciousness. And since it is recorded there, surely there will come the day when we will need to pay for what we took. That is, God who is the shopkeeper “gives credit” by giving us the feeling that we can take anything. However, he created a system whereby the taking makes an impression within our consciousness, and therefore it will be paid for at some time in one form of suffering or another.
But we need not suffer, for we may choose not to act out of a desire to receive. If we perform a selfless act of giving, then there is no “taking.” Rather the giver has left the objects of desire in God’s domain, which is the domain of selfless giving. The intention is the crucial factor. Even when we are just sitting and eating, if our only intention is to please another person or the Creator; then we have not taken anything out of God’s domain. Whenever we give with this intention, we have not taken anything.
If we do choose to take, then the form of payment we give is suffering. This is for two reasons: a) Taking creates a new desire; and b) no desire can be satiated. a) Whenever something is taken, the taking leaves an impression in the character of the taker, and this impression creates a desire to repeat the act and once again receive pleasure from what was taken. So the taking creates a lack (the lack of the repetition) which must be fulfilled, and from this we suffer. b) “No one dies with even half of his desires fulfilled” [<i>Kohelet Raba</i> 1, 13]. Even a single desire based on the desire to receive can never be satiated. After pleasure is received from fulfillment of a desire, the desire must be increased in order to receive pleasure from fulfillment of the increase – a process that never ends. So we suffer from the inevitable lack of satisfaction of our desires.
The forms of suffering we experience and their increase over time may slowly bring us to the conclusion that we need to seek satisfaction in some other manner. The role of life’s afflictions is to bring us to realize that the only way to get true, lasting satisfaction is to follow the path of loving the other and giving to the other. For the pleasure of giving does not involve taking anything, and does not transfer from one domain to another. Therefore the “shopkeeper” records no debt. Furthermore, the pleasure of a sincere, loving heart is an eternal pleasure – the exact opposite of the fleeting pleasure of receiving, which only creates a greater need than the need it fulfills, and so never “pays off.”
From this, we can understand the interpretation of the saying of our sages: “The elderly of non-educated folk [literally, peoples of the earth] – the more they age, the more their minds get cloudy and foolish” [Mishna <i>Kinim</i> 3, 6]. Because they are mired in materialistic “earthiness” and receiving, they never achieve true satisfaction and their suffering is greater than their pleasure. On the other hand, the elderly of Torah scholars – the more they age, the more their minds get settled and wise. The wisdom referred to here is the wisdom of divinity, the wisdom in loving and giving. Regarding this wisdom, the Torah states: “For this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of other peoples” [Exodus 4, 6]. For only in acquiring this wisdom is there a potential for a special quality in the people of Israel. The title of Torah scholar is literally translated as “student of wisdom;” and a person merits this title, not by acquiring information, but only when he or she acquires the intention of loving and giving.
For this reason, according to Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag, this wisdom is called “hidden.” For it is hidden from everyone. We can see another person do a certain act, but we can’t know anything about that person’s motivations. For example, we might see a man eating enthusiastically, but actually he has no motivation to “take” anything. Another person might be occupied with giving to everyone but is actually at the height of taking selfishly in some form. Sometimes we cannot even clarify our own motivation – are we taking or giving? The truth about ourselves can also be hidden from us. We need a lot of help from God to see the truth completely clearly, and this is revealed only to the few who merit it.
Frequently, we mix our self-love with our love of others. This is a relatively good situation in which at least we have some spark of recognition of the beauty in loving the other. However, our sages did not settle for this, and therefore they stated: “If you mix the sake of heaven together with something else, then you are uprooted from the world.” [<i>Sukkah</i> 45b] Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag interpreted this to be referring to a situation in which we mix our own pleasure together with our love of God. This causes us to be “uprooted” from the divine world; for we lose our connection with the divine, and thus we lack a spiritual legacy to pass on.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is not that we should despair of reaching perfection, and therefore take a step backward from giving; but rather we should strengthen our resolve and continue to move forward. At each opportunity, we should continue to try to increase the portion of our motivation which is for the sake of heaven, and to decrease the “something else.”
The whole issue of afflictions in life is unavoidable. For there is a force that pushes, and there is a force that pulls. Trains once had an engine in front and a caboose in the back, one to pull and one to push. Similarly, we have a motivational force that pushes, which is our afflictions; and we have a motivational force that pulls us toward it, which is the pleasure that we may receive in the future.
On this basis, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag interpreted the morning blessing in which we refer to God as “the one who prepares a person’s steps.” We walk by using two legs: one leg is suffering and the other leg is pleasure. Only by using both these legs can we take steps. So God “prepares a person’s steps” by: a) decreeing the measure of suffering that is required for healing our soul; and b) determining how much pleasure we can receive without it becoming spiritually dangerous for us.

IV Similarity of Form

The purpose of creation is fulfilled by our cleaving to God. We need to avoid whatever might distance and separate us from God, and we are to embrace whatever brings us closer to God. Of course, spirituality does not take up any space, and distance in the spiritual sphere is not a physical distance. We are not being advised to move physically up or down or in any physical direction. Rather spiritual distance is a matter of a difference in character.
This we see even from a psychological point of view. For example, we might find two brothers sitting next to one another physically, but people who know them well would say that they are as far from one another as east is from west. That is, one brother is good and wise, while the other is evil and foolish. So we see that the “distance” between people can refer, not to their physical distance, but to their difference in character.
As we begin to acquire a more divine-like character, then we get “closer” to God by virtue of this similarity of form. The only character we can ascribe to God is what is implied by God’s perfection. God has no need or lack; and so God has no desire to fulfill a need or lack. This is the divine-like character that we need to acquire, and it inevitably leads to the desire to give selflessly.
The path to attaining similarity of form includes two categories:
1. We need to divorce ourselves from self-love and the desire to receive pleasures.
Baal Hasulam sharpens the definition of this proscription when he applies the principle known from Jewish law: “The necessary should neither be condemned nor praised.” We are not supposed to disconnect from the necessities dictated by the nature that God planted within us, rather we are told to avoid luxuries and extravagances. By disconnecting from the need for luxuries and extravagances, we create the possibility of attaining similarity of form with God who needs nothing. Therefore this proscription is referred to in the Torah by the verse “Be holy.” [Leviticus 19, 2]
2. We need to learn to love the other.
Just as God has love for the other and God’s only desire is to benefit His creations and to give them goodness and joy, so we are enjoined to acquire this character.
Heart is called “desire,” and a “new heart” is the desire to give selflessly to others, in contrast to the “old heart” which is the desire to receive only for oneself. Only when we learn Torah and fulfill <i>mitzvot</i> with the intention that God will create in us a “new heart,” then our connection to Torah is in the correct framework.
The desire to give selflessly is not the essential matter. Rather the essential matter is the acquisition of a “second nature,” which should be understood as the love of the other; and the love of the other brings us to want to give selflessly. For it’s natural that when we love and honor another person, then we want to give to that person and make him or her rejoice.

V Levels of Self love

A baby that is born, as soon as it comes out of its mother’s womb, wants only to get pleasure. People are born as animals, as the verse in Job states: “. . . a person is born a wild young donkey.” [Job 11, 2] After birth, we continue to be drawn toward the lowest levels of degradation due to the enormous self-love that is imprinted within us. As Baal Hasulam writes: “All our movements are compelled to pivot around this self-regard.”
Why? What necessitates the creation within each person of a selfish desire to receive? Baal Hasulam explains: “God’s will in general is to benefit His creations, and it’s impossible that this goal be realized completely unless God’s creations desire to receive pleasure and joy.” As we see in the material world, we can’t enjoy a meal if we don’t have an appetite. In general, it’s impossible to get pleasure without first having a desire to receive pleasure. So we see that God’s desire to benefit His creations necessitates in practice that the desire to receive be the central feature of all things in creation.”
A newborn baby’s desire for pleasure is undeveloped, so the baby enjoys only food and sleep. As the baby grows and begins to understand that one can get pleasure from other sources, the baby immediately wants to have them. The governing rule is: “the eye sees and the heart desires” [Rashi’s commentary on Numbers 15, 39]. “The eye sees” – This does not refer only to the physical eye. Also, a person’s intellect is called “eye,” as we see in the verse that refers to the nation’s wise people as “the eyes of the congregation.” [Numbers 15, 24] So as the baby’s intellect develops, the baby automatically desires the new pleasures that the intellect reveals. The pleasure received provides the motivational fuel to seek additional pleasure that will continue to feed this machine.
At a certain point, we make attempts to overcome desire and learn to think differently. Unfortunately, however, a majority of people fail to abandon the childhood stage until their death. What motivates most people until the day of death are: jealousy, lust, and honor.
If we do succeed in refining the objects of our desires, we can get to a relatively good situation which, although still based on self-love; does not involve coarse pleasures. For example, we may understand that we are able to receive pleasure and joy from the Torah. This stage of development can be divided into two levels:
1. A lower level – We learn Torah and keep its <i>mitzvot</i>, because we want to be paid with money or honor from the society. If so, then our goal is self-interest, having arrived at the conclusion that the best way to enjoy life is by means of the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>.
2. A higher level – We don’t want people to pay us, feeling no need for what people can give. Rather we want to receive payments from God, both in this world and in the next world. If so, then we are still being guided by our desire to receive pleasure and joy. This demonstrates how it’s possible to be occupied with Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, but still be completely cut off from connection with God – for God has no connection to self-love at all.
This second level is actually unavoidable, at least temporarily. The love of the other and the love of God are wondrous levels that are not attained easily. This is not something laid out before us that anyone can just come and pick up. To develop a pure motivation requires a great deal of effort over an extended period of time. Since self-love is the nature of human beings, the only way we can begin to approach the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> is by way of self-love – which is called keeping Torah “not for its sake.” Therefore our sages said [<i>Pesachim</i> 50b]: “A person should keep Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> not for its sake, for by means of ‘not for its sake,’ the person will come to ‘for its sake.’”
The interpretation of the concept of “not for its sake” is “on the basis of self-love,” for there is no other place to start. But there comes a time when we need to leave the status of childhood – that is, to give up a life based on self-love – and move to a status of maturity. At maturity, we realize that true observance of Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> never permits us to be content with egocentric motivation.
There are those who deceive themselves by relying on the principle: “A person should keep Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> not for its sake, for by means of “not for its sake,” the person will come to “for its sake” [<i>Sanhedrin</i> 105b] They think that if the sages said that from “not for its sake,” we will come to “for its sake,” then surely they knew what they were talking about, and so we can just wait until “for its sake” comes along automatically.
The correct response to this is: No! Without making an effort, it’s impossible to arrive at keeping the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> for “the sake of heaven.” “Not for its sake” does not develop into “for its sake” just by existing long enough. That way we will forever remain mired in self-love. Perhaps we will move from receiving pleasure from chocolate and candy to enjoying Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>, or to enjoying the thought that we will receive benefit in the next world. But still everything remains centered on egoism. So we end up – as we began – stuck within self-love, and the main supplier is the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. We cannot connect in this way to God’s existence even via the Torah given to us by God.
But why doesn’t God automatically, without our effort, grant us the character of loving the other? The answer is that our effort is needed in order to create the desire to love the other. In order for God to fulfill our desire to love the other, we have to have the desire. In general, in order for there to be a filling of a lack, there must first be a lack to fill. One cannot get an answer if there was no question. We cannot feel comfort if we’ve never felt distress. A person cannot become someone who gives selflessly if he or she never suffered from being someone who receives selfishly. A person cannot have faith if he or she never suffered from being a disbeliever. It takes a lot of effort to sense a lack; that is, to be afflicted by failing to love the other, to be afflicted by failing to get free of the prison of self-love. In addition to our effort, it also requires an intervention from God, a sense of lack of this sort is indeed a rarely seen miracle in this world – something completely contrary to our self-centered nature.
In this context, we can understand the verse: “Command the children of Aaron” [Leviticus 6, 2]. The commentator Rashi explains that “command” here connotes “to urge,” and in particular it is necessary to urge people to do something when there is “<i>chisoron kis</i>.” The literal translation of “<i>chisoron kis</i>” is “lack of pocket,” but it is usually understood to mean a lack of money in one’s pocket – that is, it will cost a lot. However, Baal Hasulam interpreted it “lack of pocket” as a lack of a receptacle. Since a receptacle itself represents a lack that needs to be filled, Rashi’s interpretation according to Baal Hasulam is that we need to be urged to create a lack, when there is a lack of a lack. That is, the least we can be expected to do is to be pained by the fact that we don’t feel pained by our failing to love the other. This is the first step toward the final redemption.
However, the fact that we fulfill God’s <i>mitzvot</i> and learn Torah to the extent that we are able will not in itself be sufficient to bring the final perfection of the world, even if this involves thousands of people from a variety of different approaches to Judaism. All of them may still be living within a framework of lies and deceit. Those that keep <i>mitzvot</i> look at those who don’t and say to themselves “thank God that we have merited to keep <i>mitzvot</i>. If all of the world were like us, the messiah would already have arrived.” But the truth is not as they think. So long as people are content to keep Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> on the basis of self-love, they are nourishing their egoism, and this is not what God wants from us. We have the choice to continue our undemanding lifestyle or to understand that our situation is not satisfactory. We need to understand that what’s wrong is not how others behave, but the problem is with ourselves. We can’t hang the blame on societal failures or the failures of other people – non-believers or any other group. The blame lies solely with those who continue to develop their self-love, including those who do it under the mantle of the Torah.
God says that our animal sacrifices are despised. [Amos 5, 21] That is, God despises the way we are attempting to come close to Him. We come to synagogue and shout to God to bring us closer, but our heart is not in it. We don’t even have a conception of what it means to come close to God. Baal Hasulam explains that getting close to God means acquiring “similarity of form” – that is, acquiring characteristics similar to the divine. The Talmud says: “Just as He is generous and merciful, also you – be generous and merciful.” [<i>Shabbat</i> 133b] And of course the idea is not to be merciful on the basis of self-love, as when you expect that tomorrow the other will give you, just as you gave to the other today. True selflessness is so far from our natural mindset as to be inconceivable – at least this is certainly true at the start of our spiritual journey.
One key to spiritual development is finding a quality environment. God created humans to be social creatures, and a person’s environs is a critical and dominant factor throughout the course of one’s life. Even if our spiritual “genetics” are at a low level, nonetheless a society at a higher level can influence our low quality and bring us to a higher rung on the human ladder. However, it will require a significant amount of suffering. For only when we have afflictions, we have a push to move forward in our development. Still, we’ll need to make a choice, for the fundamental “earth” element in our spiritual genetic makeup constantly drags us down toward all sorts of deviations from our path. However, the elements of “fire” and “air” within us can arouse us to climb to a higher level where we can use our afflictions as a springboard to attain a greater human quality. Which elements will dominate? The choice is ours.
Although an environment with good values may give us partial lessons in how to be giving, nonetheless our lives may remain founded on self-love. People are taught to adopt the laws of family purity because it reduces statistically the incidence of cervical cancer. It strengthens the family when we eat festive meals together, and can often just be a pleasure to sing and rejoice with others. And so on for a wide range of perceived benefits for being religiously observant. In general, we are taught that if we follow the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>, then we will have a better life in this world, and certainly in the next world. All this is based on self-love. Even someone who seeks closeness to God wants to receive the great joy that stems from contact with the divine. This is like the story of Herschel from Ostropol who made a bet with his friend that he could teach a donkey to read from a book. Indeed Herschel “succeeded” by placing various grain stalks among the pages of the book in order to reward the donkey when it brayed correctly. And so we have learned to “bray” with Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> in order to receive our reward. But there is no other way for us to begin.
Therefore a person’s education begins with giving for the sake of receiving. In addition to assorted this-worldly benefits as mentioned above, this also includes a great deal of education regarding the reward in the world to come. Every small child is taught that this world is just a passageway – that is, a temporary situation – and the next world is the reception room – that is, the good, permanent situation. As we get older, we realize more and more how temporary our situation is, but we can accept this quietly, if we have been trained to believe that we will yet come to the eternal reception room where we will be rewarded with goodness and joy for our spiritual work in this world. Also we believe in the inevitability of punishment in the next world if we don’t follow the rules. It appears that we simply need to make an accounting regarding what is more worthwhile – to follow the rules and have eternal pleasure in paradise, or to do as we like for now but later burn eternally in hell.
If this simplistic picture is indeed generally accepted, then why doesn’t everyone do whatever is needed to get the eternal pleasure? For the same reason that someone who is sick with cancer doesn’t stop smoking. Our desire to receive does not allow us to recognize the results of our actions, but rather drags us to whatever is easy and available. So we need to put the focus on overcoming our desire to receive.
One may ask: Do we need to accept all the instructions of the Torah in order to develop spiritually, or can we choose to follow our inner guide regarding what to accept and what not? The answer is that our lowly, wretched nature does not encourage confidence in our choice of path, for we are full of instinctual inclinations, lusts, fears and self-centered concerns. Unconscious forces make our choices questionable, so that, rather than standing on steadfast principles, our opinions shift with the winds of our desires. By giving the Torah, the Creator has appended instructions to His creation regarding its proper use, and it would be foolish to insist on finding our own way to operate the machine. In practice, we have seen poor results when people have tried to create their own way of living according to their understandings and feelings. So as we continue the process of gradually refining our motivations, we really have no choice but to follow the spiritual path that’s been handed down from generation to generation from the time of Moses.
Once we see that self-love separates us from God and connects us to the emptiness and falseness of this world, we may ask: “Is there indeed a way out?” In the Talmud [<i>Kiddushin</i> 30b] God is described as saying: “I created the evil inclination; and I created the Torah as a healing condiment for it.” The evil inclination is the desire to receive for oneself, so shouldn’t the Torah enable us to have control over it? The answer: If we keep the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> with the right intention, then certainly the Torah will assist us to gain control over the desire to receive – but in a gradual manner, with effort over an extended period of time.
We can begin by increasing the quality of our desire to receive. The greater the quality it has, the more likely we will not accept easy solutions to fulfilling desire, but instead we’ll be willing to work for more complex, demanding solutions. Baal Hasulam divides our desire to receive into four levels in parallel to the four “kingdoms” of nature: mineral, vegetable, animal, human. “Mineral” are people that want to receive pleasure from resting. “Vegetable” are those who enjoy animal lusts, but are willing to work in order to make money to fulfill their desires. People at the “animal” level enjoy power and honor, and they are willing to work hard in order to get the cooperation of other people to satisfy their wants. At the “human” level, people enjoy intellectual and scientific ideas.
A further level is reserved for people who seek to enjoy connection and closeness to God. This is the highest quality of desire to receive, for it focuses on the most joyous pleasure even though it necessitates a superhuman struggle to overcome our natural inclinations. So we see that the greater quality there is to our desire, the less we are prepared to drug ourselves with passing pleasures. Rather if we choose this path, we avoid all confusion, and we are drawn only to an authentic life in which we work to reveal the tremendous potential that the Creator has hidden within creation. Some of those who choose a non-religious lifestyle do so because they don’t want to deal with the work required for an authentic religious life. So they prefer to live in a sort of bubble of confusion, never investing in anything beyond the transient.
We need to refine our desire to receive. But we need to be honest with ourselves. Our individual digestive systems cannot immediately adjust to the healthiest food. We need to change our diet step by step. In the same way, we must sense what spiritual message we are capable of digesting at each point in our development. We must move forward one step at a time in attunement with our spiritual sensitivities. On the one hand, we need to recognize the great distance between where we are and where we should be. But there’s no necessity to be in despair over the long road ahead. We should nourish ourselves with spiritual enrichment only in a way that assures we keep the strength to correct our failings.
In summary, we note that Baal Hasulam speaks in strong language when he says that the situation of human beings is at the nadir of lowliness and contamination. He wants to emphasize that there is nothing of real worth in all that makes up the world of human interest. There is nothing that is lasting, and there’s no worth to be found through investing in it – not in jealousy, not in lust, not in honor, and even not in intellectual insights in the Torah – for all these can give us only momentary pleasure and then leave us empty. The single thing that has worth is God, and then, as a corollary, whatever is connected with God. In our prayers on <i>Shabbat</i> mornings, we say that there is nothing <i>like</i> God in this world and there will be nothing <i>but</i> God in the world to come. This is in contradiction to those who imagine themselves receiving all kinds of delight in the next world. But, no, there is nothing but God also in the world to come. Only God is eternal, and anyone who does connect with God experiences an eternity of absolute and wondrous bliss.

VI Women and Children

In his discussion of the concept of observing the Torah “for its sake,” Baal Hasulam quotes the following statement of Maimonides (from The Laws of Repentance, Chapter 10): “The significance of being occupied with Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> ‘for its sake’ must not be revealed to women and children, for they would not be able to bear it.” This statement seems to be treating women as inferior. Is that indeed the position of Judaism?
There is nothing in Judaism that prevents a woman from attaining any level of serving God. Indeed, every woman is obligated – the same as every man – to work towards attaining a state of cleaving to God. There are many spiritual levels, and all of them can be found among women. For example, there were female prophets that arrived at prophecy by way of great effort in refining their character. Our role as humans is to reach the state of cleaving to God. A woman’s potential to fulfill this role is in no way inferior to the potential of a man.
Then how can we understand this quote from Maimonides? More to the point, how can we interpret Baal Hasulam’s use of this statement in the context of his essay “The Giving of the Torah?”
Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag has explained that the expression “women and children” is not used here in its plain meaning, but rather is a code-name that refers to a spiritual state that may apply to any person regardless of their gender. To understand this fully, let’s first consider what is meant by claiming that “for its sake” must not be “revealed” to certain people. Rabbi Baruch Shalom points out that anyone can just open a book, including the writings of Maimonides himself, and see what is written regarding this. Isn’t what is written already revealed? The answer is based on a principle of Baal Hasulam that wherever our sages said that something is “prohibited,” the intention is that it is impossible. According to this, Maimonides’ statement is understood as saying that it is impossible to reveal the practice of Torah “for its sake” to certain people because they cannot bear it.
It is difficult to bear the idea of serving God without any expectation or intention to get some reward. It’s completely unnatural to devote one’s time and energy to anything that brings no benefit to oneself. Serving God “for its sake” necessitates two extraordinary qualities: that we are able to face the truth that our desire is to receive and that we can appreciate the goal of desiring to give.
Why does Maimonides use the code-name “women and children” to refer to people who cannot bear the idea of Torah for its sake? According to the Kabbalah, each man and woman has both the male and the female aspects of the soul: the desire to give is labelled “male” and the desire to receive is called “female.” The association of “male” with giving and “female” with receiving derives from the biological fact that the male gives the seed which is received by the female, and there is nothing positive or negative about giving or receiving in this sense. The codename “woman,” however, applies to anyone who is dominated by his or her receiving side. This applies whether that person is biologically a male or a female. This is a particular example of the manner in which the Kabbalah uses references to the material world in order to refer to aspects of the spiritual world – a manner referred to as the language of “branch and root” (See note 16 in “Revealing a Handbreadth and Concealing Two”).
In addition to the term “women” connoting “receiving,” it has also been used as a metaphor for weakness. This is the source of the well-known expression of our sages: “His strength was weakened as a female” [<i>Berachot</i> 32a], based on an interpretation of a verse in Numbers [14:16]. Apart from such references in the Torah, the association of weakness with the female gender is apparently also due to the fact that a man’s physical strength is generally greater than a woman’s. Of course, this makes sense only from a physiological point of view, and is certainly not correct from other points of view; for example, a woman’s psychological stamina is often greater than a man’s. Nonetheless, the usual physical difference (which is more easily discernible) explains the use of the concept of “women” to symbolize weakness in general.
Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag defined one whose “strength has weakened” as one who cannot stand before the truth that he or she is in a state of self-love and disconnected from the Creator. This refers to people – male and female – who are not yet prepared to comprehend the seriousness of the low point in which they find themselves when they want to be connected to God; and the reason they are not prepared is because they are dominated by their desire to receive pleasure and joy for their own benefit.
This demonstrates again that Maimonides’ statement clearly cannot be applied to women in the plain sense of the term, for there are countless women who do have a well-developed sense of truth and have the integrity to overcome selfish desires and live according to the dictates of truth.
[It is important to acknowledge the insult to women when negative traits are referred to as “women” – whatever the explanation may be for this manner of expression. Rabbi Gottlieb has expressed his regret that the use of the code-name “women” in this way has caused people emotional pain. The intent here is to reveal the inner truth that is expressed in Maimonides’ statement, although one should refrain from continuing to express it in this way. The inner meaning expressed by Maimonides is eternally true: The idea of serving God “for its sake” cannot be revealed to a person with a selfish desire to receive and a weak ability to overcome that desire.]
The idea of service for the sake of heaven must also not be revealed to “children.” A childlike person is an undeveloped being, who has yet to grasp the true meaning of life. The “child” gives significance to what is unimportant and devalues what is significant. A small child cannot appreciate what is given to him or her, so it is thrown away after only a little play. And so it is in spirituality, when we cannot appreciate the great gift that is given us – whether it be the greatness of loving the other or the connection with the Creator – then we are considered “children.” This is not a question of a lack of knowledge, but of a lack of inner understanding that one’s path in life should be in the direction of loving the other and loving God, not in the direction of self-love.
What can a “child” do? What can be done if a person sees that he or she is not prepared at this time to face the truth? The truth can be annoying and painful, and a person dominated by childishness is not prepared to take on the required spiritual work. The remedy is for such a person to attach himself or herself to “<i>sofrim</i>” and “<i>sefarim</i>” – scholars and texts. By “texts” we mean holy books, books of truth. These are books that deal with the central point of truth, which is the only point of significance – namely, our connection with God. True scholars are people who follow this path of truth.
No one is exempt from this spiritual work. Each morning we say the blessing: “Blessed are you . . . who has made for me all that I need.” If that is so, then no one can claim exemption on the basis of the excuse that he or she lacks the resources to do what is required. Each of us receives from God the qualities with which we are to work. People look at others and say: “Well, they have fine qualities – this one is diligent; that one is persistent; and that other one has the strength to overcome difficulties. Certainly, they weren’t referring to me when our sages delineated the path one must take.” No one can exempt themselves in this way, for God gave each individual the precise qualities and character that are uniquely necessary for him or her. With those qualities we are to begin to work.
People who now have a “faulty” character – whom Maimonides called “women and children” – can eventually grow and acquire wisdom and understanding. They can also eventually attain the level of “for its sake,” for our sages said that by means of “not for its sake,” a person will come to “for its sake.” Each of us begins with “not for its sake” – that is, service of God on the basis of self-interest. There is no other way to begin, for our primal nature is to receive pleasure and joy for our own benefit. As we progress, we can take tiny steps, and by way of work in Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>, we can gradually approach the goal of observing Torah “for its sake.” In the end, we will desire to do only what is pleasing to our Creator, and we will not at all be motivated by self-love.

VII The Nations of the World

The holy <i>Zohar</i> says the following about “the nations of the world:” “All the kindness that they do, they do for themselves.” [<i>Tikunei Hazohar</i> 22a, 73b] This means that whatever acts of kindness the nations of the world do toward their friends or in the service of their gods – it will never be out of love for the other, but rather due to self-love; that is, so that it will pay off in the end. Who are these selfish nations of the world? The <i>Zohar</i> uses the expression “the nations of the world” to refer to the various selfish inclinations that are within each and every one of us.
The <i>Zohar</i> is saying that our desires and thoughts – even if they move us to do acts of kindness – are based on self-love.
The <i>Zohar</i> is obviously not a political guide, but rather a guide regarding how to direct our spiritual life. As Baal Hasulam stated, “heaven forbid” that there is an element of nationalism in the idea that the Torah was given to Israel. “Only people who have taken leave of their senses could consider the possibility that God has some national preference – that is, that God prefers one nation over another” [see Section 5 in “The Giving of the Torah”]. All the people of the nations of the world also will someday come to the service of God, no less than will the people of Israel. Rabbi Yitzchak Luria – the holy Ari – said that all souls are derived from the single, original, general soul of the first <i>adam</i>.
Since each person is a miniature world according to the <i>Zohar</i>, then within each human being is an aspect of Israel and an aspect of the nations of the world. The aspect of Israel is the source of selfless giving that is in each person’s heart, as well as the source of faith in the greatness of God. This gives us the spiritual strength that can make it possible to sacrifice everything in order to please God, in the manner that incense is completely consumed on the altar.
Rabbi Baruch Shalom Ashlag interpreted the five-letter name Israel in Hebrew as being a conjoining of two words: the first three letters are the word <i>Yashar</i> meaning “straight.” The last two letters make up one of the names of God: <i>El</i>. Together the meaning is “straight to God.” That is, the element of Israel in all people is our desire to devote ourselves to God so that all of our thoughts, all of our speech, and all of our actions will be in harmony with God’s will.
The aspect of the nations of the world is the desire to receive pleasure and joy. This desire splits into 70 nations, where each nation represents a different variety of craving. [Seventy is ten times seven, where ten represents a complete level and seven is the number of spiritual attributes according to the Kabbalah.] Each nation represents a certain craving, and all 70 varieties of craving are the essential ingredients of the desire to receive within each of us.
In the material world, Israel’s population and geographical territory are small, and it is surrounded by the nations of the world like a small lamb among 70 wolves. This is a physical manifestation of a spiritual reality – that the aspect within each of us that identifies with the divine will is small and undeveloped in contrast to the 70 forms of desire that wish to dominate our thoughts, feelings, and actions. A person must give much effort in Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> in order to extricate the aspect of Israel (“straight to God”) from darkness to light. We must recognize its value and significance, and we must recognize the contamination and dirt in the other desires and thoughts that exist within us that come from the myriad forms of desire. When we fully appreciate this, we can awaken ourselves to strengthen the aspect of Israel within us so that it will gradually overcome the aspect of the 70 nations of the world.
VI. <i>Te Nations oo the World</i>
There’s a well-known story of Rebbe Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev in which he was standing in synagogue wrapped in his prayer shawl and preparing to lead the prayers for the congregation. Everyone could see that he was debating with himself and hesitating for some time. At one point he put down the prayer shawl on the stand and shouted: “Ok, you can pray.” Naturally, no one there understood what was going on. Then the rebbe explained: “When I stood up to pray, I looked within myself and I saw that my evil inclination was also there with me. I asked him ‘What are you doing here?’ He answered ‘I want to pray too. I get a lot of pleasure and joy from performing <i>mitzvot</i> and saying prayers. It makes me feel righteous and complete. So I want to pray with you.’ I got very angry and I said to the evil inclination: ‘I’m not willing to pray with you.’ He insisted and wouldn’t leave me alone. So I got even angrier, and I told him: ‘Ok, you can pray if you want to. I’m not going to pray with you.”
From this story, we learn that even when we keep all the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> at the lofty level of Rebbe Levi Yitzchak, we still have within us two aspects: the aspect of Israel and the aspect of the nations of the world. It takes a lot of work and effort in order to learn how to distinguish between these two inner voices. There can never be a situation when both are on top, and we must make sure that it is always the side of Israel that dominates. As our sages said: “The city of Tzur was built only from the destruction of Jerusalem” [<i>Shabbat</i> 56b], and they were referring to the Tzur within us – that is, the aspect of the nations of the world. The nations within us are built only from the destruction of holiness. And the opposite is also true: Holiness is built only when we recognize the undesirable and evil nature of the seventy nations within us. We must subjugate them and bring them lower and lower. By keeping Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> with this intention, we can gradually extricate ourselves from the control of the self-love that nature has imprinted within us, and eventually acquire a second nature of loving the other.

VIII How It Feels to Begin to Give Selflessly

<b>Emptiness</b>
Our natural inclination is to do only what gives us some benefit. When we begin to give to other people because that’s what God wants us to do, and without any expectation of reward, we are acting contrary to this natural self-centeredness. At first, this causes us to feel sad and cry to ourselves. We have a sense of emptiness, like a hollow space within. It’s like walking into a desert when we have no idea where we will find food and water. Without trust in God, we naturally are very hesitant and worried.
For this reason, if we receive no pleasure from an act that is done out of love for the other, this may be an indication that we are on the path of truth. Interestingly, the Hebrew word “<i>taam</i>” means both “taste” and “reason.” To say that an act has no “taste” (lacks “<i>taam</i>”) is to say that the ego sees no reason to do it. Why eat something that has no taste and gives us no benefit? Why do something if there is no reason to do it that fits our understanding and feeling?
It requires an effort of will founded on faith in order to complete a task that has no “taste.” Faith is accepting that God is completely beneficent and is directing all that takes place in the world. This means that also other people’s actions are expressions of God in the world. Only when we recognize this, can we then act for the benefit of other people out of a love for God.
Before receiving the Torah, the people of Israel made a remarkable declaration of devotion to God’s will: “We will do and we will hear (understand).” [Exodus 24:7] With this statement, the people of Israel made a commitment to do whatever God would ask of them, before they would understand or appreciate the wisdom in acting according to God’s will. The beginning stage of giving selflessly corresponds to the “we will do” in this oft-quoted statement of the Israelites in the desert.
If we continue on the path of selfless giving, then eventually we receive a new nature whose sole concern is to give lovingly to others. At the moment we receive that new nature, we are freed from the concerns of the ego and united with God in joy. We then have reached the stage of “we will hear.” At this level, we are prepared to accept King David’s invitation: “Taste and see that God is good.” [Psalms 34:9]
<b>Dynamic, Non-habitual</b>
Regarding the beginning stages of spiritual devotion, there is a distinction between the feeling when we begin to serve God by giving to other people and the feeling in our direct service of God by fulfilling <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God. Our direct service of God is fixed – for example, putting on <i>tefillin</i> each morning or saying the same proscribed blessings. No other person is involved who will criticize us if we fail to do what is required in this regard, and we are not put to the test of other people’s shifting moods and circumstances. It’s easy to get used to this form of service, and once we have acquired the habit of doing it, then it has no benefit. For service without conscious intention and thought brings no spiritual benefit.
The situation is different in the service of God that takes place between one person and another. Here our spiritual work is capable of having an effect on us. Interpersonal matters are not dependent on habit, for they change all the time. Each day the people around us make new demands, and we are tested anew. Thus there is a preference for the service of God by an individual giving to another person, because we get feedback on the quality of our service, and so it’s unlikely that we will fall into habit.
For this reason, Rabbi Akiva said that the <i>mitzvah</i> “and love your fellow” is the central principle of the Torah. The goal is to love God, but the way to arrive at the goal is by way of the <i>mitzvah</i>: “and love your fellow.” Do we love God? One test is to see the measure of our love for other people. For it’s impossible to love the Creator without loving His creations.
Baal Hasulam states that the portion of the Torah that involves service between an individual and God is less capable of creating a spiritual healing than service between an individual and other people. By conforming to the fixed requirements of the service between an individual and God, we may deceive ourselves that we are doing a good job of serving God, even though we have simply fallen into habit. Indeed we may have even failed to consider why we are fulfilling these <i>mitzvot</i>. For example, do we ask ourselves: Why do we keep the Sabbath? What is the purpose of the Sabbath? Who commanded us to keep the Sabbath? If we just keep the Sabbath out of habit, there’s no substantial work in transforming our nature. No one other than ourselves will comment and make us see that we are not really occupied with purifying our intentions and cleaning up our inner world.
Then why do we need <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God at all? It seems we would be more effective in perfecting ourselves if we would invest all our efforts in interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i>. The answer is that <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God remind us that the final goal is love of the Creator. For this purpose the whole world was created. Loving other people is the method to arrive at loving the Creator, but it is not the goal.
Furthermore, this method – loving people – is based on our love of the Creator in three different ways:
God is the source of the requirement to love other people. If not for God’s <i>mitzvah</i> to love others, we would not see the necessity for this. Human ethics is no reliable anchor, for its demands are open to change and are in fact extremely fluid.
a) The technique that creates love of another person is to see that God is really the one who is directing that person’s actions. Therefore all our relationship to the other person is actually our relationship to God who is enclothed within him or her. Without this outlook, there is nothing that can cause us to put other people’s needs above our own.
b) Whenever there is a conflict between giving to another person and God’s <i>mitzvah</i>, we certainly must give preference to God and not the person, for the goal is not loving people but loving God. Only where the two matters of loving God and loving other people coincide, then the whole affair of loving others is transformed to be spiritually beneficial. However, when they are separated, there is no spiritual benefit at all in loving others. From this we understand that certainly we need to keep the <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God, but the interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> create sensitivity within us that prevents the <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God from becoming habitual. Thus, we should keep the <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God, and with God’s help, we eventually will acquire the ability to keep them in sincere devotion.
<b>Contrary to Our Nature</b>
How does the overriding significance of <i>mitzvot</i> between an individual and God fit in with the saying of the sages: “Hospitality is greater than receiving the divine presence” [<i>Shabbat</i> 127a]? Haven’t we been saying that hospitality is just the means, but the goal is receiving the divine presence? The answer is built on a distinction between two states in the service of God:
The state of “doing spiritual work” is called “bringing in guests” (that is, hospitality). Our inclination toward the good is considered a “guest,” because we are only occasionally conscious of this aspect of ourselves. Our spiritual labor to give supremacy to our good inclination is therefore called: “bringing in guests.” This is the spiritual work that opposes our self-centered nature.
(a) “Receiving the divine presence” is the reward. This comes after we complete our work on “bringing in” the good inclination – that is, when our inclination toward the good dominates our intentions. At this time the purpose of creation is fulfilled, for God is revealed to us.
Now we can interpret the saying: “Hospitality is greater than receiving the divine presence.” It comes to tell us that even after we have arrived at the purpose of creation – when we are receiving the divine presence – we should prefer to continue doing spiritual work – to continue bringing in the “guest” which is our good inclination. For even when we have gotten to our spiritual destination, we need to constantly renew our love for God. The renewal of love is achieved by never ceasing the spiritual work.
Baal Hasulam mentions that a certain percentage of people are born with an altruistic nature, and also among them there are differences of degree in altruism. What is the spiritual work of such people, if their nature is already to be giving? Although much good work can be done in the spirit of altruism; nonetheless, the true spiritual work is to connect everything to God. The altruist’s nature is good, and in general, the altruist does not have to overcome his or her nature. However, the altruist must believe that the need to help others is not because it’s the altruist’s nature, but because that’s the way to unite with God who is good and beneficent.
The particular form of service required of the altruist is to increase faith. The altruist may be good at responding to the distress of others, but this is not necessarily out of faith in God. The test will be when the altruist has to act contrary to his or her nature. For example, once I was acquainted with someone who had a giving nature, and all his life was completely devoted to helping other people. But one day he called me on the phone and said angrily: “Why does the Torah say that someone who is taking a walk and sees a bird with chicks is required to send the mother away and take the chicks? That’s cruel and completely unacceptable to me.” This altruist failed the test to act contrary to his nature when God required it.
Actually, not only the altruist, but all of us are to be judged by our preparedness to act contrary to our nature. Although we described how interpersonal <i>mitzvot</i> can develop our spiritual character, their true test is when they require us to overcome our nature. We find an example of this when King David, before his death, ordered his son Solomon to kill two people. One of them had only cursed the king. Generally, we would expect that someone about to die would be inclined to be kind and forgive such a thing. So why, in his last moments, did King David request that this deed be punished? The answer is that Kind David didn’t want to react when he was angry and full of strength. That would have been the natural thing to do. King David wanted to act only due to the <i>mitzvah</i> of God to punish such a sin. The Torah does not enable a king to forgive the degrading of his honor. So King David waited for a situation in which it would be against his nature, and only then he demanded that this law be followed. His request that Solomon kill the curser was therefore an act of devotion to God’s will.

IX The Spiritual Path; Short or Long?

A story is told in the Talmud [<i>Eruvin</i> 53b] about Rabbi Yehoshua who was travelling to a city and on the way met a boy at a fork in the road. Rabbi Yehoshua asked him which way to take in order to get to the city. The boy answered: This way is short but long, and that way is long but short. Rabbi Yehoshua took the short road, but as he approached the city he found it encompassed by orchards and could not get past them in order to arrive at the city. He had to return to the fork and start out again along the long, short way.
Baal Hasulam explains: “Short way” means the way that is close to our nature of loving only ourselves. “The city” refers to the goal of cleaving to God. “Long way” means the way that is contrary to our nature of loving only ourselves.
So the inner message in the boy’s directions was: If we follow the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i> on the basis of self-love alone, we will feel it to be “short” and easy. However, in truth, this is the long, hard way, and we’re not going to get anywhere. That is, we won’t be getting any closer to arriving at the goal. On the other hand, if we take the long way which is contrary to our self-serving nature, we will find that it is short. For this is the way to gradually get closer to the city – that is, to a state of cleaving to God.
From Baal Hasulam we learn that “short way” means the way that is close to our heart – that is, the way that follows our desire to receive, the way that is easy. However, this is really the long way, because it doesn’t lead to love of God. It’s easy for us to keep the Torah’s <i>mitzvot</i> with the understanding that it’s for our own benefit, and for this reason it’s thought to be the short way. But in the end, it’s long, for this way does not bring about a healing of our self-centered nature. It will lead to suffering, and we will keep going around in circles until we at last understand what is essential and what is not. Once we have given up on the short, long way, then we can begin on the long, short way.
“A long, short way” means going in the direction of loving the other. Of course, the ego opposes this – and this may be expressed by sluggishness or other states of the body – and therefore it is called a “long way.” However, if we subdue the body (where “body” is a code word for the desire to receive) and nonetheless take this path, we can merit seeing that this is the short way to true joy – the way of kindness that leads to a state of cleaving to God.
In a similar way, Baal Hasulam interprets the verse regarding the direction that was taken when the people of Israel left Egypt: “And God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines because it is near.” [Exodus 13:17] Baal Hasulam explains that God did not want to lead the people on a spiritual path that is based on receiving some reward, as people would naturally desire. Such a path would cause a turning back to Egypt – that is, this spiritual path would lead to renewed enslavement to the desire to receive.
The study of the Kabbalah is not supposed to provide intellectual entertainment. If we just remain at the level of philosophical principles, we don’t get anywhere. To study Kabbalah is a lofty pursuit, but it would be completely mistaken to think that because we study Kabbalah we are worthy of honor and admiration. An expanded ego is, of course, the opposite of the goal. We should never take pride when comparing ourselves to any other person in the world. Our goal is to see the divine greatness in others, not to devalue them.
Rather, the orientation in studying Kabbalah is to purify ourselves and subjugate the ego by putting into practice the ideas in the wisdom of the Kabbalah. The way to fulfill the purpose of life, and not to waste it, is practical work in giving and loving others, and not just thinking about the philosophy of giving. When we do spiritual work in a practical manner, we become acquainted with ourselves and learn what the “body” wants to do and what it does not want to do. We witness the inevitable resistance that arises when we make the effort to do spiritual work, and the resistance keeps us focused on authentic questions of the heart, not just intellectual queries.
Working through these difficulties is the long, short way that leads to an inner transformation in which we come to love giving in a way similar to the way that God loves giving. Having acquired such a divine nature, we will be in a state of union with God.

X Group Work

God is perfect and so has no desire to receive anything at all. God only wants to give and expresses that desire by creating and sustaining the world. The path to union with God is to aspire to attain God’s attribute of giving.
People who share the desire to develop love for others can inspire one another to form a society devoted to serving God. Giving selflessly to people who are not interested in this path, however, will drag us down, for they will exploit our giving. Since they are not looking out for us, it becomes necessary for us to look out for ourselves at least to a certain extent. So when some members of a society are selfish, it affects the whole society. [See section 17 of “The Mutual Guaranty” for a more complete explanation of this point.]
It requires a great deal of work to build a society based on “love your fellow as yourself,” but it seems very easy for anyone’s selfishness to destroy it. How can we even begin to build such a society while avoiding the risk of exploitation? Our sages said: “Give preference (in charity) to the poor of your city over the poor of another city.” It simply is not practical to work immediately on loving the whole world. In order to develop our love for others, we must begin with a small number of people. We start with those who are close to our heart and then gradually expand the circle after we have progressed in developing love for others.
We develop love for others by choosing a small group of at least three friends who are seriously committed to doing this work together. The work of the group will include the three areas of thought, speech, and action. In the area of thought, we reflect each day on what is special about each of the friends in our group. What are their good character traits, special abilities, and unique points of view? This will increase our motivation to give to them; for when we recognize the greatness of others, it feels good to give to them. Regarding our speech, we work on speaking respectfully to each member of the group, the way we would speak with very important people. In our actions, we work to do things for the benefit and happiness of the group.
The spiritual path of loving others is to fulfill the material desires of others. Our task is to give the people in our group things like attention, food, and money, for it is the nature of people to want material things more than spirituality. What does it mean to give to another? It is giving to someone else things that are precious to them. In general, these are material things. Our physical desires may cause us trouble sleeping at night. However if we feel we are lacking in spirituality, we’ll usually still manage to get a good night sleep.
Looking to fix other people and give them spirituality, is not giving. This is not giving, because we are not giving up anything. Looking to give other people spirituality is self-serving, as it contains the ego gratification of feeling superior to others. And again our task is to give the people in our group what they want, not what serves us to give.
This group work is a daily, practical method, founded by Baal Hasulam, for building a society based on loving others. It is recommended that groups meet once a week, each time at a different member’s home. Discussions should focus on the importance of society and loving the other, including practical suggestions regarding how to develop love and cooperation among the members of the group. Each member attempts to create a joyous, non-critical atmosphere that, with God’s help, will increase and spread outward from the group to wider circles of society.
