Introduction



Section I





Chapter 1

1. <b>Explaining the concept of the initial contraction, where the Infinite Light contracted in order to emanate the emanated and create the created. And within it are five aspects:</b> Before the contraction, there was the Infinite, filling all of existence. *The Tree of Life, Gate 1, Branch 2. Know that before the emanation of the emanated and the creation of the created, there was a simple, supreme light filling all of existence. There was no empty space, void, or vacuum; rather, everything was filled with that simple, undifferentiated light. It had neither beginning nor end, but everything was a single, equal, and undifferentiated light, which is called the Infinite Light.
2. The reason for creation was to reveal His names and attributes. And when His simple Will arose to create the worlds and emanate the emanated, to manifest the completeness of His actions and His names and attributes, that was the reason for the creation of the worlds.
3. The contraction of light from the surroundings of the central point. At that moment, the Infinite Light contracted itself into the central point, which is in the exact middle, and that light contracted, moving away to the sides surrounding the central point.
4. The space that remained after the contraction was circular. So what remained was an empty space, air, and a vacant void, from the central point itself. And this contraction was a perfect circle around that empty central point, in such a way that the space of that void was circular in every direction in a complete equality, and it was not in the form of a square with standing corners. This is because the Infinite contracted itself in a circular manner, equally from all sides.
5. As the Infinite Light is in equality, the contraction was also in equality, which is the secret of the circle. And the reason was that, since the light of the Infinite is perfectly equal, it necessitated that the contraction also be in perfect equality, contracting itself equally from all sides, and not more from one side than the others. It is known in the wisdom of measurement that there is no shape as equal as the shape of a circle, unlike a square with standing corners, or the shape of a triangle and other shapes. Therefore, the contraction of the Infinite had to be in the form of a circle.

Chapter 2

1.<b>Explaining that the light of the Infinite continued a line of light to the worlds, which emanated and were created in the space that contracted. And within it are five aspects:<b> From the Infinite, a line of light extended into the space. Now, after the mentioned contraction, which left a space with empty air and void in the midst of the light of the Infinite as described above, there was already a place where the emanated and the created could exist. At that point, a straight line extended from the Infinite Light, descending from above to below, and it continued to unfold as it entered that space.</b></b>
2.  The fire of the line touches the Infinite, and its end is limitless. The top of the line extends from the Infinite itself and touches it, although the end of this line below, at its conclusion, does not touch the light of the Infinite.
3. The line, soft, spreads the light of the Infinite to the worlds, and through this line, the light of the Infinite continues to extend and spread downward.
4. All the worlds are in that contracted space, and in that space, He emanated, created, formed, and made all the worlds.
5. Before the contraction, He and His name were one, and no intellect could comprehend Him. * Gate of the sayings of our Sages, Shabbat, regarding 'and to understand'. Prior to these four worlds, there was the Infinite, He is One and His name is One, in a wondrous and concealed unity, for there is no power, even in the closest angels to Him, and they have no understanding of the Infinite, for there is no created intellect that can comprehend Him, as He has no place, boundary, or name.

And the second aspect is that after the face (<i>partzuf</i>) itself of Rachel is rectified through the charity and gifts to the poor, there still needs to an enlightenment occurring within her, in the secret of its actual minds that are clothed within the face of her ten emanations at the time of slumber, as is known. So it is necessary for this enlightenment in her minds just mentioned to remain for all of these days called Purim, and to remain in existence there even if the minds of Father and Mother (<i>Abba veIma</i>) depart after the slumber and return to being face to face. But even with all of this, the enlightenment of those minds must remain in existence in her minds and not completely depart as at other times, as mentioned above. But this matter is dependent upon fulfillment of another commandment, and that is to have a Purim meal, a party and a joyous occasion.
