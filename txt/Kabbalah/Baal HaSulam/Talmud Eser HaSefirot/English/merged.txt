Talmud Eser HaSefirot

Introduction

<b>1. The claims against the wisdom of the Kabbala</b><br><b>First of all, I have found that there is a great need for me to smash the existing iron barrier that is separating us from the wisdom of the Kabbala, from the time of the destruction of the Temple and onwards, until this generation of ours.</b> This barrier <b>has made things very difficult for us indeed, and has led to the fear that</b> this wisdom <b>might be forgotten from Israel, God forbid. Now, whenever I start speaking with anyone on the topic of the study</b> of the Kabbala<b>,</b> the person's <b>first question is, “why do I have to know how many angels there are in heaven, and what their names are? Can’t I observe the entire Torah, with all its details and minutiae, without knowing these things?”</b>
<b>Second, he will ask: “The Sages have already determined that one must initially attain full knowledge of the Talmud and the</b> books of the <b>rulings</b> of Halakha<b>. Who,</b> then, <b>can deceive himself</b> into believing <b>that he has already finished the entire revealed Torah, and</b> that <b>he lacks only the esoteric Torah?”</b>
<b>Third, he is afraid that he might ruin himself by</b> becoming <b>involved with this topic, God forbid, because it has happened that</b> people <b>have been led astray from the path of the Torah due to their occupation with Kabbala. “If so, why do I need this trouble, and who is</b> so <b>foolish</b> as <b>to place himself in danger for nothing?”</b>
<b>Fourth, even those who cherish this study permit it only to</b> certain <b>holy individuals who serve God, and “not everyone who wishes to assume the reputation</b> of a God-fearing person <b>may come and assume</b> it” (see Mishna, <i>Berakhot</i> 2:8).
<b>Fifth, and most importantly, we have a principle</b> which applies <b>to any case of uncertainty, that</b> one should <b>“go out</b> and observe <b>what the people are doing”</b> (<i>Eiruvin</i> 14b). <b>I can see with my own eyes that all the Torah scholars of my generation are of one mind</b> in this regard, <b>and they withdraw from the study of the esoteric</b> wisdom. <b>They also advise those who ask them</b> about it <b>that it is better, without any doubt whatsoever, to study a page of Talmud than</b> to engage <b>in this</b> area of <b>study.</b>
<b>2. True life – a life of Torah and mitzvot</b><br><b>However, if we focus on answering only one very famous question, I am sure that all of these questions and misgivings will vanish without a trace. It is the irritating question that is asked of all mortals, namely: What is the point of our lives?</b>
<b>In other words, these few years of our lives, which cost us so dearly, through all the agonies and pains we suffer through them, in order to complete them to their end, who benefits from them? To be more precise, to whom am I providing benefit?</b>
<b>It is true that scholars over the generations – and needless to say in our generation – have wearied themselves with these reflections, such that no one even wishes to contemplate</b> this issue. <b>Yet the question itself remains in all of its force and bitterness, for it sometimes meets us unbidden, pierces our minds, and humiliates us down to the ground, before we manage to</b> scramble and <b>find the well-known strategy, which is to drift mindlessly along the currents of life, as we did the day before.</b>
<b>3. However, the verse formulates an answer to this unsolved riddle: “Taste and see that the Lord is good etc.” (Psalms 34:9). Those who observe the Torah and mitzvot in accordance with their laws will taste the taste of life, and they see and can attest that the Lord is good. As the Sages have stated, He created the worlds in order to bestow good upon His creatures, for it is the way of the good to bestow good.</b>
<b>But</b> it is <b>certainly</b> the case that <b>one who has not yet tasted the</b> taste of <b>life</b> found in <b>the fulfillment of Torah and mitzvot is unable to understand and sense that the Lord is good the way the Sages stated, that God’s entire purpose in creating him was only to bestow good upon him.</b>
<b>Therefore,</b> a person <b>has no other recourse than to go and observe the Torah and mitzvot in accordance with their laws.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning of <b>the verse in the Torah (<i>Parashat Nitzavim</i>, Deuteronomy 30:15): “See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil.” That is, before the giving of the Torah, only death and evil were before us. The meaning is as the Sages stated, that the wicked are called dead</b> even <b>in their lifetimes (<i>Berakhot</i> 18b). Their deaths are better than their lives, because the sufferings and pain that they endure in order to maintain their lives are far more intense than the meager pleasures they feel during those lives.</b>
<b>Now, however, we have merited to</b> receive <b>the Torah and the mitzvot and through fulfilling</b> them <b>we merit the true, joyful life, which provides joy to those who live it, as it is written: “Taste and see that the Lord is good.” The verse therefore states: “See, I have set before you this day life and good,” which did not exist for you at all before the giving of the Torah.</b>
<b>This is</b> also the meaning of <b>the conclusion of</b> that passage of <b>Scripture (Deuteronomy 30:19): “Choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants.” The wording appears repetitive</b> and circular: <b>Choose life</b> in order <b>“that you may live.” Rather, the reference is to a life through the fulfillment of Torah and mitzvot,</b> a life <b>in which one truly lives, which is not so for a life without Torah and mitzvot;</b> such an existence <b>is harsher than death.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning of <b>the Sages’ statement</b> that <b>the wicked are called dead in their lifetimes, as explained.</b><br><b>This is</b> also the meaning of the conclusion of that same <b>verse: “That you may live, you and your descendants.” In other words, not only does a life without Torah provide no benefit to the one who lives it, but it also cannot provide benefit to others, meaning that</b> such a person <b>has no satisfaction even from the children he fathers, since the lives of these children are also harsher than death.</b> Thus, <b>what gift is he bequeathing them?</b>
<b>By contrast, one who lives through the Torah and mitzvot not only merits to enjoy his own life, but he also rejoices in fathering children and bequeathing this good life to them.</b> Accordingly, <b>this is</b> the meaning of <b>the verse: “That you may live, you and your descendants,” for he receives additional pleasure through the lives of his children, since he was the cause of their</b> lives of enjoyment.
<b>4. With the above</b> in mind, <b>you can understand the statement of the Sages on the aforementioned verse, “choose life” (see Rashi’s commentary there), which is as follows: I am instructing you to choose the portion of life, like a man who says to his son, “choose for yourself a fine portion from my estate,” and</b> the man <b>positions</b> his son <b>on the best portion and tells him: “select this one for yourself.”</b>
<b>Regarding this, it is stated: “Lord, the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You maintain my lot” (Psalms 16:5);</b> that is, <b>“You placed my hand on the best lot, saying, take this one for yourself.”</b>
<b>Now,</b> this explanation <b>seems</b> at first glance to be <b>puzzling, since the verse states “choose life,” which means that the person is choosing of his own accord, and yet</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>“he positions him near the best portion,” and if so, there is no choice here. Furthermore, they also say that God places</b> the <b>person’s hand on the best portion, and this is very surprising, for in that case, where is the person’s choice?</b>
<b>In</b> light of <b>the</b> above <b>explanation, you can understand their statement properly. It is true and absolutely correct that God Himself places a person’s hand on the best portion. That is,</b> He does so <b>by giving</b> the person <b>a life of satisfaction and delight within this corporeal life full of sufferings and pain.</b> This life is <b>devoid of any content,</b> so painful <b>that a man necessarily detaches himself and flees from</b> that pain<b>,</b> but <b>when he is shown even a glimpse of some place of tranquility to where he can flee from this life that is harsher than death, there is no greater placement of a person’s hand by God than this.</b>
As for <b>the aspect of a person’s choice, that</b> choice <b>is only for</b> the purpose of <b>strengthening</b> himself. <b>There is certainly a great labor and much toil here, until he purifies his body and can fulfill the Torah and mitzvot in accordance with their laws, i.e., not for his own benefit but to give his Creator satisfaction. This is called “for its own sake</b> [<i>lishma</i>].” <b>It is only in this manner</b> that a person <b>merits the life of happiness and comfort that accompanies the observance of the Torah.</b>
<b>Before he attains this</b> state of <b>purity, choice is certainly relevant,</b> in that it helps him <b>strengthen himself along the good path, through all kinds of methods and strategies. He will</b> thus be able <b>to do all that he can with his own strength, until he has completed the labor of purification, and</b> so that <b>he will not fall, God forbid, under</b> the weight of <b>his burden, in the middle of the journey.</b>
<b>5. The wisdom of the Torah – its essence and the path to acquiring it</b><br><b>Based on the</b> above <b>explanation, you can understand the Sages’ statement in Tractate <i>Avot</i></b> (6:4): <b>“This is the path of Torah: Bread with salt you shall eat, water in small measures you shall drink, and upon the ground you shall sleep; you shall live a life of deprivation and in Torah you shall toil. If you do so, ‘happy you shall be and it shall be well with you’</b> (Psalms 128:2) – <b>‘happy you shall be’ in this world, ‘and it shall be well with you’ in the World to Come.”</b>
<b>A question arises with regard to this teaching: What is the difference between the wisdom of the Torah and other worldly wisdoms, which do not require such mortifications and a life of suffering, but instead, toil alone is perfectly sufficient for acquiring these wisdoms?</b> In the case of <b>the wisdom of the Torah,</b> by contrast, <b>even though we very work hard at it, that is still not enough</b> for us <b>to acquire it, other than by means of the mortifications of “bread with salt” etc., and “a life of deprivation” etc.</b>
<b>The conclusion of this statement is even more surprising, for it reads: “If you do so, happy you shall be in this world, and it shall be well with you in the World to Come.” Granted that it is possible for it to be well with me in the World to Come, but in this world, when I am mortifying myself in</b> my <b>eating, drinking, and sleeping</b> habits, <b>and I am living</b> under conditions of <b>great deprivation, can it be said about such a life: “Happy you shall be in this world”? Can this be called a happy life, in the sense</b> of the term as it is <b>applied to this world?</b>
<b>6. However, following the above explanation, that engaging in the Torah and observing the mitzvot in accordance with their laws, under their stringent conditions, is</b> performed <b>in order to give one’s Creator satisfaction, not for one’s own pleasure, this cannot be attained other than by way of great service and through mighty toil in the purification of the body.</b>
<b>The first strategy is to accustom oneself not to accept anything for one's own pleasure, even with respect to those things that are permitted and</b> actually <b>indispensable for the requirements of the body’s</b> continued <b>existence, such as eating, drinking, and sleeping, and other such essential</b> activities. <b>In this manner, he removes himself entirely from any pleasure that accompanies</b> these actions <b>even against his will, while in the process of</b> taking <b>the necessities</b> he requires <b>to sustain his life, until he lives a life of deprivation in the literal sense.</b>
<b>Subsequently, once he has become accustomed to this</b> way of deprivation<b>, and his body no longer has any desire to receive any pleasure for itself, now he can engage in the Torah and observe the mitzvot in this manner as well. That is,</b> he can engage in Torah and mitzvot <b>in order to give satisfaction to his Creator, and not for his own pleasure in the slightest degree (unless he does not regret his earlier</b> deeds, <b>as stated in <i>Tosafot</i></b> on <i><b>Rosh HaShana</i> 4</b>a, <b>s.v., “<i>bishvil</i>”; see there. There is also a mystical meaning to this idea, as stated in the Rambam, but this is not the place to elaborate).</b>
<b>When</b> a person <b>merits this</b> stage, <b>he</b> also <b>merits to taste the happy life that is filled with every goodness and delight, without the drawbacks of any deprivation,</b> the life <b>that is revealed through engaging in the Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake.</b> This is <b>as Rabbi Meir says (Avot 6:1): “Anyone who studies Torah for its own sake merits many things, and not only that, but the entire world is worthwhile for his sake etc., the Torah’s secrets are revealed to him, and he becomes as an ever-increasing wellspring etc.”; see there.</b>
<b>Regarding</b> such a person<b>, the verse states: “Taste and see that the Lord is good etc.” (Psalms 34:9), as explained above, that one who has a taste of engaging in the Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake merits and sees the purpose of creation</b> fulfilled <b>in himself.</b> This purpose <b>is,</b> as stated, <b>only</b> for God <b>to bestow good upon His creatures, since it is the way of the good to bestow good. He is glad and joyful in the number of years of life that God has granted him, and the entire world is worthwhile for his sake.</b>
<b>7. Now you can understand both sides of the coin</b> with respect <b>to engaging in the Torah and mitzvot.</b>
<b>One side is the “path of Torah,” that is, the extensive preparation through which a person must prepare the cleansing of his body before meriting the fulfillment of the Torah and mitzvot themselves. During that stage, he necessarily engages in the Torah and mitzvot not for</b> their <b>own sake, but contaminated</b> by the desire to act for <b>his own pleasure, for he has not yet managed to purify and cleanse his body from the desire to receive pleasures from the vanities of this world. During this period he has to live a life of deprivation while toiling in the Torah, as stated in the mishna.</b>
<b>However, once he has finished and completed the path of the Torah, and has already purified his body, and is qualified to observe the Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake, in order to give his Creator satisfaction, he has</b> now <b>reached the other side of the coin, which is a life of great delight and tranquility. This is the purpose of creation, “to bestow good upon His creatures,” which is the happiest life in</b> both <b>this world and the World to Come.</b>
<b>8. Thus, the big difference between the wisdom of the Torah and the other worldly wisdoms has been thoroughly clarified.</b> The difference is that <b>the attainment of the other worldly wisdoms does not improve life in this world at all, since they do not provide one with even small compensation for the pains and sufferings that</b> a person <b>continuously suffers throughout the days of his life. Accordingly, one does not have to rectify his body</b> to acquire these wisdoms<b>, and the toil he invests</b> to acquire <b>them is sufficient, just as all attainments of this world are acquired by working hard for them.</b>
<b>The same is not true of the Torah and mitzvot, whose whole purpose is to render a person fit to be worthy of receiving all the goodness of the purpose of creation, “to bestow good upon His creatures.” Consequently, one must certainly purify his body so that it is worthy and deserving of that Divine goodness.</b>
<b>9. The mishna’s statement, “If you do so, happy you shall be in this world,” has also been thoroughly clarified.</b> The Sages <b>inferred this</b> message from the verse <b>with full intention</b> and awareness. They wished <b>to teach that a happy life in this world is made ready solely for one who has completed the path of the Torah.</b> They were referring to the way <b>that the mortifications of eating, drinking, and sleeping, which are stated here, are in effect only when one is on the “path of the Torah.” For this reason, they were precise in stating: “This is the path of Torah etc.”</b>
<b>Once</b> a person <b>has finished this path of</b> the Torah in the form of <b>not for its own sake, through a life of deprivation and mortifications,</b> and reaches the state of Torah life for its own sake<b>, the mishna concludes, “happy you shall be in this world,” for you will merit that happiness and goodness which is the purpose of creation. Then the entire world will be worthwhile on your account, that is, even this world, and all the more so the World to Come.</b>
<b>10. This is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Bereshit</i>, page 31:2) on the verse (Genesis 1:3): “And God said, let there be light, and there was light,”</b> which means <b>“let there be light for this world, and there was light for the World-to-Come.”</b>
The <b>meaning</b> of this statement is <b>that the acts of creation were created with their</b> full <b>capacities, and they were created with their full statures, as the Sages stated (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 11a), that is, in their full perfection and splendor. Accordingly, the light that was created on the first day emerged in its complete</b> form<b>, which also includes the life of this world, with</b> its <b>full refinements and comforts, in accordance with the measure expressed by the words “let there be light.”</b>
<b>However, in order to prepare a place for choice and service,</b> God <b>arose and concealed</b> the light <b>for the righteous in the future, as the Sages have stated (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 12a).</b><br>The Sages <b>therefore stated, in their clear style: “Let there be light for this world.” However, it did not remain as such, but rather “and there was light for the World-to-Come.” In other words, those who engage in the Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake</b> will <b>merit</b> the light <b>only in the future, meaning at the future time that will follow after the completion of the purification of their bodies through the path of the Torah. Then they will be worthy of that great light in this world as well, as the Sages state: “May you see your world in your lifetime” (<i>Berakhot</i> 17a).</b>
<b>11. However, we find and observe in the statements of the Talmudic Sages that they made the path of the Torah easier for us than the Sages of the Mishna did, for</b> the former <b>said (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 50b): “A person should always engage in Torah</b> study and the performance of <b>mitzvot, even if not for</b> their <b>own sake, since through</b> the performance of mitzvot <b>not for</b> their <b>own sake,</b> one <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake, and this is because the light within</b> this path <b>restores him to the right</b> path<b>."</b>
<b>They thus provided us with a new method, instead of the mortifications listed in the above mishna from <i>Avot</i>. It is “the light in the Torah,” which has enough power to restore one to the right</b> path <b>and to bring him to</b> a state of <b>engagement in the Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake.</b> The Sages of the Talmud <b>here do not mention mortifications but only engagement in Torah and mitzvot. That light, which restores him to the right</b> path, <b>is enough to enable him to engage in Torah and mitzvot in order to give satisfaction to his Creator, not for his own benefit at all, which is called “for its own sake.”</b>
<b>Four essential requirements on the path of Torah study</b><br><b>12. There is, however, an apparent problem with this approach, for we find many students whose engagement in the Torah did not enable them to merit to come to</b> the state of <b>“for its own sake” through the light</b> the Torah <b>contains.</b>
<b>However, the</b> actual <b>meaning of engaging in the Torah and mitzvot not for</b> their <b>own sake is that one believes in God, in the Torah, and in</b> the concepts of divine <b>reward and punishment, and he engages in the Torah because God commanded him to do so, only he incorporates his own pleasure</b> together <b>with giving satisfaction to his Creator. If, after all his toil in engaging in the Torah and mitzvot, he would be informed that he received no benefit or personal advantage from this engagement and great effort, he would regret all the effort he put in, because it was not</b> about the Torah <b>itself from the outset, since he thought that he too would reap the benefit of his toil. This kind</b> of attitude <b>is called “not for its own sake” (as stated in <i>Tosafot</i></b> on <i><b>Rosh HaShana</i> 4</b>a, <b>s.v., “<i>bishvil</i>”).</b>
<b>Even so, the Sages permitted the start of</b> one’s <b>engagement in the Torah and mitzvot</b> to be <b>even not for its own sake, for the reason that “through</b> the performance of Torah study and mitzvot <b>not for</b> their <b>own sake,</b> one <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake,” as explained above.</b>
<b>Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly true</b> that <b>if</b> the person <b>who is engaging</b> in the Torah <b>has not yet merited faith in God and His Torah, but rather he harbors doubts, God forbid, with regard to him the Sages did not say</b> that <b>“through not for</b> their <b>own sake,</b> one <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake.” It was not about</b> such a person <b>that they stated (in Midrash Rabba, <i>Petiḥta</i> to <i>Eikha</i> 2, and in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ḥagiga</i> 1:7, s.v., “<i>shemitokh she’lo lishma ba lishma</i>) that by engaging in it, the light within it restores them to the right</b> path.
The reason is that <b>the light within the Torah illuminates only for a believer, and what is more, the measure of the force of this light corresponds to the measure of the strength of his faith.</b>
<b>For those who lack faith, God forbid, the reverse is the case, as it is written, “for those who are left-handed in</b> their approach to Torah, it is <b>an elixir of death” (<i>Shabbat</i> 88b), since they receive darkness from the Torah, and their eyes are darkened.</b>
<b>13. The Sages already provided a fine parable for this idea (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 98b), on the verse: “Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord. Why would you have this day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light” (Amos 5:18).</b> The Talmud explains: “This is <b>comparable to a rooster and a bat who were looking forward to</b> the <b>light</b> of day. <b>The rooster said to the bat: I look forward to light, since</b> the <b>light is</b> an indication of <b>my</b> time to be active. <b>But</b> as for <b>you, why do you</b> need <b>light?” Examine this</b> parable <b>very carefully.</b>
<b>It is well understood that</b> in the case of <b>those</b> Torah <b>scholars who did not merit</b> the fulfilment of the principle that <b>“through</b> the study of Torah and performance of mitzvot <b>not for</b> their <b>own sake,</b> one <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake,”</b> the reason <b>is because they lack faith, God forbid, and therefore they received no light from the Torah. Accordingly, “they go about in darkness” (Psalms 82:5), “and they die without wisdom” (Job 4:21).</b>
<b>Those who merit complete faith, by contrast, are assured by the words of the Sages that since they are engaged in the Torah, even not for its own sake, the light within it will restore them to the right</b> path, <b>and they will merit, even without the preliminary</b> process <b>of suffering and a life of deprivation, to</b> study <b>Torah for its own sake. This brings</b> one <b>to a life of happiness and goodness in</b> both <b>this world and the World to Come, as stated above. With regard to them, the verse states: “Then you shall delight in the Lord and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the world etc.” (Isaiah 58:14).</b>
<b>14. In a somewhat similar vein, I once interpreted the expression of the Sages, “one whose Torah is his vocation</b> [<i>u’manuto</i>],” as signifying <b>that the extent of his faith</b> [<i>emunato</i>] <b>is discernible from</b> the nature of <b>his engagement in the Torah.</b> This is <b>because <i>u’manuto</i></b> has the same <b>letters</b> as <i><b>emunato</i>. This is similar to a person who has faith in his friend and lends him money. It is possible that he has faith in him for one lira, but if</b> the friend were <b>to demand two liras from him, he would refuse to lend</b> them <b>to him. It is also possible that he has faith in him</b> for <b>up to one hundred liras, but for no more than that. It is</b> further <b>possible that he has faith in him</b> to such an extent that he would <b>even lend half of his possessions, but not all his possessions. It is even possible that he has faith in him with respect to all of his possessions, without the slightest fear. This last faith is considered complete faith, whereas the other types are regarded as imperfect faith, but</b> each is a form of <b>partial faith, to a lesser or greater</b> degree.
<b>Similarly,</b> there is <b>a certain person</b> who <b>allocates for himself, due to the measure of his faith in God, only one hour of his day to engage in Torah and the service</b> of God. <b>A second allocates two hours for himself, in accordance with the measure of his faith in God. A third does not neglect a single moment of his leisure time without engaging in Torah and</b> divine <b>service. You must say that only the faith of the last one is complete, since he believes in God with respect to all his possessions, which is not the case with the former ones: Their faith is, needless to say, not yet fully complete. There is no need to elaborate</b> further <b>on this</b> metaphor.
<b>15. It has thus been thoroughly clarified that a person should anticipate that engaging in the Torah and mitzvot not for</b> their <b>own sake will bring him</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake only if he knows within himself that he has merited the proper faith in God and His Torah.</b> Only <b>then will the light it contains restore him to the right</b> path, <b>and he will merit the day of the Lord, which is entirely light. The holiness of faith purifies a person’s eyes so that they can enjoy His light, until the light of the Torah restores him to the right</b> path.
<b>By contrast, those who lack faith are like bats, which cannot look at the light of day, for the light of day has been transformed for them into a darkness more terrible than the darkness of night, because they are nourished only by the darkness of night.</b>
<b>So too those who lack faith, their eyes are blinded in relation to the light of God, and therefore the light is turned into darkness for them, and the “elixir of life” becomes for them an elixir of death. It is with regard to them</b> that <b>the verse states: “Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord. Why would you have this day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light” (Amos 5:18). Rather, they must first complete themselves by</b> attaining <b>complete faith, as explained.</b>
<b>16. This resolves a difficulty</b> raised <b>by <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ta’anit</i> 7a, s.v., “<i>ve’khol</i>).</b> I<b>t is stated</b> in the Talmud <b>there: “Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will become an elixir of life for him... And anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake, it becomes an elixir of death for him.”</b> The Tosafot commentary <b>raised</b> the following <b>difficulty: But don’t we say</b> that <b>a person should always engage in Torah even not for its own sake, since through</b> Torah <b>not for its own sake</b> one <b>comes</b> to study it <b>for its own sake (see there)? In accordance with</b> the above <b>explanation, one can distinguish</b> between the cases <b>in a simple manner. Here</b> it is referring <b>to one who at least engages in the Torah for the sake of the mitzva of Torah study, since he believes in reward and punishment. Only, he incorporates his own pleasure and advantage</b> together <b>with the intent of giving satisfaction to his Creator. Therefore, the light it contains restores him to the right</b> path, <b>and he comes</b> to study Torah <b>for its own sake.</b>
<b>In the other case,</b> by contrast, it is referring <b>to one who engages in the Torah not for the sake of the mitzva of Torah study, for he does not believe in reward and punishment to such an extent that he should toil so hard for it. Rather, he toils only for the sake of his own benefit, and therefore it becomes an elixir of death for him. The light within it is turned into darkness for him, as explained.</b>
<b>17. Therefore, a scholar is obligated, before studying, to strengthen himself in his faith in God and His Providence</b> as expressed <b>through reward and punishment, as the Sages have stated (<i>Avot</i> 2:16): “And your Employer is faithful to pay you the reward of your labors.” He should have the intention that his toil will be for the sake of the mitzva of the</b> study of <b>Torah, and in this manner he will merit to derive benefit from the light within it,</b> such <b>that his faith will also be strengthened and magnified through the special qualities of this light, as it is written: “It shall be health to your navel and marrow to your bones” (Proverbs 3:8).</b>
<b>Then his heart will be steadfast, trusting</b> in the Lord, <b>since through</b> studying Torah <b>not for its own sake,</b> he <b>will come</b> to study it <b>for its own sake.</b><br><b>Thus, even</b> in the case of <b>one who knows about himself that he has not yet merited faith, God forbid, he too has hope by means of engaging in the Torah. If he focuses his heart and mind on meriting faith in God through</b> his study, <b>there is no greater mitzva than this, as the Sages stated (<i>Makkot</i> 24a): “Habakkuk came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon one,</b> as it is stated: <b>‘The righteous person shall live by his faith’ (Habakkuk 2:4).”</b>
<b>What is more, he has no counsel other than this, as it is taught (in Tractate <i>Bava Batra</i> 16a): “Rava says: Job sought to exempt the whole world from judgment,</b> for he <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe…You created righteous people</b> and <b>You created wicked people; who can restrain You?”</b>
<b>Rashi there explains: “You created righteous people, with the good inclination; You created wicked people, with the evil inclination. Therefore, there is no escape from Your hand, for who can restrain</b> themselves; <b>sinners are compelled by circumstances beyond their control.”</b><br>The Talmud continues: <b>“And how did Job’s friends answer him? ‘You do away with fear and impair devotion before God’ (Job 15:4).</b> True, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the evil inclination,</b> but <b>He</b> also <b>created the Torah</b> as <b>an antidote.”</b>
<b>Rashi there explains: “He created</b> the Torah to counter <b>it, which is an antidote, for it nullifies ‘thoughts of transgression,’ as it is stated more generally in <i>Kiddushin</i> 30b): ‘If this wretched one,</b> the evil inclination, <b>encounters you, pull it into the study hall. If it is a stone, it will melt etc.’ Therefore, they are not victims of circumstances beyond their control, for they can save themselves.” See there, and examine</b> this teaching <b>carefully.</b>
<b>18. It is</b> thus <b>clear that</b> people <b>cannot exempt themselves from judgment if they say that they received this antidote but they still have thoughts of transgression, that is, they still harbor doubts, God forbid, and the evil inclination has not yet melted</b> away. <b>It is clear that the Creator who created</b> the evil inclination <b>and gave the evil inclination its power also knew how to create the reliable cure and antidote,</b> which serves <b>to weaken the strength of the evil inclination and melt it entirely away.</b>
<b>If</b> there is <b>someone who engaged in the Torah but was unable to remove the evil inclination from himself, this is either</b>
because <b>he neglected to put in the necessary time and labor for engaging in the Torah – as it is written:</b> “If someone says, <b>I have not labored but</b> nevertheless <b>I have found</b> success, <b>do not believe</b> him” <b>(<i>Megilla</i> 6b)</b> –
<b>or perhaps</b> such individuals <b>put in the required “quantity” of toil, but were negligent with regard to</b> its <b>“quality.” In other words, they did not focus their minds and hearts when engaging in Torah</b> study <b>to merit drawing forth the light within the Torah that brings faith into the heart of man. Rather, they engaged in distraction from the main thing that must be sought from the Torah, which is the light that leads to faith, as stated. Even if they had that intention at the outset, they became distracted from it during</b> their <b>studies.</b>
<b>Either way, one cannot exempt himself from judgment by claiming that he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control, after the Sages have pledged</b> that a cure is available <b>with the claim</b> that <b>“I created the evil inclination,</b> but <B>I</b> also <b>created the Torah</b> as <b>an antidote” (<i>Kiddushin</i> 30b). If there was an exception in this regard, Job’s difficulty would remain in place, God forbid. Examine</b> this argument <b>carefully.</b><br><b>The wisdom of truth is more intended for drawing forth the light within the Torah</b>
<b>19. With all that has been explained to this point, I have removed a great complaint that is</b> frequently <b>expressed against the words of Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital (of blessed memory) in his introduction to the Arizal’s <i>Sha’ar Hakdamot</i>, and which is also published as a preface to the book</b> <i><b>Etz Ḥayyim</i> (published in Jerusalem, 1910),</b> where <b>he states the following:</b>
<b>“However, a person should not say, ‘I will go off and engage in the wisdom of the Kabbala,’ before he engages in the Torah, Mishna, and Talmud. The Sages have already said that a person should not enter the orchard</b> [<i>pardes</i>], to deal with the loftiest secrets of Torah, <b>unless he has</b> first <b>filled his belly with</b> the <b>meat and wine</b> of Torah, Mishna and Talmud<b>. This is similar to a soul without a body, which has no reward, or action, or designs, until it is attached to a body, in which it is whole,</b> and <b>rectified through the mitzvot of the Torah, through the 613 mitzvot.</b>
<b>The same applies to the reverse</b> case<b>: If one engages in the wisdom of the Mishna and the Babylonian Talmud, without giving a share</b> of his attention <b>to the secrets and esoteric teachings of the Torah as well, this is comparable to a body that is sitting in the darkness without the soul of man, the light of God, illuminating within it, such that the body is dry and does not breathe in</b> anything <b>from the source of life etc.</b>
<b>“Thus, the Torah scholar who engages in the Torah for its own sake must first engage in the wisdom of the Bible, Mishna, and Talmud, as much as his intellect can bear, and then engage in knowing his Creator through the true wisdom</b> of Kabbala<b>, as King David (may he rest in peace) commanded his son Solomon: “Know the God of your father, and serve Him”</b> (I Chronicles 28:9).
<b>“If this man finds Talmudic analysis weighty and difficult, the best thing for him would be to rest his hands from it, after having tested his portion in this wisdom, and</b> he should <b>engage in the true wisdom</b> of Kabbala<b>. This is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “From here</b> it is derived that <b>a student who did not see a positive indication in his studies</b> after <b>five years will no longer see</b> it” <b>(<i>Ḥullin</i> 24a). However, any man for whom</b> Talmudic <b>analysis is easy must devote a portion of an hour or two hours a day for the study of halakha, and set in order and resolve the difficulties that arise with respect to the plain halakha.”</b> The citation of <b>his holy statements, word-for-word, concludes here.</b>
<b>20. Now, his comments appear to be highly puzzling, for he says that before succeeding in the study of the revealed</b> Torah <b>one should go and engage in the true wisdom</b> of Kabbala<b>, which contradicts his own previous statement that the wisdom of the Kabbala without the revealed Torah is like “a soul without a body, which has no reward, or action, or designs.”</b>
<b>The proof that he cites, from</b> the teaching regarding <b>a student who did not see a positive indication etc., is even more puzzling. Did the Sages say that for this reason one should set aside the study of Torah, God forbid? Rather,</b> they <b>certainly</b> intended <b>to warn him to examine his ways, and to try</b> studying <b>with a different teacher, or another tractate, but</b> they <b>undoubtedly</b> were <b>not</b> advising him <b>to abandon the Torah, God forbid,</b> not <b>even the revealed Torah.</b>
<b>21.</b> There is <b>another difficulty,</b> which applies <b>both to the statement of Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital and the teaching of the Talmud. They both imply that a person requires some sort of preparation and special excellence in order to merit the wisdom of the Torah. But the Sages stated (in <i>Midrash Rabba</i>, <i>Parashat Vezot HaBerakha</i> 11:6): “The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: On your lives, all of the wisdom and all of the Torah is a light matter; anyone who fears Me and performs the words of</b> the <b>Torah, all of the wisdom and all of the Torah is in his heart.” There is thus no requirement here for any prior excellence, but rather one can merit all the wisdom of the Torah through only the special quality of fearing God and fulfilling the mitzvot.</b>
<b>22. However, if we pay close attention to his words, they will become clarified before us “like the very heaven for clearness”</b> (Exodus 24:10). <b>When he writes</b> that <b>“the best thing for him would be to refrain from it, after testing his portion in this wisdom,” this is not referring to the portion of acumen and expertise. Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>as we explained above, in</b> the <b>interpretation of</b> the saying <b>“I created the evil inclination</b> but <B>I</b> also <b>created the Torah</b> as <b>an antidote.” That is, he labored and toiled in the revealed Torah and yet the evil inclination retains its full strength and has not melted</b> away <b>at all, for he is still not spared from thoughts of transgression, as Rashi stated above</b> (see section 17) <b>in</b> his <b>commentary on</b> the phrase <b>“I created the Torah</b> as <b>an antidote”; see there.</b>
Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital <b>therefore advises him to refrain from</b> the study of the revealed Torah <b>and engage in the true wisdom</b> of Kabbala<b>, for it is easier to draw forth the light within the Torah by engaging and toiling in the true wisdom than</b> to attain this end <b>by toiling in the revealed Torah. The reason is very simple. The wisdom of the revealed Torah is enclothed in external, physical garments, that is,</b> the laws of <b>robbery, theft, damages, and the like, on account of which it is difficult and a very weighty</b> matter <b>for any person to focus his mind and heart on God when engaged</b> in such topics, <b>in order to draw forth the light within the Torah. All the more so for a man like this, for whom Talmudic analysis is itself weighty and difficult.</b>
<b>How can he also keep his mind on God while studying? Since the study</b> of the revealed Torah <b>deals with material subjects, they cannot come together in his</b> mind <b>with the focus on God at the same time, God forbid.</b> Rabbi Vital <b>therefore advises him to engage in the wisdom of the Kabbala, as this wisdom is entirely clothed in the names of the Holy One blessed be He. Then he will of course be able to focus his mind and heart on God while studying, without</b> any special <b>effort, even if the study is extremely difficult, for the study of topics of the</b> true <b>wisdom and God are one. This is very obvious.</b>
<b>23. He therefore cites a fine proof from the statement of the Talmud, “from here</b> it is derived that <b>a student who did not see a positive indication in his studies</b> after <b>five years will no longer see</b> it.” <b>Why did he fail to see a positive indication in his studies? This can only be on account of a lack of the heart’s intent, not due to a lack of talent in this</b> regard, <b>as the wisdom of the Torah does not require any</b> special <b>talent, but rather</b> it is accessible to all, <b>as written in that aforementioned Midrash (cited in section 21): “The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: On your lives, all of the wisdom and all of the Torah is a light matter; anyone who fears Me and performs the words of</b> the <b>Torah, all of the wisdom and all of the Torah is in his heart.”</b>
<b>But one certainly requires time in order to accustom himself to the light that is within the Torah and mitzvot, and does not know how much</b> time is needed. <b>A person can</b> remain in a state of <b>anticipation for this throughout his seventy years</b> of life. <b>Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> warns us that one should not anticipate for more than five years, and Rabbi Yosei says only three years (see <i>Ḥullin</i> 24a).</b> This <b>is entirely sufficient for meriting the wisdom of the Torah,</b>
<b>and if one did not see a positive indication in such a period of time, he should not fool himself with false hopes and vain promises. Rather, he should know that he will never see a positive indication. Consequently, he should soon try to find some fine strategy for himself by means of which he will succeed in coming</b> to a state of Torah study <b>for its own sake, and he will</b> thereby <b>merit the wisdom of the Torah.</b>
<b>The <i>baraita</i> does not clarify what</b> this <b>strategy</b> should be, <b>but</b> simply <b>warns that one should not remain in that state and wait any longer.</b>
<b>This is</b> why <b>the rabbi says that the most successful and assured strategy for him is to engage in the wisdom of the Kabbala, while entirely refraining from dealing with the wisdom of the revealed Torah, for he has already tested his portion in this</b> area <b>without success.</b> Instead, <b>he should devote all of his time to the wisdom of the Kabbala, which is an assured</b> route <b>to his success, for the reason clarified above; see there.</b>
<b>24. It is very obvious that this</b> lessening of the study of the revealed Torah <b>is not at all referring to the study of the revealed Torah for what is necessary to know</b> the <b>practical halakha.</b> This is obvious because <b>“an ignoramus cannot be a pious individual”</b> (<i>Avot</i> 5:2), <b>and “a mistake in the Talmud is tantamount to a willful transgression”</b> (<i>Avot</i> 4:13), <b>and “one sinner destroys much good”</b> (<i>Ecclesiastes</i> 9:18). <b>One is therefore obligated to review</b> the revealed Torah and its practical rulings <b>as many times as it takes for him not to stumble in practice.</b>
<b>Rather, all that is referred to here</b> by Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital <b>is only</b> the reduction of <b>the study of the revealed Torah to set in order and resolve the difficulties that arise with respect to the plain halakhot, as Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital himself concludes there. That is,</b> he is speaking of that <b>part of the study of the Torah which does not lead to practice, and not the practical halakhot at all.</b>
Further, <b>it may be that one can be lenient in this</b> study of practical halakha<b>, to learn from summaries rather than from the</b> complete <b>sources.</b> However, <b>this</b> idea of not studying the full sources <b>requires further examination</b> to determine if it is correct<b>, because there is no comparison between</b> a person <b>who knows the halakha from the source to one who knows it from some survey or via a certain summary. In order that one should not make a mistake in this</b> regard, <b>Rabbi Ḥayyim Vital cited, at the very beginning of the passage,</b> the idea <b>that a soul is attached to a body only “when it is complete</b> and <b>rectified through the mitzvot of the Torah, through the 613 mitzvot.”</b>
<b>25. Now you can see how all the difficulties we raised at the start of the introduction are vanity of vanities. Indeed, they are the traps spread out by the evil inclination to ensnare innocent souls, in order to expel them from the world without mercy.</b>
<b>Let us look at the first difficulty, that</b> people <b>imagine they can fulfill the entire Torah even without knowing the wisdom of the Kabbala. I say to them: “Certainly, if you are able to fulfill</b> the requirement of <b>Torah study and the observance of the mitzvot in accordance with their halakhot, for</b> their <b>own sake, that is, solely in order to give satisfaction to the Creator, then you truly do not require the study of the Kabbala. In that case it is stated about you, ‘a person’s soul will teach him,’ since then all the secrets of the Torah are revealed to you like ‘an ever-increasing wellspring,’ in the words of Rabbi Meir (in Mishna <i>Avot</i> 6:1, cited in section 6), without you requiring help from the books</b> of Kabbala<b>.</b>
<b>“However, if you are still at the stage of engagement</b> with the Torah <b>not for its own sake, but you are hoping to merit through</b> that stage that you will eventually study Torah <b>for its own sake, I must then ask you how many years you have been engaging in</b> study <b>in this manner. If you are still within the five years stated by the first <i>tanna</i>, or within the three years according to Rabbi Yosei, you may still wait and hope.</b>
<b>But if you have been engaged in Torah</b> study <b>for more than three years according to Rabbi Yosei, or five years for the first <i>tanna</i>, the <i>baraita</i> warns you that you will no longer see a positive indication on this path along which you are treading. Why, then, should you delude yourselves with false hopes, when you have a strategy that is so accessible and assured as the study of the wisdom of the Kabbala, for the reason I established above, that the study of the topics of</b> this <b>wisdom is one and the same as</b> studying <b>God Himself. See</b> the <b>earlier</b> argument <b>(in section 22).</b>
<b>26. We can similarly examine the second difficulty, which is that</b> people <b>must first have their fill of the Talmud and the ruling authorities'</b> books before studying Kabbala. <b>Now this is certainly the case, for everyone agrees with this.</b>
<b>However, all this applies if you have already merited to study</b> Torah <b>for its own sake, or even not for its own sake</b> assuming <b>you are within</b> the <b>three or five years.</b>
<b>This is not the case after that period, for the <i>baraita</i> warns you that you can no longer</b> expect to <b>see a positive indication, as explained above. If so, you have to try to succeed</b> in reaching the level of study and mitzvot for their own sake through <b>the study of the Kabbala.</b>
<b>Two parts to the true wisdom: The secrets of the Torah, and the reasons of the Torah, which it is a mitzva to reveal</b><br><b>27. You must additionally know that there are two parts to the true wisdom</b> of Kabbala<b>:</b>
<b>The first is called the secrets of the Torah, which it is forbidden to reveal other than by means of allusion, directly from a Kabbala scholar to a recipient who can understand</b> the topic <b>of his own accord. The Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot</b> [<i>ma’aseh merkava</i>] <b>and the Act of Creation</b> [<i>ma’aseh bereshit</i>] <b>also belong to the part</b> of the secrets of the Torah. <b>The Sages of the <i>Zohar</i> call this part the</b> <b>first three</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>:</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> and <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>, and it is also called the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>.</b>
<b>The second part is called the reasons of the Torah, which it is permitted to reveal, and it is even a great mitzva to reveal</b> them. <b>In the <i>Zohar</i> this</b> part <b>is called the</b> <b>seven lower ones</b><b>,</b> the seven lower <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>, and it is also called the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>.There are ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>in every holy</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>, which are called</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Ḥesed</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Gevura</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Netzaḥ</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Hod</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yesod</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>. The</b> <b>first three</b> <b>of these</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>are called the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>, while the seven lower</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>are called the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>.</b>
<b>Even in the soul of the lower man there are these aspects of ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>with these same names, and likewise in every</b> <b>level</b><b>, both in the higher and lower</b> levels. <b>These topics, and the reasons for them, will be explained on in</b> this <b>book, God willing.</b>
<b>The reason why the seven lower</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>, which are the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>, are called the reasons of the Torah</b> is based <b>on the mystical meaning of the verse: “The palate tastes food”</b> (Job 12:11), and the word for "taste," <i>ta'am</i>, can also mean "reason." <b>The lights that are revealed below the</b> <b>first three</b> <i>sefirot</i>, <b>which are the mystical meaning of the</b> <b>head</b><b>, are called “reasons”</b> which is the same as the word "tastes" <b>while the</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is called “palate.” Because of this, these</b> lower seven <i>sefirot</i> <b>are called the "reasons"</b> or “tastes” <b>of the Torah, i.e., those that are revealed from the palate of the</b> <b>head</b><b>, and the</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is the source of all the tastes. There is no prohibition against revealing</b> the aspects <b>that are from</b> that <i>Malkhut</i> <b>and below; on the contrary, the reward of one who reveals them is limitless and immeasurable.</b>
<b>Thus, these</b> two categories, that of the <b>first three</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>and</b> that of the <b>seven lower</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>mentioned here, are distinct</b> from each <b>either.</b> This categorical distinction applies both <b>to the general</b> structure of reality <b>or to the smallest details</b> into which reality <b>can be divided. Thus, even the</b> <b>first three</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>at the bottom of the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>belong to the part</b> called <b>the secrets of the Torah which is prohibited to reveal.</b> Similarly, <b>the seven lower</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>in</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>belong to the part</b> called <b>the reasons of the Torah which is permitted to reveal. These ideas are well established in the works of the Kabbala.</b>
<b>28. The source for these ideas can be found in Tractate <i>Pesaḥim</i> (118b–119a), where it is stated: “It is written: ‘Her grain and her hire shall be consecrated to the Lord; it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her gain shall be for those who dwell before the Lord, to eat their fill, and for stately clothing</b> [<i>limekhaseh atik</i>]’ <b>(Isaiah 23:18) etc</b>. <b>What is</b> <i><b>limekhaseh atik</i>? This is one who conceals</b> [<i>mekhaseh</i>] <b>matters that the Ancient of Days</b> [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] <b>concealed. And what are these? The secrets of the Torah. And some say: This is one who reveals matters that the Ancient of Days concealed. And what are these? The reasons of</b> [<i>ta’amei</i>, the tastes of] <b>the Torah.”</b>
<b>Rashbam explains there as follows: “‘<i>Atik Yomin</i>’ is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is written: “And one who was ancient of days</b> [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] <b>was sitting” (Daniel 7:9). ‘The secrets of the Torah’ is the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot and the Act of Creation, and the explicit</b> pronunciation <b>of</b> God’s <b>name, as it is written: “This is My name forever” (Exodus 3:15)</b>. <b>‘And one who conceals’ is one who does not hand them over to every person, but</b> only <b>to one ‘whose heart is concerned,’ as is written in the second chapter of Tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i> (13a). ‘This is one who reveals matters that the Ancient of Days concealed.’ This is how</b> the exposition <b>should be understood: Regarding the concealed secrets of the Torah, which were initially concealed, and</b> then <b>the <i>Atik Yomin</i> revealed them and granted permission to reveal them, one who reveals them merits that which is stated in this verse.” This concludes the citation from</b> the commentary of the Rashbam.
<b>29. It is thus explicitly</b> stated <b>to you the significant distinction between the secrets of the Torah, in</b> which <b>one who attains them receives this great reward (detailed in the Talmud there, in</b> its <b>interpretation of the verse) for concealing them and not revealing them.</b>
<b>The opposite</b> is the case regarding <b>the reasons of the Torah, in</b> which <b>one who attains them receives this great reward for revealing them to others.</b>
<b>The second interpretation</b> in the Talmud beginning with "And some say" <b>does not contradict the first</b> interpretation<b>; rather, the interpretation of the meaning</b> of the verse <b>is</b> the <b>only</b> difference <b>between</b> them. According to <b>the first interpretation, the exposition focuses on the end of the verse, "stately clothing"</b> [<i>u’limekhaseh atik</i>] which also can be translated as "concealing the ancient," <b>and therefore the attainment of the great reward is explained in reference to concealing the secrets of the Torah.</b>
<b>In the second interpretation the exposition focuses on the earlier part of the verse, “to eat their fill,” which relates to the "tastes,"</b> which is the same as the word for "reasons" <b>of the Torah, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “The palate tastes food.” The</b> <b>lights</b> of the aspect of <i>Malkhut</i> called <b>tastes</b> [<i>ta’amim</i>] <b>are called “eating.” Consequently, the attainment of the great reward stated in the verse is explained in reference to one who reveals the reasons</b> or tastes <b>of the Torah.</b>
<b>However,</b> the author of <b>this</b> interpretation <b>and</b> the author of <b>that</b> interpretation both <b>maintain that the secrets of the Torah must be concealed, while the reasons of the Torah must be revealed.</b>
<b>30. You thus have a clear answer to the fourth and fifth difficulties that</b> were presented <b>at the beginning of the introduction. When you find in the statements of the Sages, and also in the holy books</b> about Kabbala<b>, that</b> the wisdom of the Kabbala <b>is handed down only to one whose heart is concerned etc., that</b> is referring to <b>that part which is called the secrets of the Torah, which is the aspect of the</b> <b>first three</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>, the aspect of the</b> <b>head</b><b>.</b> This aspect <b>may be handed down only to modest</b> individuals, <b>and under</b> certain <b>known conditions,</b> such <b>that in all the books of the Kabbala which have been written down and published you will not find even a trace of them, since these are the things that</b> God, <b>the Ancient of Days, concealed, as stated in the Talmud</b> cited <b>above.</b>
<b>On the contrary, you</b> yourself <b>should</b> ask <b>if it is possible to doubt or even imagine that</b> this injunction was violated by <b>all of these renowned holy and righteous</b> individuals, <b>who are the greatest of the nation, the highest of the highest.</b> These include the authors of <i><b>Sefer Yetzira</i>, the book of the <i>Zohar</i>, the <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Yishmael, Rav Hai Gaon, Rav Ḥamai Gaon, Rabbi Eleazar of Worms, the rest of the early authorities up to the Ramban, the <i>Ba’al HaTurim</i>, the author of the <i>Shulḥan Arukh</i>, until the Vilna Gaon, the Gaon</b> Rabbi Shneur Zalman <b>of Liadi, and the rest of the righteous people, may all of their memories be for a blessing. From</b> all these <b>the entire revealed Torah came forth to us and from</b> these <b>mouths</b> we heard the teachings on the basis of which <b>we live</b> our lives, <b>to know the work that we must do</b> in order <b>to find favor in the eyes of God. Now, all of these wrote and published books on the wisdom of the Kabbala, and you have no greater</b> method of <b>publicizing than writing a book, since the writer does not know who will peruse his book, as it is possible that</b> even <b>absolutely wicked</b> individuals <b>will look in it, God forbid, and thus you have no greater revelation of the secrets of the Torah than this.</b>
But <b>God forbid that one should speculate about these holy and pure</b> individuals <b>after their deaths that they would have violated even the slightest detail of that</b> about <b>which is explicitly written in the <i>mishnayot</i> and Talmud that it is prohibited to reveal</b> them, <b>as written in the second chapter of Tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i> (11b).</b>
<b>Rather, it must necessarily be the case that all the books written and published are of the aspect of the reasons of the Torah, which the Ancient of Days initially concealed and subsequently revealed, in the mystical meaning of</b> the verse: <b>“The palate tastes food.”</b> This is <b>as stated above, that</b> with regard to <b>these secrets, not only is there no prohibition to reveal them, but on the contrary, it is a great mitzva to reveal them (as stated above in section 28, citing <i>Pesaḥim</i> 119a). The reward of one who knows how to reveal</b> them <b>and does reveal them is extremely great, for the arrival of the righteous redeemer –</b> may he come <b>speedily in our days, Amen – depends on the revelation of these</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to the public, specifically to the public.</b>
<b>The reason why the arrival of the righteous redeemer depends on the spread of the study of the Kabbala amongst the public</b><br><b>31. It is very much necessary to explain once</b> and for all this idea <b>that is so emphasized in the <i>Zohar</i> and all the books of Kabbala:</b> Why does <b>the arrival of the righteous redeemer depend on the spread of the study of the Kabbala amongst the public? The masses,</b> meanwhile, <b>hang empty pitchers on it,</b> suggesting incorrect explanations <b>to an unbearable extent.</b>
<b>The meaning of this idea is explained in the</b> <i><b>Tikkunei Zohar</b></i> <b>(73b, <i>tikkun</i> 30, s.v., “<i>netiv tanina</i>”): “The second approach: ‘And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters’ (Genesis 1:2). What is ‘and the spirit’? Rather,</b> it is <b>certainly</b> the case <b>that when the Divine Presence descends into exile, this spirit rests upon those who engage in the Torah, on account of the Divine Presence that is found amongst them etc.</b>
<b>“‘All flesh is grass’ – they are all like animals that eat grass; ‘and all its kindness is like the flower of the field’ (Isaiah 40:6) – all the kindness they perform, they perform for themselves etc. and even all those who toil in the Torah, all the kindness they perform, they perform for themselves.</b>
<b>“At that time, ‘He remembered that they were but flesh, a spirit that passes away and does not come again’ (Psalms 78:39) forever, and this is the spirit of the Messiah. Woe to those who cause him to leave the world and not to return to the world. It is these who make the Torah dry, and who do not wish to toil in the wisdom of the Kabbala, who cause the wellspring of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>to depart, of which it is</b> the letter <i><b>yod</b></i> representing <i>Ḥokhma</i> <b>etc. This spirit that departs is the spirit of the Messiah, and it is the divine spirit, and it is ‘the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord’</b> (Isaiah 11:2).
<b>“The second commandment: ‘And God said, let there be light, and there was light’ (Genesis 1:3). This love, which is the love of kindness, is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: ‘I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with affection have I drawn you’ (Jeremiah 31:2). With regard to this it is stated: ‘That you do not awaken or stir up love until it pleases etc.’” (Song of Songs 2:7),</b> i.e., <b>love and fear, which are its essence, whether</b> for <b>good or evil. For this reason this fear and love is called ‘on the condition of receiving a reward’ (<i>Avot</i> 1:3). For this reason the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field, that you do not awaken or stir up love until it pleases,’ which is love without a reward and not on the condition of receiving a reward.</b> This is <b>because fear and love on the condition of receiving a reward is</b> the service <b>of a maidservant, and ‘for three things the earth quakes etc. for a servant when he reigns</b>…<b>and a handmaid who inherits her mistress’ (Proverbs 30:21–23).”</b>
<b>32. We shall start to explain</b> this section of <b>the</b> <i><b>Tikkunei Zohar</b></i><b>, in reverse order.</b> The <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> <b>states that</b> if <b>the fear and love a person has when engaging in the Torah and the mitzvot</b> is <b>on the condition of receiving a reward, that is,</b> that <b>he hopes that some good will develop for him on account of the Torah and the service,</b> this service <b>is of the aspect of</b> the service of <b>a maidservant. Regarding</b> this kind of service <b>it is written: “And a handmaid who is heir to her mistress.” T</b>his is <b>apparently difficult: Since we maintain that “a person should always engage in Torah</b> study and the performance of <b>mitzvot, even if not for</b> their <b>own sake” (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 50b), why would the “earth quake”</b> for this kind of service<b>? Another</b> thing <b>that needs to be understood is the issue of the relationship between engaging</b> in the <b>Torah not for its own sake and this specific aspect of maidservant</b> to which it is being related. <b>The phrase “who inherits her mistress” also</b> requires clarification: <b>What inheritance is there here?</b>
<b>33. You will understand this idea through all that has been explained earlier in this introduction.</b> It was explained that <b>engaging</b> in the <b>Torah not for its own sake is permitted only because “through</b> the performance of mitzvot <b>not for</b> their <b>own sake,</b> one <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake,” as the light within</b> this divine service <b>restores him to the right</b> path.
<b>Therefore, engaging</b> in the <b>Torah not for its own sake is considered</b> akin to <b>a maidservant who helps by performing the menial tasks for her mistress, which</b> in this case <b>is the holy Divine Presence.</b> Such a person <b>will ultimately reach the aspect of “for its own sake,” and</b> then he will <b>merit the resting of the Divine Presence</b> upon himself<b>. Then the maidservant, which is the aspect of engaging</b> in the <b>Torah not for its own sake, will also be considered a maidservant of holiness, for she helps and prepares the holiness. But she is described as</b> being of <b>the aspect of the holy</b> side of <b>the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>.</b>
<b>If, however,</b> a person's <b>faith is incomplete, God forbid, and he engages in the Torah and service only because God commanded him to study, it has already been explained above that through such Torah</b> study <b>and service the</b> <b>light</b> his service <b>contains will not be revealed at all, for his eyes are impaired and they transform the</b> <b>light</b> <b>into darkness, like a bat, as stated above</b> in section 15. <b>This kind of engagement</b> in Torah <b>has already left the domain of a maidservant of holiness, for it will not merit to come</b> to a state of engaging in Torah <b>for its own sake, God forbid, and</b> his divine service <b>therefore comes to the domain of the maidservant of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i><b>, which inherits this Torah and service and exploits them for itself.</b>
<b>This is why the earth quakes, that is, the holy Divine Presence, which is called “earth,” as is known (see, for example, <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Behar</i>, 17), because that Torah and service which should have come into the possession of the holy Divine Presence, are exploited by that evil maidservant which brings them down into the possession of the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i><b>. Thus, the maidservant “inherits her mistress,” God forbid.</b>
<b>34. The</b> <i><b>Tikkunei Zohar</b></i> also <b>explains the mystical meaning of the oath “that you do not awaken or stir up love until it pleases.”</b> The divine <b>insistence</b> here <b>is that Israel draw forth the supernal</b> <i><b>Ḥesed</b></i> <b>that is called “love of kindness,” since that is what “pleases.” This is drawn forth specifically by engaging in Torah and mitzvot not on the condition of receiving a reward.</b>
<b>The reason is that through the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of this kindness Israel draws forth the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of supernal</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>that is revealed and enclothed in this</b> <b>light of <i>Ḥesed</i></b> <b>that Israel drew forth. This</b> <b>light of <i>Ḥokhma</i></b> <b>is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord” (Isaiah 11:2), which is said about the King Messiah, as it is stated in the continuation there: “And He will set up an ensign for the nations, and will assemble the dispersed of Israel, and gather together the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth” (Isaiah 11:12).</b>
<b>After Israel draws forth, by means of the</b> <b>light of <i>Ḥesed</i></b><b>, the</b> <b>light of <i>Ḥokhma</i></b><b>, in the mystical meaning of “the spirit of wisdom and understanding etc.,” then the Messiah will be revealed and he will gather the dispersed of Israel etc.</b><br><b>Thus, everything depends on engaging in the Torah and service for its own sake, which is designed to draw forth the great</b> <b>light of <i>Ḥesed</i></b> <b>within which the</b> <b>light of <i>Ḥokhma</i></b> <b>is</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>and drawn forth. This is the mystical meaning of the oath “that you do not awaken or stir up etc.,” for the complete redemption and ingathering of the exiles is impossible without</b> this process<b>, because the channels of holiness are arranged in this manner.</b>
<b>35. This is</b> the meaning of the <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>’s <b>further interpretation: “‘And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.’ What is ‘and the spirit’? Rather,</b> it is <b>certainly</b> the case <b>that when the Divine Presence descends into exile, this spirit rests on those who engage in the Torah, on account of the Divine Presence that is found amongst them.”</b>
<b>The meaning is</b> as follows: <b>During the exile, when Israel are still engaging in Torah and mitzvot not for its own sake, if they are nonetheless</b> doing so <b>in the aspect of:</b> “<b>Since through</b> the performance of Torah and mitzvot <b>not for</b> their <b>own sake,</b> one <b>comes</b> to perform them <b>for</b> their <b>own sake,” the Divine Presence is</b> indeed <b>among them. But</b> it is only among them <b>in the aspect of exile, because</b> their service <b>has not yet come</b> to the state of <b>“for its own sake,” as stated above with regard to the mystical meaning of the maidservant of holiness.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning <b>of</b> the <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>’s <b>statement: “On account of the Divine Presence that is found amongst them,” i.e.,</b> the Divine Presence is <b>in</b> a state of <b>concealment</b> among them<b>. Ultimately, however, they will merit the revelation of the Divine Presence. At that time, the spirit of the King Messiah will hover over those who are engaged</b> in the Torah <b>and will “stir” them to come</b> to the state of <b>“for its own sake,” in the mystical meaning of “the light within it restores them to the right</b> path.” This light <b>helps and prepares the</b> people for the <b>resting of the Divine Presence</b> upon them<b>, which is</b> the meaning of "<b>her mistress."</b>
<b>However, if this engagement</b> in the Torah <b>not for its own sake is not suitable to bring them</b> to the state of <b>“for its own sake,” God forbid, for the reasons mentioned above, then the Divine Presence suffers and declares: “All flesh is grass – they are all like animals that eat grass.” That is, there is not found amongst those who engage in the Torah that spirit of man which ascends upwards. Rather, they are satisfied with the animal spirit that descends downwards.</b>
<b>The reason is explained there, because “all its kindness is like the flower of the field – even all those who toil in the Torah, all the kindness they perform, they perform for themselves." In other words, all their engagement in Torah and mitzvot is for their own advantage and benefit, and</b> thus <b>the engagement in Torah is incapable of bringing them</b> to the state of <b>“for its own sake,” God forbid.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning <b>of</b> the <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>’s ensuing <b>statement: “At that time, ‘He remembered that they were but flesh, a spirit that passes away and does not come again’ forever, and this is the spirit of the Messiah.” That is, the spirit of the Messiah does not hover over them, but rather it goes away from them and will not return. This is because the maidservant of impurity exploits their Torah and inherits the mistress, as explained above, because they are not on the path of coming from</b> a state of <b>“not for its own sake” to the aspect of “for its own sake,” as stated earlier.</b>
The <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> <b>therefore infers there: “It is these who make the Torah dry, and who do not wish to toil in the wisdom of the Kabbala.” The meaning is</b> as follows: <b>Although they do not succeed through engagement in the revealed Torah – because it contains no light and is dry, on account of the smallness of their minds (as stated in section 15 above) – they can nevertheless succeed through engagement in the study of the Kabbala.</b> This is <b>because the light within</b> the study of Kabbala <b>is</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the garments of the Holy One blessed be He, that is, the holy names and the</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>.</b> Through these, <b>they could easily come to the aspect of “not for its own sake” that brings them to “for its own sake.”</b>
<b>Then the spirit of God would hover over them, in the mystical meaning of “the light within it restores them to the right</b> path.” <b>However, they have no interest whatsoever in the study of the Kabbala, and this is</b> why <b>it is written: “Woe to them, for they cause poverty, destruction, plunder, slaughter, and devastation in the world. This spirit that departs is the spirit of the Messiah, as it is taught that it is</b> the spirit of <b>divine insight, and it is ‘the spirit of wisdom and understanding etc.’”</b>
<b>36. The resulting</b> understanding <b>from the words of the <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> is that there is an oath that the</b> <b>light of giving</b> <b>and love in the world will not be awakened until the actions of Israel involving the Torah and mitzvot will be</b> performed <b>with the intent not to receive a reward, but only to give satisfaction to the Creator. This is the mystical meaning of the oath: “I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, etc.”</b>
<b>Thus, the whole lengthy exile and the sufferings that we bear are dependent</b> upon our actions <b>and wait for us to merit to engage in the Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake. If we would only merit that, this</b> <b>light of giving</b> <b>and love would immediately awaken, which is designed to draw forth the mystical meaning of the verse: “And</b> the spirit of the Lord <b>shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding etc.,” and then we will merit the complete redemption.</b>
<b>It has also been explained that it is impossible for all Israel to come to this great</b> state of <b>purity other than by studying the Kabbala, which is the easiest method,</b> and is <b>sufficient even for those of small minds.</b>
<b>This is not the case for the method of engaging in the revealed Torah alone: Only special individuals can merit</b> that state <b>through</b> the study of the revealed Torah<b>, and</b> only then <b>by means of great effort, but</b> this is <b>not</b> possible <b>for the majority of the people, for the reason explained above (beginning of section 22). This thoroughly explains the nullity of the fourth and fifth difficulties that</b> were presented <b>at the beginning of the introduction.</b>
<b>37.</b> As for <b>the third difficulty, which</b> is a person’s <b>fear that he might go astray</b> through the study of Kabbala<b>, there is no</b> basis for <b>fear or anything of the kind here. This is because</b> people’s <b>going astray from the path of God, which did happen on occasion, God forbid, was due to</b> one of <b>two reasons:</b>
<b>Either they violated the statement of the Sages regarding those</b> things <b>it is prohibited to reveal,</b>
<b>or because they took the words of the Kabbala by their external meaning, that is, in</b> their <b>corporeal sense, and they</b> thereby <b>transgressed</b> the command: <b>“You shall not make for you a graven image or any manner of likeness” (Exodus 20:3). Consequently, there has indeed been a fortified wall surrounding</b> this <b>wisdom to this day, for many tried and began</b> its <b>study but were unable to continue with it due to a lack of understanding and on account of the</b> seemingly <b>physical terms.</b>
<b>For this reason I made</b> great <b>efforts in</b> my <b>commentaries <i>Panim Me’irot</i> and <i>Panim Masbirot</i> to interpret the Arizal’s great work <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i>, and to abstract the physical forms and establish them in accordance with spiritual laws,</b> which are <b>above time and space.</b> This was done <b>such that every beginner could understand the ideas along with their reasons and justifications, with a clear mind and in</b> a manner of <b>great simplicity, no less than how</b> a passage of <b>Talmud is understood by means of Rashi’s commentary.</b>
<b>Clarifications of “Torah for its own sake” – “I have labored and have found” – the concealed teachings of the Torah</b><br><b>38. Let us further elaborate on the obligation to engage in Torah and mitzvot for</b> their <b>own sake, which I</b> already <b>began to discuss. Now,</b> one <b>must understand this title of “Torah for its own sake”: Why is the perfect, desired service called by this name, “for its own sake,” and the service that is not desired is called “not for its own sake”?</b>
<b>According to the plain meaning, that one who engages in Torah and mitzvot must direct his heart towards giving satisfaction to his Creator, and not for his own good, this should have been called and defined as “Torah for His sake,” and “Torah not for His sake,” meaning for the sake of Heaven.</b>
<b>Why is it</b> instead <b>defined as “for its own sake,” and “not for its own sake,” which means for the sake of the Torah?</b>
<b>Rather, it must be that there is a higher</b> level of <b>understanding than that which is stated</b> above. <b>The language proves that Torah for His sake, meaning to give satisfaction to his Creator, is as yet insufficient, but rather the engagement must also be “for its own sake,” that is, for the sake of the Torah</b> itself. <b>This requires elucidation.</b>
<b>39. The idea is that the name of the Torah, as is known, is “the Torah of life.” As it is stated, “For they are life to those who find them etc.” (Proverbs 4:22), and the verse likewise states: “For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life etc.” (Deuteronomy 32:47). Accordingly, the meaning of “Torah for its own sake” is that the engagement in Torah and mitzvot leads one to life and length of days, since then the Torah fits its name.</b>
<b>One who does not focus his heart and mind on the context</b> of his studies will <b>find that engaging in Torah and mitzvot will bring him</b> to <b>the opposite of life and length of days, God forbid. This is the ultimate “not for its own sake</b>," literally <i>lo lishma</i>, not ‘for its own name’,” <b>since its name is “the Torah of life.” Understand this.</b>
<b>These</b> ideas <b>are explicitly formulated in the words of the Sages (<i>Ta’anit</i> 7a): “Anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake, it becomes an elixir of death for him. And anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will become an elixir of life for him.”</b>
<b>However, their words require</b> further <b>explanation,</b> in order <b>to understand how and in what</b> manner <b>the holy Torah becomes an elixir of death for</b> such a person<b>. Is it not enough that he toils for nothing and in vain, and he receives no advantage from his toil and effort, God forbid, that</b> in addition <b>the Torah and service itself must also be transformed for him into an elixir of death? This is a highly perplexing idea.</b>
<b>40. Let us first understand a statement of the Sages</b> cited earlier, <b>that they said:</b> “If someone says, <b>I have labored and I have found</b> success, <b>believe</b> him; but if he says, <b>I have not labored but</b> nevertheless <b>I have found</b> success, <b>do not believe</b> him” <b>(<i>Megilla</i> 6b). A difficulty can be raised regarding the wording “I have labored and I have found,” since this</b> wording <b>appears to be two contradictory.</b>
<b>“Laboring” involves</b> the <b>work and toil that one</b> is willing to <b>invest as the price for any desired acquisition. On behalf of an important acquisition one invests much labor, while on behalf of a lesser acquisition one invests a smaller</b> amount of <b>labor.</b>
<b>The opposite is</b> true of <b>a “found”</b> thing <b>which typically comes to a person</b> when he is in a <b>completely unfocused</b> state, <b>without any preparation of toil, labor, or price.</b>
<b>If so, how can one say “I have labored and I have found.” If there is labor here, it should have said “I have labored and I have acquired,” or “I have labored and I have merited,” or something similar, not “I have labored and I have found.”</b>
<b>41. Now, it is taught in the <i>Zohar</i>, on the verse: “Those who seek Me earnestly shall find Me” (Proverbs 8:17),</b> that the Sages <b>asked with regard to this</b> verse: <b>Where can God be found, and they said</b> in response <b>that He can be found only in the Torah. They likewise said on the verse: “Truly, You are a God who hides Yourself”</b> (Isaiah 45:15), <b>that the Holy One blessed be He hides Himself in the holy Torah.</b>
<b>These statements must be understood properly. It would appear that the Holy One blessed be He is concealed only by the objects and dynamics of the physical</b> world, <b>and in all the vanities of this world that are outside the Torah. How can</b> one <b>say the opposite, that He hides Himself only in the Torah?</b>
<b>Also,</b> on <b>a</b> more <b>general level, why does the Holy One blessed be He need to conceal Himself in such a manner that it is necessary to seek Him out? Likewise,</b> the statement <b>“that all who seek Me shall find Me,” which is the inference from the verse: “Those who seek Me earnestly shall find Me,” must be thoroughly understood. What is the nature of this seeking out, and the nature of this finding, and why are they</b> necessary?
<b>The reason for the distance from God – the lack of open Providence</b><br><b>42. However, you must know that the reason for all this distancing,</b> i.e., <b>that we are so distanced from God, and the fact that we have such a tendency to violate His will, is for one reason alone, which has become the source for all the pains and sufferings that we bear, and all the willing and unwilling</b> transgressions <b>upon which we are continually stumbling, God forbid.</b>
<b>Together with this</b> idea it will be <b>understood that once this reason has been removed,</b> we <b>will immediately be rid of all sorrow and all pain, and</b> we <b>will merit to cleave to Him with total heart, soul, and strength. I say to you that this initial reason is none other than “our limited understanding of His Providence over His creatures,” that</b> is, because <b>we do not understand Him properly.</b>
<b>43. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the Holy One blessed be He would treat His creatures in</b> the manner of <b>revealed Providence, such that for example anyone who ate something forbidden would instantly choke on the spot, while anyone who performed a mitzva would find a wonderful pleasure therein, similar to all of the finest pleasures in this physical world.</b>
<b>In that case, who would be</b> so <b>foolish as to even contemplate tasting something forbidden when he knows that he would immediately forfeit his life on its account, just as he does not contemplate jumping into a fire.</b>
<b>Similarly, who would be</b> so <b>foolish as to leave aside any mitzva without immediately fulfilling it with all haste, just as he is unable to abstain or delay</b> enjoying <b>a great physical pleasure</b> when the opportunity <b>comes to hand, without taking it instantly, with all the haste he can muster.</b>
<b>Thus, if there was revealed Providence before us, all the inhabitants of the world would be completely righteous.</b>
<b>44. You can thus observe that we lack nothing in our world other than revealed Providence. If we had revealed Providence, all the inhabitants of the world would be completely righteous, and they would also cleave to God with absolute love, because it would certainly be a great honor for each one of us to adulate and love Him with a whole heart and soul, and to cleave to Him constantly, without losing even a moment.</b>
<b>However, that is not the case, but rather “there is no reward for a mitzva in this world” (<i>Kiddushin</i> 39b). Likewise, those who transgress His will are not punished before our sight at all; instead, God is patient with them, and what is more, it sometimes appears to us that the opposite</b> is the case, <b>God forbid, as it is written: “Behold, such are the wicked, and they who are always at ease increase riches etc.” (Psalms 73:12).</b>
<b>Therefore, “not everyone who wishes to assume the reputation</b> of a God-fearing person <b>may come and assume</b> it” <b>(<i>Berakhot</i> 16b); rather, we stumble at each and every step, God forbid, like the Sages said (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 2:1) on the verse: “One man among a thousand I have found” (Ecclesiastes 7:28), that one thousand enter</b> a study <b>room and one</b> alone <b>emerges</b> fit <b>to</b> issue halakhic <b>rulings.</b>
<b>Thus, the understanding of His Providence is the cause of all good, while</b> its <b>misunderstanding is the cause of all evil. Consequently, it is the fulcrum upon which all the inhabitants of the world turn, whether for correction or for mercy.</b>
<b>Four levels of grasping Providence, and the service practiced in these times</b><br><b>45. When we reflect carefully on the grasp of Providence that can be sensed by people, we find that they are of four types. Each type receives its own special Divine Providence, such that there are four aspects to the grasping of Providence, although in truth they are only two: The concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance and the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance.</b>
<b>However, they divide into four, for there are two aspects of Providence</b> in the aspect <b>of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, namely “one concealment,” and “a concealment within a concealment.”</b>
Likewise, there are <b>two aspects of Providence</b> in the aspect <b>of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, which are Providence of reward and punishment, and Providence of eternity, as will be explained below, God willing.</b>
<b>46. Now, the verse states: “Then My anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say on that day: Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? And I will surely hide My face on that day for all the evil which they have done, for they turned to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:17–18).</b>
<b>When you examine this passage you will find that it is initially written: “Then My anger shall be kindled etc. and I will hide My face etc.,” which is one concealment, and it is subsequently written: “And many evils and troubles shall come upon them etc. and I will surely hide My face,” which is a double concealment. The nature of this double concealment must be understood.</b>
<b>47. First of all, let us understand the meaning of the countenance of God, regarding which the verse states “and I will hide My face.” Understand</b> that <b>this is similar to</b> how <b>a person, when he sees his friend’s face, instantly recognizes him, which is not the case if he sees him from behind, for then he is not sure about his identification, and he might be uncertain</b> as to whether that person <b>might</b> in fact <b>be someone else, rather than his friend.</b>
<b>The same</b> applies <b>to the issue before us, for everyone knows and senses that God is good, and it is the way of the good to bestow good. Accordingly, when God goes and bestows good upon His creatures that He created, commensurate with His generosity, it is discernable that His face is revealed to His creatures.</b> It is <b>then</b> that <b>everyone knows and recognizes Him, since He is acting as befits His name, as explained above with regard to the issue of revealed Providence; see there.</b>
<b>48. When, however, He acts with His creatures in the opposite manner to that described</b> above, <b>that is, at a time when they receive suffering and pain in His world, this is considered the “backside” of God. His “face” i.e., His attribute of perfect goodness, is entirely concealed from them, because this</b> manner of <b>acting does not befit His name.</b>
<b>This is comparable to one who sees his friend from behind, who might harbor doubts and think</b> that <b>he might be someone else. This is</b> the meaning <b>of the verse: “Then My anger shall be kindled etc. and I will hide My face from them etc.” At a time of anger, when the creatures receive troubles and pains, the Holy One blessed be He is hiding His countenance which is His attribute of perfect goodness, and only His backside is revealed. Then one has to strengthen himself greatly in his faith in God in order to ward off thoughts of transgression, God forbid, since it is hard to recognize Him from behind, as explained. This is called “one concealment.”</b>
<b>49. However, due to the extreme measure of increase in troubles and pain, God forbid, a double concealment is caused, which in the</b> source <b>books is called “a concealment within a concealment.” This means that not even His “back side” is visible, God forbid. In other words,</b> people <b>do not believe that God is angry with them and is punishing them,</b> but <b>rather they attribute</b> their misfortunes <b>to chance and nature, and</b> thus <b>come to deny His providence, God forbid,</b> in its expression <b>in</b> the form of <b>reward and punishment. This is</b> the meaning <b>of the verse: “And I will surely hide My face etc., for they turned to other gods,” that is, they come to</b> a state of <b>heresy and turn to idolatry, God forbid.</b>
<b>50. In contrast, there is</b> a different phrase <b>before this</b> point in the passage, <b>where the verse speaks only of one concealment,</b> and there <b>the verse concludes: “So that they will say on that day: Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?” In other words, they still believe in</b> divine <b>providence through reward and punishment, and they say that the troubles and sufferings are coming upon them because they did not cleave to Him, as it is written:</b> “Have not <b>these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?” This illustrates that they can still see God, but only from behind. It is therefore called “one concealment,” i.e., only the concealment of</b> God’s <b>face.</b>
<b>51. Thus, the two aspects of the</b> possible <b>perceptions of concealed providence that people can sense have been clarified, namely “one concealment,” and “a concealment within a concealment.”</b>
<b>The first kind of concealment means only the concealment of</b> God’s <b>face, while the</b> divine <b>back side is revealed to</b> people. <b>In other words,</b> in this kind of concealment, people <b>believe that God brought the sufferings upon them as a punishment.</b> Such people <b>find it difficult to recognize God consistently through</b> the aspect of <b>His “back side,” as explained above,</b> and <b>this</b> lack of recognition <b>causes them to transgress. Even so,</b> despite the difficulties they face, <b>they are</b> still <b>called incompletely wicked. That is, these transgressions are like unwitting</b> sins, <b>for they arrived at them due to the many sufferings</b> they underwent, <b>since they generally believe in reward and punishment, as stated.</b>
<b>52.</b> In the case of <b>“a concealment within a concealment,” which means that even the “back side” of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is concealed from them – because they do not believe in reward and punishment, as mentioned above – the transgressions they have</b> performed <b>are regarded as willing</b> sins, <b>and they are called completely wicked.</b> This is <b>because they commit heresy by saying that God has no providence over His creatures at all, and they turn to idol worship, as it is written: “for they turned to other gods,” God forbid.</b>
<b>53. You must understand that the whole concept of</b> divine <b>service that is practiced through the fulfillment of the Torah and the mitzvot by way of</b> a person’s free <b>choice, primarily operates within</b> these <b>two aforementioned levels of concealed providence. Regarding this stage</b> of existence, when divine service is performed in an environment of concealment, <b>Ben Heh Heh said: “In accordance with the pain is the reward” (<i>Avot</i>, end of chapter 5).</b>
God’s <b>providence is not revealed, and He can be seen only through</b> the <b>concealment of</b> His <b>countenance, like one who sees his friend from behind, who might harbor doubts and think</b> that <b>he might be someone else.</b> Because of this concealment, <b>the choice is always in the hands of man, whether to fulfill</b> God’s <b>will or to violate His will, God forbid.</b>
<b>The troubles and pains</b> a person <b>receives bring him to the</b> state of <b>doubt in the existence of the providence</b> of God <b>over His creatures, as stated, whether in the first aspect</b> of concealment<b>, which are</b> considered like <b>unwitting</b> transgressions, <b>or God forbid in the second aspect, which are</b> considered <b>willing</b> transgressions; <b>see there.</b>
<b>In either</b> state of concealment<b>,</b> the person <b>is in</b> a state of <b>great pain and heavy toil, and with respect to this period the verse states: “Whatever your hand attains to do with your strength, that you should do etc.” (Ecclesiastes 9:10).</b> The person <b>will not merit the revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance, which means the complete measure of His goodness, before he makes the effort to do everything that he has the ability and power to do, and “in accordance with the pain is the reward.”</b>
<b>54. Repentance out of fear and the intermediate level in attaining the revelation of</b> divine <b>countenance</b><br><b>However, when God sees that a person has completed his</b> requisite <b>measure of toil and has finished all that he had to do with the power of his choice and the strengthening of</b> his <b>faith in God, then God helps him and he merits to attain the revealing of</b> divine <b>providence, that is, the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance.</b>
<b>He then merits complete repentance, meaning that he "returns" and cleaves to God with all</b> his <b>heart, soul, and might, as</b> this repentance <b>is drawn down of its own accord, due to</b> his <b>attainment of the revelation of</b> divine <b>providence.</b>
<b>55. Now, this attainment</b> of the revelation of divine providence <b>and this repentance stated</b> above <b>come to a person in two levels. The first is the attainment of the providence of absolute reward and punishment: Apart</b> from the fact <b>that he attains</b> comprehension <b>with a clear grasp</b> of <b>the reward of every mitzva in the World to Come, he also merits to attain the wonderful delight that is instantly</b> enjoyed <b>at the time of the fulfillment of a mitzva in this world. Similarly, apart</b> from the way <b>that he attains</b> comprehension of <b>the bitter punishment of every transgression after his death, he also merits to sense the bitter taste of every transgression even while he is still living.</b>
<b>Needless to say, one who attains this revelation of providence will be certain within himself that he will sin no more, just like a person is certain about himself that he will not cut off</b> one <b>of his limbs and</b> thereby <b>cause himself terrible suffering. He is also certain about himself that he will not leave aside</b> any <b>mitzva without immediately fulfilling it when</b> the opportunity <b>comes to hand, just as a person is sure that he would not leave aside any pleasure of this world, or</b> opportunity for <b>great benefit, that comes to his hand.</b>
<b>56. With this</b> in mind, <b>you can understand what the</b> Sages <b>said: “What is</b> the definition of <b>repentance?</b> When a person has changed his ways to a great extent, <b>until the One who knows hidden matters would testify about him that he will not return to his foolishness again”</b> (see <i>Rambam Hilkhot Teshuva</i> 2:2). At first glance, <b>this claim appears puzzling</b> in using the language of "testifying." <b>Who would ascend to the heavens to hear God’s testimony? Furthermore, before whom does God need to submit this testimony? Is it not enough that God Himself knows that the person</b> in question <b>has repented with his whole heart and will not sin again?</b>
<b>But</b> in light <b>of what has been explained</b> above, <b>the idea is entirely obvious. In truth, a person is not absolutely certain that he will not sin again, before he merits to attain the providence of reward and punishment, clarified</b> earlier, which is <b>the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, as stated. This revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, which is from the side of</b> God's power of <b>salvation, is called a “testimony,” since it is</b> God's <b>salvation itself that</b> brings a person to <b>this attainment of reward and punishment and provides him with the assurance that he will not sin again, as explained above. It is therefore regarded as God testifying about him</b> that he will not sin again<b>.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning of the <b>statement: “What is</b> the definition of <b>repentance?” In other words, when can a person be certain that he has merited complete repentance? He is accordingly given a clear sign, which is “until the One who knows hidden matters would testify about him that he will not return to his foolishness again.” Meaning, he merits the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, for then</b> God's <b>salvation itself testifies about him that he will not return to his foolishness again, as explained.</b>
<b>57. Now, this aforementioned repentance is called “repentance out of fear.” Even though he returns to God with</b> his <b>whole heart and soul, until the</b> point that the <b>One who knows hidden matters would testify about him that he will not return to his foolishness again, as explained, nevertheless, this entire confidence that he will not sin again is caused by his grasp and sense of the punishment and the evil sufferings that result from transgressions. It is for this reason that he is certain about himself that he will not sin, as explained, in the</b> same <b>manner that he is sure that he would not</b> willingly <b>bring terrible sufferings upon himself.</b>
<b>However, ultimately this repentance and certainty is only due to the fear of the punishments that stem from the transgression, which means that his repentance is only out of fear of the punishment. This is why it is called “repentance out of fear.”</b>
<b>58. With this</b> explanation, <b>one can understand the Sages’ statement (see <i>Yoma</i> 86b) that one who repents out of fear merits that his willful</b> transgressions <b>become like unwitting</b> transgressions <b>for him. We need to understand how this occurs, and with the above</b> explanation, <b>you can understand this well.</b>
<b>It was explained above (#section 52#) that the willful</b> transgressions <b>a person commits are drawn to him from the aspect of</b> his <b>acceptance of the providence of a double concealment, which is “a concealment within a concealment,” meaning that he does not believe in the providence of reward and punishment, God forbid.</b>
<b>However, from the aspect of a single concealment, which means that he does believe in the providence of reward and punishment but on account of the many sufferings</b> he has experienced, <b>he sometimes comes to thoughts of transgression – for although he believes that he received the sufferings as a punishment, he still resembles one who sees his friend from behind, who might harbor doubts and think</b> that <b>he might be someone else (as stated above; see there) – these sins are only unwitting</b> transgressions, <b>since in general he believes in the providence of reward and punishment (see there).</b>
<b>59. Therefore, after he has merited repentance out of fear, as described above, which means</b> a repentance <b>through the clear grasp of the providence of reward and punishment until he is certain that he will not sin, the aspect of “a concealment within a concealment” is entirely rectified for him. He now sees plainly that there is a providence of reward and punishment, and it is evident to him that all the many sufferings he has felt since he came into existence have been a punishment from</b> God’s <b>providence for the sins he committed.</b>
<b>It has been retroactively established</b> for him <b>that he made a bitter error</b> back <b>then, and accordingly he uproots these willing</b> transgressions <b>from their roots, albeit not entirely,</b> but <b>rather they become like unwitting</b> transgressions <b>for him. In other words,</b> they are <b>similar to the transgressions he performed in the aspect of “one concealment.”</b> For these transgressions, <b>he stumbled due to his confused mind resulting from the many sufferings that drive a person out of his mind, which are considered only unwitting</b> transgressions, <b>as explained above.</b>
<b>60. However, he did not at all rectify, by this repentance of his, the “one concealment” that he had before.</b> The repentance applies <b>only from this point onwards, after he merited the revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance, as stated. But with regard to the past, before he merited repentance, the concealment of</b> God’s <b>countenance and all the unwitting</b> transgressions <b>remain for him as they were, without any rectification or change at all. This</b> lack of change is <b>because he believed then too that the troubles and sufferings came to him as a punishment, just as the verse states: “So that they will say on that day: Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us,” as explained above; see there.</b>
<b>61. Consequently, he is not yet called completely righteous, for</b> only <b>one who merits the revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance – which means His full attribute of goodness as befitting His name (see #section 55#, above)</b> – <b>is called by the name “righteous</b> [<i>tzaddik</i>],” <b>for he justifies</b> [<i>matzdik</i>] God’s <b>providence as it truly is, i.e., that He treats His creatures with absolute goodness and absolute perfection, such that He bestows goodness upon the good and the evil.</b>
But <b>since he has merited the revelation of</b> divine <b>countenance, from here onwards, he deserves to be called by the name “righteous.” However, because he has completely rectified only the level of “a concealment within a concealment,” whereas he has not yet rectified the level of “one concealment,” but</b> can only do so <b>from here onwards, as stated, it thus follows that</b> during <b>this</b> prior <b>period, before he merited repentance, he is not yet worthy of being</b> retroactively <b>called “righteous.”</b> This is <b>because at that time he still retained the concealment of</b> God’s <b>countenance as before, and he is therefore called incompletely righteous, meaning that his still needs to rectify his past.</b>
<b>62. He is also called intermediate</b>. This is <b>because once he has at least merited</b> the level of <b>repentance out of fear, he has been rendered fit, by</b> his <b>full engagement in the Torah and good deeds, to merit repentance out of love as well, at which stage he will merit the aspect of complete righteousness. Consequently, he is currently found to be</b> in <b>the intermediate between fear and love, and that is why he is called intermediate. This is not the case before that</b> stage, as he <b>was not</b> yet <b>fully rendered fit even to prepare himself for repentance out of love.</b>
<b>63. We have thus thoroughly clarified the first level of the attainment of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, that is, the attainment and sense of the providence of reward and punishment</b> to the degree <b>that the One who knows hidden matters would testify about him that he will not return to his foolishness again, as stated. This is called repentance out of fear,</b> in <b>which</b> his <b>willing</b> transgressions <b>become like unwitting</b> transgressions <b>for him, and he is called incompletely righteous, and is also called an intermediate, as explained.</b>
<b>64. Repentance out of love and the level of the completely righteous – through the attainment</b> of the One who is <b>good and bestows good</b><br><b>We can now explain the second level of the attainment of the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, which is the attainment of the complete, true, eternal providence. This</b> providence <b>means that God watches over His creatures through the aspect of “the One who is good and bestows good upon the good and the evil.”</b> When a person achieves this, <b>he is now called completely righteous, and</b> has achieved <b>repentance out of love,</b> through <b>which he merits that</b> his <b>willing</b> transgressions <b>are transformed for him into merits (from <i>Yoma</i> 86b).</b>
<b>We have thus clarified all four aspects of the understanding of</b> divine <b>providence</b> found <b>among people.</b> It can be said <b>that the first three levels, which are “double concealment,” “one concealment,” and “the attainment of the providence of reward and punishment,” are nothing other than preparations through which a person merits the fourth level, which is the attainment of the complete, true, eternal providence, whose nature will be clarified below, God willing.</b>
<b>65. We</b> still <b>need to understand, however, why it is not enough for a person</b> to attain the <b>third aspect, which is the attainment of the providence of reward and punishment, as we said.</b> At this level, a person <b>has already merited that the One who knows hidden matters would testify about him that he will not sin again. Why is he still called intermediate or incompletely righteous, a name that indicates about him that his service is not yet satisfactory to God, and</b> that <b>his Torah</b> study <b>and service is still lacking and flawed?</b>
<b>66. What is the nature of the mitzva to love God?</b><br>Before answering this question, <b>we will first clarify</b> a famous <b>difficulty raised by the commentaries with regard to the mitzva to love God: How can the holy Torah obligate us in a mitzva that we have no ability to fulfill at all? A person can force himself and subjugate himself to fulfill any</b> other type of obligation, <b>but when it comes to love, no subjugation or force in the world is effective.</b>
The commentaries <b>answered</b> by explaining <b>that since a person fulfills all</b> the other <b>612 mitzvot in their proper manner, the love of God is drawn forth to him of its own accord. Consequently, it is considered as though he has the ability to fulfill</b> this commandment to love God<b>, for he can subjugate and force himself with</b> respect to those <b>612 mitzvot,</b> so <b>that he fulfills them in their proper manner, in which case he merits the love of God as well.</b>
<b>67. However, this statement of theirs still requires</b> a more <b>comprehensive explanation.</b> Even if we accept their answer, <b>ultimately the love of God should not reach us in the form of a mitzva, since we do not have</b> to perform <b>any an action or subjugation from our side towards it at all. Rather,</b> according to this explanation, <b>it</b> simply <b>comes of its own accord after the</b> other <b>612 mitzvot have been completed. If so, the commandment to</b> observe the <b>612 mitzvot</b> should have been <b>enough for us and entirely sufficient. Why,</b> then, <b>was the mitzva to love</b> God <b>written</b> at all<b>?</b>
<b>68. In order to understand this, we must first</b> arrive <b>at a true understanding of the essence of the love of God itself. One should know that all the tendencies and attributes that are ingrained within a person for use</b> in his conduct <b>towards his friends, all of these tendencies and ingrained attributes are necessary for the service of God. From the outset they were created and ingrained within man only for</b> the sake of <b>their ultimate function,</b> the one we just <b>stated, which is the purpose and goal of the entirety of man, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And he who is banished will not be an outcast from Him” (see II Samuel 14:14).</b> For that goal, these attributes <b>are all required, in order to perfect oneself through them in the ways of receiving</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>to complete the will of God.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning <b>of the verse: “Everyone who is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory,</b> I have formed him, yea, I have made him” <b>(Isaiah 43:7)</b>, <b>and similarly: “The Lord has made all things for His own purpose etc.” (Proverbs 16:4). Within this process, a whole world has been prepared for man, in order that all of these tendencies and attributes that are ingrained within him should be developed and perfected by his engagement with</b> other <b>people through them, such that the</b> attributes <b>are prepared for their ultimate purpose.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning of <b>the Sages’ statement (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 37a)</b> that every <b>“person is obligated to say, the world was created for me.”</b> This means that <b>all the creatures of the world are necessary for</b> each <b>individual</b> person, <b>because they</b> help <b>develop and make fit the tendencies and attributes of each individual person, until they are rendered fit and become a service vessel for service</b> of God<b>.</b>
<b>69. Accordingly, we must understand the nature of</b> one’s <b>love of God from</b> our analysis of <b>the attributes of love with which a person treats his friend.</b> It is <b>necessarily</b> the case that <b>love of God is also transmitted</b> to the ones a person loves <b>by these attributes, since from the outset the</b> attributes <b>were ingrained in man for</b> the sake of <b>His name, as explained above.</b>
<b>When we reflect upon the attributes of love that</b> apply to the relationships <b>between man and his fellow, we find</b> that they consist of <b>four attributes of love, one above the other,</b> and <b>which are two that are four.</b>
<b>70. Four attributes of love between man and his fellow, and between man and the Omnipresent</b>
<b>The first is a love that is dependent on something</b> (see <i>Avot</i> 5:16), <b>which means that on account of the abundance of goodness, delight, and benefit that one received from his friend, his soul cleaves to</b> the friend <b>with a marvelous love. There are two versions contained in this</b> type of love: <b>One version is that before</b> the pair <b>recognized and loved one another they caused harm to each other, but they do not wish to remember these</b> past deeds, <b>because “love covers up all iniquities” (Proverbs 10:12).</b>
<b>The second version is that they always performed good</b> deeds <b>and</b> provided <b>benefit to one another, and there has never been any trace of damage or harm between them at all.</b>
<b>72. The second</b> broad type of love <b>is a love that is not dependent on something</b> (see <i>Avot</i> 5:16), <b>which means that one recognizes his friend’s virtue, that it is exceptional and goes far beyond any estimation and imagined</b> worth, <b>as a result of which his soul cleaves to him boundlessly with a great love.</b>
<b>Here too, there are two levels</b>:
<b>One level is</b> a love that is present <b>before he becomes familiar with all of his friend’s manners and dealings with others. In this case, the love is considered a love that is not absolute, because his friend has some dealings with others</b> on the basis of <b>which, on a superficial level, he might appear to be one who causes them harm and damage out of negligence.</b> I<b>f the one who loves him were to see these</b> dealings<b>, all of his friend’s virtue would be impaired</b> in his eyes, <b>and the love between them would be spoiled. However, he has not yet seen these dealings, and therefore their love is still complete and great to a supremely marvelous</b> degree.
<b>73. The second level of a love that is not dependent on something is the fourth level of love overall. It also comes from the aforementioned recognition of one’s friend’s virtue, only</b> that <b>in addition to this he is now familiar with all of</b> his friend's <b>manners and dealings with all people. None of those</b> ways <b>have been left out, and he has examined and found that not only is there no trace of a flaw in them, but</b> that <b>his</b> actual <b>goodness is immeasurably greater than</b> even the good ways and dealings he exhibits, <b>and</b> his goodness <b>rises above any estimation and imagined</b> worth. This <b>is now an “eternal, absolute love.”</b>
<b>74. Now, all of these four types of love, which are present between man and his fellow, are also present between man and the Omnipresent. Furthermore, in the</b> case <b>of</b> one’s <b>love of God, these</b> four types of love <b>act as</b> ascending <b>levels, in the manner of cause and effect.</b> Thus, <b>it is impossible to merit any one of them before</b> first <b>acquiring the first type of love, which is</b> love that is <b>dependent on something. After one has acquired</b> this type of love <b>completely, this first type causes</b> the person <b>to acquire the second type, and after he has acquired the second type and reached its end, this causes him to merit the third type, and the same</b> applies to <b>the third type</b> in relation <b>to the fourth type,</b> that <b>of eternal love.</b>
<b>75. Accordingly, the question arises: How can a person imagine acquiring the first level of the love of God, which is the first type of love,</b> the love that <b>is dependent on something</b> and which is <b>a love that comes from the abundance of goodness attained from the beloved, when we maintain</b> that <b>“there is no reward for a mitzva in this world” (<i>Kiddushin</i> 39b).</b>
This is <b>all the more</b> problematic <b>according to the</b> above <b>explanation, that every person has to pass through the first two levels of the providence of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance.</b> As explained, this <b>means that His “face,” which is His attribute of goodness, as it is the way of the good to bestow good, is concealed at the time, as explained earlier (#section 47#), see there. This</b> concealment <b>is why one receives pain and suffering at that</b> stage; <b>see there.</b>
<b>It was explained that the entire engagement in Torah and the service</b> of God <b>by way of</b> one’s free <b>choice is primarily in effect during this period of the concealment of His face. Given</b> these factors<b>, how can it be imagined that one can merit the second type of love that is dependent on something?</b> This love has been explained as resulting from the fact that <b>from when</b> a person <b>came into existence to this very day the beloved has done for him only numerous and wonderful</b> acts of <b>goodness, and has not caused him any trace of harm whatsoever.</b> Furthermore, it is <b>needless to say</b> that it is hard to understand <b>how</b> a person <b>could acquire the third or fourth</b> levels of love.
<b>76. The meaning of the blessing “May you see your world in your lifetime”; the level of “the opening of the eyes”; and the saying that “a person should always see himself as wicked”</b><br><b>We have indeed plunged into mighty waters, and we must at least raise</b> one <b>precious pearl from here. We will therefore explain a saying of the Sages (<i>Berakhot</i> 17a): “When the Sages took leave of the study hall of Rabbi Ami – and some say</b> it was <b>the study hall of Rabbi Ḥanina – they would say to him the following</b> blessing: <b>May you see your world in your lifetime, and may your end be to the life of the World to Come etc. and may your feet run to hear the words of the Ancient of Days.”</b>
<b>This must be understood: Why didn’t they say “may you receive your world in your lifetime," but</b> instead <b>only</b> said, <b>“may you see</b> it?” <b>If they were seeking to bless, they should have blessed in a complete manner, that he should attain and receive his world in his lifetime.</b> This <b>must also be understood on</b> a more <b>general</b> level: <b>Why does a person need to see his World to Come in his lifetime, causing him pain that it is only later that he will reach his afterlife in the life of the World to Come? Furthermore, why was this blessing placed first?</b>
<b>77. Now, we must first of all understand, what is</b> the nature of <b>this seeing of</b> one's <b>World to Come in one's lifetime.</b> It is <b>certainly not with one's physical eyes that one sees anything spiritual. It is also not the way of God to change the order of creation. The entire order of creation was arranged by God in its order specifically because</b> this order <b>is the most successful</b> arrangement <b>for the desired purpose</b> required <b>from</b> creation, <b>which is that a person should thereby merit to cleave to God, as stated,</b> and <b>as it is written: “The Lord has made every thing for His own purpose” (Proverbs 16:4). If so, we must understand how a person can imagine seeing his world in his lifetime.</b>
<b>78. I will say to you</b> in response <b>that a person achieves this sight by means of the “opening of the eyes” through the holy Torah, in the manner of the verse: “Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Your Torah” (Psalms 119:18). It is with respect to this</b> quality <b>that an oath is administered to the soul before it comes into the body (<i>Nidda</i> 30b) that even if the entire world says to you that you are righteous you should be wicked “in your eyes,” meaning, specifically in your own eyes.</b> This <b>means</b> that <b>as long as you have not merited the opening of the “eyes” through the Torah you should consider yourself as wicked, and do not let yourself be fooled by your worldwide renown as righteous.</b>
<b>You can thereby also understand why the blessing of “May you see your world in your lifetime” was positioned as the first of the blessings, since before</b> reaching <b>this</b> state of opening one's eyes, <b>one does not merit even the level of “incompletely righteous.”</b>
<b>79. However, this must</b> still <b>be understood: If one truly knows about himself that he has already fulfilled the entire Torah, and likewise the whole world agrees with him in this</b> regard, <b>why is all of this not enough for him at all,</b> but <b>rather he remains bound by the oath to consider himself wicked?</b> Can it be the case that simply <b>because he lacks this wonderful level of the opening of the eyes through the Torah, to see his world in his lifetime,</b> that <b>you can compare him to a wicked</b> individual? <b>This idea is extremely puzzling.</b>
<b>80. However, we have already explained the four ways that people attain God’s providence over them, which are two</b> ways <b>from the aspect of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, and two from the aspect of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance.</b> We also <b>explained the reason for</b> God's <b>“concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance” from</b> His <b>creatures, that it was by a great design, in order to give people space to toil and engage in His service through the Torah and mitzvot, out of</b> free <b>“choice.”</b>
As a result, <b>the Omnipresent receives more satisfaction from their service in His Torah and mitzvot than</b> the <b>satisfaction He</b> gets <b>from the supernal angels, “who have no choice”</b> but <b>rather must</b> comply <b>with their mission, as is known. There are also other, extremely valid reasons</b> for this concealment, <b>but this is not the place to elaborate on them.</b>
<b>81. Despite all of the aforementioned praise for the aspect of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, it is not considered an ideal state, but only a “transitional”</b> stage. <b>It is the state from which</b> people <b>are able to acquire the desired completeness. In other words, a person merits the whole reward for a mitzva that is prepared for him only through his toil in the Torah and good deeds at the time of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, that is, when he engages</b> in them <b>through the strength of</b> his <b>“choice.”</b>
This is <b>because he then suffers pain from holding steadfast to his faith in God through the fulfillment of His will, and the whole reward of a person is measured only in accordance with the pain that he suffers from the fulfillment of the Torah and mitzvot, as stated by Ben Heh Heh: “In accordance with the pain is the reward” (<i>Avot</i> 5:26).</b>
<b>82. Therefore, every person must pass through this “transitional”</b> stage <b>of the time of the “concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance.” When</b> a person <b>has completed this</b> period, <b>he then merits to attain the revealed providence, which is the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, as stated.</b>
<b>Before</b> a person <b>has merited the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, even though he can see</b> God’s <b>“back side,” it is impossible for him not to come to</b> commit <b>a transgression on occasion, as explained above (#section 53#). Not only does he not have the ability to fulfill all 613 mitzvot – because love does not come by way of force and compulsion – but he is not even complete with</b> respect to the other <b>612 mitzvot either, since even his fear</b> of God <b>is not properly established, as stated.</b>
<b>This is the mystical meaning of</b> the fact that <b>the numerical value of</b> the Hebrew words of <b>Torah is 611 (as all numerical values</b> of Torah <b>are</b> an expression of the <b>mystical meaning of the “back side”), for</b> it signifies <b>that he is unable to fulfill even</b> those other <b>612</b> [<i>tariv</i>] mitzvot <b>properly. This is</b> also <b>the mystical meaning of</b> the verse: “God <b>will not eternally contend"</b> [<i>yariv</i>] <b>(Psalms 103:9)</b> with a person not meriting the revelation of the divine countenance. <b>Instead,</b> a person <b>will ultimately merit the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, as stated.</b>
83. <b>Now, the first</b> <b>level</b> <b>of the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, which is the acquisition of understanding of the</b> divine <b>providence of reward and punishment with absolute clarity, comes to a person only by means of God’s salvation.</b> Through this salvation, <b>a person's eyes are opened in the holy Torah with a wondrous perception and he becomes like an ever-increasing wellspring, like Rabbi Meir (<i>Avot</i> 6:1).</b> Additionally, <b>in every mitzva in the holy Torah that he has performed with toil out of his free will, he merits to see the reward of the mitzva destined for him in the World to Come, as well as the great loss incurred by a sin.</b>
84. <b>Although</b> this person <b>has not yet received the reward, because “there is no reward</b> for the performance <b>of a mitzva in this world” (<i>Kiddushin</i> 39b) nevertheless, the complete comprehension</b> he has attained <b>suffices to allow him to feel great delight whenever he subsequently performs any mitzva, because anything “that is awaiting collection is as though it was already collected” (<i>Yevamot</i> 38b).</b>
<b>For instance, this is comparable to a merchant who engaged in a business deal and earned a great sum. Although the profit will only reach him after a long interval, nevertheless, if he is certain, without the shadow of a doubt, that he will receive the profit at the proper time, his happiness is the same as if he had received it immediately.</b>
85. <b>It is self-evident that</b> when a person experiences <b>such revealed providence, it testifies that from now on</b> this person <b>will cling to the Torah and the mitzvot with all his heart, spirit, and might. Similarly,</b> he <b>will separate himself and flee from sins as one flees from fire.</b>
<b>Although</b> in this state <b>he is not yet completely righteous, as stated above, because he has not yet merited</b> to attain <b>repentance out of love, nevertheless, his great clinging to the Torah and to good deeds helps him gradually attain repentance out of love as well.</b> This attainment is <b>the second stage of the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance. Then he can fulfill all 613 mitzvot completely, and he becomes a completely righteous person.</b>
86. <b>Now,</b> as a result of the above discussion, <b>we can understand the answer to the question we raised earlier regarding the vow that the soul is told to make before it enters this world, that “even if the entire world says to you: You are righteous, consider yourself wicked” (<i>Nidda</i> 30b).</b>
<b>We had raised the objection that since the entire world agrees with</b> this person <b>that he is righteous, why must he consider himself wicked, and not believe the entire world? An additional question one may raise is regarding the phrase, “even if the entire world says…”: what is the relevance of the testimony of the entire world? Does not a person know himself more than the entire world</b> knows him<b>? That being so, the vow imposed on him should have been, “even if you yourself know that you are righteous, etc.”</b>
<b>There is an even greater difficulty: the Talmud states explicitly, “Rava said: One should know of himself whether or not he is completely righteous” (<i>Berakhot</i> 61). This</b> indicates that <b>there exists a reality of</b> a person <b>being completely righteous and an obligation</b> to become completely righteous<b>. Furthermore, a person is obligated to examine and know that truth within himself. Accordingly, how is it that an oath is administered to the soul that it should always consider itself wicked, and it should never know the truth about itself, after the Sages have required the opposite (as explained)?</b>
87. <b>However, the language</b> of the Talmud <b>is very precise. As long as a person has not opened his eyes to the Torah with the</b> necessary <b>wondrous comprehension to an extent sufficient to provide him with a clear comprehension of reward and punishment, it is certain that he will be unable to deceive himself that he is righteous. This is because he senses that he is lacking the</b> attainment of the <b>two most inclusive mitzvot in the Torah, which are</b> the mitzvot of <b>love and fear.</b>
<b>Even attaining just fear</b> alone <b>in its complete form, i.e., in such a way that the One Who Knows Secrets will testify that he will never again return to his foolishness due to his fear of punishment and loss incurred by a sin, as stated above, is impossible</b> to achieve <b>before</b> the person <b>attains a complete, clear, and absolute understanding of the providence of reward and punishment. As mentioned above,</b> this understanding of reward and punishment is the stage in which <b>he will attain the first</b> <b>level</b> <b>of the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, which comes to a person when he opens his eyes in Torah.</b>
Additionally, <b>it goes without saying that</b> such a person will not yet have acquired <b>love</b>, as he has not yet even properly acquired fear<b>. The nature</b> of the mitzva of love <b>is entirely outside the range of his ability, since it depends on the “understanding of the heart”</b> (<i>Megilla</i> 24b)<b>, and no toil and coercion can help a person with that.</b>
88. <b>Therefore, the words of the vow is “even if the entire world says to you: You are righteous, etc.” The</b> knowledge of whether or not a person is fulfilling <b>the two mitzvot of love and fear is given to that person alone, and no one else in the world can distinguish and know</b> when he possesses <b>them.</b>
<b>Therefore, when other people see that he is complete in regard to</b> his adherence to <b>the</b> other <b>611 mitzvot,</b> they <b>assume that he has</b> fulfilled <b>the mitzvot of love and fear as well. Since the nature of a person pushes him to believe others, he is very liable to fall into a terrible error</b> and believe their assumption about his attainment of fear and love, instead of examining himself directly<b>. Therefore, a vow is imposed on the soul regarding this matter before it enters this world, and hopefully this will help us. Accordingly, a person himself is certainly obligated to examine and know whether he is a completely righteous person, as stated above.</b>
89. <b>Now</b> we can <b>also understand</b> the answer to <b>the question raised earlier (section 75, see there) regarding the attainment of love. We asked: how is it possible to attain even the first level of love, since we have the principle that “there is no reward</b> for the performance <b>of a mitzva in this world”?</b>
<b>Now, however, it is clearly understood, because</b> a person <b>need not literally receive the reward of the mitzva in his lifetime. This is the reason for the specific wording</b> in the Talmud<b>, “May you see your world in your lifetime, and may your end be life in the World to Come”</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 17a)<b>. This teaches that the reward of a mitzva does not exist in this world, but only in the World to Come. However, in regard to seeing, knowing, and feeling</b> in this world <b>the reward of the mitzva that he will receive in the World to Come, a person must truly know with absolute clarity, even while he is alive,</b> that he will receive that reward in the World the Come<b>.</b> This knowledge is acquired <b>as a result of his wondrous comprehension of the Torah, as stated above.</b> Through this comprehension, <b>he at least attains the level of “love that is dependent on something” (<i>Avot</i> 5:16), which is the first level a person must have in order to emerge from the concealment of the</b> divine <b>countenance, and his reaching the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance.</b> These achievements <b>are necessary for a person to fulfill the Torah and mitzvot properly, in such a way that He Who Knows Hidden Things will testify that this person will no longer return to his foolishness, as stated above (section 56, s.v. “And from that which was explained”) see there.</b>
90. <b>From this point, since the person is trying to fulfill the Torah and mitzvot through the aspect of “love that is dependent on something,” which he attains as a result of the knowledge of the reward</b> coming to <b>him in the future, in the World to Come, through the aspect of “that which is awaiting collection is as though it was already collected” as stated above (section 84, s.v. “and although”);</b>
<b>he then progresses further and attains the second level of the revelation of the</b> divine <b>countenance, which is the aspect of</b> God's <b>providence over the world, from His eternity and truth. This refers to how God is good and bestows good to evil and good</b> people<b>.</b> The person then <b>attains love that is not dependent on something, at which point his willful sins are transformed to be as merits. From then on, he is called a completely righteous person, because he can fulfill the Torah and the mitzvot with love and fear. He is called “complete,” because he has all 613 mitzvot in completion.</b>
91. <b>This</b> thought process <b>also resolves the question raised earlier (section 65) regarding</b> a person who <b>attains the third level of providence, which is the providence of reward and punishment.</b> Regarding this state, <b>the One Who Knows Hidden Things testifies that</b> such a person <b>will no longer return to his foolishness. Nevertheless,</b> the person <b>is still only called a righteous person who is incomplete, see there.</b>
<b>Now it is clear</b> that he is described like this <b>because ultimately, he still lacks "one mitzva," the mitzva of love, as explained.</b> Accordingly, <b>he is certainly not complete, because he must complete the</b> full <b>number of 613 mitzvot, which are the required first step upon the threshold of</b> becoming <b>complete.</b>
<b>An explanation of the mitzva of love, “I labored and found</b> success,” <b>and the obligation of studying Torah for its own sake</b><br>92. <b>Everything stated</b> up to this point <b>will answer the explicit questions that were raised</b> previously <b>(see section 66:7): How could the Torah obligate us in the mitzva of love</b> of God<b>, given that this mitzva is not at all in our power to perform and touch upon, not even slightly?</b>
<b>Now, you will understand and see that our Sages cautioned us regarding this: “‘I have labored and not found success,’ do not believe him” (<i>Megilla</i> 6b). Similarly, “A person should always engage in Torah study and performance of mitzvot, even if he does so not for their own sake, as through the performance of mitzvot not for their own sake, one comes to perform them for their own sake” (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 50b). Additionally, regarding this the verse testifies, “And those that seek me earnestly shall find me” (Proverbs 8:17).</b>
93. <b>Therefore, the Sages state, “Rabbi Yitzḥak said: If a person says to you, I have labored and not found</b> success<b>, do not believe him.</b> Similarly, if he says to you: <b>I have not labored but nevertheless I have found</b> success<b>, do not believe him.</b> If, however, he says to you: <b>I have labored and I have found</b> success<b>, believe him.</b> The Talmud comments: <b>This</b> connection between labor and success applies only <b>to matters of Torah. But</b> with regard to <b>business,</b> success depends upon <b>assistance from Heaven (<i>Megilla</i> 6b)."</b>
<b>Previously (above, section 40), regarding the phrase, “</b>If, however, he says to you: <b>I have labored and I have found</b> success<b>, believe him,” we objected,</b> saying that it <b>is apparently self-contradictory. “I have labored” refers to</b> something that a person works to <b>attain, whereas “I have found” refers to something that a person acquires without any effort whatsoever and without mental involvement.</b> Instead, <b>the phrase should have read, “I have labored and I have attained.”</b>
To answer this, <b>one must know that the term “found” as used here relates to the verse, “Those that seek Me earnestly shall find Me” (Proverbs 8:17), which refers to finding God’s countenance. This is in accordance with the statement of the <i>Zohar</i> that God can only be found in the Torah. In other words, as a result of laboring in Torah,</b> people <b>merit to find the revelation of the countenance of God.</b>
<b>Therefore, the Sages’ words were meticulously chosen: “I have labored and I have found</b> success<b>, believe him.” The "labor"</b> refers to laboring <b>in Torah and the "finding" is of the revelation of the countenance of God’s providence (as stated above, 47).</b>
The Sages <b>intentionally did not state, “I have labored and I have merited, believe him” or “I have toiled and I have acquired,” because such</b> phrasing could have led a person <b>to err that the</b> language of <b>merit or acquiring refers to the acquiring of the Torah. Therefore, they specifically used the language of, “I have found,” to teach that the intent is to something in addition to the acquiring of Torah: i.e., to finding the revelation of the countenance of God’s providence, as explained.</b>
<b>94. This</b> explanation <b>also explains the phrase, “I have not labored but I have found</b> success, <b>do not believe him.” This statement is</b> initially <b>surprising,</b> as <b>who would be foolish enough to think that one can succeed in Torah without having to labor in it? But this statement is referring to the verse, “Those that seek Me earnestly shall find Me,” which indicates that anyone, great and small alike, who seeks God will find Him immediately, as indicated by the term, “Those that seek Me earnestly.”</b> Therefore, a person <b>might have thought that laboring to do so is not so necessary, and even an unremarkable person who is not prepared to invest any toil in this endeavor will find God. For this reason, the Sages cautioned us that a person should not believe such an approach, but</b> rather one must know that <b>in this endeavor toiling is requisite.</b> Therefore, if a person says, <b>“I have not labored but I have found</b> success<b>, do not believe him.”</b>
<b>95. With this</b> explanation, <b>you can understand why the Torah is called by the name “life,” like the verse says, “See, I have set before you this day life and good, etc.” (<i>Devarim</i> 30:15), “Choose life…” (ibid. 19), and “They are life unto those that find them” (Proverbs 4:22).</b>
<b>This association is derived from the verse, “In the light of the King’s countenance is life” (Proverbs 16:15). As Hashem is the source of all life and all goodness, therefore life is drawn to the branches that cling to their source, which is said regarding those who have labored and found the light of God’s countenance in the Torah. This</b> refers to <b>those who have merited the opening of their eyes in the Torah with wondrous comprehension until they merited the revelation of God’s countenance.</b> This revelation refers to <b>the comprehension of the true providence that is fitting for God’s appellation as the One Who is “good,” as it is the way of the good to do good, as stated above (section 83).</b>
<b>96. Those who merit this</b> level <b>are unable to separate themselves from performing</b> a <b>mitzvah properly, like a person who cannot separate himself from a wonderful delight that he has acquired. Similarly</b>, such people <b>flee a sin as</b> one <b>flees a fire.</b>
<b>Regarding such</b> people<b>, the verse states, “You that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day” (<i>Devarim</i> 4:4). This is because</b> God’s <b>love reaches them and pours itself onto them with a natural love,</b> meaning <b>via the natural conduits that have been prepared for a person from the natural</b> structure <b>of Creation.</b> In this state, <b>the branch is now properly attached to its root, and life is transmitted to this person in vast abundance from its source, without interruption. For this reason, the Torah is said to be “life.”</b>
<b>97. Therefore, the Sages have cautioned us repeatedly that a requisite condition for learning Torah is that it be specifically “for its own sake,” meaning, in such a way that</b> a person <b>will merit life through</b> the Torah<b>, since it is a Torah of life. For this reason</b>, the Torah <b>was given to us, as the</b> verse <b>states, “Choose life.”</b>
<b>Therefore, when learning Torah, every person must labor in it and focus his mind and heart on finding in it the light of the countenance of the living King, meaning, the comprehension of the revealed providence which is called the light of God’s countenance (see above, section 47).</b>
<b>Every person is capable of this, as the verse states, “Those that seek Me earnestly shall find Me,” and as</b> the Sages <b>state, “I have labored and not found</b> success<b>, do not believe him.” A person lacks for nothing</b> in this process <b>except toil. This is the meaning of</b> the Sages’ <b>statement, “Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah study will be an elixir of life for him” (<i>Ta’anit</i> 7a). That is to say, all he need do is focus his mind and heart on attaining life which is the meaning of “for its own sake,” as explained.</b>
<b>98. Now you will see that the question the commentaries asked regarding the mitzva of love</b> for God <b>(mentioned above, section 66), saying that this mitzva is not in our hands, since love does not come as a result of coercion and compulsion.</b> We now see <b>that this is no question at all, because</b> this mitzva <b>is in fact entirely in our hands, since every person is able to toil in Torah until he will find the comprehension of God’s revealed providence. As</b> the Sages <b>stated, “I have labored and I have found</b> success<b>, believe him.” When</b> a person <b>merits</b> a comprehension of that <b>revealed providence, love is drawn to him of itself through the natural conduits, as explained above.</b>
<b>One who does not believe that he can attain this</b> comprehension and the resulting love <b>by means of his toil, for one reason or another, this must mean that he does not believe in the words of the Sages, heaven forbid. Instead, he imagines that toil does not suffice for every person, which contradicts the Sages’ statement “I have labored and not found</b> success<b>, do not believe him.” Similarly</b>, this view <b>contradicts the words of the verse, “Those that seek Me earnestly shall find Me.”</b> That verse <b>speaks specifically of “those that seek Me earnestly,” whoever they may be, whether small or great. However, a person must certainly toil.</b>
<b>The concept of concealment, concealment in the Torah and that one who learns Torah not for its own sake, his Torah becomes the elixir of death</b><br><b>99. From that which was explained</b> above<b>,</b> one <b>can understand the Sages’ statement, “Anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake, his Torah will be an elixir of death for him” (<i>Ta’anit</i> 7a). Additionally, regarding</b> the comments of the Sages <b>on the verse, “Verily You are a God that hides Yourself,” that the Holy One, blessed be He, conceals Himself in the Torah,</b>
<b>we asked (above, section 41)</b> the following question: <b>It is reasonable</b> to say <b>that God is concealed specifically in trivial matters and the vanities of this world, which are external to the Torah, but not</b> concealed <b>in the Torah itself,</b> since the Torah <b>is the only place of revelation.</b>
<b>We also asked about this concealment itself, that the Holy One, blessed be He, conceals Himself so that people will seek Him and find Him, as the <i>Zohar</i> states.</b> We asked, <b>why is all that</b> concealment and seeking <b>necessary?</b>
<b>100. From everything that has been explained, you can clearly understand that this concealment with which God conceals Himself so that people will seek Him, refers to the concealment of God’s countenance, the way that He conducts Himself with His creatures, in two aspects: a single concealment and a concealment within a concealment (as explained above, section 48-9). The <i>Zohar</i> tells us that a person should not think that God wishes to remain, heaven forbid, in the aspect of providence in concealment of His countenance from His creatures. Rather,</b> this concealment <b>may be compared to a person who conceals himself on purpose so that his friend will look for him and find him. So too, when God conducts Himself with His creatures with the concealment of His countenance, that is only because He wants people to seek the revelation of His countenance and find Him.</b>
<b>Meaning, there would be no way or opening for people to be able to attain the light of the countenance of the living King if He did not at the outset conduct Himself with them with the concealment of His countenance.</b> He does so <b>in a such way that this entire concealment is merely a preparation for the revelation of His countenance, as explained above (section 77).</b>
<b>101. This is the meaning of the statement that the Holy One, blessed be He, conceals himself in the Torah. The suffering and pain a person experiences during the time of the concealment of God’s countenance is not the same in a person who has committed sins and diminished</b> his engagement <b>in Torah and mitzvot and in a person who has engaged a great deal in Torah and good deeds.</b>
<b>The former is prepared to judge his Maker favorably—i.e., to think that he has experienced this suffering because of his sins and minimal amount of Torah</b> study<b>.</b>
<b>In contrast, it is very hard for the latter person to judge his Maker favorably, because in his view he does not deserve such severe punishments. Furthermore, he sees that others who are worse than he is do not suffer so much, as illustrated by the verse, “Behold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches” (Psalms 73:12), and similarly, “For nothing I have merited my heart” (based on Psalms 73:13).</b>
<b>From this, you may see that as long as a person has not attained</b> a grasp of <b>the providence of the revelation of God’s countenance, the Torah and mitzvot that he has</b> acquired <b>in great quantity cause the concealment of God’s countenance to weigh down on him very heavily. This is what is meant by the statement that the Holy One, blessed be He, conceals Himself in the Torah.</b>
<b>In truth, all of this heaviness that he feels more intensely because of the Torah</b> he has acquired <b>is nothing but the calling aspect of the holy Torah as it calls to him through this</b> feeling of heaviness<b>, arousing him to hasten with alacrity, and hurry to engage in the amount of effort required of him, so that he may immediately be given the merit</b> to reach <b>the revelation of God’s countenance, as God desires. Understand this well.</b>
<b>102. This is</b> the meaning of <b>the statement that any</b> person <b>who learns Torah not for its own sake, his Torah becomes an elixir of death for him (<i>Ta’anit</i> 7a). It is not only that he does not emerge from the aspect of the concealment of God’s countenance to the revelation of God’s countenance, as he has not set his mind on toiling and attaining it. Additionally, the more Torah he learns, the more it adds concealment of God’s countenance from him in very great measure, until he falls into a</b> state of <b>concealment within concealment, heaven forbid.</b> This state <b>is the aspect of death, of being entirely disconnected from his root.</b> This illustrates how <b>his Torah becomes an elixir of death for him.</b>
<b>103. This explains two terms customarily</b> employed to characterize <b>the Torah: revealed and concealed.</b> One <b>must understand why a concealed Torah is necessary and</b> the reason <b>why the entire Torah is not revealed.</b>
<b>There is a deep meaning</b> to this<b>. The</b> phrase <b>“concealed” Torah alludes to how God “conceals Himself” in the Torah, as explained previously. Accordingly, it is called the concealed Torah.</b>
The Torah is also <b>referred to as revealed because God is revealed through the Torah, as explained above.</b>
<b>Therefore, the kabbalists have stated—as found in the siddur of the Vilna Gaon—that the sequence in comprehending the Torah begins with the secrets</b> of the Torah <b>and concludes with the straightforward meaning. This means to say that by means of the appropriate toil that a person engages in from the outset in the concealed Torah, through this</b> acquired understanding <b>he</b> also <b>attains the revealed Torah, which is the simple meaning, as explained earlier. Thus, he begins with the concealed</b> Torah<b>, which is referred to as being secret, and when he succeeds, he concludes with the simple meaning.</b>
<b>The explanation of the level of love of God such that one feels that from then on, he received only good.</b><br><b>104.</b> We can now <b>answer the question we raised earlier (section 75): how is it possible to attain the first level of love</b> of God, <b>which is the aspect of love</b> called love <b>that is dependent upon something? We know that although “there is no reward for the performance of a mitzva in this world,” nevertheless, comprehending the reward of the mitzva does exist in this world,</b> and <b>it comes to a person when he opens his eyes in the Torah, etc., as was explained above.</b>
<b>This clear comprehension is entirely as if he receives the reward of the mitzva immediately, on the spot, as explained previous (section 84). As a result,</b> the person <b>feels</b> the bestowal of God’s <b>wondrous good</b> upon him, <b>which is incorporated in</b> God’s <b>thought in creating</b> the world. This thought in creating the world was <b>in order to benefit His creatures in accordance with His full, good, and broad hand. As a result of the vast goodness that this person attains, an incredible love is uncovered between him and God,</b> a love <b>that is transmitted to him without cease, through the ways and conduits in which natural love is revealed, etc. and explained above.</b>
<b>105. However, the person receives all of this</b> goodness <b>starting from the time of his comprehension and onward. But the entire aspect of suffering</b> he experienced <b>due to</b> his being under <b>the providence of the concealment of God’s countenance that he endured before he attained this revelation of God’s countenance—although he does not want to remember them, because “love covers all transgressions” (Proverbs 10:12)—</b> that suffering <b>is certainly considered to be a great blemish.</b> Such suffering would be viewed this way <b>even from the perspective of love between people (as discussed above, section 70).</b> Accordingly, <b>it goes without saying</b> that it would be viewed as a blemish <b>with regard to the truth of God’s providence, since He is good and</b> gives <b>good to those who are bad and those who are good.</b>
<b>Therefore, we must understand: how it is possible for a person to attain God’s love of this</b> following <b>aspect,</b> in which <b>he will feel and know that Hashem has performed wonderful benefits for him always, from the time of his birth and onward, without having done him any slightest amount of evil at all throughout his existence?</b> This aspect of love is <b>the second aspect of love (as explained above, section 70).</b>
<b>106. In order to understand this, we need</b> to turn to <b>the words of the Sages, who state that when a person repents out of love, his intentional sins are counted for him as merits (<i>Yoma</i> 86b). This means that not only does God forgive a person’s intentional sins, but every intentional sin and transgression he committed is converted into a mitzva by God.</b>
<b>107. Therefore, after a person has attained the illumination of</b> God’s <b>countenance to such a degree that every transgression that he had committed, even every intentional transgression, is transformed and made into a mitzva, he rejoices and revels in all of his feelings of suffering and bitter pain, and in the many afflictions that he had experienced throughout his life.</b> This <b>includes the period of time when he was within the two aspects of the concealment of God’s countenance mentioned above.</b> He even revels in these <b>because it is these</b> aspects of concealment <b>that caused and brought him</b> to commit <b>all of those intentional sins that have now been transformed to mitzvot through of the illumination of God’s countenance, which engenders extraordinary wonders, as explained above.</b>
<b>Every pain and distress that plagued him so that he stumbled and committed errors, as in the first concealment, or that he stumbled and committed intentional sins, as in the double concealment (as explained above, section 52) —is transformed to now serve as cause and regular preparation to perform a mitzva and receive great and wondrous reward from it forever. Therefore, every heartache is transformed to great joy for him, and every evil to wondrous benefit.</b>
<b>108. This is similar to the well-known story about the trustworthy Jewish assistant of a nobleman, whom the nobleman loved as himself. One time, when the nobleman went on a journey, he left his affairs in the hands of a deputy, a man who hated Jews. What did this deputy do? He took the Jew and struck him five times publicly in order to humiliate him thoroughly. When the nobleman returned, the Jew went to him and told him what had happened. The nobleman got very angry and summoned his deputy, and instructed him to immediately give the Jew 1,000 gold coins for each time he had struck him.</b>
<b>The Jew took the money and went home. His wife found him weeping, and asked him in great anxiety, “What happened between you and the nobleman?” When he told her, she said to him, “So why are you crying?” He told her, “I am crying because the deputy only hit me five times. If he had hit me ten times, I would have had 10,000 gold coins.”</b>
<b>109. Thus, you see that after a person has attained forgiveness for his sins in such a way that his intentional sins are transformed into merits, he succeeds as well in reaching God in the aspect of love of the second level.</b> In this perspective, <b>the beloved has not caused the one who loves him any evil, not even a trace of evil, but constantly does him vast and wonderful favors throughout the latter’s entire</b> life <b>and onward (as explained above, section 70, s.v. The first). In this way, repentance out of love and transformation of intentional sins into merits come together as one, as the Sages stated above.</b>
<b>Explaining the words of our Sages regarding whether performing one mitzva pushes the divine scales to merit for himself or for the entire world</b><br><b>110. Until this point, we have only discussed the aspect of love that is dependent on something in its two levels. Thus, it is still necessary to understand how a person succeeds in coming to his Maker on the two levels of love that are not dependent on anything.</b>
<b>Regarding this, we must gain a clear understanding of the words of the Sages (<i>Kiddushin</i> 40b):</b> "<b>The Sages taught, a person should always view himself as though he were</b> exactly <b>half-liable and half-meritorious.</b> He should act as though the plates of his scale are balanced, so that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is fortunate, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of merit.</b> If <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of liability, as it is stated: ‘But one sin destroys much good’ (Ecclesiastes 9:18).</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says, since the world is judged by its majority,</b> meaning, it is judged depending on whether people have performed a majority of mitzvot or a majority of sins, <b>and an individual is</b> likewise <b>judged by his majority,</b> each person must consider that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is praiseworthy, as he tilts</b> the balance <b>of himself and the entire world to the scale of merit.</b> Conversely, if <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts</b> the balance <b>for himself and the entire world to the scale of liability, as it is stated: ‘But one sin</b> destroys much good.’ <b>Due to one sin that this</b> individual <b>commits, he squanders much goodness from himself and from the entire world.”</b>
<b>111. This</b> passage <b>seemingly contains</b> a number of <b>difficulties from beginning to end. It states that when a person performs one mitzva, he tilts</b> his <b>balance to the scale of merit, since he is judged by the majority</b> of his being<b>. But this can only be said regarding those people who are half-liable and half-meritorious, which is something about which Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, does not speak at all, so the main element is missing from the text.</b>
<b>Rashi explains that</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>is referring to the words of the first mishnaic opinion, which states that “a person should view himself as though he were</b> exactly <b>half-liable and half-meritorious,” and Rabbi Elazar adds that he should also view the entire world as being half-liable and half-meritorious. However, this main element is missing</b> from the actual text of the Talmud<b>. Furthermore, if</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>is speaking about the same circumstances, why does he change the terminology and not use the same language as the first Tanna?</b>
<b>112. The greater difficulty</b> in this passage <b>is the statement itself that a person should view himself as though he is only half-liable. This</b> idea <b>is quite extraordinary. If a person recognizes his many sins, then by telling himself that he is half-and-half, he is lying, and the Torah states, “Keep yourself far from a false matter” (Exodus 23:7).</b>
<b>In addition,</b> the Talmud <b>interprets the verse, “one sinner destroys much good,” to mean that one sin tilts</b> the sinner <b>and the entire world to the scale of liability. This</b> appears to be <b>speaking of the true state of existence and not some false perception that a person is meant to perceive about himself and the world.</b>
<b>113. It is also perplexing: How it possible that in every generation there aren’t many people who perform one mitzva, thus tilting the world toward the scale of merit? Meaning, does the situation</b> of the world <b>never change at all, but the world continues in its customary way,</b> despite many people performing a mitzva that should tilt the world to merit?
To answer this, we <b>need extra depth</b> of analysis<b>, because on a superficial level these matters are incomprehensible.</b> The fact <b>is that this</b> Talmudic statement <b>is not speaking at all about a person who knows that his sins are many, telling him falsely that he is half-and-half and deceiving him that all he is missing is one mitzva, as that is not the way of the Sages.</b>
<b>Rather, the</b> Talmud <b>is speaking about a person who feels and imagines that he is an entirely complete, righteous person, who perceives himself to be at the pinnacle of wholeness.</b> He perceives himself this way <b>because he already attained the first stage of love</b> for God <b>as a result of his eyes being opened in Torah, as explained above, and the One Who Knows Secrets already testifies that he will no longer return to his foolishness (#section 56#).</b>
<b>The</b> Talmud <b>is addressing this person and clarifying his ways to him, proving to him that at this point he is not a righteous person, but only a <i>beinoni</i>, meaning that he is half-liable and half-meritorious. This is because he still lacks “one mitzva” of the 613 mitzvot in the Torah, that being the mitzva of loving</b> God, <b>as explained previously (#section 91#). The entirety of the testimony of the One Who Knows Hidden Things that</b> this <b>person will no longer sin is solely because of the clarity of his comprehension regarding the great loss</b> incurred by <b>a sin, which is the fear of punishment, and is thus termed repentance out of fear</b> and not love <b>as discussed above at length (#section 57#).</b>
<b>114. It was also explained above that this level of repentance out of fear only repairs a person from the time of his repentance and onward. However, all of the pain and suffering that he endured before he attained the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance remain as they were without any rectification. Additionally, the sins that he committed</b> then <b>are not completely rectified, but remain of the aspect of errors as discussed above at length (#section 58#), see there.</b>
<b>115. Therefore, the first opinion</b> in the Talmud <b>states that a person like this who still lacks</b> the <b>“one mitzva”</b> of loving God <b>should view himself as though he is half-liable and half-meritorious. This means that he should envisage that this moment at which he has repents exists in the middle of his years. As a result, he is “half-liable” because of the half of his years that passed before he repented, when he was certainly guilty, and because</b> his <b>repentance out of fear does not rectify</b> his sins, as explained above.
<b>Additionally, he is “half-meritorious” because of the half of his years following the time that he has repented, when he is certainly meritorious, since he is certain that he will no longer sin. Thus, in the former half of his years he is liable, and in the latter half of his years he is meritorious.</b>
<b>116. The</b> Talmud <b>tells this person that he should think to himself that if he performs “one mitzva,” meaning that</b> one <b>mitzva that he lacks of the 613 (as explained above, #section 91#), he is fortunate, because</b> in that way <b>he tilts his balance to the scale of merit. This is because</b> the person who <b>attains the mitzva of love</b> for God<b>, by means of</b> engaging in <b>repentance out of love, as explained above, transforms his intentional sins into merits through that</b> repentance<b>. Then all of the heartache and sadness that he endured throughout his life before he achieved this repentance are transformed to wonderful, infinite delights, so much so that he regrets that he did not suffer twice as much, or more.</b> This follows <b>the allegory mentioned previously about the nobleman and his Jewish friend (#section 108#).</b>
<b>That is what is called “tilting</b> the balance <b>to the scale of merit,” because</b> now <b>all of his feelings together with</b> his <b>errors and intentional sins are transformed into “merits.” This is the tilting</b> of the balance to <b>the "scale of merit," so that the entire scale filled with liabilities is transformed and becomes a scale filled with merits. In the language of the Sages, this transformation is called “tilting the balance.”</b>
<b>117. The</b> Talmud <b>further states and cautions</b> this person <b>that as long as he is an intermediate and has not attained the “one mitzva” that he lacks of the 613, he should not believe in himself until the day of his death, nor should he rely on the testimony of the One Who Knows Hidden Things that he will no longer return to his foolishness, but that he is liable to sin again.</b>
<b>Therefore, he should think that if he commits one sin, woe to him for having tilted his balance to the scale of liability, because then he will immediately lose all of his wonderful comprehension in Torah and all of the revelation of</b> divine <b>countenance that he had attained. He will return to the level of the concealment of</b> divine <b>countenance, and he will tilt his balance to the scale of liability, because all of the merits and the good even from the latter half of his years will be destroyed. And regarding that, the</b> Talmud <b>brings a proof from the verse, “But one sin destroys much good.”</b>
<b>118. Now you can understand what Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, adds to the words of the first opinion, as well as why he does not utilize the terminology of being half-liable and half-meritorious like the first opinion. The first opinion is speaking of the second and third levels of love</b> of God, <b>following the previous explanation (#section 70 and 72#). Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, is speaking of the fourth level of love discussed previously (#section 73#), which is eternal love, the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance as it truly is, of the aspect of “He Who is good and does good to the bad and to the good.”</b>
<b>119. It was explained that a person can only attain the fourth level</b> of love for God <b>when he is completely familiar with and knowledgeable of all of the undertakings of</b> his <b>beloved, a total</b> knowledge of <b>how he conducts himself with others. Therefore, even the great achievement in which a person tilts his own balance to the scale of merit does not yet suffice for him to attain complete love</b> for God, <b>meaning, the fourth level</b> of love. The reason is <b>because at this point he does not</b> yet <b>comprehend God’s greatness through the</b> divine <b>aspect of</b> "<b>He Who is good and does good to the bad and to the good.</b>" <b>Instead,</b> he only comprehends the level <b>of God’s providence toward himself, as it was explained above (#section 107#).</b>
<b>He does not yet know of God’s providence in that elevated and wonderful manner</b> in which that providence manifests toward <b>the other beings in the world. As explained earlier, as long as</b> a person <b>does not know all of the undertakings of</b> his <b>Beloved with other people without a single exception, that love is not yet eternal (see #section 72#). Therefore, he is obligated to also tilt the balance of the entire world to the scale of balance, and only then is</b> that <b>eternal love revealed to him.</b>
<b>120. This is</b> the meaning of <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, “because the world is judged by its majority, and an individual is judged by his majority.” Because</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>is speaking of the entire world, he cannot say,</b> similar to the words of <b>the first opinion that</b> people <b>should view them as though they were half-liable and half-meritorious. That stage comes to a person only when he attains a revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance and repentance out of fear, as explained previously.</b> Therefore, <b>how can this</b> idea about being half-liable and half-meritorious <b>be said about the entire world, since</b> the entire world <b>has not attained that repentance? Therefore,</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>must necessarily say that the world is judged by its majority, and an individual is judged by his majority</b>, comparing the two types of situations.
<b>The explanation</b> of this is that <b>one might think that a person only attains the level of being completely righteous if he has never committed any sin or transgression, but that those who have transgressed and committed intentional sins are no longer fit to attain the level of being completely righteous people.</b> To counter this perspective, <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, teaches that this is not the case, that the world is judged after its majority, and so too the individual.</b>
<b>That is to say, after a person has left behind the status of intermediate, meaning</b> of being a person who <b>has repented out of fear, at which time he immediately attains the 613 mitzvot and is called a intermediate in which half of his years are liable and half of his years are meritorious—after that, if he simply adds one mitzva, the mitzva of loving</b> God<b>, the majority of his being is deemed meritorious and he tilts the balance of everything to the scale of merit. This means that even the scale of sins is transformed to merits, as stated above by the first opinion</b> in the Talmud.
<b>Thus, even if he possesses a full scale of transgressions and intentional sins, they are all transformed to merits.</b> He is then <b>certainly similar to a person who never sinned in his life, and</b> so this former sinner <b>is considered to be a completely righteous person. Thus</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>states that the world is judged by its majority, and an individual is judged by his majority, meaning that</b> this person’s <b>sins prior to his repentance are not taken into account at all, because they have been transformed into merits. Thus, even completely wicked people, if they attain repentance out of love, are considered to be completely righteous.</b>
<b>121. Therefore,</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>states that if an individual performed “one mitzva,” meaning that following</b> his <b>repentance out of fear, at which time he lacks nothing except the one mitzva</b> of love for God, <b>as explained above,</b> then <b>“he is praiseworthy, as he tilts the balance of himself and the entire world to the scale of merit.”</b>
<b>That is to say, through his repentance out of love, not only has he tilted his own balance to the scale of merit like the first opinion</b> in the Talmud, <b>but he further succeeds in tilting the balance of the entire world to the scale of merit.</b>
The <b>explanation</b> of this is <b>that he merits to rise to wondrous comprehensions in the holy Torah until it is revealed to him how ultimately all of the people in the entire world will attain repentance out of love. Then all of the wondrous providence that he himself has attained will be revealed and appear to them as well, and they too will all tilt</b> the balance <b>to the scale of merit, when “sinners</b> will <b>cease out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more…” (Psalms 104:35).</b>
<b>Even though the people of the world have not yet even attained repentance out of fear, nevertheless, once</b> this <b>individual attains</b> for himself <b>the tilting of the balance to the scale of merit that they will attain in the future, with a clear and absolute comprehension, this</b> attainment <b>is similar to the aspect of “may you see your world in your lifetime”</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 17a) <b>that applies to a person who repents out of fear.</b> Regarding this, <b>we said that he is moved</b> by that aspect <b>and delights as a result of that</b> comprehension<b>, as though he has already attained</b> his world <b>immediately, since anything “that is awaiting collection is as though it was already collected”</b> (<i>Yevamot</i> 38b), <b>as explained above (#section 84#), see there.</b>
<b>Here as well, for this individual who grasps the</b> reality of the future <b>repentance of the entire world, it is as though they literally have already merited and attained</b> that <b>repentance out of love, and have tilted the balance of every one of them to the scale of merit.</b> The knowledge of other people that this individual grasps is to <b>the extent that he completely knows God’s undertakings with each and every person in the world.</b>
<b>This is</b> the meaning of <b>that which Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, said: “Fortunate is the person who has tilted the balance of himself and of the entire world to the scale of merit.” From this point on,</b> this person <b>knows all of the ways of God’s providence with every creature, from the aspect of the revelation of</b> God’s <b>true countenance. This refers to “He Who is good and does good to the bad and to the good.” Since</b> this person <b>knows that, he has attained the fourth level of love, which is eternal love, as explained in the first opinion</b> of the Talmud<b>.</b>
<b>Additionally, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, like the first opinion</b> in the Talmud, <b>cautions this person that even after he has succeeded in tilting the balance of the entire world to the scale of merit, he should nevertheless not believe in himself until the day of his death.</b> Further, <b>if, heaven forbid, he stumbles</b> and commits <b>a single sin, all of his wondrous attainments and goodness will immediately be lost. As the verse states, “One sin destroys much good,” as quoted in the first opinion.</b>
<b>Thus, the difference between the first opinion and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon has been explained.</b>
<b>The first opinion speaks only of the second and third levels of love</b> for God<b>. Therefore, it does not mention the tilting of the balance of the entire world.</b>
<b>However, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, speaks of the fourth level of love, which is only envisaged by means of the attainment of tilting the balance of the entire world to the scale of merit.</b>
<b>But we must still understand how to attain that wondrous attainment of tilting the balance of the entire world to the side of merit.</b>
<b>In order to attain the ultimate love, one must participate in the pain of the</b> Jewish <b>people</b><br><b>122. Here we must understand the words of the Sages (<i>Ta'anit</i> 11a)</b>: <b>“An additional teaching: When the community is immersed in suffering, a person should not say: I will go to my home and I will eat and drink, and peace be upon you, my soul. If he does so, the verse says about him: ‘And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die’ (Isaiah 22:13).</b>
<b>What is written afterward,</b> in the following verse<b>? ‘And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you until you die’ (Isaiah 22:14). Up to this point</b> is the <b>attribute of the intermediate<i>.</i> However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <b>attribute of wicked people, what is written? ‘Come, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,' (Isaiah 56:12). What is written afterward? ‘The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart, that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come’ (Isaiah 57:1). Rather, a person should be distressed together with the community…. He will merit seeing the consolation of the community.”</b>
<b>123. It appears that these words share no connection.</b> The Talmud <b>seeks to prove from the verse that a person is obligated to share in the distress of the public. If so, why must we here distinguish and differentiate between the attributes of an intermediate and the attributes of wicked people?</b>
<b>Additionally, what is the meaning of the specific terms, “the attribute of the intermediate “and “the attribute of wicked people”? Why does</b> the Talmud <b>not say “intermediate” and “wicked people”? Why</b> mention <b>“the attribute”?</b>
<b>Furthermore, what indication is there that the verse is speaking of the sin of not sharing in the distress of the people?</b>
<b>Moreover,</b> the verse <b>does not describe any punishment of those who have the trait of wickedness. Rather, it states, “The righteous person perishes and no man lays it to heart….” If the wicked people sinned, what did the righteous person do that he should be punished? And what do the wicked care if the righteous person passes away?</b>
<b>124. However, you should be aware that the attributes mentioned here in the Talmud of intermediates, wicked people, and a righteous person are not referring to</b> three <b>separate</b> sets of <b>people. Rather, all three</b> sets of attributes <b>exist in every person in the world. These three aforementioned attributes may be discerned in every person.</b>
<b>During the time that</b> the divine <b>countenance is concealed from a person, before he has attained even repentance out of fear, he is categorized</b> as having <b>the attribute of wicked people.</b>
<b>Subsequently, if he succeeds in repenting out of fear, he is categorized with the attribute of an intermediate.</b>
<b>Then, if he also succeeds in repenting out of love, which is the fourth aspect</b> of love for God<b>, meaning eternal love, he is</b> then <b>categorized as being completely righteous.</b>
<b>Therefore,</b> the Sages <b>did not say just "intermediates" and "righteous people," but instead</b> phrased it as <b>“the attribute of intermediates” and to “the attribute of wicked people,” as explained.</b>
<b>125. It also must be mentioned that it is impossible to attain the fourth level of love under discussion without</b> a person <b>first acquiring the aspect of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance that will exist in the future for the entire world. With that</b> attainment, <b>a person has the ability to additionally tilt the entire world to the scale of merit, as stated by Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon previously.</b>
<b>It has already been explained that the concept of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance must transform the pain and suffering that</b> a person experienced <b>during the period of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance into wonderful delights.</b> This transformation is <b>to such an extent that</b> the person <b>will regret having endured less suffering, as was explained clearly above (#section 107#).</b>
<b>Consequently, the</b> following <b>question may be asked. When a person tilts his own balance to the scale of merit, he definitely recalls all of the pain and suffering he experienced during the period of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance,</b> and this recall <b>allows the reality of them being transformed into wonderful delights for him.</b>
<b>But when a person tilts the balance of the entire world to the scale of merit, how does he know the extent of the suffering and pain that all people in the world endure, in order to understand how they are tilted to the scale of merit in the same way we explained that an individual</b> understands <b>when he tilts his own</b> balance to the scale of merit <b>(#section 107#).</b>
<b>In order that the scale of merit of the entire world will not be lacking at the time that this person is capable of tilting</b> the world <b>to the scale of merit, his only strategy is to see that he constantly shares in the distress of the public, in the same way he is distressed by his own problems.</b> This participation means <b>that the scale of liability of the entire world will be present within him like his own scale of liability.</b> Then, <b>if he succeeds in tilting his</b> own balance <b>to the scale of merit, he will also be able to tilt</b> the balance of <b>the entire world to the scale of merit, and he will attain the aspect of a completely righteous person.</b>
<b>126. From the above explanations, the words of the</b> Talmud <b>may be properly understood</b> as follows<b>: if a person does not share in the distress of the public, then even when he succeeds in repenting out of fear, which is the attribute of an intermediate, as explained previously (#section 62#) the verse refers to him favorably with the phrase, “And behold joy and gladness.”</b>
<b>This means that</b> this <b>person who attained the blessing of “may you see your world in your lifetime” sees his entire reward</b> for performing the <b>mitzvot that is prepared</b> for him <b>in the World to Come. He is certainly filled with “joy and gladness,” and he tells himself, “slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.” In other words, he is filled with great joy because of the reward that he is promised in the World to Come, and so he says with great joy, “for tomorrow we shall die,” and I will collect my life of the World to Come in its entirety after I die.</b>
<b>However, what does the verse then state? “And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you until you die.” In other words, the verse reproves</b> this person <b>for the errors that he possesses, as explained, because when a person repents out of fear, his intentional sins are transformed only into errors</b> and not into merits <b>(#section 59#). Therefore, since he did not share in the distress of the public and he is unable to attain repentance out of love, at which time intentional sins are transformed into merits, it is necessarily the case that his errors will not be expiated while he is alive. Thus, how can he rejoice in his life of the World to Come? Accordingly, the verse states, “this iniquity,” meaning</b> his <b>errors, “shall not be expiated by you until you die,” meaning before his death.</b> As a result, <b>atonement is withheld from him.</b>
<b>127. The</b> Talmud <b>further states that this is the “attribute of intermediates.” That is to say, this verse is speaking of a person from the time that he repented out of fear and onward, at which time he is called a intermediate, as stated above. “However,</b> with regard to the <b>attribute of wicked people, what is written?” Meaning, what will be of that time during which</b> this person <b>was immersed in</b> a state of <b>the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, when he was said</b> to possess <b>the “attribute of wicked people”?</b>
The Talmud <b>explains that repentance out of fear will not rectify what he went through before he engaged in</b> that <b>repentance. Therefore, the</b> Talmud <b>applies another verse to: “Come, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day.” Meaning, those days and years that he experienced during the time of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, which he has not yet rectified,</b> and <b>when</b> he <b>was said</b> to possess <b>“the attribute of the wicked,”</b> those days <b>do not want him to die.</b> This is <b>because they will have no portion in the World to Come after</b> he <b>dies, since they are of the attribute of wicked people.</b>
<b>Therefore, at that time when the intermediate attribute within him is joyful and cheerful, “for tomorrow we shall die,” and</b> that attribute <b>will attain the life of the World to Come, the attribute of the wicked people in him does not</b> also <b>say that. Instead, it says, “and tomorrow shall be as this day.” That is to say,</b> the attribute of wicked people <b>wants to rejoice and live in this world forever, since it does not yet have any portion in the World to Come, because</b> this person <b>has not rectified it.</b> This attribute will <b>only be rectified</b> when the person <b>repents out of love.</b>
<b>128. Thus the</b> Talmud <b>concludes, “And what is written afterward? ‘The righteous perishes.'” Meaning, this person has lost the aspect of the completely righteous person that he needed to attain. “And no one lays it to heart... as the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.” In other words, because that intermediate did not share the distress of the public, he cannot attain repentance out of love, which transforms intentional sins into merits and evils into wonderful delights.</b> Instead, <b>all of the errors and evils that he endured before he attained repentance out of fear still exist fully, of the aspect of the attribute of wicked people who feel evil</b> deriving <b>from His providence, and because of those evils that</b> those aspects <b>still feel, he cannot succeed in becoming a completely righteous person.</b>
<b>Thus the verse states, “and no man lays it to heart.” This means that the person does not consider that “from the evil,” meaning because of the “evils” that he still feels from the past in</b> God’s <b>providence, “the righteous person is taken away,” which means that he loses the level of a righteous person, and will die and leave the world only with the level of a intermediate. All this is because a person who does not share the distress of the public does not merit to see the consolation of the public, because he cannot tilt their balance to the scale of merit and see their consolation. Therefore he will never attain the level of a righteous person, as explained previously at length.</b>
<b>The attribute of righteous, intermediate and wicked</b><br><b>129. Now, from everything stated to this point, we have merited to learn that there is not a single human being who will not experience these three attributes: the attribute of wicked people, the attribute of intermediate, and the attribute of righteous people. These are called “<i>midot</i>,”</b> literally translated as “measures”<b>, because they are drawn from the measure of</b> a person’s <b>comprehension of</b> divine <b>providence. That is in keeping with the</b> Sages’ <b>statement, “With the measure that a person measures, he is measured with it” (<i>Sota</i> 8b). Those who comprehend the measure of</b> God’s <b>providence from the aspect of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance are categorized</b> as of <b>the attribute of wicked people.</b> This includes <b>either incompletely wicked people</b> who correspond to <b>the aspect of a single concealment, or completely wicked people</b> who correspond to <b>the aspect of a double concealment (as explained above, #section 49#).</b>
This is referred to as the attribute of wicked people <b>because, according to their way of thinking and feeling, the</b> entire <b>world is conducted</b> under <b>a providence that is not good, heaven forbid. That is to say, they incriminate themselves in that they experience suffering and pain from</b> God’s <b>providence and feel only bad things all the time. They similarly incriminate themselves even more by thinking that all people in the</b> entire <b>world are under</b> the same <b>providence as they are, under a providence that is not good, heaven forbid. Therefore,</b> since they experience reality through this lens of bad things, <b>these</b> people who <b>comprehend</b> God’s <b>providence from the aspect of the concealment of</b> His <b>countenance are called “wicked people.”</b>
<b>Understand that this label</b> of wicked people <b>shows itself to</b> be applicable <b>to them as a result of their underlying feelings. This</b> status <b>is dependent upon what a person’s heart comprehends.</b> Even if a person's <b>speech or thoughts justify</b> God’s <b>providence, this is not relevant when it conflicts with the</b> underlying <b>feeling of all</b> of his <b>limbs and senses</b> telling him that God's providence is bad<b>. These underlying feelings cannot lie,</b> even <b>under coercive</b> pressure from his words and thoughts.
<b>Therefore, those who have this measure of understanding providence</b> in a negative light <b>are categorized as having tilted their balance and</b> the balance <b>of the entire world to the scale of liability, as stated by Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. This is for the aforementioned reason, that they imagine that all people in the world are just as they are, under a providence that is not good, heaven forbid.</b> But a providence that is good <b>is</b> what is <b>fitting for</b> God’s <b>name, as “He Who is good and does good to the bad and to the good.”</b>
<b>130. Those who merit to attain and feel</b> God’s <b>providence of the aspect of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, in its first level, called repentance out of fear (mentioned above, #section 57#), are categorized as of the attribute of an intermediate. This</b> status is <b>because their feelings are divided into two parts, which are called the "two sides of the scale."</b> When such people <b>attain the revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance of the aspect of “may you see your world in your lifetime” (#section 78#), they attain, at least from now on,</b> an awareness of God’s <b>good providence that is fitting for His good name. Therefore, they possess the side of merit</b> of the scale<b>.</b>
<b>However, all of the pain and bitter sufferings that were well engraved into their feelings during all of the days and years that they were receiving the providence of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, meaning, in the past before they attained this repentance, all of those</b> still <b>exist fully, and are called the side of liability</b> of the scale<b>.</b>
<b>These</b> people <b>possess these two sides</b> of the scale<b>, which are arranged corresponding to each other, so that at the moment of their repentance and prior to it, the side of liability is arranged and exists fully, and from the moment of their repentance and onward, the side of merit is arranged, and they are assured of receiving it. Therefore, their point of repentance is found in the middle, between liability and merit, and so they are called intermediate</b>.
<b>131. Those who merit</b> to reach <b>the level of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance of the second level, which is called repentance out of love</b> for God<b>, through which a person’s intentional sins are turned into merits (mentioned above, #section 107#), are categorized as having tilted the aforementioned side of liability to the side of merit.</b>
<b>All of the pain and sufferings that were engraved on their bones when they were under the providence of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance have now been resolved and transformed to the side of merit, because all of the heartache and depression have been transformed into wondrous, infinite delight, as mentioned above (#section 108#). They are now called “righteous people”</b> (<i>tzaddikim</i>) <b>because they justify</b> (<i>matzdikkim</i>) God’s <b>providence.</b>
<b>132.</b> We <b>must also know that the attribute of intermediate is active even when</b> the person <b>is currently</b> operating <b>under the providence of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance. Through intense effort</b> to attain <b>faith in</b> God’s <b>reward and punishment, the light of great trust in God is revealed to them and they temporarily attain the level of the revelation of His countenance in the attribute of intermediate. The flaw here is that they cannot maintain and remain in that</b> level of the <b>attribute permanently. Remaining</b> in that state <b>permanently can only be</b> achieved <b>through repentance out of fear, as mentioned previously (#section 57#).</b>
<b>The essence of divine service in Torah study and performance of mitzvot is after one has attained repentance out of love</b><br><b>133. One must also know that our statement that free will operates only during the period of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance (#section 53#) does not mean that once a person has attained the providence of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, he no longer need expend effort and toil in Torah and mitzvot. On the contrary, the essence of a person’s proper service in Torah and mitzvot begins after he has repented out of love. Only then is it possible for him to engage in Torah and mitzvot with love and fear</b> of God <b>as we are commanded. “The world was created only for absolutely righteous people” (<i>Berakhot</i> 61b).</b>
<b>This is comparable to a king who wished to select his most faithful loyalists from the kingdom to serve in his private palace. What did he do? He issued a public proclamation that anyone who wanted, great or small, could come to serve in the private</b> areas of the <b>palace. But he placed of his servants many guards at the palace entrance and on all of the roads leading to his palace, and he instructed them to mislead through trickery all of those who approached his palace and to send them away from the road leading to the palace.</b>
<b>Of course, everyone in the country hurried to the king’s palace. However, they were diverted due to the trickery of the zealous guards. Many overcame the guards and approached the palace entrance. But the guards at the entrance were especially zealous, and they would cunningly divert these people.</b> This continued <b>until the numbers of those were repelled equaled the number trying to enter.</b>
People <b>would try, get sent away, prepare themselves</b> again and <b>come back, over and over again, for many days and years, until they tired of trying. Only those among them who were strong, who remained patient, overcame the guards and opened the entrance were able to merit meeting the king.</b> It was <b>each of these</b> people <b>who were appointed</b> by the king <b>to an appropriate position.</b>
<b>Obviously, from then on, these</b> people <b>had no more encounters with those guards, who had misled and diverted them, and who had embittered their lives for so many years as they tried repeatedly to reach the entrance.</b> These people were <b>now working and serving before the light of the king's countenance, in his inner sanctum.</b>
<b>The</b> concept of this analogy <b>is the same with regard to the service of completely righteous people. The free will that operates during the period of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance is certainly no longer operating once</b> people <b>open the entrance to the attainment of revealed providence. However,</b> when they reach this level, that is when <b>they begin the essence of serving</b> God, <b>from the aspect of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance. It is then that they begin to climb the many rungs of the ladder set upon the earth, while its top reaches to the heavens (<i>Bereshit</i> 28:2).</b> They do this <b>in the mystical meaning of the verse, that righteous people “go from strength to strength” (Psalms 84:8), and as the Sages state, that each righteous person “is burned by the canopy of his friend” (<i>Bava Batra</i> 75a). This service</b> they perform <b>prepares them to</b> fulfill the <b>desire of Hashem, that through them He will</b> actualize <b>His thought</b> and intent <b>in Creation: “to benefit His creations” in keeping with His good and generous hand.</b>
<b>The</b> <b>Devolving</b> <b>of the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>to the Torah of this world</b><br><b>134.</b> One should <b>know</b> the following <b>supernal rule: revelation exists only where there was once concealment. This is the same as occurrences in this world, in which non-being precedes being. The growth of a stalk of wheat is only revealed after</b> the kernel <b>has been sown and disintegrated</b> in the ground<b>.</b>
<b>The same is true in supernal matters, as concealment and revelation have a relationship with each other, like a wick and the flame that grasps it.</b> When a layer of <b>concealment is rectified, the</b> <b>light</b> <b>that is revealed from that</b> rectification is <b>related to the type of concealment. This revealed</b> <b>light</b> <b>is attached to</b> that concealment <b>like a flame</b> grasping <b>a wick. Remember this.</b>
<b>135. With this</b> concept<b>, you can understand the Sages’ statement (<i>Zohar Emor</i>, 188) that the entire Torah is the names of the Holy One, blessed be He. This seems surprising, since we find many coarse matters</b> in the Torah<b>, such as the names of wicked people like Pharaoh and Balaam.</b> Similarly, the Torah <b>refers to matters that are forbidden and impure, as well as cruel curses in the two “rebukes,” and the like. So how is it possible to understand that all of these are the names of the Holy One, blessed be He?</b>
<b>136. In order to understand this, we must know that</b> God’s <b>ways are not our ways. It is our way to go from the incomplete to the complete, whereas it is from His way that all revelations flow to us, from</b> their state of <b>completeness to a</b> state of <b>incompleteness. In the initial</b> emanation from God, <b>that which emerges is totally complete, and that completeness descends from before Him and</b> <b>devolves</b> <b>in</b> <b>constriction</b> <b>after</b> <b>constriction</b><b>, through a number of stages until it comes to the final, most constricted stage, which is appropriate for our material world. Then the</b> devolved creation <b>is revealed to us here in this world.</b>
<b>137. From the</b> description of this process of devolvement<b>, you can understand that the holy Torah, which is infinitely lofty, did not emanate and emerge from before Him the way it</b> appears <b>before our eyes here in this world. As known, “the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one” (<i>Zohar Aharai Mot</i> 299), yet this is not visible at all in the Torah of this world.</b>
<b>Furthermore, when</b> a person <b>engages in Torah not for its sake, his Torah will be an elixir of death for him, as stated previously (#section 102). Rather, when</b> the Torah <b>was initially emanated from before Him, it emanated and emerged in a state of utter completeness, meaning, literally of the aspect of “the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He are one.” This</b> level of the Torah <b>is called the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, regarding which is written (in the Introduction to <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>, p.</b> 3b<b>/10) that “He and His lifeforce and His attributes are all one.”</b>
<b>Afterwards,</b> the Torah <b>descended from</b> before God’s <b>countenance and it was incrementally constricted in many</b> <b>constrictions</b> <b>until it was given from Sinai, at which point it was written as it is before our eyes here in this world, clothed in the coarse garments of the material world.</b>
<b>138. However,</b> one <b>should know that although the distance between the garments of the Torah that is in this world and the garments</b> of the Torah <b>of the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>is beyond measure, as mentioned above. However, the Torah itself – that is to say, the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in the garments – does not change in the slightest from the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>to the Torah of this world. That is alluded to in the verse, “I the Lord change not…” (<i>Malachi</i> 3:6).</b>
<b>Furthermore, the coarse garments of our Torah of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>are not, heaven forbid, lacking in value relative to the</b> <b>light</b> <b>that they clothe. On the contrary, the importance</b> of these garments <b>is infinitely higher, from the aspect of their ultimate rectification, than all of</b> the Torah’s <b>pure garments in the supernal worlds.</b>
<b>The reason is that concealment is the cause of revelation. When concealment is rectified, at a time of revelation,</b> the concealment is related to <b>the revelation as a wick to the flame that grasps it, as discussed previously. The greater the concealment, the greater the flame that will be revealed and grasp it at the time of its rectification.</b>
<b>Thus, all of these coarse garments in which the Torah is clothed in this world are not lacking in value relative to the</b> <b>light</b> <b>that is clothed in</b> the Torah<b>, but indeed the opposite, as explained.</b>
<b>139. It is in this regard that Moses vanquished the angels, when he argued, “Is there jealousy among you, is there an evil inclination within you?” (<i>Shabbat</i> 89a). The meaning</b> of this <b>follows our explanation, that the greatest concealment reveals the greatest light.</b> Moses <b>showed</b> the angels <b>that the highest</b> <b>lights</b> <b>cannot be revealed through the pure garments in which the Torah clothes itself in the world of angels as</b> well as they <b>can</b> be revealed <b>in garments of this world.</b>
<b>140. It has thus been explained that there is no difference at all, heaven forbid, between the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, in which “the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one,” and the Torah in this world. The entire distinction is in the garments. The garments in this world are what hide and conceal Him, as explained (#section 101#).</b>
<b>Know that because</b> God <b>is</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the Torah, He is given the name “<i>Moreh</i>”</b> (teacher) <b>to convey that even at the time of the concealment of</b> His <b>countenance and even in a double concealment, as mentioned above (#section 52#), the Holy One, blessed be He, resides and is</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>within the Torah. He is the <i>Moreh</i>, and it is the Torah,</b> which comes from the same Hebrew root<b>.</b>
<b>The coarse garments of the Torah</b> in our world, that appear <b>before our eyes, are of the aspect of wings that cover and hide the Teacher, Who is clothed and concealed in them. However, when a person attains revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance</b> as a result of <b>repenting out of</b> the <b>love of the fourth level (discussed above, #section 73# and #section 121#),</b> the verse <b>says of him, “Yet shall not your Teacher hide Himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher” (<i>Isaiah</i> 30:20). From then on the garments of the Torah do not cover and conceal the Teacher, and it is revealed to</b> this person <b>forever that “the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one.”</b>
<b>141. With this, you may understand the Sages’ comment that the verse, “…and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law” (<i>Jeremiah</i> 16:11) means, “If only they would abandon Me and keep My Torah, the light in it would restore them to the better” (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Chagigah</i> 1:7). This</b> statement <b>seems surprising. However,</b> the Sages’ <b>intent</b> was as follows<b>: Because</b> people <b>were fasting and mortifying themselves in order to find the revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance, as the verse states, “They delight to draw near unto God” (<i>Isaiah</i> 58:2), the verse tells them in the name of Hashem: “If only you would abandon Me, because all of your toil is in vain, since I am not anywhere but in the Torah. Therefore, follow the Torah and look for Me there, and</b> then <b>the light in it will improve you, and you fill find Me” as explained (#section 94#) in the verse, “Those that seek me earnestly shall find me” (Proverbs 8:17).</b>
<b>The nature of the wisdom of Kabbala</b><br><b>142. Now it is possible to explain something of the nature of the wisdom of the Kabbala in a way that will serve</b> to give <b>a correct concept of the nature of this wisdom.</b> With this, <b>a person will not delude himself with deceitful delusions imagined by the majority of the masses.</b>
<b>You must know that the holy Torah is divided into four aspects, which encompass all of reality. Three of these aspects form the reality of this world, and are called “world,” “year,”</b> and <b>“soul.”</b>
<b>The fourth aspect</b> consists of <b>the ways that maintain those three parts of</b> the <b>reality</b> of this world<b>. Meaning,</b> this fourth aspect is <b>what sustains them</b> and <b>what guides them and all of their circumstances.</b>
<b>143. Explanation: The exterior of existence, such as the heavens, the firmaments, the earth, the seas, and the like, which are mentioned in the holy Torah, are all termed “world.”</b>
<b>The interior of existence, meaning man, beasts, wild animals, and fowl, and</b> all of <b>their species, and the like, mentioned in the Torah, are called "soul" and</b> they <b>reside in the places mentioned earlier called the exterior.</b>
There is a <b>devolving</b> <b>of reality in</b> its <b>generations of cause and effect, such as, for instance, the</b> <b>devolving</b> <b>of the heads of the generations, from Adam to Joshua and Caleb, who entered the Land</b> of Israel<b>, as recorded in the Torah.</b> In this devolving, <b>the father is categorized as the cause of the son, who is the effect brought about through him. This aspect of</b> reality called the <b>devolvement</b> <b>of the details of existence through cause and effect, is termed “year.”</b>
<b>All of the ways of existence, both exterior and interior, in all the ways that they act and their circumstances that are mentioned in the Torah, are termed “the maintenance of existence.”</b>
<b>144. Know that the four worlds that are called in the wisdom of the Kabbala</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>, at the time that they devolved and emerged, they emerged one from the other, in the aspect of seal and impression. Meaning, just like everything that is inscribed in the seal necessarily appears and emerges in that which is stamped by it, no less and no more,</b>
<b>so it was in the</b> <b>devolvement</b> <b>of the worlds. All four levels, which are “world,” “year,” “soul,” and their maintenance, were in the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>.</b> They <b>all emerged and</b> their imprint <b>was impressed and revealed in the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, and similarly from the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i> <b>to the world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, until the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>.</b>
This occurred <b>in a way that all three levels the in the existence before us, termed “world,” “year,” “soul,” with their maintenance, are arranged before our eyes, here in this world.</b> They <b>were drawn forth and revealed here from the world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>from that which is above it, in such a way that the source of all of these many details before our eyes are in the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>. Not only that, but even those innovations that are innovated and come</b> into being <b>today in this world, every innovation must first be revealed from above in the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>. From there it comes and</b> <b>devolves</b> <b>and is revealed to us in this world.</b>
<b>This is</b> alluded to in <b>what the Sages said, “There is not a single blade of grass that does not have a constellation in the firmament that strikes it and says to it: ‘Grow’” (<i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 10:7). This is the mystical meaning of “A person injures his finger below only if they declare about him on high” (<i>Chullin</i> 7b).</b>
<b>145. Know that the aspect of</b> <b>enclothing</b> <b>of the Torah in the three aspects of existence of “world,” “year,” “soul,” and their physical maintenance in this world</b> is the source of the <b>restrictions and</b> concepts of <b>impurity and prohibited things, which appear in the revealed Torah. As explained above, the Holy One, blessed be He, is</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in</b> the Torah <b>in the mystical meaning of “Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one,” but in</b> a state of <b>great hiddenness and concealment. These material garments</b> of this world <b>are the wings that cover and hide Him. However, the aspects of</b> <b>enclothing</b> <b>of the Torah of “world,” “year,” “soul,” and their maintenance, in their pure</b> form as found <b>in the three upper worlds, which are called</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, are termed overall by the phrase, “the wisdom of the Kabbala.”</b>
<b>146. Accordingly, the wisdom of the Kabbala and the revealed Torah are one and the same. But as long as a person receives from the level of providence of the concealment of</b> God’s <b>countenance and the Holy One, blessed be He, conceals Himself in the Torah (as above, #section 101#), he is engaging in the revealed Torah. In other words, he is incapable of receiving any illumination from the Torah of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, and it goes without saying</b> he is incapable of receiving anything <b>higher than</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>.</b>
However<b>, when a person merits a revelation of</b> God’s <b>countenance, as discussed previously, (#section 83#), then he begins to engage in the wisdom of the Kabbala, since the garments of the revealed Torah themselves have been purified for him, and his Torah has become the Torah of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, which is called “the wisdom of the Kabbala.” Even when</b> a person <b>merits the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, that does not mean, heaven forbid, that the letters of the Torah have been changed for him. Rather, those very same garments of the revealed Torah have been purified for him and become very pure garments, made in the mystical meaning of the verse, “Yet shall not your Teacher hide Himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.” Then they are made</b> to be <b>of the aspect of “He, His lifeforce and His attributes are one,” as mentioned above (#section 137#) .</b>
<b>147. In order to make this a little more intellectually accessible, I will give you an example as an analogy. While a person is in the period of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance, the letters and garments of the Torah necessarily conceal the Holy One, blessed be He. Because of this</b> concealment, this person <b>stumbled in the intentional and unintentional</b> sins <b>he committed, and he is cast under the rod of punishment, heaven forbid,</b> under <b>the coarse garments in the Torah, which are</b> references to <b>impurity,</b> to those acts which are <b>prohibited and</b> to that which is spiritually <b>unfit, and the like.</b>
<b>However, when he merits revealed providence and the aspect of repentance out of love, when his intentional sins become like merits for him, the very coarse and bitter garments of all of the intentional sins and errors in which he had stumbled from the time that he had been under the concealment of</b> God’s <b>countenance are now removed. They are clothed in the aspect of garments of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and mitzva and merits, because those coarse garments in themselves have been transformed into merits, as explained previously (#section 107#). They are now of the aspect of garments drawn from the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>or</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, which do not cover and conceal the “Teacher,” may He be blessed, but rather, “your eyes shall see your Teacher.”</b>
<b>Thus, there is not even the slightest change, heaven forbid, between the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>and the Torah in this world, meaning, between the wisdom of the Kabbala and the revealed Torah. The entire difference is only of the level of the person engaged in</b> learning <b>the Torah. Two people</b> may be <b>engaged in</b> learning <b>Torah about</b> the same <b>halakha and literally with the same words, yet for one</b> person <b>that Torah will be on the level of the wisdom of the Kabbala and the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, and for the other it will be the Torah of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>and the revealed</b> Torah<b>. Understand this well.</b>
<b>148. With this, you can understand the accuracy of the words of the Vilna Gaon, may his memory be for a blessing, who wrote (in the siddur, on the blessing on the Torah) that we begin the Torah with</b> the aspect of <b><i>sod</i></b> (secret), <b>meaning the revealed Torah of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>, which is</b> secret in that it is of <b>the aspect of concealment, since Hashem, may He be blessed, conceals Himself there entirely, as explained. Afterwards</b> we proceed to the Torah aspect of <b><i>remez</i></b> (hint), <b>meaning that He is</b> then <b>more revealed in the Torah of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>.</b> This progression continues <b>until one merits the <i>peshat</i></b> (simple meaning), <b>which is the mystical meaning of the Torah of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, which is called <i>peshat</i> since it is <i>nitpashta</i></b> (stripped) <b>of all the garments that conceal Hashem, may He be blessed, as has been explained.</b>
<b>The four worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of holiness and of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i> <b>in the path of divine service</b><br><b>149. Now that we have reached this point, it is possible to present some concept and</b> provide <b>discerning insight regarding the four worlds known in the wisdom of Kabbala by the names</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of holiness. Similarly, there are the four worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i><i><b>.</b></i> The worlds of the <i>kelippa</i> <b>are arranged in the mystical meaning of "one corresponding to the other," corresponding to</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of holiness. You can understand all this from what was explained above regarding the four aspects of attaining His providence, may He be blessed, and from the four aspects of love. We will first explain the four worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of holiness, starting from below, from the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>.</b>
<b>150. It was explained previously (#section 51#)</b> that there are <b>two first aspects of providence, of the aspect of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance. Know that these two</b> aspects <b>are</b> of <b>the aspect of the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>. Thus, it is</b> stated <b>in <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i></b> of the Arizal's writings <b>(Gate 48, Chapter 3) that “the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>is mostly bad, and</b> even <b>the small amount of good in it is mixed together with the bad, so that it is unrecognizable.”</b>
<b>Explanation: from the aspect of the single concealment (explained previously, #section 50#)</b> the reality <b>that is mostly bad is drawn out, meaning the sufferings and pains that those who receive this providence feel. The aspect of the double concealment</b> is the source of <b>the good mixing with the bad, and the good is entirely unrecognizable (as above, #section 52#).</b>
<b>The first aspect of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance is the aspect of the world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>. Therefore, it is</b> stated <b>in <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i> (Gate 48, Chapter 3) that “the world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>is half good and half bad.” That means, as stated above (#section 54#), that a person who attains the first level of the revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, which is</b> also <b>the first level of</b> the type of <b>love that is dependent on something,</b> also <b>termed repentance out of fear, is called a intermediate.</b> Accordingly, <b>he is half-liable and half-meritorious (as explained above).</b>
<b>b&gt;The second aspect of love (as above, #section 74#), which is also</b> the type that is <b>dependent on something, but there is no hint of any damage or bad</b> within this <b>aspect whatsoever, is similar to the third aspect of love (as above, section #72#), which is the first aspect of</b> the type of <b>love that is not dependent anything. Both</b> of these <b>are aspects of the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>. Therefore, it is</b> stated <b>in <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i> (Gate 48, Chapter 3) that “the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i> <b>is mostly good and</b> has a <b>small amount of evil, and the bad minority is not discernible” (see there).</b>
<b>&lt;this is="" like="" what="" i="" wrote="" above,="" (#section="" 116#),="" in="" the="" explanation="" of="" the&lt;="" b=""&gt; Talmud stating <b>that since the intermediate</b> person <b>attains a single mitzva, he tilts his balance to the scale of merit, as a result of which he is said to be mostly good, and this is the second aspect of love. The small amount of evil in</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i> <b>that is not discernible is drawn from the third level of love, which is</b> the type of love that is <b>not dependent anything, and</b> a person who possess this love has also <b>already tilted his balance to the scale of merit. However,</b> such a person <b>has not yet tilted the balance of the entire world (as above, #section 119#). Thus, he has a small amount of evil within him, since this love is not yet of the aspect of eternal</b> love, <b>as explained above. However, this small amount</b> of evil <b>is not discernible, because he has not yet felt any evil or damage evem toward others (as explained above, #section 72#).</b></b>
<b>The fourth level of love, which is love that is not dependent on anything and which is also eternal (as above, #sections 72# and #section 121#), is of the aspect of the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>. It is thus written in <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i> that in the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>there is no evil at all.</b> <i>Atzilut</i> <b>is the mystical meaning of what is written, “evil shall not sojourn with You” (Psalms 5:5).</b> This is <b>because after</b> a person <b>has also tilted the balance of the entire world to the side of merit, the love is eternal and absolute, and no covering or concealment is conceivable ever again</b> in that state. <b>That</b> state <b>is the place of the absolute revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance, in the mystical meaning of what is written, “Yet shall not your Teacher hide Himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.”</b> That person <b>already knows all of the activities of the Holy One with the created beings, within the aspect of the true providence that is revealed from His name that is good and does good to the bad and to the good (as explained above.).</b>
<b>151. With this, you can also understand the aspect of the four worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i><b>, which are arranged corresponding to</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of holiness, in the mystical meaning of “this corresponding to that did God make” (Ecclesiastes 7:14). The chariot of the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i> <b>of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><i></i> comes <b>from the aspect of the concealment of</b> the divine <b>countenance in its two levels. This chariot governs in order to cause a person to tilt the balance of everything to the scale of liability, heaven forbid.</b>
<b>The world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i> <b>grasps in its hand the scale of liability, which is not rectified in the world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>of holiness (as explained, #section 115#). With this,</b> the <i>kelippot</i> of this level <b>rule over intermediate</b> people<b>, who receive from the world of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, in the mystical meaning of “this corresponding to that did God make.”</b>
In <b>the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i><b>,</b> the <i>kelippot</i> <b>have power in their hands to nullify love that is dependent on something. This means to say,</b> they <b>only</b> have the power <b>to nullify the thing on which the love depends. This</b> weakness is <b>the lack in the love of the second aspect.</b>
<b>The world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i> <b>grasps in its hands that small amount of evil that is not discernible and that exists in</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> deriving <b>from the power of the third aspect of love.</b> This love <b>is true love from the power of the One Who is good and does good to the bad and to the good, which is the aspect of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>of holiness. Nevertheless, since</b> the person of that level <b>did not merit</b> to reach the love that would <b>also tilt the balance of the entire world to the side of merit, there is power in the hand of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i> <b>to undermine this love, from the</b> aspect of <b>the power of</b> God's <b>providence over others</b> that the person of this level lacks <b>(as above, #section 72#).</b>
<b>152. Thus, it is written in <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i> that the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i> <b>is positioned in correspondence to the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i> <b>and not in corresponding to the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, see there. This is as was explained, that in the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>of holiness, from which only the fourth type of love is drawn, the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i> <b>have no governance at all.</b> A person of this level <b>has already tilted the balance of the entire world to the scale of merit, and knows all of the activities of God, including His providence over all creatures, from the providence of His name</b> in that He <b>is good and does good to the bad and to the good.</b>
<b>But in the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><i></i> of holiness<b>, from which the third type</b> of love <b>is drawn,</b> the person <b>has not yet tilted the balance of the entire world</b> to the scale of merit<b>, and so the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i> <b>still have a purchase</b> there<b>. But these</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i> <b>are considered</b> as being <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippa</b></i><b>, since</b> these <i>kelippot</i> <b>correspond to the third type</b> of love<b>, which is love that is not dependent on something,</b> as this <b>love is</b> on <b>the level of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>.</b>
<b>153.</b> We <b>have fully explained the four worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of holiness.</b> We have also explained <b>the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i><b>, which are the aspect that corresponds</b> to <b>each of the worlds of holiness.</b> Each world of the <i>kelippa</i> is <b>the aspect of lack that corresponds to one of the worlds of holiness. These</b> latter <b>are called the four worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>of the</b> <i><b>kelippot</b></i><b>, as explained.</b>
<b>The books of the wisdom of Kabbala: for whom are they intended, and the way to learn them</b><br><b>154. These words will suffice for every student so that he will feel in his mind the character of the wisdom of Kabbala,</b> at least <b>to some miniscule extent. You should know that most of the authors of books of Kabbala intended their books only for students who have already attained a revelation of</b> the divine <b>countenance and</b> attained <b>all of the supernal insights, as discussed above.</b>
<b>One should not ask: if they already attained</b> those <b>insights, they know everything from their own insight, so why do they need to learn more in books of the wisdom of Kabbala</b> written <b>by others?</b>
<b>However, this question does not come from wisdom. This is similar to</b> a person <b>engaged in</b> studying <b>the revealed Torah</b> but <b>who has no knowledge of the activities of this world,</b> no knowledge <b>of the aspects of “world,” “year,”</b> and <b>soul” of this world, as stated above.</b> He <b>does not know people’s circumstances and conduct regarding themselves nor their conduct regarding others, and does not know about this world’s domestic animals, wild animals, and birds. Would you think that such a person is capable of properly understanding some matter in the Torah? He would upend matters in the Torah from bad to good and from good to bad, and he would not be able to understand anything.</b>
<b>The same applies to the matter before us. Although a person</b> may have <b>merited insight, and even insight from the Torah of</b> the level of <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, nevertheless from there he only knows what relates to his own soul. He still must know all three aspects, “world,” year,” and “soul,” in all of their circumstances and conduct, with a full grasp, so that he may be able to understand the matters of the Torah that are related to that world. These matters with all of their details and particulars are explained in the books of the <i>Zohar</i> and in the true books of the Kabbala that every wise person and every person who is able to understand on his own is obligated to study day and night.</b>
<b>155. Therefore, one may ask: if</b> it <b>is so,</b> that Kabbala books were designed for people who have merited an opening of their eyes, <b>why did the kabbalists obligate every person to learn the wisdom of the Kabbala?</b>
<b>However, there is an important point here, worthy of being publicized. There is an incredible, incomparable power of those who engage in</b> study of <b>the wisdom of the Kabbala, even if they do not understand what they learn,</b> because <b>out of</b> their <b>strong desire and will to understand what they are learning, they bring upon themselves the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>that surround their soul.</b>
<b>The explanation of this is that every person of Israel is promised that he will ultimately comprehend all the wondrous concepts that Hashem, may He be blessed, thought in</b> His <b>intention of Creation</b> which was <b>to benefit every creature. A person who does not attain</b> this comprehension <b>in this incarnation will attain</b> it <b>in a second incarnation, and so forth, until he will succeed in</b> grasping the <b>complete thought</b> of Hashem<b>, may He be blessed, that He thought about</b> in creating existence<b>, as is known to be stated in the <i>Zohar</i>.</b>
<b>As long as a person is not complete, those</b> <b>lights</b> <b>that are slated to come to him in the future are in the state of the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>surrounding lights</b> <b>relative to him. This means that</b> these lights <b>stand ready for this person, but they are waiting for him to attain his</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>with which to receive, at which time these</b> <b>lights</b> <b>will be</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the prepared vessels.</b>
<b>Therefore, even while</b> this person <b>is</b> still <b>lacking</b> those <b>vessels</b><b>, when he engages in</b> studying <b>this wisdom and mentions the names of the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>that have a connection to him through the aspect of his soul, they immediately shine on him, to a certain extent. However, they illuminate him without being</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the interior of his soul, because the</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>ready to receive</b> these lights <b>are missing, as stated. However, the illumination that he receives time after time as he engages</b> in that study <b>draws supernal favor onto him, and transmits</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>of holiness and purity onto him, which brings him very close to</b> the state of <b>completion.</b>
<b>156. However, there is a crucial condition</b> that a person must fulfill <b>at the time that he engages in</b> the study of <b>this wisdom. He must not corporealize matters</b> by using <b>illusory and material concepts.</b> People who do so <b>transgress</b> the prohibition of <b>“You shall not make for you a graven image, nor any manner of likeness” (Exodus 20:3), heaven forbid. In such a case, instead of benefit,</b> a person <b>receives harm. This is why</b> the kabbalists <b>of blessed memory warned</b> us <b>to learn</b> this <b>wisdom only after</b> reaching the age of <b>forty or</b> only <b>from the mouth of a</b> knowledgeable <b>rabbi, and</b> other <b>similar warnings. All of</b> those warnings are <b>for the above-stated reason.</b>
<b>Therefore, with the help of Hashem I prepared the commentaries <i>Panim Meirot</i> and <i>Panim Masbirot</i> on <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i>. I made these</b> commentaries <b>in order to rescue students from any corporealization.</b>
<b>However, after the first four sections of these commentaries were published and were circulated among students, I saw from</b> those students <b>that I had not yet fulfilled my obligation of providing explanations as I thought I had. All of the great trouble that I had gone to in order to explain and elaborate so that</b> these <b>matters would be made clear</b> and <b>without difficulty, was almost without any utility.</b>
<b>This</b> failure <b>was because these students did not feel the great need to assiduously</b> study <b>the explanation of every word that came before them, and to review</b> those explanations <b>multiple times, such that it would be sufficient to remember</b> them <b>well as they continued</b> studying <b>the book, each</b> time <b>an</b> explained <b>word would appear. As a result of forgetting some words, matters grew confusing for them because, since the material is so subtle, the lack</b> of knowing the meaning <b>of one word sufficed to obscure the entire topic for them.</b>
<b>In order to rectify this, I began to compose an alphabetical glossary of all the words</b> used <b>in the books of Kabbala that require explanation. On the one hand, I gathered together the explanations of the Arizal and the other early kabbalists regarding everything they said on</b> each <b>word. On the other hand, I</b> developed an <b>explanation of the essential meaning of</b> a word. <b>That</b> explanation <b>is derived from the sum of the explanations</b> of those preceding kabbalists<b>, from which I arranged accurate definitions explaining each word in a way that would suffice for the student to understand it whenever he would encounter that word in all of the true books of Kabbala, from the early to the more recent. I did the same for all the words that are common in the wisdom of Kabbala.</b>
<b>With the help of Hashem, I have already published the words beginning with the letter <i>alef</i>, as well as some of</b> the words beginning with <b>the letter <i>bet</i>, and only on one-sided</b> pages<b>, and these already are close to a thousand pages. But due to the lack of money, I stopped the work at its beginning. It has been almost a year that I have not continued this important work any further. Hashem, may He be blessed, knows whether</b> this project <b>will continue for me, because there are many expenses, and I do not have supporters helping at present.</b>
<b>Therefore, I now have taken a different approach, in the way of “If you grasp few, you grasp something” (<i>Sukkah</i> 5b), which is this book, <i>Talmud Eser HaSefirot LeHaArizal</i>. In it, I gather all of the principal statements related to explaining the ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>from the books of the Arizal, and in particular from his book <i>Etz Ḥayyim.</i> I have placed</b> these statements <b>at the top of every page, and on</b> that collection of statements <b>I have composed an extensive commentary called <i>Or Penimi.</i></b> Additionally, I composed <b>a second commentary called <i>Histaklut Penimit</i>, which explains every word and every topic</b> discussed <b>in the Arizal’s words at the top of the page, in as simple and easy a language as I could.</b>
<b>I have divided the book into sixteen sections. Each section is one lesson on a specific topic of the ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>. <i>Or Penimi</i> mainly explains the words of the Arizal in that lesson, and <i>Histaklut Penimit</i> mainly explains the topic with a general scope. In regard to these</b> commentaries<b>, I have arranged a list of questions and a list of answers on all of the words and on all of the topics</b> discussed <b>in that section.</b>
<b>After the student finishes that section, he can test himself</b> to see <b>if he is able to properly answer every question in the list of questions. After he has answered, he should look at the list of answers to see if he answered properly. Even if he knows</b> the material <b>well</b> and can <b>answer the questions from memory, he should nevertheless review the questions a great many times until they will be solidly placed in his memory. In that way, he will succeed in remembering the word when he needs it, or at least he will remember where to look it up.</b> Then <b>“the purpose of the Lord might prosper by his hand” (Isaiah 53:10).</b>
<b>The order of learning</b>
<b>157. First, learn the</b> principal text<b>, which is to say, the words of the Arizal that appear at the top of</b> every <b>page, until the end of the book. Although you will not understand, review them a few times, in the way of “first learn and then understand”</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 63a). <b>Afterwards, learn the commentary <i>Or Penimi</i>, and apply</b> yourself until <b>you can learn and understand well the</b> principal text <b>even without the help of the commentary. Afterwards learn the commentary <i>Histaklut Penimit</i> until you understand it and remember it all. After</b> having gone through <b>all of these, test yourself with the list of questions. After you have answered a question, look at its answer, doing so for every question. Learn, review, and go over these a number of times until you remember them well, so that they are solidly placed in your memory, because literally with every word in the third section, one needs to remember well the entirety of both of the first sections. Not even the smallest understanding should be lacking. Worst of all is</b> a case in which <b>a student will not be at all aware of what he has forgotten, such that either these matters will be obscure in his eyes or he will</b> have <b>a mistaken</b> understanding <b>of a topic, because of his forgetting. Obviously, one error will draw ten errors after it, until he will come to a complete lack of understanding, and he will have to set the learning aside altogether.</b>

Chapter 1

1. <b>Explaining the concept of the initial contraction, where the Infinite Light contracted in order to emanate the emanated and create the created. And within it are five aspects:</b> Before the contraction, there was the Infinite, filling all of existence. *The Tree of Life, Gate 1, Branch 2. Know that before the emanation of the emanated and the creation of the created, there was a simple, supreme light filling all of existence. There was no empty space, void, or vacuum; rather, everything was filled with that simple, undifferentiated light. It had neither beginning nor end, but everything was a single, equal, and undifferentiated light, which is called the Infinite Light.
2. The reason for creation was to reveal His names and attributes. And when His simple Will arose to create the worlds and emanate the emanated, to manifest the completeness of His actions and His names and attributes, that was the reason for the creation of the worlds.
3. The contraction of light from the surroundings of the central point. At that moment, the Infinite Light contracted itself into the central point, which is in the exact middle, and that light contracted, moving away to the sides surrounding the central point.
4. The space that remained after the contraction was circular. So what remained was an empty space, air, and a vacant void, from the central point itself. And this contraction was a perfect circle around that empty central point, in such a way that the space of that void was circular in every direction in a complete equality, and it was not in the form of a square with standing corners. This is because the Infinite contracted itself in a circular manner, equally from all sides.
5. As the Infinite Light is in equality, the contraction was also in equality, which is the secret of the circle. And the reason was that, since the light of the Infinite is perfectly equal, it necessitated that the contraction also be in perfect equality, contracting itself equally from all sides, and not more from one side than the others. It is known in the wisdom of measurement that there is no shape as equal as the shape of a circle, unlike a square with standing corners, or the shape of a triangle and other shapes. Therefore, the contraction of the Infinite had to be in the form of a circle.

Chapter 2

1.<b>Explaining that the light of the Infinite continued a line of light to the worlds, which emanated and were created in the space that contracted. And within it are five aspects:<b> From the Infinite, a line of light extended into the space. Now, after the mentioned contraction, which left a space with empty air and void in the midst of the light of the Infinite as described above, there was already a place where the emanated and the created could exist. At that point, a straight line extended from the Infinite Light, descending from above to below, and it continued to unfold as it entered that space.</b></b>
2.  The fire of the line touches the Infinite, and its end is limitless. The top of the line extends from the Infinite itself and touches it, although the end of this line below, at its conclusion, does not touch the light of the Infinite.
3. The line, soft, spreads the light of the Infinite to the worlds, and through this line, the light of the Infinite continues to extend and spread downward.
4. All the worlds are in that contracted space, and in that space, He emanated, created, formed, and made all the worlds.
5. Before the contraction, He and His name were one, and no intellect could comprehend Him. * Gate of the sayings of our Sages, Shabbat, regarding 'and to understand'. Prior to these four worlds, there was the Infinite, He is One and His name is One, in a wondrous and concealed unity, for there is no power, even in the closest angels to Him, and they have no understanding of the Infinite, for there is no created intellect that can comprehend Him, as He has no place, boundary, or name.

And the second aspect is that after the face (<i>partzuf</i>) itself of Rachel is rectified through the charity and gifts to the poor, there still needs to an enlightenment occurring within her, in the secret of its actual minds that are clothed within the face of her ten emanations at the time of slumber, as is known. So it is necessary for this enlightenment in her minds just mentioned to remain for all of these days called Purim, and to remain in existence there even if the minds of Father and Mother (<i>Abba veIma</i>) depart after the slumber and return to being face to face. But even with all of this, the enlightenment of those minds must remain in existence in her minds and not completely depart as at other times, as mentioned above. But this matter is dependent upon fulfillment of another commandment, and that is to have a Purim meal, a party and a joyous occasion.
