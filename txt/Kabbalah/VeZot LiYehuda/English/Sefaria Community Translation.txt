VeZot LiYehuda



A letter and this to Yehuda,
A letter that Rabbi Avraham Abulafia sent to Rabbi Yehuda known as Shalmon:
Love righteousness and hate wickedness, because of God's play, the fat of your friends, the righteous will never die and the wicked will not dwell in the earth, righteous and evil to him evil and good to him, wicked and evil to him righteous and good to him.  , my eyes are a burden to my soul from all the daughters of my city, hunt me like a bird, my enemies are empty, they are in the hole of my life, and water overflows over my head, you said I was taken away, I called your name from a pit of saucers, my voice you heard, do not close your ear to my spirit in my time, you have sacrificed  On the day of Ikraach you said do not be afraid, O Lord, my soul's adversary, redeemed my life, O Lord, you have seen my trials, you have judged my judgments, you have seen all their vengeance, all their thoughts against me:
