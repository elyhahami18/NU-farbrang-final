Introduction



Every single person amongst human beings hopes. And were it not that he hopes for something in the future, all of his thoughts, actions, and words would be for naught. However, since he does hope and await for the goal of the thoughts of his hope, he does think many thoughts, performs actions, and speaks words, so that he will come to the goal of his hope. But his hopes are also not [all] equal. Rather, they are on all sorts of various levels that differ very very much from one another. And this difference is generated by desire and by thought.
However, no sage has any desire besides that for wisdom and anything that leads to it, just like no fool has any desire besides that for laziness. So there is already a big disagreement between these two extremes: For one is truly most lofty, and the other is, without a doubt, most lowly. And the disagreement is that the fool will praise foolish matters. That is, even though he will not call them foolish, since the word foolish for him is also commonly agreed to indicate lowliness. However, he will change the name of foolishness and call it something else, which indicates something lofty to him. That is like someone who whores does not call his action evil, but instead calls it a great delight for himself.  Likewise, the fool will call foolishness knowledge and understanding, according to how his lowly thinking will formulate [them]. Yet because the sage [knows] that he is very much lacking the righteousness to describe the true value of wisdom, he is only able to praise it with comparisons beneath its actual value. If so, behold that the intentions are the opposite, the desires strange, and the hopes extraneous. For the hope of the fool is to be rewarded with a very lowly reward when he happens to do one of the commandments. As he would only do a commandment when [its] value is not foreign to him, since he does not recognize the virtue of its performance as he cannot recognize its true supernal reward. 
But the hope of the sage is one alone in everything that he hopes to be rewarded for it; and that is more wisdom every single day. And when it comes to him every day, he appreciates that God is granting him a great reward, as He strengthens his very soul and constantly raises it up from one thing to another and from one reward to another. And is the first reward not that God strengthens his heart and his effort to hunger for wisdom and hungrily hope to become wise by way of his great efforts and his diligent study according to that which it is fitting to study at the times that he has fixed to study wisdom? Hence when you see someone who hungers to know the truth for the honor of truthful elevation, it is impossible that his hunger will not burn with the fire of hunger when he studies the Sefer HeHoshek [The Book of the Hungry One, a reference to Sefer HaHeshek], which fires up the hearts of the lovers of God. And their reward will be great in the increase of the flow of the existence of wisdom for which they hunger. All the more so, when it comes to prophetic wisdom which are taught by the [divine] names that orchestrate reality, like those that we have hinted to in the first section, and which I will further hint to in these two sections.































Since God has made all this known to you, in that you are contemplating His work with your understanding, there is none so discerning and wise as you [alluding to Genesis 41:39]. And behold, if you do seek Him, He will make Himself present for you. But if you leave Him, He will forsake you forever. And likewise is it written, <i>the Lord is with you as long as you are with Him. If you turn to Him, He will make Himself present for you, but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you</i> (II Chronicles 15:2). And his final request and demand from us: He said that the attainment of prophecy which he spoke to us about is an easy way to grasp His conception, may He be blessed; all of it is actually through the combination of the letters, which itself is a way to know His names and to know His traits. And God made him know that He began all of his deeds with them and ended His work with them, and we have endless Torah proofs about this.
