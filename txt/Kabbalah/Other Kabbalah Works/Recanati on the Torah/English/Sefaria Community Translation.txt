Recanati on the Torah

Bereshit



Noach

























  And they said: “Let us build for us a city and a tower” etc. [Genesis 11:4]. The city mentioned is a small city, as you say “and the name of the small one [is] Rachel” [Genesis 29:16)]. And the tower is “a tower of strength is the name of HaShem” (Proverbs 18:10). And this “and his top in heaven [Genesis 11:4] alludes to the uppermost heavens. “And let us make for us a name” [Genesis 11:4]. The one who knows the explanation of “name”, recognizes their evil thought. Because they wanted to separate the Shekinah from the building, and in the separation were the forces of impurity, flowing in her [the Shekinah] from the contamination of the snake, and this is “and let us burn [them] to fire-hardened bricks” [Genesis 11:3]. In the secret of “The house of our holiness and our splendor became a conflagration of fire” (Isaiah 64:10) and in the secret of “because he has made unclean the sanctuary of HaShem” [Numeri 19:20]. “And the brick was for them as stone” [Genesis 11:3]. This secret is known to you in the secret of the Dimensions of the Body [Shi’ur Qomah]. And I cannot explain it. And the stone is the Stone of Foundation, and they were giving a small dimension against a large one. And after they had built the city and the tower according to their shape, they said to make for them a name to be conducted by it, so that they would not be given into the hand of an other leader.

"And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land." The great Rabbi of blessed memory wrote: I will tell you a general principle that you should understand in all the upcoming Torah portions about the forefathers, and it is a significant matter that our Sages, of blessed memory, hinted at briefly. They said, "Everything that happened to the forefathers is a sign for the children." Therefore, the Torah extends the descriptions of the journeys, the digging of wells, and other events. One might think they are unnecessary details without purpose, but all of them come to teach about the future. For when an event occurs to one of the three Patriarchs, it symbolizes something destined to happen to their descendants. And know that every decree of the heavenly watchers, when it transitions from the force of the decree into a symbolic act, will be fulfilled without fail. Therefore, prophets often perform symbolic acts in their prophecies, as in the case of Jeremiah, who commanded Baruch, "When you have finished reading this book, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates and say, 'So shall Babylon sink.'" And similarly with Elisha, who placed his hand on the bow and said, "Shoot," and when the arrow was shot, he said, "An arrow of deliverance from the Lord." And it is written, "The man of God was angry with him and said, 'You should have struck five or six times,'" etc. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Abraham to hold possession of the land and made for him symbolic acts of everything that would happen to his descendants in the future. Understand this. The meaning of "And the Canaanite was then in the land" is to hint at the heavenly ruler over them, as I have already explained in the secret of the division of nations.

The great and exalted God is speaking to Moses; He saith to him, that he should come up to Jehovah, which is Metatron, who is oftentimes called with the name of God, alluding to the שכינה, the glory of the Lord, which is thus called. And the reason why he saith Come up, is as if he had said: Ascend to the place of glory, where there is the Angel, the Redeemer; because no one can come from the great God: for (it is written in Exodus 34:20) "There shall no man see Me and live."

You shall bring forward your brother Aaron, with his sons, from among the Israelites, to serve Me as priests, Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Itamar, the sons of Aharon: You already know that there is no sacrifice sacrificed without priests, Levites and Israelites, since they correspond to the three forefathers. Priests are from <i>Chesed</i> (Kindness). Hence, they atone, as 'iniquity is atoned by kindness.' And it is written (Isaiah 1:18), "Be your sins like crimson, they can turn snow-white." Levites are from the power of <i>Gevurah</i> (&lt;might]). hence,="" they="" are="" appointed="" over="" the="" song.="" and="" because="" they="" correspond="" to="" 'arms="" everlasting'="" (the="" mystical="" traits="" of="" &lt;i=""&gt;Chesed and <i>Gevurah</i>, that which is proper with this one is disqualified with that one. It is like our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said in Chullin (24a:7), "That which is fit with the priests is disqualified with the Levites, that which is fit with the Levites is disqualified with the priests." The Israelites are from the power of Mercy, which is called the Holy Elder Israel. It is about this matter that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said [that] the priests, the Levites, and the Israelites [are all] indispensable for the sacrifice. In the Book of the Zohar (source not found): The priests, the Levites and the Israelites were together in all of the shifts. They all stood over the sacrifice to connect it with connections and to bring down blessings to the worlds; the [Israelite] shifts with prayer, the priests with [the offerings of] His will and the Levites with song. The shifts would arouse it for that pure thought to go up, the priests would arouse the Right [side] to embrace it [and] the Levites would arouse the Left [side] with mercy to unify with it. It is like you say (Song of Songs 2:6), "His left hand was under my head." And like this, the aroma [of the sacrifice] may become intertwined, one with the other, to connect one with the other. And this spirit is that of the Wife with Her Husband, such that all of the other forces eat, benefit and grow from Them. We learned that they [thus] grow and arise. And all [this] is from the secret of Israelites, priests and Levites, as you can see (end of quote). And do not wonder how it is that Aharon came out of the power of the Levites which is the trait of strict Divine justice, since he is the opposite of their trait. As this is the way of the Holy One, blessed be He, may He be exalted. He brings out fire from water and water from fire; He brings out sweet water from salt water; and from the power of bitterness, there does He shine His wonder to refine.

Because today Ad-nai will appear to you. You already know that the Names are sometimes in the masculine and sometimes in the feminine. And so "if You [fem] do this to me" (Numbers 11:15). And they said: feminine and masculine are hints to the characteristic of compassion and the characteristic of judgment. And since the characteristic of judgment receives its emanation [atzilut] from the characteristic of compassion, therefore they called male this compassion, and female this judgment. And she is the shepherdess of the Song of Songs, and the hint - behold, the characteristic of judgment touched Nadav and Avihu, as we explain regarding the decree of El. This is why it is written after "and the Glory/Honor of God appeared to them". There are those who explain this through 'Oh Ad-nai, may You appoint peace for us' (Isaiah 26:12) and the end of the verse proves it: 'You have also requited all our misdeeds' it is a hint to the characteristic of judgment, that separated from sexual transgressions, and so too "if You count transgressions, Yah" (Psalms 130:3), the feminine is hidden, and you know that the Name Yah is a hint to the Shechinah. Our sages said regarding this verse that David said in front of the Holy One of Blessing: Master of the Universe! You give me to an angel that does not show favor! If you keep count of sins, Yah, Ad-nai, who can stand?!' And you know that this characteristic is called angel, and this is what they said regarding the fiery sword that revolves 'some times men, sometimes women' (see Bereshit Rabbah 21:9) therefore our sages z"l called the expression 'shechinah' as feminine. It would be appropriate for the Shechinah to make ten travels 'the Shechinah travel, went up' (Rosh Hashanah 31a) and in the Midrash Mishlei the Shechinah fell in front of the Holy One of Blessing. And the secret of this issue is that even when between the Names there is a distinction between the characteristics of judgment and of compassion, they are all combined and included on each other, as our sages said in the Sefer HaZohar (Zohar 3:30b) There is no crown of all the crowns of the King that does not include both good and evil, and because of that the characteristic of judgment expands onto compassion, or the opposite, because if they were not included on each other it would be impossible for them to switch places, until the first one is cancelled, and then a new creation would be created. This is the knowledge of the masters of Kabbalah and it is right, and I already wrote in a different issue regarding the secret of upsiding connected to Sdom.

And the reason for <i>and you shall call to it in peace</i> is like that which our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Vayikra Rabba 9:9), “Great is peace as, even in times of war, we [need] peace, as it is stated: <i>[…] you shall call to it in peace</i>.” And the reason that one should not distance oneself from acts of kindness during wartime is so that the trait of strict justice not become harsh, like the idea of, <i>lest the wild animals increase against you</i> (Deuteronomy 7:22). And [concerning] the reason for <i>do not destroy its trees</i>, you already know the statement of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed (|Bereishit Rabbah 10:6), “There is not a single blade of grass below, etc.” So behold, when he destroys it below, he injures [what corresponds to it] above. However if it does not bear fruit, its strength has already ceased [and can be cut down]. And understand the statement of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed (Bava Kamma 91b:19), “My son Shivchat only died becuase he cut down a fig tree before its time.” And that is [the meaning of] <i>for is man a tree of the field</i>, according to its straightforward understanding. And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said in Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer (34:4), “When people cut down the wood of the tree which yields fruit, its cry goes from one end of the world to the other, and the voice is inaudible, and […] likewise when the soul departs from the body.”
