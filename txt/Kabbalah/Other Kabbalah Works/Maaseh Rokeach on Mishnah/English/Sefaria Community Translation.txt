Maasrot

Tractate Ma'asrot has 5 chapters. The first letters of each of those chapters has the numerical value of 40 and the numerical value of the last letters in each of those chapters is 496. All these details need to be explained.
It appears to me, once we know that the previous tractate [ed. see introduction to Tractate Terumot above] corresponds to the 12 tribes, and also since it is well known that in all the Midrashim the Tribe of Levi is called "maaser" from the tribes (being as Jacob swore an oath to "give maaser from all that [God] gives me", he therefore separated Levi as "maaser"). Based on this, I feel forced to ask a question: In the Talmud, Tractate Ketubot (50a) teaches that a person should not give more than a fifth of his wealth to charity and brings a proof from Jacob who said "Aser Eh'asreinu" which the Talmud interprets to mean a fifth [ed. as opposed to merely a tenth as the simple reading implies]. If this is so, how could Jacob have fulfilled his oath by only sanctifying Levi [ed. which would be one tenth of his sons] when he vowed to sanctify one fifth [ed. ie. two children out of ten]?

Another correct reason that the erasure of Amalek is 166 words in the Torah and that there are 166 verses in the Scroll of Esther can be said as follows: It is known that Esther is the secret of the Divine Presence, the trait of Kingship (<i>Malkhut</i>) in the secret of, "and Esther wore royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments" (Esther 5:1). And this is the secret of (Chullin 139b:12), "From where in the Torah is Esther? 'And I will surely hide (<i>haster astir)' (Deuteronomy 31:17–18)." And the word, <i>astir, spelled full adds up to [a numerical equivalent] of 671, like the count of the name, <i>Ado-nai</i>, with its filling (each letter being spelled out), as is known (in the same way that 166 corresponded to an alternative count of the parallel name of God). And in my humble opinion, it appears that it is for this reason that there are ten sections in the Scroll, to complete the number of Esther, [to] Esther 10. For the Scroll is called the Scroll of Esther - and with the additional ten, it adds up to 671, to indicate her virtue, as she was with the secret of the higher Kingship, <i>Ado-nai</i>, with its filling</i></i>

And this is the secret of the Mishnah, "[If] one married a woman in Cappadocia" — meaning the Holy One, blessed be He, who married the Jewish people, and the marriage was in the tabernacle, which is Cappadocia — "and divorced her in the land of Israel." Even though it was not a complete divorce between the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Jewish people, it was nevertheless similar to a divorce, as we will write below, with the assistance of God, in Tractate Gittin.

And let us return to the content of our tractate to explain the precise inferences with which we began. Behold, at first glance, the words of the commentators seem strange when they ask from one verse to the other — Isaiah said: <i>Where is the bill of divorce of your mother </i>(Isaiah 50:1); whereas Jeremiah said: <i>and I handed her a bill of divorce</i> (Jeremiah 3:8), as I have brought above. But what is their difficulty? Behold, Isaiah was before Jeremiah, as is well known. Hence in the days of Isaiah, there was truly still no divorce bill. But afterward, in the days of Jeremiah, when they had filled up their measure [of sin], and the time approached 852 years, He divorced them. And that is why Jeremiah said: <i>and I handed her a bill of divorce</i>. But [this] can be resolved. As one who looks carefully at the verse there in Jeremiah 3 will see that [those words] are discussing the ten tribes which were already exiled. And even though the expression, "and I handed," is [actually] about the future [since it is only the conversive conjunction that makes <i>eten</i> past tense], this is the way of prophecies as is well known. And the ten [northern] tribes had already been exiled in the days of Hoshea ben Elah, who was in the days of King Hezekiah of Judea. And Isaiah was still alive then, as is well known, since Manasseh killed him. Hence it is truly difficult. And one could discuss this further, but here is not the place to discuss this at length.
But behold I will tell you something new about which I have not found any hint in earlier books. However, it is something that my heart is telling me, according to the hints I will write. And if I have erred, may the good Lord atone [for me]: That according to my humble opinion, the book of Jeremiah as a whole is a bill of divorce that He gave to the Jewish people. And with this, the verse is exact. As it said: <i>I have sent her</i>, which is in the past; <i>and I handed [eten] her a bill of divorce</i>, which is in the future. However, the word, "I have sent her," refers to the ten tribes, and [that] sending away was without a bill of divorce. For the time had not yet come close to the 852 years. But when the time comes, then <i>I [will hand] her a bill of divorce</i>, and that is [Jeremiah's] book.

And it follows that the reason for all of those, "two that are four," is understood. It is that there are two [precepts] from the Torah, and the sages, may their memory be blessed, added another two. And likewise, anything like this. But, at first glance, this is difficult — how is it that they had the right to add on to the commandments of the Torah? However, it is that many ideas, hints, and secrets are included in each and every letter of the Torah, and they merited to understand it. And everything they added is all understood in the Torah for the one who merits to understand it. And that is why the words of the [rabbis] are as stringent as the words of the Torah. And it is as I wrote in Tractate Makkot, that the word, Makkot, with the full spelling of the letters, <i>mem, mem; caf, alef, peh; vav, yod, vav; and tav, yod, vav</i> add up to 619. And with the word itself, it is 620, like the count of the 613 commandments of the Torah and the seven rabbinic commandments. That is to say that they are all equal in punishment, and likewise concerning reward. And I have written somewhat at length to remove [the idea] from the hearts of the wanton ones, that the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed, are light in their eyes.
