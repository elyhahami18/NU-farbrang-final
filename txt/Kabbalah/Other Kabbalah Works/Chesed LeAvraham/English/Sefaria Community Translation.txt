To explain the attire of angels upon their descent to the material world and how they manifest visually:
It is said that there is a faction among researchers regarding demons who completely deny their existence, and this is the deceptive faction. However, there is another faction that believes in the existence of demons and claims that they are composed of two fundamental elements: fire and air. Ramban, may his memory be blessed, extensively discussed this in the chapter Acharei Mot. Just as demons are sometimes visible and known to certain people, angels, whose essence is the simple soul, descend to the lower world through the foundation of fire and air. They clothe themselves in a body composed of the two fundamental elements: fire and air. This garment is a subtle clothing visible to the discerning eye, resembling a material object.Upon their departure from the material world, these two fundamental elements will separate, with the spiritual soul ascending to its place. The spiritual fire within that material garment is a fire that consumes and contracts within that same attire, which will be inhabited by the four fundamental elements. It will not burn because of the screen constituted by these two elements within it.

River 18 - To explain that the total of all the souls of Israel are 600,000:
Know that the total of all the souls are 600,000, and the Torah is the root of the souls of Israel, and therefore there are correspondingly 600,000 interpretations, so that according to each one of the interpretations, from there one Israelite soul root came into being. And in the future to come, each and every member of Israel will read and know the whole Torah according to the interpretation that reaches their root by which they were created, and that is how it is in the Garden of Eden. Actually, there are souls that include multiple interpretations, and indeed, the soul of Moses our teacher, peace be upon him, included all 600,000, and thus he knew all 600,000 interpretations.
Also at night, while sleeping, anyone who merits to rise up, reads there the interpretation that reaches their root, and all according to their deeds.
And know that the divine master, our honorable teacher the master, our rav Isaac Luria Ashkenazi, may his memory be for life in the world to come, would see on a person’s forehead the verse and the interpretation belonging to them according to their soul, and would explain it to them so that their soul would rise up endlessly, and other things would be revealed to them, which the corporeal could not sense. And know that the 600,000 interpretations mentioned are according to the <i>peshat</i> (the simple meaning), and opposite them there are also 600,000 in <i>aggadah</i> (oral legend) and opposite them, 600,000 in <i>kabbalah</i> (received wisdom), and so on, so that there is no soul that is not included out of all of them. –Our teacher, the master Isaac Ashkenazi, may his memory be for life in the world to come, and this is what he taught.

"River 28" - Regarding the matter of engaging in Torah without understanding and without inquiry:
"Know that if you engage in the study of Torah all your days without understanding it, but only read it, then in this way you are eating the wheat with its bran and the brain with its husk. The questions of halakha are like the husks, and you are obligated to ask and break the husks to extract the essence, to resolve and scrutinize the words, and to understand what is hidden. Concerning one who is meticulous in this, it is said that he will cause others to wait for him, as mentioned in the Zohar. To study Torah in this manner, without understanding, is to mix the sacred with the mundane and the mundane with the sacred. Of such a person it is said, 'And he who does not add, will subtract,' and he is liable for death, for since it is in his power to engage deeply in Torah and he does not, he is strengthening the husks and allowing them to stand."
The matter to understand is that the Torah is the essence of the emanation that spreads, and it is the Divine discovery through which a person cleaves to God. The soul thus adheres to the true life's light, i.e., cleaving to His Divinity in this world and in the World to Come. This is why the verse says, "And you who cleave to the Lord your God, you are all alive today," even today, in this world, and certainly in the World to Come. The attachment requires that there be no screen that separates between you and His Torah. Since you examine His Torah and it is distant from your understanding, hidden from you by difficulties, which are the shells covering the Torah and hiding it from the eye of your intellect, behold, the shells are an "iron curtain" between you and it. Therefore, if the desire for love is rooted in your heart to cleave to Him, you must seek out the obstacles to break and annul them, and cleave to the concealed Torah within those shells. One who does this is indeed attached to the utmost level of attachment. This is the great separation that brings you closer to God, without a partition separating you from His Torah. Even if you do so, when you separate your thoughts from the Torah and from studying it, you are immediately considered like one of the other people regarding cleaving to God, because your cleaving to Him only occurs when you think about His Torah. However, if you separate your thoughts from it, then the shells are readily available to be found between you and Him. This is why our Sages prohibited a Torah scholar from standing in an unclean place. This is so that he does not separate his thoughts because at that time, when he speaks with the Torah, it is prohibited to separate his thoughts. The thought in the Torah is there. In the interpretation, they explained that in the act of the Torah of Rabbi Khiya, which refers to the Torah scholar, as in such a case, the thoughts in the bathroom will be considered his degradation and the disgrace of his body. Who are you to boast about this? In truth, you indeed humble the shells and everything to be attached to sanctity and to His Divinity, and the outsiders should not separate between you and the attachment.
Especially when a person enters the realm of holiness and seeks the wonderful attachment through the study of Torah, he should consider that his sins cause him, God forbid, many obstacles and difficulties. The person needs to strengthen himself against these challenges to overcome them so that they do not separate him from his Creator. According to the explanation in the Tikkunim, when a person sees that the difficulties become strong before him in halachic matters, he should understand that they are the shells that create separation between him and his Creator. He should recognize that his own sins have caused these difficulties. Then, he should strengthen himself through repentance, engagement in the commandments, acts of charity, constant study, and then he will gain understanding.
When a person reviews and engages with a matter, repeatedly studying and contemplating it many times, this is the cause for breaking the shells. This is because the Torah, in the secret of "Bil Peh," is comprised of the actual letters fixed in a person's mouth, which materialize in the air and ascend from the realm of "Ayin" to "Yesh." Through this ascent, which connects to its root, it is beyond doubt that these letters ascend, cleave the air, open upward, and adhere to the one engaging in the Divine, bestowing understanding and precision. Thus, the person grasps that which was not initially within their capacity to understand. This is simple, and this is the meaning.

Nahar 29

River 29 - To explain the divisions of the Torah
The concept here is that there are two parts in the Torah. One is the secret of Atzilut (Emanation), which encompasses the realm of Malchut and above. The other is the secret of Creation, Formation, and Action. Now, as for the secret of the Torah, in the realm of Malchut and above, a person has no ability to add anything to it. The only place for addition is in the secret of Renewed Prophecy, which emerges in the prophets who reveal its secrets. This is not dependent on the majority but rather follows the Higher Kabbalah (Kaballah HaElionah). They oversee the Bat Kol (heavenly voice), which is the Malchut (Kingdom) in its secrets, and the matter depends on it. A person has no right to add anything contrary to the Kabbalah, except through a prophet and according to the heavenly voice, as was the case with Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and his colleagues who descended to the Merkavah (Chariot) and comprehended hidden matters in the secrets [according to the tradition of compiling of the text of the Zohar].
Indeed, the Torah, which pertains to the three worlds in the realm of Beri'ah (Creation), is entrusted to the lower realms, from the right and from the left. In Beri'ah, there is the secret of the Hall of Hewn Stone, where the Sanhedrin of seventy is located, and everything depends on the majority there. Therefore, concerning this aspect of the Torah in Beri'ah, it is written: "If a matter is too difficult for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between judgment and judgment, or between lesion and lesion, matters of dispute in your cities, then you shall rise up and go to the place which the Lord your God chooses." (Deuteronomy 17:8). When there is doubt about one of these judgments, all the sages of Israel shall gather, and they shall adjudicate according to the majority, for the matter depends on this. They do not rely on the supervision of a Bat Kol, but rather on the Torah of Atzilut, where all the decrees are not based on the majority, but everything depends on the decree of the Holy One, blessed be He.
Furthermore, there is another distinction, and that is that the Torah in Beri'ah (Creation) lacks the power to nullify any arguments at all. The reason for this is that the disagreement is the secret of the hard shell (kelipah), and the kelipah has the power to ascend in all three worlds of Beri'ah. Likewise, regarding the secret of exile, it is said in Tikunei HaZohar 146, that this is because there is no power to resolve the disagreements and to clarify the coarseness. It is said, "A question to so-and-so (piloni) is a question," even though his words are the words of the living God [true judgments handed down by the Sanhedrein are still questioned due to extraneous forces]. 
Nevertheless, there, the kelipah strengthens itself, and there is no power to nullify it at all. However, from the side of the Daughter of the King, which is the Torah of Atzilut, it is said, "I am the Lord, that is My name," and there is no difficulty or Talmud Tikunim 146 at all in it, as it has the power to nullify the kelipah.

Nahar 30


The order of study is as follows: The Scriptures are divided into three parts – Torah, Prophets, and Writings. Then comes the Mishnah, and the Beraisa, and the Tosefta, which is the Oral Torah. After that, there is the Book of the Torah of the Kohanim, which contains 22 chapters, corresponding to the 22 words in the Ten Commandments. One who merits and engages with this book is blessed with blessings corresponding to the number of its sections, and it is considered as if they fulfilled the entire Torah. The Almighty guards them at all times and in all places. Next is the fourth level, which includes the Talmud Yerushalmi, Talmud Bavli, the Midrashim, and the Aggadot. Then, the fifth level is Kabbalah, which includes the work of Creation (Ma'Aseh Breisheit), the work of the Chariot (Ma'Aseh Merkavah), the measurement of the stature (Sh'iur Komah), and the Throne of Glory (Kisei HaKavod).
Know that anyone who delves into Aggadah has the power to forgive all the sins of the people of Israel. Furthermore, if one adds and says the Kaddish over the Aggadah, all their sins are forgiven, even if the decree of judgment has been sealed. The Holy One, blessed be He, forgives and atones for their sins. Likewise, one who listens to a discourse from the mouth of a wise person in the wisdom of Kabbalah, which is called Aggadah, will have all their sins forgiven.
Know that the Name Yud-Hei of the Aleph-Bet, which is attained from the first level of study, the Scripture, grants the soul inclusion of six sparks, signifying the complete letter Aleph. One who attains the Scripture and the Mishnah obtains the comprehension of the soul and spirit. The soul includes six of the 7 sparks, while the spirit includes 13 sparks, symbolizing the numerical value of the Aleph-Vav, alluding to the Torah.
Among them all, there are 19 sparks. One who also reaches the level of the third, which is the wisdom of Aggadah, hinted at in Bina, the first Aleph, attains the completeness of the soul, composed of 40 sparks, corresponding to the numerical value of the Aleph, and among them are 25 sparks.
One who attains the level of the fourth, which is the completeness of the true wisdom, attains the soul of the soul, which includes 20 sparks, corresponding to the numerical value of Yud, signifying the attribute of wisdom. Among them all, there are 45 sparks, as is the secret of Adam, Man, representing the name Yud-Hei of the 45 sparks, and you shall know this from which reason he is called Adam. This is the secret of the letter Mem-Shin-Lamed. From the book of handwritten notes.

Nahar 31


The matter, according to how a person draws near to the service, is that one attaches to the secret of eternal life. If they attach themselves to the primary level of the Scripture, they will connect to the secret of the Spirit of the Lord clothed in the wheels (Ophanim). If they attach to the secondary level of the Mishnah, they will connect to the secret of eternal life clothed in the living beings (Chaiyot). If they attach to the tertiary level of the Talmud, they will connect to the soul of the Lord [the first] that manifests within the Seraphim. This is the secret that a person should "sell all that they have" and take a daughter of a Torah scholar, for this commandment has no measure, for it is the vessel to cleave to the Lord and draw near to Him, and thus it has no measure. Therefore, all of one's possessions will not be compared to it, and therefore, one should "sell all that they have" and take a daughter of a Torah scholar, for from her, they will attach. This is the commandment "and cleave to Him," as mentioned earlier. It is known that one cannot cleave to the soul except through the spirit, and not even with the spirit except through the soul. Therefore, our Sages said that one who cannot find a daughter of a Torah scholar should marry the daughter of schoolteachers, who are from the primary level of the Scripture. Similarly, the daughter of charity collectors who possess a soul. In this manner, they should diligently pursue until they attach as much as possible. The reason is that a person can only draw the eternal life through their attachment to the Almighty, as in, "You that cleave unto the Lord your God, you are alive everyone of you this day." (Deuteronomy 4:4) According to how one attaches, so they merit eternal life.
The matter is that a person possesses free will and choice. If they improve their actions and reach the primary level of the Scripture, they will merit the soul, and behold, the life that clothes itself in them from the level of the Wheels. If they further merit to be from the secondary level of the Mishnah, they will ascend to the level of the Living Beings. If they then also merit the tertiary level of the Talmud, they will ascend to the level of the Seraphim, having the life clothed in them from the level of the Seraphim.
When they further merit to be from the primary level of Kabbalah, from the concealed Torah, they will ascend to the level of Atzilut (Emanation) and merit the lights of Atzilut. All of this is conditioned upon their actions surpassing their wisdom. On this matter, it is said, "And you that cleave unto the Lord your God, you are alive everyone of you this day." When you cleave to the Lord, the life spreads throughout every part of you. This means all your parts, in your body, soul, spirit, and your very essence. This is the secret of "you are alive everyone of you this day." This is the secret.

Nahar 32



Nahar 33

River 33 - To reveal the secret of receiving the countenance of one's teacher, the secret of the vision of the pilgrimage, the secret of the vision of the Torah scroll, and the secret of the vision of the land of Israel.
It is worth knowing the virtue of one who views the Land of Israel from a distance, even if they do not enter it, as the Scripture states, "If a man sees among these men the land, etc." It seems that the act of seeing has its merit, and furthermore, our teacher Moses, may peace be upon him, was granted a great elevation, close to his death, when he saw the land, as it is written, "So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor; but no man knows of his sepulcher unto this day. And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended." (Deuteronomy 34:5) This teaches us that there is some elevation even for one who sees it, even if they do not enter it.
The matter will be understood from what was explained in the Zohar regarding the verse "And Joseph shall place his hand upon your eyes" in Parshat Vayelech (Genesis 46:4). The eyes are the gateway to the mental images resembling intellect. Firstly, one envisions that thing in their mind and intellect. And behold, that image is formed there. If the image is of inferior things, then the intellect should approach and lower it from its exalted state. This is the prohibition of gazing at women and forbidden sexual matters, because even if one does not consciously intend to commit a sin, eventually he will form that image in his mind and contemplate that which is improper, even if he does not engage in any negative action. The reason is that the image formed in one's mind will either corrupt the soul or refine it if it is a good image. It will lead to several good aspects in the context of spiritual work. Therefore, when a person envisions a holy image in his mind, that holy image, when contemplated, will perfect his intellect. This is the meaning of Rabbi Aba in Parshat Mishpatim, where the form of Rabbi Shimon appeared before him, and he achieved great insights as a result. This is the meaning of "And your eyes shall behold your teacher," and this is the reason why it is said, "Do not turn to idols," because it is forbidden to gaze at idolatry, for that degrading image corrupts the intellect. This is the reason it is said, "Do not gaze at the face of an evil person." (Megillah 28A) 
And not only that, but also when the form of a person is depicted in the honored intellect, he will attain great and wonderful elevation. This is the reason why our sages said that a person must receive the countenance of his teacher by standing in his place [metaphorically speaking], as he will envision himself in the intellect of his teacher. This is what our sages explained regarding the verse, "As the Lord your God lives, before whom I stood," meaning that he stood before Elijah his teacher. When one stands before Elijah, he will undoubtedly envision his own form in the mind of Elijah. And as Elijah stands and serves before his Creator, due to his intense connection with prophecy, he is found continually standing before the Lord, and the same applies to many others. This is the reason for the verse, "Your sons shall see the face of the Lord, my God," among other interpretations, for one will form the image of the male [Eli'ahu] in his mind and find it within the Shekhinah standing there. Even though the Divine Providence is everywhere, nevertheless, one should not isolate themselves to engrave their form in the Shekhinah, as they would when appearing in a holy place. This is the meaning of "And you shall not see My face in vain,"(Isaiah 45:19) and this is likewise significant in the Torah.
When a person sees their beloved, undoubtedly, they will acquire great joy in their soul, and their forms will be engraved in each other, and one in the other, due to their deep love. They will establish the image of their beloved in their intellect and their joy and love will increase. Conversely, it is the opposite with hatred. This is the reason for the prohibition "Do not see the face of evil." Similarly, this is the reason for the verse, "If a man sees among these men the land," because after they spoke negatively about the land and hated it, it is not appropriate that their forms be engraved in it, so that they won't have the opportunity to see its beauty and spirituality. For the same reason, their forms should not be engraved within them because they hate, so that they won't arouse hatred in a place of love.
However, this was not the case with our teacher Moses, peace be upon him. Instead, "And the Lord showed him all the land." The Zohar in Parshat Bereshit explains why Moses was able to see all of this, as it is impossible to comprehend all of this through physical sight. It is explained that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him with the primordial light concealed since the six days of Creation, in which one could see from the beginning of the world to the end of it. Now, with this introduction, we will further understand what is shown in the text of the Torah to the people. This matter is also done in the Heavenly Temple, as mentioned in the Zohar in Parshat Balak.

Nahar 34

The concept is that the souls in the Garden of Eden bring concise teachings from the upper levels, which are brief like "Mishnah." Afterward, they expound with explanations, like the Talmud. This is their give and take. Those who wander with their intellect in the comprehension of these matters in this world through their learning will then understand more in the world to come and will become the head of a yeshiva for many who did not succeed as he did. This is the meaning of the beginning of the statement in the Zohar.

Nahar 35

River 35 - to explain the secret that a wise person is superior to a prophet
The matter is that prophecy for the prophets emanates from the lower two sefirot, Netzach and Hod, which are eternity and glory. It is known that when a prophet experiences prophecy, all his faculties and senses are nullified, and he has no ability to comprehend through the vision of prophecy except for what is designated for him from above. At that moment, his mind is not directed towards questioning or challenging why this or why that. Rather, it aligns itself with the Divine will overflowing upon him during his prophecy. The investigative choice is taken away from him, and he almost lacks cognitive faculties at that moment, only to understand the specific matter. However, he will not scrutinize it.
This is unlike the wise person who possesses knowledge and understanding and chooses to investigate a matter using his selected intellect. The reason for this distinction is that the role of the wise person is an addition from above to prophecy, as prophecy originates from the lower two sefirot, as mentioned earlier. The wisdom of the wise person, rooted in the secrets of Binah, Chochmah, and Da'at, surpasses the knowledge found in prophecy. Therefore, the insight that the wise person attains in the realm of divinity is more distinguished in these aspects than the insight attained by the prophet. Even though the prophet may see and comprehend "eye to eye," the heart perceives much wisdom and knowledge, meaning intellectual and thoughtful capacity, much more than prophecy. The reason is that the scheming of the wise person and his choice are in his hands to consult and investigate according to his understanding. This is not the case with the prophet, as his choice is nullified during his prophecy.
Another reason is that the soul of Moses, our teacher, may peace be upon him, whose rank is higher than all the prophets, spreads into the souls of righteous and wise individuals clothed in the physical body in the lower world. The abundance of his wisdom spreads in them like the radiance of the sun spreading among the stars. Through the power of Moses, peace be upon him, they comprehend and renew in Torah.

Nahar 36

River 36 - In the secret of our sages, that each individual from the people of Israel has a share in the Torah and in the level of our teacher Moses, may peace be upon him.
Afterward, as previously mentioned, since the klipot (impure forces) create a separation between a person and the Torah, which is essentially between a person and the divine, it is fitting to say that the one who is more attached is the one who is more discerning. Accordingly, Moses, our teacher, may peace be upon him, who was more attached to divinity, comprehended more in the Torah than anyone in the world. As he is the teacher for all of Israel in general and for all the prophets, it is appropriate to say that what Moses, our teacher, innovated in the Torah is what we renew, and there is nothing new in it that he did not know through the goodness of his intellect. This is the intention of our sages when they say, "Even what an experienced student will innovate in the future was already said to Moses, our teacher, may peace be upon him." 
Indeed, it is true that if Moses, our teacher, may peace be upon him, wanted to reveal to us the Merkavah (Divine chariot) and much more, he would have innovated for us more and more than Ezekiel the prophet. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Moses, our teacher, may peace be upon him, and said to him, "Know that a prophet will arise for Israel from such and such a family, and this is his prophecy, and from your strength and influence, he will prophesy thus and thus." But He did not give Moses, our teacher, may peace be upon him, permission to reveal that secret until Ezekiel came and revealed it to us through him. All of this pertains to the entire Torah, which we renew in it, including the explanations, laws, and resolving difficulties, as there is a time for every desire. This is similar to the Song of Songs, which was revealed by Solomon the King, may peace be upon him, during the construction of the Temple, and the like.
The secret in this is that it is known that the Torah, the souls, and time are the sefirot that revolve upwards in one matter and share one attribution. For time is the secret of the rotation of the sefirot, with a certain count of sefirot during the day, a different count during the night, and another count on the Sabbath. The time from the creation of the world until the rotation of the sefirot is not the time that continues to revolve; rather, it is only new aspects, as the order of times has no end. According to this, the secret of the Torah is that even if all the righteous of the world, both in this world and in the world to come, were to stand from the time of the first man's birth until now, they would forever increase knowledge on top of their existing knowledge, gaining more and more. They will continue to gain and progress in understanding, with no limit, as it has no end. This is the breadth of Your commandments. Therefore, the secret of the souls is that there is no limit to their reincarnation, and they continuously emerge and renew. Each soul brings a unique aspect of the Torah, as every soul is superior from a known perspective, from a perspective without end.
As the righteous engage in Torah, teaching and sharing, 'This part of the Torah is renewed in this way, and that part is renewed in another way,' the higher aspects and the light of one soul unite with another. This is the supreme perfection, beyond which there is nothing higher. It is the unity and connection of the chambers in the sefirot. This aligns with the saying of our sages that 'a word said in the name of its speaker brings redemption to the world,' as it truly illuminates that aspect, revealing the source and adding to the Torah and unity.
It is known that one will not find in the branch what is not found in the root. After this is established, one may wonder why this light is not revealed through the root, which is from Moshe our teacher, peace be upon him, but rather it is revealed through a specific branch and not another. The reason is that there is a relation between that light and its revelation through that specific branch, and it will not be revealed through another. Just as all the secrets are included in the TaT (Talmud Torah, study of Torah), which is the essence of the Torah, and spread from it through the secret of the branches, revealing through a specific branch, the same applies to the Torah in the secret of the souls.
The soul of Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, encompasses everything and is revealed through a specific soul, revealing a specific aspect. Everything is revealed through the soul of Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, which is the root of the higher aspects. When a certain soul, dependent on a specific branch, reveals a certain secret at a certain time, it is revealed through that specific branch. Everything is revealed through the root, which is Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, the TaT, and the time of the giving of the Torah. At that time, the Torah's secret and the TaT spread and reveal as a whole. Thus, it becomes clear that nothing is renewed in the Torah that is not revealed through Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him."


Nahar 37

Regarding the explanation of the secret of the influence of the soul of Moses, peace be upon him, and its appearance in the souls of the wise disciples:
Even in our time, the soul of Moses, may he rest in peace, spreads within the souls, illuminates them, and imparts the secret of the Torah. Although he is concealed and clothed in the secret of exile, he illuminates the souls of the living with the secret of his vitality and the light of his Torah, which spreads and branches out in all souls.
The concept is that the kingship of Moses, peace be upon him, over Israel is spiritual, like the soul's dominion over the body, just as the soul reigns over the body, spreading to all its organs, and no limb moves without its energy. Similarly, the soul of Moses will radiate into the soul of Israel, who are like one body. Just as the moon's light is the sun's light, the light of the Torah that illuminates the disciples, even in these generations, is the light of the Torah of Moses, peace be upon him. That is why we call him 'our Rabbi.'
However, the flow and light from Moses, peace be upon him, to the disciples is not like the moon or stars that shine directly from the sun. Rather, it is through various intermediaries, similar to the way a tree draws moisture through its roots. This means that Moses, peace be upon him, illuminated in the generations of the wilderness and the speaking generations, and the children of the children after them. So, generation after generation, the light reached all those who were alive at the time.

Nahar 38

Nahar 38 - Revealing the secret of performing the commandments in the time of exile:
The matter is that during the exile, the light of the commandments of Israel does not shine as it should. But in the time of redemption, the commandments will shine, bringing joy to those who mourn over them. The light of all the commandments, which is found and concealed in their performance, remains hidden until the time of the Final Redemption.

Nahar 39

.Nahar 39 - Differentiating among people in the performance of the commandments:
The concept is that people are distinguished concerning the Torah in three aspects:The first is the one who engages in the Torah deeply, delving into it and knowing the sources of the law independently without relying on others' opinions. He is in the secret of Atzilut, and his soul is from Atzilut. He is called a son and not a servant because he studies the Torah for its sake, not for the sake of reward.The second is the one who does not know much about the Torah but relies on the rulings and practices taught to them by the sages. They respond with "We will do, and we will hear." They are in the secret of servants, and their source is the "face of the moon" receiving from the "sun."
The third is the person who is an "Am Haaretz," lacking in Torah knowledge and behaving shamefully, much like the nations of the world. His soul comes from the external aspects, and these three levels correspond to the secrets of Atzilut, Beriah, and the external worlds. <br>Know that prayer and the commandment, which involves Torah study, are unique because nothing is higher than them. Engaging in the Torah atones for sin and keeps a person from sinning. It also teaches the path of service. Moreover, when one performs these actions with intention and deep understanding, they have a different quality from lifeless physical bodies without souls."

Nahar 40

Nahar 40 - Explaining that the commandments change according to the one performing them:
The concept is that, just as a person's understanding of Torah and the Elokut (Godly realms) corresponds to the rungs [of the spiritual ladder], each person grasps according to the subtlety of their soul. Some do not grasp as much because their soul is not on that level. Similarly, the secret of the performance of the commandments ascends or descends according to the specific individual, taking into account the fineness or coarseness of how the commandment is fulfilled. <br>As an example, the commandment of Tefillin may result in a throne within the body of a righteous individual and a chariot for the Holy One, blessed be He, with the secret of the Tefillin of the head, and a chariot for the Divine Presence with the secret of the Tefillin of the arm. However, common people subdue the evil inclination with the secret of Tefillin but cannot create a throne and chariot for the Divine Presence, as mentioned in the Zohar in Parshat Pinchas. The same applies to other commandments.

Nahar 41

Nahar 41 - Explaining the secret of blessings and their influence:
The concept is that the soul serves as a ladder for blessings to ascend from below to above, in the manner of Atzilut (the highest of the spiritual realms). It is also a ladder for blessings to descend from above to below through Atzilut. Therefore, in all instances, blessings are like a throne and foundation. If in Atzilut, they emanate from the level of the soul in Atzilut, spreading from there to all the lower realms. If in Beriyah (the second spiritual world), they come from the level of the soul. In Yetzirah (the third spiritual world), they come from the spirit (Ruach), and in Asiyah (the fourth spiritual world), they come from the Nefesh of Asiyah. <br>In the material world (Gashmiut), it serves as a throne and foundation for those blessings that lead to an influence. From there, it bestows upon all those who receive. Blessings do not precede this realm. They originate in the secret of Atzilut, from a place that cannot be grasped, and from there, through the secret of the soul, as mentioned earlier, they enter. Regarding what descends upon the soul, spirit, and Nefesh, it pertains to the adornments and garments for the World to Come. As for what descends upon the body, it relates to eating fruits in this world."

Nahar 42 - To explain the deficiency of one who enjoys without a blessing and the deficiency of one who worships idolatry:
It is already known that everything in the world is found and exists, along with all its particulars, its trees, its organs, its sections, through the power of letters, as mentioned in the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation). Everything is found and exists within the thirty-two paths of wisdom, in the ten utterances (Sefirot) in the secret of Keter (crown), and in the One complete unity. It is all operated by Chochmah (wisdom), through Binah (understanding), and by the Tifferet (beauty), and through the Malchut (kingdom). Similarly, all the existences extend downward, even the smallest blade of grass, from its root to its core, its branches and its flowers, its buds, and the various colors of its flowers, its size, length, width, squareness, and roundness. Everything depends on the supreme hint according to the strength of one's grasp on their task. Their task in the angels and the angels in their roots, their roots in the Sefirot, and the Sefirot in the Ein Sof (infinite)
The enjoyment of a person in this world, without making a blessing, actually causes a transformation in the grass, as it shifts from below to above, because its creation was from above to below. However, due to a person's un-blessed enjoyment, it ascends from below to above in the secret of the transformation of lightWhen a person pours his strength and moisture into the service of his Creator through eating, this ascends all the way to Ein Sof (the infinite), connected through the Sefirot, with joy and the service of this righteous personThe wicked person who derives pleasure without a blessing brings this holy thing down to impurity, which doesn't ascend to the higher realms. Instead, it descends to the place of the outside, without a blessing, and it goes down to the unholy.Likewise, a descendent of a descendent of Cain, who actually takes a tree, or a plant, or fruit and offers it to idol worship, for what was sanctified in holiness and is connected to the Creator, since by the link of the descending worlds, there is nothing separate from it. Its light pierces and descends through the chain of creation to a lower state. This plant will become either living, growing, or dormant. That's why anyone who commits this sin, taking a tree or fruit and offering it in idol worship, sins greatly, beyond what the mouth can utter.This is what is meant by 'You shall not make idols of silver.' In this case, one's unity and the hint of his Sefirot are included in the existence of creation, and silver signifies Chesed (kindness) and gold signifies Gevurah (severity). Those who engage in idol worship actually perform an upper-level hint and tarnish these attributes. That's why it says, 'For you shall not make with Me gods of silver' because if you make gods of silver, I, as it were, will make them, for My energy is bound to them to some extent, and they are the ones who cause Me to sin. This is the meaning of 'you shall not make gods of silver,' as mentioned."
And know that in the Zohar on Parshat Pekudei, they said that one who enjoys without a blessing decreases the blessings. The concept here is that when a person blesses, they cause blessings to flow from the upper source to the Tiferet, and the Malchut. This person enjoys the higher blessing but diminishes the creation from the lower creations from what he consumes. He diminishes the upper power that flows and bestows to all the lower creations. When he consumes and consumes them and burns them, he withholds that power from the world. The angel or force that is in charge of him becomes void and empty. Therefore, one must draw blessings before eating. One increases the upper abundance against what he somewhat diminishes in the consumption. The ministering angel that oversees what he eats is filled with this abundance to enhance the creation once again. One who enjoys without a blessing steals from the Tiferet and the Malchut, from two aspects. One is when he consumes creatures in whom their spirituality is strong, and the ministering angel is appointed over them. The second is that he should have drawn a blessing, and he diminishes the order of the blessing from above. For this, he is affiliated with the destructive man and completes the wicked person, as mentioned in the Zohar Pekudei
And that is why all the actions of the nations, from vegetation in their fields to every creature, are not affiliated with holiness. Because they themselves are separate and distant from the blessed God, as it is said, 'When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,' etc. Therefore, utensils of the nations require immersion, among other matters. Their grain is exempt from tithing, like our grain is considered external. Similarly, their dough is exempt from the obligation of taking challah, like the dough of our dogs. Holiness does not extend to them at all, and the Supernal Light does not shine upon them. This is why only Israel is affected above, and they are included in 'You shall not offer anything that has a blemish' (Deuteronomy 17:1), whereas the nations of the world have no part in holiness, neither them nor their acquisitions. This matter will be rectified in the secret of 'For then I will turn to the peoples.' This means that His name will then be magnified and sanctified, for His name will be magnified and extend to all that exists. And this is what it says: 'I will sanctify My great name which was profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst, and the nations shall know that I am the Lord.' (Ezekiel 36:23)."

 the secret of receiving the prayers of the righteous...
 Every mitzvah a person performs causes a specific upper limb and known chamber to be united above. The reward of each action is one specific matter, which cannot be achieved through the performance of another mitzvah. Therefore, when a person performs one physical mitzvah in the material world using a known limb, such as the tefillin of the head, through his thought, he affects the world of Atzilut through the limb of the head in the secret of the soul. Through speech, he influences the world of Beriyah, the secret of the Throne of Glory, with the name known specifically as with tefillin where the secret of the name Eheyeh is connected. Through physical action, he accomplishes and influences the world of Yetzirah, which is the secret of the angels attached to the name Eheyeh, as they allude to the secret of the head, and the reward of the mitzvah is below, similar to it. <br>The matter is that if a person is careful in a known mitzvah, the angels known to that mitzvah will join him to safeguard it. And if the power of the supernal influence is in the secret of the rain, and that person goes before the ark in the year of 'Betzur' as in the form of the Holy Temple, those angels will hasten to him to receive his prayer above. They will answer quickly, something that will not happen with another person, even if he is more righteous than him. And even if he has a unique spiritual advantage for a particular request, it will not help him for other difficult prayers, because he does not have the same level of vigilance and swiftness in the mitzvah attached to that particular limb where the matter of receiving his request lies. This is the secret of 'Atmachi Gavra, Atmachi Qamia.

Nahar 44

To explain the types of prayers and the intention in the Kavanah:
The matter is that prayer, which is the service of the heart, has two aspects. The first is the secret of drawing down influence to the Divine Kingdom and bestowing it. When one serves in this manner, their intention in their prayer and blessings is not directed toward material things but rather toward providing nourishment for the Divine Presence and adorning it. Regarding this, it is said (Avot 1:3): "Do not be like servants who serve the master in order to receive a reward. Such a prayer is not received by Metatron, who is an angel of the lower material governance and the reception of material influence. This prayer, which lacks a material component, is not like a servant's work but more like a child serving their father without expecting a reward. Therefore, it is not accepted by Metatron but rather by Yesod (the Foundation).However, what our Sages explained, that a person should be like a servant who arranges praise before their master, relates to a person who serves in their prayers in the manner mentioned above, with a material intention, in order to receive a reward. That's why this prayer is called a "hired worker," and the hired worker is Metatron, who is hired for the governance of the lower realms. The reward for this is the prayer, for the lower governance to receive influence. That is why it is the one who accepts this prayer, as mentioned.
However, the concept of intention in prayer is that a person, through the progression of their soul from one level to another, connects to the holy chain of spirituality from above. This progression of the soul should be like a ladder on which the awakening of their deeds rises until the upper Sephirot merge with them. From there, blessing flows through the Sephirot from the first to the last, reaching the lower levels. In this way, it descends along the mentioned ladder. The extent of the awakening and the preparation of deeds determines the expansion of the channel and the revelation of the upper influence. However, the degree of light that flows through one individual will not be the same as that which flows through another. Likewise, the blemish caused by one person will not be equivalent to that caused by another. Moreover, one individual cannot rectify the blemish caused by someone else, and only that person can make amends through repentance or spiritual cycles The meaning of the saying from our sages that God is meticulous with the righteous as fine as a hair is evident. When the righteous person refrains from performing one of the commandments, the great outpouring of light destined to come through them diminishes considerably due to their omission. However, even if they refrain from a seemingly minor act, the light and abundance they would receive through it will be much less. The contrast is significant. The blemish made by the righteous, given their elevated spiritual state, differs from the blemish made by an ordinary person whose spiritual station is much lower.
However, there is a significant difference between the intention of learned individuals and that of the common people when it comes to the progression of souls. For the wise person, when their good intentions align with the stages of the spiritual ladder, their soul ascends from one level to another, from one reason to another, and from one height to another. This continuous progression leads them to approach and connect with the source of life. Through this connection, abundant blessings are drawn, and they become a place, a seat, and a conduit for divine influence, which they then share with the whole world, as mentioned in the Zohar, Parshat Terumah. This ultimately results in the Shekhinah, the divine presence, uniting with them. However, one who simply focuses on the external aspects of prayer, without understanding its esoteric secrets, will not attain the privilege of beholding the divine presence. Even if they receive some divine response, it will be as if they are answered indirectly, not directly experiencing the divine presence. Therefore, the understanding of the essential focus in prayer is that the individual must draw spirituality from the higher levels to the letters they recite. By doing so, they enable these letters to ascend to the highest level, arousing and fulfilling their request. The intention is that nothing is void in the individual; everything has spiritual significance. It's essential to draw the higher spiritual power to help the letters ascend to their desired level, thus elevating their prayer to a sublime place and expediting its fulfillment.
Indeed, in the general context of prayer, one should focus on aligning the voice in the recitation (Tevorat Hashem) and the speech in the praise (Malchut), which represent the Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey (Adonai). The intention should be that these two aspects converge in a united manner, indicating the sacred name Yud-Alef-Hey-Dalet-Vav-Nun-Hey, which alludes to the unity of both. Furthermore, one should also intend that the voice and speech encompass fire, water, and air. Through the combination of these three elements, representing the secret of Chesed-Gevurah-Tiferet, the uniqueness is achieved, as it is known that the voice consists of a combination of fire, water, and air. <br>Additionally, it is fitting to direct one's intentions in each prayer according to the dominant quality of that time, whether it be morning, afternoon, or evening. In alignment with that specific measure, one's intentions should correspond to the essence of the prayer and the appropriate time. Moreover, it is advisable to direct one's thoughts and expressions using the names and designations related to the Sefirot. This means directing one's focus toward the names of the Tetragrammaton that allude to the essence of the Sefirot and the internal spirituality that serves as a garment for the bones. This spirituality emanates from the Ain Sof, the unique essence beyond our limitations, and can only be alluded to through the Tetragrammaton in those specific points. By doing so, one can safely proceed on their path. <br>However, we should not disclose more in this book. We have already summarized the privacy of intention in prayer in this book separately, and we named it "Sefer Kanaf Renanim" (Book of Soaring Wings) with the help of God.

Nahar 45

To Explain the Secret of the Fall of the countenance
Know that the number of days in the year, which are the days of His sorrow, meaning the days of the fall of the Countenance (Nefilat Afim), these days serve as the medium chariot, which is the chariot of Metatron. This is the secret of "On the river of Kevar," etc. The sequence of the chariot in these days is as follows: five days in Tishrei and twenty-four in Cheshvan, totaling twenty-nine; twenty in Kislev, totaling forty-nine; twenty-three in Tevet, totaling seventy-two; twenty-three in Shevat, totaling ninety-five; twenty-two in Adar, totaling 117. In Nisan, Metatron does not have dominion. In Iyar, twenty-three days, totaling 140; in Sivan, eleven days, totaling 151; in Tammuz, twenty-four days, totaling 175; in Av, twenty-three days, totaling 198; in Elul, twenty-four days, totaling 222. Metatron serves during these days with the Chayot (Holy Animals), four camps, and nine spheres. There remain twenty-one forbidden days during the fall of Afim. These days serve as the throne of creation, and the letters Kaf-Lamed-Bet are the Kabbalistic letters that are not transmitted the secrets of the chariot except to those who master the secrets of Kabbalah. According to the numerical value (Gematria).

Nahar 46

To Explain the Secret of the Ingredients of the Incense:
Know that the recitation of the incense formula holds a mystical power to dispel any prosecution from the King. Indeed, our sages commented on the verse "This is the Torah of the burnt offering," etc. The reason that there are eleven ingredients in the incense is to teach us that in any community where there is one wicked person, they should not exclude him from among them, nor should they prevent him from praying with them. They should not assume that they will lose by participating in the prayer of the wicked. On the contrary, it will be beneficial for them, for when examined above, the value of his prayer, in accordance with the value of the prayer of the wicked, will appear more significant than what they, being without wickedness, offer. The wicked person will also benefit, as his prayer becomes important through joining theirs. This is when ten righteous and one wicked person are considered all righteous; all eleven are deemed righteous. However, the power of nine righteous individuals cannot annul the disqualification of one wicked person. If there were two wicked individuals in the congregation, twenty righteous individuals would be required to annul the disqualification of two wicked individuals. Therefore, in the incense, ten good signs were used to neutralize the bad odor of galbanum.
Now, one of them is myrrh, and the second is frankincense, the third is cinnamon, the fourth is calamus. The interpretation of calamus is "white," hinting at the attribute of kindness. Regarding this, Israel is covered under the shadow of kindness through the secret of the magical power of the incense at the time of anger, to weaken the power of the King's prosecution and dispel it. The "Mem" is myrrh, the "Vav" is mor (myrrh), the "Hei" is ketsi'a (cassia), and the "Zayin" is nard (spikenard). The "Chet" is karkom (saffron), with the initial letters forming "Miknei," which means possessions. Israel is the possession of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, "And I will give you the land of Canaan." The "Tet" is koshet (costus), and the "Yud" is kinnamon (cinnamon), with the initial letters forming "Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh Hashem Tzva'ot" (Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts). This hints that Israel, the possession of the Lord, is covered in the shadow of the attribute of kindness, called "Chet Tet" through the secret of the incense, to be protected from the prosecution of the King's prosecution. The first four signs bring "seventy" measures from each of them, and four times "seventy" equals "two hundred and eighty," to hint that the prosecution of the King, whose form is a calf and is called "Par Refu Yedeiav" (healing the hands), and the other four signs each bring "ten" measures, and four times "ten" equals "forty," hinting at the secret of "Sia'ata D'Shmaya" (support from Heaven). When you connect the quantity of "seventy" with "two hundred and eighty" to the quantity of "forty," the sum is "three hundred and twenty," symbolizing the secret that the King's prosecution, named "Shmad," and its intention to destroy, as it is written, "And he said to destroy them if not for Moses," the "Kuf" is twelve, hinting at the twelve tribes, which are the offspring of Jacob called "Emet" (truth), whose translation is adorned. When you connect the quantity of twelve with the letter "Shin," it will rise to "three hundred and sixty," suggesting that the anger of the King will turn into favor. The "Kuf" is twelve, hinting at the twelve tribes, which are the offspring of Jacob called "Emet" (truth), whose translation is adorned. When you connect the quantity of twelve with the letter "Shin," it will rise to "three hundred and sixty," suggesting that the anger of the King will turn into favor. The "Lamed" is thirty, hinting at the thirty generations that spread out among Israel and were cut off, as it is written, "All the nations surround me in the name of the Lord, for I will cut them off." When you consider the quantity of thirty with the "Nun," it will rise to "fifty," symbolizing the turning of Satan, named "Shet," meaning "Shin Tav," to die, in the secret of the power of the incense. The "Tet" is nine, hinting at the power of the nine patriarchs that spread among Israel and were cut off, as it is written, "All the nations surround me in the name of the Lord, for I will cut them off." When you connect the quantity of nine with the "Nun," it will rise to "fifty-nine," symbolizing the change of Satan, named "Shet," to "Shin Tav," in the secret of the power of the incense. The "Yud" is ten, hinting at the ten Sefirot of the Divine emanation. When you connect the quantity of ten with the letter "Samech," it will rise to "sixty," symbolizing the secret that the perfection of the matter of the incense causes good to Israel. When you connect the quantity of sixty with the "Tzadi," it will rise to "ninety," symbolizing the secret of the three fathers in the secret of the "Shin" of Shabbat. This means that, in the merit of the three fathers of Israel, they are saved at the time of anger through the secret of the incense. A handwritten note accompanies this text.

Nahar 47

In the secret of the sacrifice and reincarnation:
It is known that the animal sacrificed on the altar, through its fat and blood, binds and dedicates the higher attributes. For this reason, in order for holiness to be effective upon it, the animal must be without blemish, as any blemish is undoubtedly a defect adhering to the substance itself. It indicates the domination of the klipah (impurity) over it, repelling holiness from it, as it is impossible for two opposites to exist together without one repelling the other. Undoubtedly, holiness flees from there. Therefore, a complete vessel is needed to instill holiness in it, allowing the higher attributes to be singled out in it. Besides this reason, there is an additional reason in the secret of reincarnation. The same secret is found in animals, specifically in the case of evildoers who are deserving of death. They clothe themselves in an ox or a sheep, slaughter it, and it is considered as their death and punishment until their sins are appeased and removed. By the will of the Lord, their ways will be dressed in a kosher animal to draw near to the altar. Then, in the secret of the smoke of the offering, it will depart after receiving its punishment through a proper ritual slaughter performed by the high priest Michael, who sacrifices the souls of Israel. This is a great secret in sacrifices to rectify the wicked of Israel who contemplated repentance. Since the destruction of the Temple, they are rectified through the death of infants. If a wicked soul, impure and unfit for sacrifice on the altar, clothed in an animal and the mark of sin is imprinted upon it, it will have a fixed blemish, preventing it from approaching the altar or entering the sacred. Instead, it would be slaughtered outside the sanctuary with a proper and checked knife. Afterward, it would be purified and whitened through the secret of the correction of the commandments, until it is rectified. Only then, after a proper slaughter, could it ascend, but not to the altar. Therefore, it is forbidden for an ignoramus to eat meat, as it does not purify and is destined to undergo reincarnation. Some reincarnate in clean domesticated animals and kosher birds, becoming neveilah (a carcass) with a faulty or damaged knife, or they are found as treifah (a fatally injured animal). This is a difficult reincarnation from the previous one. Others reincarnate in unclean domesticated animals or in dogs, and their reincarnation is extremely difficult, almost without rectification. Some reincarnate in a non-Jew, and this is almost as difficult as before. Some reincarnate in a Jewish servant, which is better than the previous cases. Some reincarnate in a woman, which is better than the previous cases. Despite all this, it is a descent from the first level. For these three, we recite the blessing "Who did not make me a non-Jew, a slave, or a woman," while for all other animals, we do not recite a blessing.
However, the secret of these reincarnations pertains not to the soul, perish the thought, but solely to the nefesh (lower level of the soul). The angel in charge of this is Sandalphon, the prince of souls. He teaches merit on behalf of the souls of the children of Israel to purify them, as explained in the Tikkunim regarding the commandment of sending away the mother bird. He encompasses all the souls of Israel, even the disqualified ones. He desires that no soul be completely rejected from him. This concept is expressed in the verse "With all desire of your soul, you may slaughter and eat meat." This signifies the completion of the desired perfection for all the souls. We have already expounded on this in the Ein Mishpat section of the Secret of Secrets.

Nahar 48

Understand that the livestock that Jacob sent to Esau numbered precisely 440, neither more nor less, with a deliberate intent in a complete calculation of purity. This calculation includes both the aspect of purity, signifying those without blemishes, and the aspect of impurity, representing those with defects, which is denoted by the term "blemished" (מומין). Therefore, the Scripture associates them with the impure ones. This is evident in the inclusion of camels between the cattle and the sheep, and the mention of cattle between the camels and the donkeys. This informs us that just as camels and donkeys are disqualified for sacrifice, so are the livestock, both sheep and cattle, disqualified for sacrifice because they had blemishes. Hence, the verse begins with the Doron (gift) with eight words ending in the letter "Mem." These include "Izi"m (goats), "Mati"m (sheep), "Teishi"m (female donkeys), "Alei"m (rams), "Ezri"m (ewes), "Leishi"m (male donkeys), "Ra'cha"l (ewes), and "Lei"ah (ewes). These words total 440, with no other intervening words between them. This signifies that all the animals Jacob sent as a gift to Esau, in the gift, were all blemished.
And know that the calculation of all the pure animals that he sent to Esau in the Doron (gift) was 490, corresponding to the numerical value of the letters ס (Samech), ל (Lamed), and ת (Tav), representing pure species. As for the unclean animals, they are in the category of blemished. Now, the numerical value of עזי"ם (goats) is 127, signifying the years of Sarah's life. The term "Rachelim" (ewes) also hints at the merit of his wife Rachel standing by him. Additionally, from the cattle, the merit of Rebecca, his mother, will stand by him. The calculation of camels and donkeys equals the numerical value of the impure animals (טמא"ה) and 191 (יטמ"א), respectively. When these impure animals are combined with the pure ones, the total numerical value (נת"ק) ascends to the head of Esau. Since he initially sent the gift to the realm of Azazel before separating the tithe for the sacrifice, even though they were blemished, his descendants were obligated to sacrifice 490 animals each year for the additional offerings: 100 for the Sabbaths, 22 for the heads of the months, 7 for the days of Passover, 11 for the additional offerings, and 7 for the firstfruits, totaling 141. Furthermore, 14 oxen for the seven days of Sukkot, 14 rams for the days of Sukkot, and 98 sheep for the seven days of Sukkot, totaling 112. Additionally, 70 lambs for the seven days of Sukkot, 98 he-goats for the seven days of Sukkot, and 16 for Shemini Atzeret, totaling 184. The grand total, including the 490 animals sent as the gift, amounts to 4910. This is the numeric value represented by the final letters (פ"ד) with an additional שנ"א. And this is the sum of the manuscript.

 The Secret of the Sabbath and the Extra Soul and Sabbath Meals
Know that there is a person who only merits the Nefesh (physical life force), and there is a person who merits the Nefesh and the Ruach (spirit), and there is someone who also merits the Neshama (soul). One who merits all three during the weekdays gains the advantage of all three on Shabbat. However, one who only merits the Nefesh during the weekdays will only gain an additional Nefesh on Shabbat. Because not many people attain at least [the merit of] everyone, they merit an extra Nefesh.
Know that the extra soul is the daughter of the King and originates from the supernal kingdoms of creation. When it comes into the world, three angels from the world of formation accompany it. One is from the camp of Michael, corresponding to the attribute of kindness of Abraham. Another is from the camp of Gavriel, corresponding to the attribute of strength, the awe of Isaac. The third is from the camp of Uriel, corresponding to the truth of Jacob. For this reason, the seventh day is called Shabbat, meaning Shin-Bet-Tav, hinting at the three patriarchs. The intention is on the three angels mentioned who come to accompany the extra soul, which is called "Bet." Therefore, on Erev Shabbat, after handling three myrtle branches, which hint at the three patriarchs, one should seek three myrtle branches with a valid source. The intention is for them to serve as a seat for the three angels mentioned, who come to accompany the extra soul. When the extra soul perceives that the three angels found a place to rest upon it, it waits for them until Motzei Shabbat to accompany it. At that moment, it rejoices and is happy. On Motzei Shabbat, during the Havdalah ceremony when blessing those three valid myrtle branches, the three angels walk with the extra soul, accompanying it until its place. At the moment of its departure, the extra soul blesses the homeowner for the joy it received. If one did not prepare the three myrtle branches on Erev Shabbat, when the three angels come to accompany the soul and do not find a place for their camp, they leave, and the soul remains alone and sad. On Motzei Shabbat, when blessing the myrtle branch, the angel from the left side moves away from it, and the accompanying angel separates from the soul. The soul goes away alone in sorrow and curses the homeowner for not taking the trouble to prepare three myrtle branches thick enough for the angels to camp on, as they accompany it.
Indeed, the root of the extra soul is as follows: When Moses ascended Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, he was given one thousand portions of light, which correspond to the secret of the "Aleph" of the multitude of Adam, Seth, and Enosh. However, when the Israelites committed the sin of the Golden Calf, they were lost due to the transgression of Israel. At that point, only one portion remained, separate from the original one thousand portions. Therefore, it is called "Aleph" precisely. Since Moses did not sin but lost only due to the sin of Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, completes them with Moses as a kind of gift to Israel. These are the lights and crowns, which are the witnesses of Israel that they regretfully separated from with the sin of the Golden Calf. Moses then took them to complete what was lacking for them. However, every Erev Shabbat night, Moses returns to receive those one thousand portions of light that were lost, taking them with the secret of the additional aspects of Shabbat. He then returns the crowns of Israel to them. From these crowns, Israel inherits the additional aspects of Shabbat every Erev Shabbat. This is the secret of Moses rejoicing in his gift of a portion. Meaning, on Shabbat, Moses is given as a gift that portion which was taken from him, and he rejoices in what has been restored to him. The intention is to say that since he has received his portion, he is joyful with his portion and does not covet the portions of Israel. Thus, he returns their portions and does not say, "Since Israel sinned and I already gained their portion, I will take it all." Rather, he rejoices in his portion alone and returns their portions to them.The reason is that an faithful servant is called for him. Therefore, the crowns of Israel that were entrusted to him, he returns to their rightful owners. This is what is meant by saying, "For a faithful servant is he called." He explained what the gift of his portion was, mentioning that it is the same glorious robe that was placed on him while he stood before You on Mount Sinai. It was lost from him as he descended from the mountain, and he brought down the two stone tablets with his own hands. However, the glorious robe was taken from him. This is the gift of his portion that he now receives on Shabbat.
And know that the extra soul arrives at the onset of the Sabbath. The household needs to be prepared for the Sabbath with an arranged table, a lit candle, and the homeowner adorned and dressed in Sabbath attire. If one has the ability to immerse [in a ritual bath], it is commendable. If not, washing hands and feet with warm water suffices. At that point, joy enters the human body, especially during the morning prayer when the prayer leader says, "The soul of every living being." This is the time of the arrival of the soul. During the afternoon prayer, when the prayer leader says, "And I, my prayer," it is the time of the arrival of the spirit. During the Havdalah ceremony on Saturday night, when reciting "Ata Chonantanu," the spirit returns to its place. During the Sanctification of the Holy One's name [Kedushah] in the prayer service, it is the time of the departure of the soul. After the soul has departed, permission is given to kindle the candle. During the Havdalah ceremony over the cup, it is the time of the departure of the spirit. According to the opinion of the holy Ari, may his memory be a blessing, as written by the Ari, the following is the explanation: When saying, "Bo'i Kala" (Come, O Bride) during the reception of the Sabbath, you should intend to receive the additional soul. In the blessing, intend to receive the spirit. During the phrase "U'feros Sukkat Shalom" (And spread the shelter of peace), intend to receive the soul. All of these correspond to the secret of the night, which is the realm of the Kingdom. Afterwards, in the morning, intend to receive the soul in the blessing. During the Sim Shalom (Grant peace) blessing connected to the Amidah prayer, intend to receive the spirit. During the Musaf prayer, in the phrase "Ayei Makom Kevodo" (Where is the place of His glory), intend to receive the soul. All three are from the secret of the daily attributes.
And it is necessary to arrange the table with twelve loaves, in the evening, morning, and for the third meal. Arrange the bread in two simple rows, six to the south and six to the north, forming the structure of the six-row system. The table should be positioned to the north, and the menorah to the south, with the length of the table from east to west. However, according to the kabbalist, the holy Ari, may his memory be a blessing, he wrote, and may he rest in peace: Arrange them so that there are twelve loaves, six on the right side of the table and six on the left. The six on the right should be arranged in groups of three, as should the six on the left, and these three should resemble the structure of the acronym SaGaV (סגו"ל). This is the prescribed order:  
ndeed, because on your right side, there are four loaves, two on top of two, and likewise, on your left side, there are four, two on top of two. In the center, there are four other loaves that are divided into two, which are two loaves near those on the right and two others near those on the left. When you want to make the blessing, take the two upper loaves from the center, attach and join them with both hands, so the two sides of the loaves stick together, and their two faces will be facing in opposite directions. Then it will appear as if it is one loaf with two faces. This is the secret of the "Double-faced Bread." Cut off a piece about the size of an olive, take it for yourself, cut another piece about the size of an egg, and give it to your wife. Afterward, you can cut additional pieces if you want to giv
And it is necessary that the one arranging the table is in the north, and the menorah is in the south, and the length of the table is from east to west. The table's length should be twelve handbreadths, its width six, and its height no less than nine and no more than ten. The host should sit with his back to the north and his face opposite the faces of the candles. During the blessing over the bread, he should take two loaves from the right side, one from each arrangement, and not place them on top of each other. Instead, both should be standing vertically, one beneath the other, so that one face of a loaf is in front of him, and the second face of the other loaf faces the menorah before him, resembling the Double-faced Bread. If he cannot arrange twelve loaves, he is not allowed to place more than four. Arrange two on the right, one on top of the other, and two on the left, one on top of the other, with the three themselves forming a triangular shape
And know that it is necessary to arrange a meal for the Saturday night after the Havdalah, and one should set the table beautifully, as it is necessary to honor the additional soul in its arrival, just as in its departure. Whoever does not dine on these Saturday nights does not fulfill the obligation of the third meal, and furthermore, from it, the person derives pleasure, which is known as "luz." This is well known. Additional intentions regarding the meals of Shabbat are expounded in the book "Ma'aseh Choshev," with the help of God.e to others.

On the Secret of Prohibitions on Shabbat and Permitted Activities on weekdays:
The matter is that on the other days, the dominion of the attribute of kingship does not rule in the lower world. The light of emanation does not spread downward, except for the secret of the angel Metatron, and that is during the weekdays. Thus, in the weekdays, the entire world and everything in it are illuminated, and they are clothed in the lights of Metatron. When a person performs his work and labor, which is under the dominion of Metatron, it is permissible to act in it. <br>However, on Shabbat, because from above, in the higher dominion, the secret of the additional soul light spreads, its branches extend downward, and thus, all that is below is illuminated by the light of kingship. Concerning the implements of plowing, the heifer, and the plowed ground, they make use of the upper light of kingship. Engaging in these activities on Shabbat interferes with all the work one does because it is the Shabbat of the upper kingship, and certainly, one cannot sow with implements or plow on Shabbat. The ground, which is plowed, is truly a dominion since it reigns and spreads among the lower beings. This is the essence of the matter.

Commentary on Circumcision
It should be asked, after Israel, who are holy and God's portion, received the impurity of foreskin, which is the "Sitra d'Shmaya" (the Other Side of Holiness, associated with impurity) and is the highest level of impurity. The proof is that the sages compared it to the impurity of a dead body, the father of impurities, as is mentioned in Midrash Yalkut (Yalkut Reuveni) on Parashat Vayera and Parashat Naso, and they said, "And Moses said, 'This is the thing which the Lord has commanded, you shall do, etc.'" - what is this thing? Concerning circumcision, he said to them, etc. A parable to a certain hunchback who had a lover, and he was a priest, and he had impurity in his house, etc. Similarly, it says in Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 29: "One who separates from the foreskin is like one who separates from the grave. Anyone who touches the foreskin is like one who touches the dead, etc." If so, where does this impurity come from for Israel? It can be said that the initial arousal of sexual activity is only from the side of the evil inclination for the pleasure of the world. Even the pious, who cannot avoid having some aspect of worldly pleasure, as stated in Vayikra Rabbah, Parashat Tazria, Section 3: "In the sin of 'I created' - Rabbi Acha said, 'Even if one is a Hasid among the pious, it is impossible that he will not have some aspect of desire for worldly pleasures.'" David said before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Did I intend anything, O Father in Heaven, but for my own pleasure, etc." until "For my father and my mother have forsaken me, etc." And Yishai, who is from the tribe of Judah, died because of the bite of the snake, as mentioned in Berachot 17a and Shabbat 146a. It was said about him by the Holy Spirit, "In the sin of 'I created,' etc." It is derived from this that there is no sexual activity that does not have some aspect of desire, and from that aspect, the foreskin is formed.
However, the secret of circumcision and uncovering is that the judgment dictates that the upper light will spread across all worlds, and the light of the North will be revealed and shine. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, concealed the light of His divine presence and hid His goodness because of the sin of Adam and the wicked who draw from it. In this context, the line of judgment is humbled, and a screen is made to separate above, namely, the outer aspects. He gave to guard the way of the Tree of Life, as it is written, "And He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and the flame of the revolving sword to guard." These are the two circumcisions: one, the revolving sword, which is the foreskin that is cut off by the sword, as it is written, "Make for yourself sharp knives"; the second, the cherubim, which are the wings of the foreskin, peeled from here and from there, forming two cherubim covering with their wings on the Ark Cover. We do not cut it, but it spreads its wings and opens its doors from here and from there to reveal the good sign of the North and the way of the Tree of Life. Regarding this, it is said, "And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin." It is called "flesh of the foreskin" because it is an advantage. Since the form of the organ is hidden from within the flesh, and there is no similarity in all organs to this, if you cut off any part of an organ, you will subtract a piece, and this is a flaw. The form of the organ will be revealed, indicating that this matter is added to the true form due to the sin that caused the created beings. This is the meaning of "the flesh of your foreskin" because the added flesh and blemish are because of you, for the way of the Tree of Life was revealed, and man, in his sin, added foreskin flesh and concealed the way of the Tree of Life. Therefore, "the flesh of your foreskin" specifies, and behold, Adam's sin was in the service of hands [and the mouth], for he took with his hands and ate with his mouth. Also, this command is performed with circumcised hands and sucked with the mouth to rectify this sin, for man was pulling on his foreskin, which is the flesh of your foreskin. And you shall circumcise, like the way you caused the flesh of your foreskin, as on that day, thus it shall be performed. This is like the same way you caused it yesterday; similarly, circumcise it and thus rectify the sin.

Nahar 52

River 52: Regarding the importance of the commandment of circumcision:
Know that a person is not called by the name 'human' except through the commandment of circumcision, and without it, he is called a demon and not a human. The reason is that the conditions for a person to be called by the name 'human' require him to be in the image of God. For in the image of God, He made man. Therefore, it is fitting to understand the nature of the image, what it entails.Understand that a person has a soul, spirit, and breath through which his soul, spirit, and breath are protected from external influences. For there is no empty space in all the air of the world that does not have many demons and harmful entities. However, through the garment created for the soul, spirit, and breath, as mentioned, they are preserved from external influences.This is the meaning of 'But in the image, one shall walk.' For a person cannot navigate this world and traverse the air filled with harmful entities and external influences except through the image, which is the divine garment, as will be explained with the help of the Almighty.This garment is shared between Israel and the nations, between humans and demons, as they are all the work of His hands. Therefore, a person is included in the secret of this garment, which is the mystery of the image mentioned. However, animals do not have this fortune; they do not have this secret."
And behold, when the soul becomes impure through its actions, then this garment departs, and the external forces seize it. The extent of that sin varies, from much to little. When sin increases, it departs entirely. This is the meaning of the statement 'And they knew that they were naked.' This is the secret, as on the day you eat from it, you will surely die. For that sin causes the departure of the mentioned garments entirely, and in this way, the external forces can seize the soul, spirit, and breath. This is the secret of death, and this is the secret of the saying of the sages, 'The wicked, even in their lifetime, are called dead.' Because through their sin, the shadows go, and the garments depart, leaving them naked until their removal is complete. Only then is permission given for one to take the soul.This is the meaning of 'until the shadows flee away.' The mentioned image is a garment for the soul. The concept is that the soul is from Binah, as it says, 'And the soul of Shaddai will understand them' — the language of understanding. Thus, 'Ehyeh' with the full spelling, Yud-Hey, is equal to 'Tzelem' (image). However, the spirit and the soul are from the attributes of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. Therefore, their garment is 'Ehyeh' with the spelling Aleph-Hey-Yud-Hey, totaling 91. The garment for the spirit, which is equal to Aleph-Hey-Yud-Hey, and the garment for the soul, which is equal to Aleph-Hey-Yud-Hey with the Hey of the Yud, add up to Aleph-Lamed-Peh-Yud-Hey, which is 'Ehyeh' (spelled fully), and He said to him, 'Ehyeh' with the addition of the Yud, for He is 'Ehyeh' with ten letters."
And behold, even the demons are His creations, blessed be He. Since they are spirits without bodies, as is known, they only have the name 'Ehyeh' of Yud-Hey and the Aleph-Hey-Yud-Hey, which are masculine, for the body is from the realm of the Kingdom, as known. Therefore, 'Ehyeh' of Yud-Hey and the Aleph-Hey-Yud-Hey together have the numerical value of 'Shed,' which is a demon. As for the nations, the peoples of the world do not have a soul, as the soul is acquired through the laws, and the Torah. This is what the Scripture says: 'And you shall keep and do them, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations.' They will say, 'Only a wise and understanding people is this great nation.' Perhaps it means that through the laws of the Torah, a person acquires completeness of the soul. Through action, intention, and speech, a person acquires three garments for the three parts of the soul, as mentioned. Through action, the soul is perfected. Through speaking the Torah, the spirit is perfected. Through intending in the Torah and its commandments, the soul is perfected. Know that each of the soul, spirit, and breath is divided into the respective parts, and similarly, action is divided into judgments, commandments, and statutes, and speech is also divided into plain interpretation, Midrash, and Kabbalah. Intention, too, whether it is directed according to the plain meaning, Midrash, or the secret, completes each part of the soul, spirit, and breath. This is easy to understand.
And know that to attain the lofty soul, which can only be reached by select individuals, such as Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and the like, however, for a regular soul, all of Israel together achieve this through performing the laws. This is what is meant by 'And you shall keep and do them, for it is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations.' Meaning, they merit a soul that is drawn from wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the nations who will hear all these statutes and say, 'Only a wise and understanding people is this great nation.' It means that every great nation collectively merits the level of the soul, as mentioned, through the laws. This level is not found only among the Israelites. This is what is meant by 'only,' indicating exclusivity. The matter is that the divine image is perfected when all its parts, which are the soul, spirit, and breath, come together. This can only be found among the Israelites. Therefore, specifically, you are called 'Adam' (human).
And behold, in the soul and spirit, there is some hold for the external forces. The reason is that the root of judgment derives from the attributes of beauty and sovereignty, which are the mysteries of spirit and soul. However, from understanding and above, they have no hold at all. In this, one can understand the reason why the garments of the soul, spirit, and breath are in the secret of Ehyeh, as mentioned. This is because the name Ehyeh is the mystery of understanding from which the external forces flee. Therefore, as long as there is a hold for uncircumcision and impurity in a person, it is impossible for the soul to rest upon him, and thus, he cannot be called by the name Israel. Therefore, it is customary not to call him by that name until after the circumcision, for once the uncircumcision and impurity have been removed, the mystery of the soul will certainly take effect upon him—meaning, the soul of the lower aspect. In this case, he will be called by the name of an Israelite, like Shimon, Reuben, and the like. Thus, it becomes clear that the reason he is called 'Adam' is through the commandment of circumcision. This is the essence of the matter.

  In the secret of charity, and in the secret of the half-shekel every year, and the redemption of the firstborn:
The matter is that the Scripture found it necessary to write in several places that they sold Joseph for twenty silver pieces, to inform us how much they benefited from him so that we can rectify his distortion. The twenty silver pieces were twenty dinars of silver, and each dinar is six ma'ah, and each ma'ah is four issarim, which are twenty-four issarim in total. Each four dinars of silver are a holy shekel. It follows that all twenty dinars of silver are five shekels. Therefore, we were commanded by the Torah to give five shekels for the redemption of the firstborn, corresponding to those shekels of Joseph's sale. From these five shekels, each one received half a shekel, and the five shekels amounted to ten portions. Therefore, we were commanded by the Torah to give each one, as atonement, the half-shekel every year for communal sacrifices. Even in this time when the Temple does not exist, every Jewish man is obligated to give them to the poor, whose Torah is their profession. <br>Know that charity given willingly and wholeheartedly has a virtue to save one from the judgment of Gehenna. However, charity given out of pride, to honor oneself, or out of shame, thinking that if one does not give, others will, has the power to save from an unusual death. Yet, it lacks the power to save from the judgment of Gehenna. For an unusual death is a brief moment of suffering, while the suffering of Gehenna is prolonged. Moreover, one is physical suffering, and the other is spiritual suffering. Not only does charity save from an unusual death, but also from death at the hands of Heaven, as stated in Masechet Shabbat and as explained.

Nahar 54

- In the secret of miracles:
Know that the attachment to the supernal light can only be achieved through desire and love, which are spiritual elevations. Through this, the soul overcomes the material, and a person adheres to his Creator, and the entire world is under his feet. He rises above all and acts in the world according to his will because he is the source of the upper abundance, causing the world to exist. That is, he prevails over the angels who are appointed over the affairs of the world, and they are all subject to him, doing his will. It is similar to the one who said to the oil, 'Ignite,' and he said to the vinegar, 'Ignite,' meaning that he replaced the angels and put the power of oil into the vinegar. This is very close to the true meaning of miracles, similar to these righteous individuals, for leprosy does not cause death; rather, sin causes death, which is the ministering angel and the husk that overflows in him. When the supernal light departs from him, what remains is like straw and stubble before human beings. This is the meaning of 'A wolf shall dwell with a lamb,' and 'On the light of vipers,' etc.

In the secret of the Manna, the Well, and the Clouds of Glory:
The concept is that the matters of the well and the manna were not just ordinary sustenance, and the clouds of glory were not merely for shade. Instead, there was a secret of refinement in the well itself, water from the Kingdom, and an abundance of its holiness sanctifying the body, preparing it for the performance of Torah commandments. Similarly, the manna was heavenly bread, a glory that meticulously refines the body, preparing and purifying the spirit to dwell in the chambers of Torah and engage in its commandments day and night. Likewise, the clouds from the aspect of kindness and understanding, as kindness is the foundation of the patriarchs' homes, providing for the body and clothing it in a holy spirit to purify the soul and prepare it for the hidden secrets of the Torah. This involves the three aspects: the first being the Nefesh (soul), corresponding to the well and the practical commandments; the second being the Ruach (spirit), corresponding to the manna and, in turn, to the Torah and prayer; the third being the Neshamah (soul), corresponding to the clouds of glory and the hidden secrets of the Torah

Nahar 56

In the secret of the Exodus from Egypt:
Know that according to the tradition of Kabbalah in our hands from our Sages, it is taught that there were fifty gates of purity created in the world of formation, in the Hall of Love, standing there the camp of Michael, called Ophanim. Corresponding to them, fifty gates of impurity were created in the world of the Halls of Transformations, called the world of Sammael, who rules over them. Let not the saying be difficult in the eyes of the discerning about the world of Sammael, for from the greatness of the servant, the greatness of the master is known to all who possess knowledge. As Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, may his memory be a blessing, wrote that Sammael is the servant of Metatron. Likewise, Metatron himself is the servant of the Holy One, Blessed be He.
And it is known that a person is not judged in the heavenly court until he reaches the age of twenty and beyond. If one enters on the first day of being twenty-one, and he chooses good, rejects evil, and endeavors to engage in Torah and commandments, then, on the first night when he sleeps in his bed, Michael, the great minister, dispatches one angel from his great hosts, fitting for this purpose. This angel leads his soul and brings it to the entrance of the first gate among the fifty gates of purity. The soul is brought inside up to the extent of the merit of his soul. In this way, every night, the soul is brought further inside, commensurate with the effort he invests in Torah and commandments. If he merits entering the fiftieth gate, he becomes a free person from Sammael. He no longer fears him. However, as long as he has not merited entering the fiftieth gate, even if he has entered into the realm of Metatron, he still possesses the strength, through his free will, to overcome the evil inclination and to extricate it from the fiftieth gate of the impure Halls and bring it into the Halls of purity.
Likewise, someone who, on the first day of the year at the age of twenty-one, begins to despise good, chooses evil, and forsakes the paths of righteousness to walk in the ways of darkness. Then, when he sleeps in his bed, Sammael dispatches one of his great ministers, in proportion to the degrees of the soul's sin, to lead it into the Halls of impurity. He brings it inside up to the first gate, according to the measure of his sins and transgressions. If he continues to transgress, they bring him further inside until he enters the fiftieth gate. At that point, there is no eternal rectification for him, and it is said of him, 'He who is twisted cannot be straightened.' For this reason, the Halls of purity and impurity were created through this condition. However, as long as he has not entered the fiftieth gate of impurity, even if he has entered the Halls of Metatron, he still has the power, through his free will, to contemplate his past deeds. He can break the doors of bronze, cut the bars of iron, and depart from the Halls of impurity to enter the Halls of purity. This is the secret as the Sages said, 'One can acquire his world in one moment.' The secret of the matter is that even the most wicked among Israel, despite increasing in accusations, cannot enter the fiftieth gate of impurity until he regrets and condemns his deeds for four hundred consecutive days, one after another."
And know that there is a tradition received from our Sages that the children of Israel became so deeply immersed in the abominations of Egypt that on the eve of Passover, they entered the Halls of Metatron. If, God forbid, they had delayed longer, they would have entered the Halls of impurity, and again, there would be no eternal rectification for them. This is the secret, and had the Almighty not brought our forefathers out from there, we and our descendants would still be enslaved to Pharaoh in Egypt. Therefore, the Torah writes the Exodus from Egypt fifty times, corresponding to the number of times it was handwritten.
Indeed, the reason that the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt is revealed before the Almighty, Blessed be He, as He knew that Israel would be subjected to four kingdoms in the future. To prevent them from despairing of God's salvation, both they and the nations that would enslave them, so that their rulers would say, "Their God is weak and unable to take them out," He decreed in His wisdom that they would be enslaved in Egypt, which is second only to the Land of Israel. In Egypt, only seventy rulers and the angel Sammael govern, as all the rulers of the seventy nations are under their dominion. If they cannot stand against Israel, certainly the other nations and rulers cannot. This secret is hinted at in the verse, "The palm trees trembled, and the cedars of Lebanon quivered," for Egypt is under the dominion of Sammael and the seventy rulers, due to the abundance of their impurity compared to all the other lands. Thus, anyone entering into a covenant with them becomes enslaved.
Certainly, the reason for the exile in Egypt, as written by the Arizal (Rabbi Isaac Luria, may his memory be a blessing), is that the generation at that time carried the secret sparks of impurity from the seminal emission that Adam, the first man, expelled during those 130 years. They represented the secret of the generation of the Flood, who also corrupted their seed on the earth until they were wiped out. This corresponds to the verse "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth." The wickedness of man literally refers to the secret of seminal emission, called "evil," and the one who emits it is called "wicked," as mentioned in the Zohar on "Do not let evil dwell with you." Thus, the generation of the Flood was the actual evil of the first man. This is the secret of "And God regretted that He had made man," and then they reincarnated in the generation of the Tower of Babel. Concerning them, it is written, "Come, let us go down and confound their language," indicating that they were the actual descendants of Adam, but due to the impurity from the seminal emission, they were disturbed. Afterwards, they reincarnated in the generation of the division of nations, and concerning them, it is written, "Let us go down, and there confound their language," to see the city and the tower that the sons of man built. It means that they were built from the very essence of Adam that was distorted by their external impurity. They, too, sinned, and later they needed rectification because they all possessed holy and mighty souls. However, the external forces clung to them and corrupted them. After they join together and purify themselves, they will become holy souls after the removal of their impurity. The point is that you already know that the external forces only hold onto holy souls, which are their life force.
Behold, the exile in Egypt had no purpose other than to refine those souls. Therefore, they came into that great bondage and embittered their lives with hard labor in clay and bricks, corresponding to the bricks and clay that the generation of the division of nations used, as will be explained in the book "Ein Yaakov," Nahar 23 in the section on Sefer Yetzirah. Also, know that the reason for the exile in Egypt was because on the day that the Creator assigned the nations to be rulers in the generation of the division of nations, the sons of Adam rebelled against themselves. They entered a great rebellion, all under the influence of the external forces, saying, "Come, let us build ourselves a city," and they all entered the secret of rebellion. They entered the external dominion because they saw the external force as having status and the ability to permit them in idolatry, immorality, and anything they desired, without restrictions. Sammael and Lilith ruled over them. Since they had a spark of holiness in their souls, the Creator consented, and external forces ruled over them through appointed rulers. Their intention was to be under the external dominion and in unity. As you already know, unity is certainly related to holiness. Therefore, the Creator scattered them under the external forces because separation is attributed to the external forces. The dispersion was under 70 branches, representing the various branches of the impure husks. In this way, the dominion of the Divine was upon them, although they behaved through the appointed rulers.
Indeed, there remained for the Almighty only a small portion, namely Abraham from Terach alone. There were holy souls that continued from the day the world was created until that time, flawed and degraded. They were also mixed with impurities before the sin of the first man. Therefore, Abraham separated 12 princes from Ishmael, the ministers of the right side. Additionally, Abraham fathered several families from Keturah, all of whom were ministers of silver, separate and refined. Between them, some families sinned in idolatry, and they were more wicked than necessary. The ocean overflowed upon them, and a place under the dominion of the ministers of this silver was established. Isaac joined, and he brought forth ministers of gold. He set Esau and his champions, subjecting them to a second ruler for Edom. Similarly, Lot joined Ammon and Moab. Abraham was called the father of a multitude of nations, indeed, all the nations born in the nine generations would join and be refined through his seed in the secret of the exile in Egypt. There, all souls would be clarified and refined through the generations, and this is what seems correct to me.

The secret of lighting Hanukkah candles:
Know that for the candles, there are certain conditions. Firstly, one must use an appropriate vessel for the Hanukkah candle. There are fifteen types of vessels suitable for lighting, and anything preceding these is praiseworthy. The vessels are: 1) Gold, 2) Silver, 3) Light copper similar to gold, 4) Reddish copper, 5) Iron, 6) Lead, 7) Tin, 8) Glass, 9) Wood, 10) Earthenware plated with metal, 11) Unplated earthenware, and it must be new, 12) Pomegranate peels, 13) Pistachio peels, 14) Oak peels. For these peels, you should make them into a vessel, like creating a balance scale, or weave them into pepper shakers and the like. However, peels from onions, eggs, and the like are not suitable for lighting. All the mentioned fifteen vessels, which cannot stand on their own without support, are not suitable for a Hanukkah candle.
Know that the measure of pure oil that has the seal of the Kohanim and is placed under the oil is a sixth of a log of the Rabbeinu Tam (which is a Rabbinic measure). Every night, in every candle, one would use the weight of seven Drahms (a unit of weight), lacking a quarter Drahm. This is a sufficient measure for an hour and a half, which is an eighth of the night. A miracle occurred with this amount, as they would light it, and it would continue burning throughout the entire night. The time for lighting a Hanukkah candle, our sages said, is half an hour. Therefore, it would be sufficient for each candle to use a weight of two Drahms and a quarter. The matter is that a half Log, which is three eggs, would be the measure. Each egg is eighteen Drahms, so the total for each candle would be fifty-four Drahms. This measure would last for eight nights. The oil was distributed over eight nights, and every night, for each candle, a weight of seven Drahms, lacking a quarter Drahm, was used, as mentioned earlier. And thus, the total for the seven times would amount to fifty-four Drahms, equaling the measure of a half Log. This measure was sufficient for all eight nights, and the oil, which was split into eight portions, was given every night for each candle a weight of seven Drahms, lacking a quarter Drahm, as mentioned. This measure was for the seven nights, and when you add the eighth time, it sums up to the measure of a half Log.

The secret of the mikveh:
Know that the tradition of Kabbalah is in our hands from the sages of truth, that fourteen hundred varieties of impurity are attached to the impure. In order to remove these types attached to the spirit of impurity, one needs a hundred se'ah of water. Each se'ah strengthens forty-nine eggs. Thus, the total for the hundred se'ah is five thousand nine hundred and sixty eggs. The weight of a Jerusalem egg is twelve dinars, and the Babylonian egg is twelve dinars minus a third of the dinar. Since a person is composed of four elements, his purification is only through water. The reason is that impurity is a spirit, as mentioned: 'And I will pass the spirit of impurity from the earth.' The spirit does not naturally enter into water. When the impure enters the water, that spirit of impurity is extracted from him. Therefore, our sages of blessed memory required the impure person to enter into the water completely. If even one hair remains outside the water, he will not become pure because all impurity clings there, returning and attaching to the body
And in the secret, water alludes to the attribute of kindness, and its name is the secret of purification from blemish, as stated: 'In kindness and truth, iniquity is forgiven.' From the waters of kindness, the attribute of wisdom flows. The letter Yud hints at wisdom. The form of the letter Yud is a sealed structure resembling an egg. The numerical value of the letter Yud is ten. Yud Yud Vav, Vav Yud Vav, Vav Yud, and Daled Yud, which are six combinations of the letter Yud, together equal twenty. All six combinations total one hundred twenty. With six more combinations, you have a hundred and twenty-six. The six combinations of the letter Yud have eighteen letters and six words, totaling twenty-four. With the addition of Kaf, twenty-four becomes a hundred and twenty-four, which corresponds to a hundred and twenty-four eggs. This is the secret of a se'ah, a hundred and twenty-four eggs. Thus, the se'ah resembles the letter Yud, signifying that each se'ah has the capacity to remove ten varieties of impurity. When forty se'ahs are combined, they will remove all the forty varieties of impurity. This is the secret of 'and four hundred men were with him,' as mentioned in the Zohar.
Know that in ten places, there are gates in the body corresponding to the ten categories of impurity. The gate of the head alludes to the first, the gate on the right cheek hints at the second, and the gate on the left cheek hints at the third. This corresponds to the three upper categories, which are considered as one. The gate of the right armpit hints at the fourth, and on the left cheek, it hints at the fifth. The gate on the throat and heart hints at the sixth, which is the body of the tree. The gate on the right knee hints at the seventh, and on the left, it hints at the eighth. The surroundings of the righteous hint at the ninth, and his rear hints at the tenth. These ten places serve as seats for the ten forces of impurity to take hold of if they become impure.

The secret of the matter is that the soul of a living being, even though it is spiritual due to being from the preservers and inhibitors of the intellectual soul, after entering the human body, transforms into blood. Blood is physical, and its weight is twenty drachms, neither less nor more, whether male or female, whether young or old.
Because the redemption of the soul is found not in the measure of judgment but in the measure of kindness, as it is written, "By kindness and truth, iniquity is atoned for." The line of judgment says that the sinning soul must die, and silver symbolizes the measure of kindness. Therefore, the redemption of the soul is only with silver, meaning that one must give the weight of twenty drachms of silver, equivalent to the weight of the soul's blood. Each drachm weighs ten issarins, and twenty times ten equals two hundred. In this manner, the weight of the silver, when multiplied by the number of issarins, amounts to two thousand.
Each issar is the weight of a medium-sized carob seed. In this way, the measure decreases from the blood of the soul on the day of fasting, as will be explained in detail in "Ein Yaakov" (a compilation of Aggadic material in the Talmud) in the section about the river, section 44, according to the numerical value.

River 63 - In the secret of the placement of the ear, hand, and foot, and in the secret of the signs that Jacob transmitted to Rachel:
Know that there are three major ministers from the side of the left, and they are the ones who awaken a person to pursue bodily desires. One of them camps on the right earlobe, and he is the great one. The intermediate one on the right hand's thumb, and the small one on the right foot's big toe. Through the priest's application of the blood of the guilt offering to these three places, the mentioned ministers are removed from him. This is similar to how, through the sprinkling of the blood of the sin offering on one impure from contact with a corpse, the impurity of the dead, which is a spirit of impurity from the side of the left, is removed from him. Similarly, on the eve of Yom Kippur, one must apply the blood of the slaughtered rooster for atonement on the right earlobe, the right hand's thumb, and the right foot's big toe. Through this, the ministers who arouse him to pursue bodily desires are removed from him. <br>They are the instigators, and with their removal, a claimant and an accuser are spared, and no court can judge without a plaintiff. Similarly, the matter with the secret of sexual relations: when arousal comes from the male, that act of sexual relations is not for the sake of heaven but for pleasure. Even though it is impossible for the initiation of sexual relations not to be for pleasure, from this perspective, the uncircumcised organ is born, as mentioned above. However, for the one who merits a kosher woman, every sexual act, when it occurs through her arousal, and when she holds her husband's right earlobe, right thumb, and right big toe while intending to arouse him, she must direct her heart at that moment to strengthen these three signs. Through this, the three ministers who arouse desire for reasons other than heaven will be removed from him. When he intends to fulfill the mitzvah of onah alone and not for any pleasure at all, then that sperm can leave his body without causing impurity to his mother's womb. These are the signs that Jacob transmitted to Rachel. However, the woman needs to start with the right big toe, which is the lower sign, and then the right thumb, which is the middle one, and afterward the husband's right earlobe, which is the upper one. In this way, Jacob transmitted them to Rachel.

River 72 - The secret of visiting the sick and welcoming guests:
The concept of visiting the sick is that when a person is ill, he reveals through that illness that the external force dominates him, as implied in the statement in Job: "Behold, it is in your power." Every illness in the world is the spirit of impurity that clothes itself in judgment against the person. Our sages explained this as "evil and faithful diseases," and the meaning according to the sages is diseases entrusted to messengers. This is the same force given to cause him to be nauseous, and that judgment sticks to him until he accepts the bitterness of his obligation. This is precisely the same soul in its supreme place that influences it with judgment and gives it the pulse of light. When a person comes to visit him, worries about him, and seeks mercy for him, he draws upon that soul the influence from the side of the crown. This is precisely the healer of the sick, healing the soul, and unifying the six lower sefirot with understanding. There, the realities of the soul, spirit, and vital soul, clothed in judgment and illness, are found. When he visits the sick, it causes the revelation of the upper emanations on the sick person, and the Divine Presence from the heads of the sick appears, and he seeks mercy for him and lightens his illness.
The secret of hosting guests and its components is manifold. Firstly, hosting them in one's home is undoubtedly an act of kindness, and the guests are the six lower sefirot, the foundation, and they are travelers as the way is known. The Divine Presence pursues those who walk the path when there is Torah discourse among them, which is the Torah of the sefirot. This is as explained in the Zohar on the verse "He walks in justice before Him." The reason is that since there is Torah among them, which unifies there, it is certainly the place where she unifies with him, as is certain in Parashat Orot. When a person brings them into his home, he creates a dwelling and hospitality for the sefirot and the foundation in a house, which is the Divine Presence. His house becomes a dwelling for the Divine Presence, and he brings guests into the house, causing them to unify since there is no coupling on the way. Even if they are engaged in Torah, if he provides them with food and drink afterward, which is abundance in the secret of eating, "They ate, drank, and anointed themselves," as explained in the Zohar on Parashat Vayikra, this causes them to connect more, especially if they are men of importance. Additionally, when he accompanies them, it causes more than anything else because the accompanying of Levi is greater than anything in the world. The reason is that the host, with whom the Divine Presence is present, when he accompanies the guests, causes the Divine Presence, which guards the way, to certainly guard him with all the abundance of Torah. Moreover, it is at the entrance of the path, which is the sixth sefirah, and she guards that place. When he accompanies the guests, it causes the Divine Presence to walk with them, as the Divine Presence pursues uniqueness, represented by the letter "He" in the name, which chases the "Yud" and the "Hey," the letters in the male. These letters are with the host who is in the place of the sefirot. This is the accompanying of the "Yud" letters that are the letters of His name - "Yud" from the right, "Hey" from the left, and "Vav" in the middle. By doing this, he forms a connection with the letters "Yud" and "Hey" of His name. This is the escort of the "Yud" letters, the letters of His name. The "Yud" is from the right, the "Hey" from the left, and the "Vav" from the middle. By doing this, he forms a connection with the "Yud" and "Hey" letters of His name, and this is the escort of the letters "Yud" and "Hey" as explained. This is why the mitzvah of escorting is greater than anything they do with the guests. This is as explained.

In the secret of the Priestly Blessing:
Know that there are seven types of blessings created in the world, and they are: 
Wisdom, Children, Life, Grace, Wealth, Leadership, and Peace. All of them are hinted at in the Priestly Blessing. We also taught in the book of Yetsirah, Chapter 4, that no more than these seven types of blessings were created in the world. <br>Therefore, the priest who blesses needs to direct in the proper order for all these seven types of blessings. In the phrase "May He bless you," one must intend that the Almighty will bestow wisdom upon all of Israel, as the Sage wrote that there is no blessing except wisdom, as it says, "And God blessed Solomon," and it is written, "And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon." It is also stated in the Book of Bahir that there is no wisdom except as a blessing. <br>In the phrase "And guard you," one must aim for the blessing that the Almighty will grant children to Israel, for there is no preservation for a person not to have his name erased from Israel except through children, and with children, one is guarded against all evil. <br>In the phrase "May the Lord shine His face upon you," one must aim for the blessing that the Almighty will increase good and healthy life for Israel because one who is alive and healthy has a radiant countenance. <br>In the phrase "And be gracious to you," one must aim for the blessing that the Almighty will bless Israel with charm. In the phrase "May the Lord lift His face toward you," one must aim for the blessing that the Almighty will bless Israel with wealth and leadership, as leadership is dependent on wealth, and servitude is associated with poverty. <br>In the phrase "And grant you peace," one must aim for the blessing that the Almighty will bless Israel with the blessing of peace, as its literal meaning, as mentioned in the Sefer Yetzirah.

To explain the concept of marriage:
The primary commandment in all the commandments is the commandment of procreation, and it precedes all the commandments in the Torah. It is the first of the commandments, as in the portion of Bereshit, where it is written, "And God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.'" This matter was the will of the Creator even for birds and fish, as written about them, "And God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.'" Likewise, in the portion of Noah, it is written, "Every creature that is with you of all flesh, be it fowl or cattle or beast of the field that are with you, let them multiply on the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth." This extends to the warning not to castrate even a dog, as it is written, "You shall not do thus in your land." Even the nations are commanded in this, as stated in the Talmud in Yevamot, Chapter "Hey ayin reish lamed," that regarding a convert who has children before converting, it is sufficient for him if they convert with him. The Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explained this. Furthermore, even in the case of someone whose half is a slave and half is free, it was said in the tractate Kiddushin, "You have improved his master but not himself." Even regarding a freeborn who is idle and unoccupied, it is impossible. As it is written, "He did not create it a waste; He formed it to be inhabited." This matter includes for Israel converting Gentiles, serving as servants, or providing for animals, fish, and birds, whether impure or pure. Due to the importance of this matter for humans, the temptation exists even for an infant on its first day.
And the reason for this matter is explained in the Zohar in Pekudin, that the divine presence does not spread in its branches below except through the descent of higher souls. For this reason, a person must procreate and multiply to continue the descent of higher souls below. Through the existence of souls below, a higher light will emanate in the lower realms, and the divine presence in the lower realms has a need for the higher realms.As the divine presence descends below and rectifies itself in the actions of the lower realms, the light of the sefirot will emanate in it. When the light of the sefirot emanates in the Kingdom, the light of the Ein Sof emanates in the sefirot and in the Kingdom and in the lower chariots, as is known. The Ein Sof light does not spread in its entirety but in a complete vessel. The sefirot are not complete except when they are connected with the Kingdom, and the Kingdom is adorned for unification only when it dwells and resides in the lower realms, which is adorned through their actions.It is known that the commandment that directs the existence of the supreme unity has no equal, as other commandments instruct the preparation of the unity and its adornment, and they are 248, corresponding to the 248 upper limbs. Through this, it is found that in the foundation, all the upper aspects are included. According to this, the commandment of procreation and multiplication encompasses all the aspects of the other commandments. Besides this, it causes another aspect that other commandments do not cause, as the divine presence in the lower realms depends on this commandment.
And behold, Adam the first man was not commanded with a positive commandment except this one, to have all the worlds dependent on this commandment as explained. Even the other creatures, by nature embedded in them through the ministering angel appointed over them, do not have a way of good action but rather the fulfillment of their species in nature. On this, the commandment comes not to mate even a dog because it instructs, God forbid, about the dryness of the upper source, the flow appropriate for the ministering angel appointed over that species. <br>Now, one who avoids this matter has a great punishment, and it is less than that of an unclean animal, snakes, and even insects. It is similar to a hard shell that does not bear fruit and enters itself there. Therefore, one who nullifies it finds it easy not to have been created, and therefore, that body has no redemption at all fundamentally. Also, all the other commandments will not benefit him unless he merits purification because all the commandments do not illuminate except through this commandment. Since their vitality is dependent on this inclusive aspect that we explained, and this is as explained.

Explaining the Concept of Marriage:
Regarding the matter of marriage, a great misconception has fallen upon the minds of many people, thinking that marriage is based on one's strength and virility. In this regard, some are inclined toward profit and wealth, while others set their eyes on beauty, and some focus on the family being of good standing. There is no doubt that all these considerations are inappropriate. It is close to me to say that this matter operates in two ways, as if to say that most of our generation behaves inappropriately, and there is no one who chooses his spouse properly. Everything depends on the circumstances, like the saying, "As in the matter of grabbing in vineyards" or "Perhaps he will precede him in mercy." Alternatively, it may be said that even now, suitable souls exist, and the Holy One, blessed be He, arranges this so that it will be taken and enriched for this purpose. The cause of these things is that the evil and inappropriate thoughts of human beings align with the decree of His wisdom.
..However, among the difficult matters that complicate this issue is the strictness of our sages regarding the marriage of a Torah scholar. If the decree is true that one should only be matched based on his deeds or the suitability of his spouse, then it is challenging for me. If every man can marry a Torah scholar, what will other daughters of Israel do? I found in the Zohar, in the portion of "Lech Lecha," an explanation of this matter, and they said, "Rabbi Chiya said, 'Whoever is permitted [to marry] will come [and be matched], and the one whose deeds are proper will demand the match he deserves.' He [God] said to him, 'Teach them [people] that a person should always sell what he has and marry a daughter of Torah scholars, as a Torah scholar is trustworthy in managing money; they will be managed in his hands.' Now, the understanding of this statement depends on two things: first, what they said in the tractate Sotah, here regarding the first marriage, and there regarding the second marriage. Similarly, the Zohar explains in the portion of Lech Lecha. If you say, 'Isn't matching [marriage] done according to the ordinary way?' know that he [God] will certainly arrange the match for him. The one who deserves it and whose deeds are suitable will be matched, and his deeds will qualify him to connect with the one designated for him.
And this matter will be understood from the first premise, which is that a person can merit his spouse in one of two ways and lose his spouse in one of two ways. The first way is when a person has a new soul that has never been reincarnated. If this man, through his deeds, merits a spouse who is pure and untainted by anyone, and she, too, is new and has never been reincarnated, their union will be like the union of the patriarchs, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and the like. The second way is when a person has been reincarnated and has merited that, before, he was worthy and suitable. Just as he has been reincarnated, his spouse has been reincarnated with him to fulfill their destiny together as appropriate, or according to the decree of His wisdom regarding reincarnation, as will be explained elsewhere. Both of them are reincarnated, and they are matched, and their union is successful. On such a premise, the commentaries explain that there is a righteous person for whom the right time has come, meaning a righteous person whose spouse is suitable for him and is reincarnated with him. Examples of this are Moses with Zipporah, David with Bathsheba, Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa with his spouse, and many others like them.
There are two ways in which a person can lose his spouse. The first way is when he has been reincarnated to fulfill his purpose, and his spouse has already achieved and completed her purpose. In this case, he does not have the merit to compel her to reincarnate for his benefit, and this refers to a righteous person for whom the right time has not yet come. This is explained in the commentaries. After he completes his destiny in this world, she will return to be with him, and she is waiting for him. It is possible that sometimes, in his old age, everything will be reincarnated according to the talent of his deeds and the decree of his wisdom. This is why we see some who marry virgins or young women in their old age and then experience peace, the continuation of the household, and satisfaction from their spouse. The second way is when someone loses his spouse entirely, and he has no spouse at all. These are the ones who died childless, and their wives were leverated, and they were impregnated by their levirate brothers. These are considered others, and they have no spouse at all except through abduction, as explained in the Zohar in several places, particularly in the Parashat Mishpatim in Saba.
There are two other scenarios in which a person can lose his spouse for a certain period. The first scenario is when a person has committed many sins and corrupted his deeds to the extent that he will not merit a spouse until she returns with complete repentance as is fitting. He may, however, marry another woman immediately after divorcing his previous wife to honor his sin by not keeping his previous spouse. According to the appearance in the corrections, the specific sin for this case may be the sin of adultery during childhood, meaning that just as he did not preserve the first drop for his spouse, she will not be preserved for him and will be given to another after all. An example of this is David with Bathsheba, except that she was preserved for him, as Uriah had never touched her. This is due to David's righteousness in preserving the drop in a permitted way. Alternatively, the spouse might not be given to another but is kept as a deposit for her husband until he merits and takes her. There is a significant difference between these two scenarios, as giving her to another is very difficult for her subsequent marriage, as it requires deferring her soul for the sake of another soul, and it is challenging to be placed before him, even though it is all judgment and justice, as stated in the Zohar. This is illustrated by Uriah being rejected because of David, but if she is not given to another, there is no obligation to defer a soul for another soul, as he can marry her himself. This is similar to the case of Bathsheba being given to David despite being previously married to several men. The second scenario is when she has corrupted her deeds, is not suitable for him, and is forbidden in the hands of harsh masters until she repents of her ugly deeds. Then she may merit another spouse after deferring her soul for the sake of another soul, as it is not possible in another way. These two scenarios may never happen unless a person repents.
Another difficult aspect is when a person loses his spouse forever and ever. This occurs in two ways due to her corruption. The first way is when a man divorces his wife because this action distances her from him. If the divorce is due to a matter of prohibited relations, she is divorced, and regarding her, it is said, "She shall go and become another man's." This is certain and undeniable. In such a case, the first husband cannot take her back. This is explained in the Zohar with the example of Rabbi Levinus, a resident of Kfar Ono, who was mocking. If the wife was divorced because of the husband's evil deeds, and she is righteous, she does not descend but is given to another. The other ascends with her, and she does not get divorced from him. Instead, the second husband clings to her for his benefit with his righteous deeds. This is why the Scripture says, "And the last man hates." There is a last man who hates, and there is a last man who does not hate. For this reason, the Torah established the law of the suspected adulteress (Sotah): if she became corrupt, she would not be divorced but would drink the bitter waters, die, be reincarnated, and return to her original husband. Divorce is not the same; even the altar sheds tears for it, as it truly separates two faces forever.
After introducing the mentioned concepts, Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzchak said the following in the tractate Sotah, as Rabbi Yochanan opened with the same idea when discussing the Sotah. He said: "A person does not marry a woman except according to his deeds, as it is stated, 'For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the portion of the righteous.'" Rabbah bar bar Chana said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that this matter is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea. As it is said, "God makes a home for the lonely; He brings out the prisoners into prosperity." Do not read "brings out" but rather as "brings out," meaning that just as God brings out, so too a person must bring out. I ask: Isn't this contradictory to what Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rav, that forty days before the formation of the fetus, a divine voice goes forth and declares, "The daughter of so-and-so is destined for so-and-so"? It is not difficult; here, it refers to the first marriage, and there, it refers to the second marriage. Now, the matter of the Sotah involves her deeds contaminating a matter that separates her from her husband. If the matter could be rectified by a divorce document (Get), the marriage would be annulled from its foundation, and her soul would be separated from her husband. Therefore, it is preferable to rectify it through the waters of the Sotah. If she is pure, she remains pure with the pure; if she is impure, and he is impure, the waters do not check, as explained by our sages. The man is cleansed from sin, etc. Therefore, if both are pure, and she is impure, the waters destroy her building, and she is rebuilt a second time. If, after all this, she still goes astray, either she eventually comes back to her husband, or she dies due to her sin, and everything happens according to the decree of His blessed wisdom. This is why Reish Lakish said in the tractate Sotah that one does not marry a woman except according to his deeds, meaning either pure with the pure or impure with the impure, as it is stated, "For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest." This is the reason for the Sotah, as explained.
The difficulty in comparing the marriage of a couple to the splitting of the Red Sea is based on the statements of Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yochanan, which were specifically mentioned regarding the second marriage, as will be deduced later. Now, the reasoning for this is as follows: since souls, both male and female, are inherently pure, combining pure with pure and impure with impure, the separation that occurs in the world when they descend makes it challenging for them to reunite, akin to the difficulty of splitting the Red Sea, as will be explained later. The difficulty arises because, even during the approximately nine months of gestation in the mother's womb, souls unite regardless of their spiritual standing. As the sages mentioned, forty days before the formation of the fetus, a divine voice declares the destined spouse for a person. This refers to a specific soul that is earmarked for a particular individual, even though it has not yet taken physical form. It is impossible to declare the woman for the man explicitly, as she does not yet have a body. Nevertheless, God, in His wisdom, ensures that the appropriate soul, whether pure or moderate according to the intentions of the father and mother, is assigned to the child at the moment of conception. The moment the angel named Lailah raises the drop (the sperm) on high, God gives it the suitable soul that corresponds to the child's parents and their sanctification during marital relations. Immediately, God declares, "The daughter of so-and-so is destined for so-and-so." This proclamation is not publicized to the individuals involved, as the embryo has not yet developed into a recognizable form. Instead, it signifies that the specific soul designated for a particular individual is prepared for the assigned individual. This declaration occurs before the separation of the body and soul, demonstrating that these souls are meant to unite. Therefore, understanding that they will eventually marry is not contingent on their later union.
...And prior to this, the difficulty arises due to the will of the Creator, as everything in the nature of existence indicates that they should easily unite. Why should their matter be respected? The explanation is not as you originally thought, but rather the interpretation is that there are two types of unions. The first type is the initial union, meaning the one that occurs when their status has not changed. Their actions remain unchanged, and the spouse is not given to another. This union is light and not burdensome; it is natural and straightforward. Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yochanan explained that the difficulty in this union is akin to the splitting of the Red Sea, which signifies a situation where one needs to separate oneself for the benefit of another. This is explained in the Zohar in the context of the phrase "Lech Lecha," and it refers to the second marriage, which is postponed due to the first spouse's presence. Despite this, within the realm of justice and mercy, both are considered, and the Egyptians were rejected for the sake of Israel. Thus, there is both justice and mercy in this matter, similar to the situation in Egypt. They were judged and had mercy shown to them concurrently. The Egyptians were rejected for the sake of Israel, exemplifying both justice and mercy in one context. It was possible for their days to be prolonged further if they hadn't been rejected for the sake of Israel, just as the Egyptians had not yet filled their measure. This dual aspect of justice and mercy is also evident in the Midrash's interpretation of "Kishru, Bechi, v'Shiru" (they tied, cried, and sang). Tying represents the rejection, crying symbolizes the exile, and singing signifies the redemption. Thus, justice is applied in one aspect, while mercy is extended in another. This is also reflected in the story of Joseph, where his actions led to him being united with his spouse, even if she was initially in the hands of another. This elucidates the meaning of the statement, and it completes the discussion that was designated for it.
...The second matter is that when male and female souls unite, they are necessarily matched. The point is that when the male attains the soul and not the spirit or the neshamah, he will only be given a spouse if she is like him, possessing only a soul. It is impossible to unite with a spirit, neshamah, or the like unless they lack something, and each lacks the other. Thus, they are not balanced to ascend unless they are precisely in accordance with their deeds.When a person possesses a complete soul, spirit, and neshamah, he merits having a spouse in completeness, as male and female are united in all aspects—soul with soul, spirit with spirit, and neshamah with neshamah. In this case, the female lacks the power to extricate herself from the dominion of the Creator when she is twelve years old, for example. In most women, they are eligible and do not have the same ability as a person who can free themselves from the dominion of the Creator from the age of thirteen until the age of eighteen for marriage. Therefore, a bachelor who has not tasted the taste of sin is highly commendable, as our sages explained. Consequently, the female soul is precious when it is under the supervision of one who draws her from above with purity. Just as an individual's actions dictate, a person draws a soul to a newborn. The female soul, pure and clean, has no one to draw her in purity. She is entrusted to the one who draws her from above in cleanliness and purity. This is achieved through Torah scholars and those engaged in Torah and mitzvot with purity. They unite with their spouses in sanctity, drawing these souls and meriting to have a worthy and righteous student.

Now, with this, the statement that we previously cited in "Man Demands a Deposit" will be understood. It is clear that one who is refined in good and proper deeds attains the soul, spirit, and neshamah. Therefore, the phrase "one who demands a deposit" refers to someone who is upright in good and proper actions, and he merits the soul, spirit, and neshamah. Consequently, one who wishes to marry should demand a deposit, indicating that the intention is not to take an actual name. It is still possible that his spouse may be entrusted to another or to a person of many proper deeds, such as a charity collector or a teacher of young children, as explained by our sages. Therefore, he said that he should demand a deposit if one of the parties defaults.To explain the matter, we learn in a Baraita: "A person should always sell all he possesses and marry the daughter of a Torah scholar." The reason is that sometimes people are very interested in wealth and generosity. Therefore, he said that a person should always sell all he possesses and marry the daughter of a Torah scholar. The reason is the "deposit" of Mariya, referring to the pure soul given as a deposit, as those souls are only entrusted to the hands of a Torah scholar.

The secret of a pregnant and nursing woman:
The matter is that one who emits seed in vain affects the external forces called 'batalah' (wasted). However, one who impregnates his wife, even a nursing or pregnant woman, is not considered emitting seed in vain because she conceives when commanded by our sages. This is also a mitzvah for Torah scholars from Friday evening to Friday evening. The reason is that through this action, as it occurs in a state of holiness, the husband and wife unite in the secret of their souls. Then, inevitably, they will bring about something from their higher root. If so, even a husband and wife who are unfit to conceive through physical means will conceive spiritually in the realm of the soul. This is the secret of 'and He breathed into his nostrils the soul that He made,' for this reason, it is not considered wasted seed influencing external forces. God forbid! Rather, it is to conceive spiritually, as the verse says."

Nahar 67

The Secret of Marital Modesty:
The matter is that all the actions of the material world, if the physical desire overcomes them, even if it is for the sake of Heaven or for the sake of a commandment, most of that action is given to the external force of that desire. The main focus of these externals is to be in this matter, as evidenced by the snake with Eve. Therefore, the main intention should not be directed towards the material but towards the intellect and the intellectual soul. This is almost impossible unless most of the arousal of that action is directed towards the defective inclination. How can one avoid it? By strengthening oneself with self-discipline and sweat, as it says, 'tremble and do not sin.' As we see, the evil inclination purifies itself and does not gain control, but the pure aspect within it works for the sake of Heaven. Then, there is no control over the external. These are the two conditions for distinguishing the external: a) the desire, b) self-discipline and sweat, and also c) the covering mentioned in the Zohar at the beginning.
The matter is that anyone who engages in permissible activities, as do those who commit obscene acts and engage in licentiousness and promiscuity, will receive his share from the woman engaging in adultery. He will wear it and defile himself with it, and he will be called impure. All of this will lead him to a lower state, engaging in what is permissible for him in a physical manner, like those who have no internal entrance. Therefore, they abandon themselves, their approach, and their drop of seed. However, those who are internal in holiness will not abandon their approach when it is permissible for them. Instead, they sanctify themselves concerning matters that distance the adulterous woman from them. This is why it is said in a similar vein, 'A wayward woman eats and wipes her mouth, and says, "I have committed no iniquity."' The point is that when a person is clad in the evil inclination, and even when it is permissible for him, in a manner that is unseemly, immediately the adulterous woman seizes the opportunity and indulges in that union. She eats from it, wipes her mouth, and says, 'It is permissible.' He does not realize that there is a share in it for external forces, and the adulterous woman derives pleasure from it. This is also the case with all permissible matters that have a share for external forces. Hence, sanctify yourself even in what is permissible for you, and so on.
Similarly, one who engages in the customs of the nations, participating in their gatherings or entering their places of worship, will attract an evil influence to himself. The person may believe that he is not affected by impurity, only slightly contaminated, and may not realize that it penetrates his soul. The reason is that their gathering places become a residence for the nocturnal evil force, as it is said that the evening demon dwells on their children. When one enters into their midst, he steps into the realm of their impure atmosphere. Therefore, one who ascends to the lofty spiritual level should distance himself from deriving benefit from them. He should not enter their gatherings or ascend to their places of worship unless absolutely necessary. Without a doubt, he sits in the wings of the impure nocturnal force, contaminating him like a menstruating woman in her seat alone. Even the assembly of the ignorant is somewhat impure. All of this is mentioned in the corrections, as stated.

Nahar 68

In the explanation of the rest and coverings of the soul:
The concept is that just as for the completeness of all bodily needs, two things are required: clothing and food, similarly, for the completeness of the souls, two things are required: commandments and Torah study. This is because the soul has 248 spiritual limbs and 365 spiritual sinews. It resides within the body, a spiritual organ within the physical organ, with 248 limbs corresponding to the 248 sparks of the soul. If a person were to commit a transgression, God forbid, by looking at something forbidden, then the eye of the soul becomes blocked and covered with a shell, unable to see the spiritual realm. It cannot perceive the secrets of the Torah, and the book is closed before it. Similarly, the ear and other organs may be affected, causing the spiritual ear to become deaf to spiritual matters, not hearing the declarations of angels. The mouth may become mute, unable to speak spiritual words. This is illustrated by the story of a certain righteous man who guarded his limbs from wrongdoing, and the Satan accused him. A beautiful woman appeared to him, and he was saved by blinding his eyes with a fiery nail. This act was to protect the physical eyes from becoming a cause of blocking the eyes of the soul. This is why they were blinded to save the eyes of the soul. This corresponds to the statement, 'Do not turn to the idols; and a molten god, you shall not make for yourselves,' so that you will not turn like an idol with eyes that cannot see.
Know that in the mouth, it is quicker to sin than in other limbs, and it is very difficult to guard it. Therefore, they warned with their statement, 'When you sit at home, guard the opening of your mouth,' since speech is a part of the soul that goes out. With every word, if it is a conversation of a commandment, an angel is created, and if it is of impurity, an evil angel is created. If it is vain talk, a vain angel is created. This is because prayer, holiness, and Torah that a person speaks penetrate the firmament and ascend upwards, as mentioned in the Zohar. If it is evil speech, it contaminates the soul, and the holy part of that speech ascends to a place of impurity resembling it. The holy part remains confined in prison, and much effort is required to release it, seemingly, until it is brought out from there. Violating the covenant of the mouth, which is holier and superior to the lower covenant, is called 'nevalot peh' (rottenness of the mouth). Like a carcass that has no remedy, this sin has almost no remedy except through profound repentance. This is why it says, 'Guard the opening of your mouth,' indicating only the opening of the mouth is necessary. Similarly, it warns about other things, 'Let your garments always be white,' meaning that the body, which is the garment, and the clothing for the soul, should be adorned with the commandments to dress the soul. 'Oil on your head,' refers to the soul, which is the 'lamp of God' (Proverbs 20:27), and should not lack. If, God forbid, it turns the other way, the soul will be damaged, as mentioned regarding its 248 limbs, which become contaminated. It is necessary to bleach them with the light of Gehenna, to burn the black garment, whiten the soul, purify it, and restore it to its original place from where it was hewn

Also, spiritual sustenance is the Torah. If a person does not engage in Torah study for its own sake in this world day and night, he will lack sustenance in the world of souls, even if he has the garment, which is the commandments. Then, in the world of souls, he will hunger for the superior sustenance. This is the secret of 'And the people went out and gathered it daily,' signifying that they collect their reward and sustenance day by day. They gather their wages and sustenance, day by day. The multiplication is to inform you that there is a day in this world and a day in the world to come. What a person engages in for one day in this world corresponds to a great and endless spiritual day above. All the Torah and commandments that a person engages in during this world constitute a limited and confined day, and in the world of souls, it ascends to infinity. This refers to the matter of 'day by day,' meaning the Torah, which a person speaks in this world, leads them to his day, which is the day above. The intention is that a person should bring with him that which will be sustenance for his soul in the Garden of Eden.

Nahar 69

Explaining the Secret of Positive and Negative Commandments, the Secret of Plagues in Houses, Garments, and Human Beings:
Understand that the Blessed God chose Israel from among all the nations and took them for Himself alone as a people. He commanded that we be distinct and separate from all impurities. The concept is that each of the 248 positive commandments has its unique virtue to attach us to the Divine Presence. Likewise, each of the 365 negative commandments has its virtue to separate us and distinguish us from the forces of impurity so that they do not dominate us and do not afflict us.
Know that the 365 types of impure forces are susceptible to afflict a person through evil actions. In response to them, we were commanded in the Torah with the 365 negative commandments, no more and no less. Anyone who violates any one of them brings upon themselves a spiritual blemish from one of the 365 impure forces corresponding to that particular transgression. Even after the preparation of this spiritual blemish, that force is not allowed to afflict the person until it receives permission. This permission is granted when the individual repeats the same transgression, as will be clarified. Permission is given only to the force corresponding to that specific transgression. <br>Any plague appearing on the wall of a house does not come out of it independently; it is caused by the transgression itself committed by the owner of the house. The blemish becomes a visible plague for the owner of the house. This plague should have ideally manifested on the owner's physical body, but due to God's mercy, it is not inflicted upon the owner unless there are two warnings. The first occurs on the wall of the house; if the owner repents, it is better for him. If not, and he does not repent, then the second warning appears on his garment. If he still does not repent, then he is afflicted, and the plague becomes visible on his body. <br>Permission for the impure force to afflict with regard to these plagues is given only through the judgment of the priest. This is mentioned in the teachings of our Sages, may their memory be blessed.

Nahar 1

River A - in the secret of the primordial existence of the ten sefirot:...
Behold, from the renewal of the temporal world, today is the fifth millennium and the 79th year. It will be pleased that so many times the sun traveled from the point of the Aries constellation and circled to it, which is the period of the solar cycle divided into four parts, and they are the twelve constellations. Each period of the four seasons is three constellations. Now, this time is dependent on the celestial sphere counted from the time the sphere is renewed and moves. This occurs from the birth of the first man who found a renewed world like himself. He understood in his wisdom the renewal of the world and sanctified the moon and began to count years. However, before this time, angels were not found heading eastward, except in the six days when the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and these were the revealed beings. Likewise, the hidden beings preceding the action in time and in transcendence were also found, meaning that the angels of the world of creation were renewed with the renewal of the revealed material beings. As for the Throne, which is the world of creation, whether it is renewed in time like angels or precedes in the primordial state is not clearly explained. Nevertheless, our sages of blessed memory said that the Throne of Glory preceded the world. They also explained this in Perkei De Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 3.
And it is found according to this that the material creation is not composed of the formation, for if so, it would be fitting for the formation to precede the action, and not so. Instead, some of the action preceded the formation. The angels were created in the second, and the heavens and the earth were created in the first. Likewise, it is explained elsewhere that the heavens were created from a certain place, the light that is the garment of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, "He wraps Himself in light like a garment" (Psalms 104:2). They desired to know from where the heavens were created. Although it seems that the creation ascends to the action in the order of degrees, since the action is lower than the formation, it is not from there that the heavens and the earth were created but from the light that clothes the transcendence, meaning the creation, the light that clothes the divine emanation. They were expanding and extending until He said to them, "Enough," for now that they are formed from the creation, it would be appropriate for them to be stretched according to their measure. However, He said to them "Enough" and contracted them in this state that is lower than the formation. The earth was not created from the side of the formation, which is still only from the snow under the Throne of Glory, etc. Behold, the explanation is that the heavens and the earth created on the first day, their cause is not the formation but the Throne, meaning the creation. And in the chapter "In two," the Holy One, blessed be He, created the firmament and the angels, etc., and concludes with it, meaning the firmament above the heads of the living beings, etc. So too, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai explained in Parashat Bereshit and in the Tikunim, the cause of this world is the creation. And so is the judgment that the governance of the formation in the world is only on weekdays. If Adam had merited, he would have been worthy of an eternal Sabbath, and on weekdays, governance is by the formation, and on the Sabbath, governance is by the emanation vested in the creation. If the world had been created in formation, it would have been necessarily subject to it by the force of its cause, which is the formation, and there would be no sanctity of the Sabbath in it. Now, since it is found from the creation, it ascends essentially from the Sabbath, and on the Sabbath, the governance is by the emanation, and when it goes out from the governance of the Sabbath to the governance of the weekday, meaning from Binah, the world of formation, it goes out of its natural state that adheres to it.
And now, we do not need to give precedence to the world, but to the Throne. The Throne, in the aspect of its existence, precedes the world. Every existence, the spread of its essence, continuously extends its existence as long as its essence is delayed. Its spreading is not a precession of time because time is only from the first day onward when this material time was created. But rather, time is the existence of the spreading, for when the first level began to spread from the Throne, it spread and continued until the completion of that aspect. It started with two, and so on until the completion of the final spreading of the levels of the Throne. This preceding existence is a time that is not a material time but is like that time that our sages, may their memory be blessed, limited for the precession of the Torah forever, which is a time within time. It is not time in the usual sense. This is the matter of the ne'etzalim (emanated entities). The idea is that the Ein Sof (Infinite) precedes all existing things wonderfully, so that no precession can be justified in it. The Keter (Crown) willed from its emanation until it rose willingly above the desires and preceded all emanated entities. Afterwards, the other Sefirot spread one after another until the completion of their spreading. This is the intention.

Nahar 2

 Explaining the Vestment of the Divine Presence:
Know that the beginning of existence, after the domination of external forces and the removal of the Shekhina (Divine Presence) from the lower realms due to the corruption and sin caused by the early generations, generation after generation, the Klipah (shell) strengthened and closed the gates of holiness. The Shekhina stood in the upper realms, except for what clothed itself externally to descend upon Israel in the Egyptian exile, as it is written, "I will descend with you to Egypt, and I will surely bring you up also." When Moses, our teacher, peace be upon him, saw from within the bush, i.e., the thorns, it was to reveal the secret of the vestment to a fiery daughter, meaning a daughter of the eye, a daughter of a king, clothed in thorns that cannot be without them. Similarly, the Shekhina in the midst of exile clothes itself within the domain of the rulers of Egypt, as will be explained in its proper place.
And behold, when the Shekhina descended to Israel in the secret of the Tabernacle, that Klipah (shell) strengthened itself in its judgment, and it closed the passage with the force of the sins of the previous generations. These are the same souls that were reincarnated, rectified, and clothed in Israel, as will be explained elsewhere with the help of God. The Shekhina said, "These have distanced themselves with their sins, sealing the gates of holiness. How can the Shekhina descend to them in a widespread manner? It is fitting that it descends only through a vestment from the outside, as it did when it emerged in exile, clothing itself in the four Klipot, which are Asiya, Yetzira, Beriya, and Atzilut. I saw, and behold, a stormy wind coming from the north, a large cloud, and a flashing fire, and a brightness surrounding it, and from within it, etc." Within these Klipot, the Shekhina will vest itself when descending to them below. Therefore, the merit of the ancients and the compassion of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the merit of our holy forefathers stood, and the entrance opened, and all the Klipot were shattered, creating an opening for the Holy Presence to pass through to the outside, illuminating for Israel and singing upon them without any external garment at all and without any separating barrier from these external forces.

And this opening burst forth then in the desert opposite the dwelling place of the children of Israel, and it went with them on their heads until it stood opposite the entire land of Israel, four hundred parasangs. It extends from the beginning of the border of the land of Israel to its end, on one side called "Gvilon" and on the other side called "Magidon." Within these boundaries, between Gvilon and Magidon, there is no Klipah (shell) and barrier at all between the entrance of the Holy of Holies to the foundation of the sapphire stone, to the holy land of Israel. Instead, that air descended immediately and illuminated without vesting itself at all in the four Klipot, which are the secret of the external crowns. From this perspective, it is said that the land of Israel is holy, and the air of the land of Israel is holy. In contrast, the land of the nations, its dust is impure, and its air is impure, and whoever enters it is very close to stumbling. Therefore, when the patriarchs went abroad, they needed several vows. Did Jacob not say, "If God will be with me"? Regarding Joseph, it is written, "And the Lord was with Joseph." Our sages explained it as a parable to a man who was carrying [something], behold, Abraham, who entered Egypt to test whether he would cling to the Klipot. However, in the land of Israel, a person is guarded. The roots of the land of Israel belong to the domain of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the domain extends to the land, which is the domain of the external forces, the impure air. Therefore, guarding is necessary for the righteous, as mentioned. And this is a comparison.

Nahar 3

The rest of the Land of Israel is situated beneath the gate of the heavens.
The Land of Israel is placed under the gate of the heavens, meaning under the window through the covering of the heavens. This window is square, narrow from above, and wide from below. Its measure is a cubic Tefach above by a cubic Tefach below, similar to the measure of the Temple, for the entire Temple was placed under the window. Through the thickness of the covering window, which measures the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the measure of the window from below is four hundred parsecs by four hundred parsecs, the measure of the Land of Israel and all the Land of Israel underneath it. The abundance descends from above through the pipe of the Kingdom of the Ten Sefirot from the World of Emanation. It descends in a straight line until the mentioned covering window and falls upon the Temple. From the Temple, it spreads over the entire Land of Israel. When the breaches multiplied in the first Temple due to the vanity of evil speech, gossip, and foul language, causing sin, that abundance became denser, coagulated, and turned into a thick cloud. It began to close little by little around the edges of the window until on the ninth of Av, it closed entirely, and the flow ceased, and the Temple was destroyed. And immediately, right after the destruction of the Temple, the Holy One, blessed be He, opened the window and removed the world of the wheels. He contracted the dominion of the world of the wheels within the window, so that it would not close again. This opening will never be sealed except specifically at the time of destruction when permission is granted to external forces to enter the land to destroy the Temple, as mentioned. Immediately, they were expelled from there, and there is a covering and a screen, a curtain surrounding the Land of Israel, which preserves these boundaries so that the husk does not spread, and it expels any foreign entity from within it. Even though the Land of Israel is desolate and desolate due to this external operation, which is the act of destruction, despite all this, it does not dominate the Land of Israel. Rather, it was destroyed, expelled, and the Land of Israel stood even in its desolation, clean and pure, free from any foreign presence within it.
And know that the measurement of the Land of Israel is a distance of four hundred parsa by four hundred parsa. Now, only a hundred by a hundred remains, which is half of the eighth part. Every place, previously fertile and abundant, has now become shriveled and contracted. This is in accordance with the desolation of its Sabbaths, corresponding to the seventy Shemittah cycles that were nullified. Only remnants are left, and even though they sow in its remnants, it is as if they sow in a place where nothing grows.
And know that the Almighty, blessed be He, promised to Abraham to give his descendants ten lands, corresponding to the attribute of Malchut (Kingship), which is inclusive of the Ten Sefirot. In the days of Moses, however, He promised them only seven lands, corresponding to the seven lower Sefirot. This is in opposition to the seven lower Sefirot. Nevertheless, the Land of Keni, Kenizi, and Kadmoni, which correspond to the three upper Sefirot, was not promised at that time because in that era, only the lower Sefirot were in operation. However, after the final redemption, when the three upper Sefirot will be active, then He will grant them the entire ten. Know that the land of Sichon and Og is part of the border of the three mentioned, and for this reason, the children of Gad chose it since it is destined to be opposite the three upper Sefirot. It is destined to be chosen above all the land. Even though it has not yet been sanctified after the redemption, it is possible that Moses, our teacher, may be buried there, as it is known from the secret of Da'at (knowledge) associated with that place.

Nahar 4

To explain the secret of the ladder and its significance:
Know that this ladder is the light, and it surrounds the entire Land of Israel. The form of the territory of the Land of Israel is neither long nor round nor square; rather, it is shaped like a person lying down, his head to the east, and his two arms spread out, one to the north and one to the south. His two thighs are open, one facing the northern-western corner (which is a horn) and one facing the southern-western corner (which is a horn). Between his two legs, the Great Sea enters, and the sea is to the west of the Land of Israel. Therefore, the Land of Israel is all large and small strips, and the mentioned ladder encompasses all the strips. It has steps on both sides, inward towards the Land of Israel, and outward crossing over to the outside of the land.
And know that every inhabitant outside the land is surrounded by eleven thousand angels, as it is written, 'A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand' (Psalms 91:7). They ascend in the order of the ladder, from the outside towards the outside of the land, and go to their places. At that moment when a person enters the airspace of the ladder, immediately, twenty-two thousand angels of purity descend through the steps of the ladder from the inside, equivalent to the number of letters in the Torah. They accompany him, twenty thousand from one side and two thousand from the other side, hinting at the verse, 'The chariots of God are myriads, thousands of Shainan' (Psalms 68:18). All the inhabitants in the Land of Israel are also with him, twenty-two thousand angels of purity, as mentioned. However, when someone with an unfortunate fate ventures outside the land and approaches the mentioned ladder, the aforementioned twenty-two thousand angels distance themselves from him. They ascend through the ladder's steps inward and return to their places, while eleven thousand descend and accompany him outside the land.

Nahar 5

Stream 5 - To address two strong and formidable questions: the first, how does the evil inclination operate in the Land of Israel, and the second, what is the nature of death in the Land of Israel.
Now, based on what we have explained, two strong questions arise. The first concerns the evil inclination in the Land of Israel—how does it operate? The second relates to death in the Land of Israel—what is its nature? Regarding the first question, it should be noted that the nature of the matter in the Land of Israel is such that the influence of the external forces to lead astray is not dependent on this. It is similar to the way it has control to exit from its domain to entice, as it comes out of this boundary and enters the holy realm. The point is that to the north of the Land of Israel, there is an entrance to the external forces to enter this pure air and come to the entrance of the sanctuary to be there as a gateway for sin, lying there to be brought up. Therefore, opposite the external walls of the sanctuary, the klipot (shells) cling, like the shells of a nut, for they are the four holy chambers, and the klipah clings from outside. This means that the secret of that holiness flows to these external forces, and inevitably, they have levels upon levels, descending from there and nursing from them. That is why all the chambers have external nudity—that is, the external entities that adhere there and revolve. Hence, to the north, there is an opening through which these entities exit from their territory and enter. This is why it is said, "The Satan also came among them." This is also the control of the externals in the Land, concerning all the missions in the world. This opening standing to the north is called Nokva D'tehoma Raba.
And similarly, any part given to the external forces, such as the smoke of the incense from limbs and joints, which fumes all night, tends specifically toward the north side of the Land of Israel, through the same opening from where it goes out to them. It gives them an aspect related to the entrance of the chamber, as the klipot that revolve around are called Nokva D'tehoma Raba. The chamber itself is called Tehoma Raba, and this part of the abyss holds all ten crowns and the seven chambers up to the ninth expanse of the firmament, from bottom to top, as such:
And behold, the firmaments, nine or seven secrets of the entire creation, form a complete sphere with no opening at all. The firmaments revolve and encompass the entire existence without any opening at all. However, the klipot and their dominion are the ones that broke and shattered, losing their control over the Earth. Only when they are removed through the opening and the channel, their dominion is established on Earth. In contrast, outside the Land, their dominion is established in several ways....
And behold, through the opening, those kelipot emerge to seduce, tempt, and kill, and they are given control in the land, as will be explained with the help of God. However, Gehenna is not like this. Instead, souls are expelled through the opening of Nukva d'Tehoma Raba and go outside, where they are judged until they ascend through the opening after their purification, as explained in the well. <br>Now, the secret of this opening, to the north, opposite the chambers, is essentially to enter the chambers. However, to enter the land, the enticing and deceiving part, and the deadly part, they have several openings, all to the north. Among those who are expelled outside, such as the nations whose souls depart to the outside, and do not ascend through the skies but immediately near the land, they have an opening. Similarly, all the prayers that Israel prays in the Diaspora, and all the pure souls that die in the Diaspora, float in the impure air, as will be explained elsewhere with the help of God. There, a complete angel of the Diaspora stands ready to receive and roll them until they reach this lower air, which is the air between the earth and the lower firmament. There, too, there is a northern opening to admit and expel—to admit the wicked and the smoke of the battle array and to expel the righteous and the prayers of Israel who pray in the Diaspora. This is exactly like the form we have explained. It also has an entrance for ascent and for tempting the people of the land with the evil inclination. However, it is not similar to the strength of the evil inclination and the klipah there outside, like its control in the land. It has no natural entrance, only through the opening and the Nukva. There, all the essence dwells, and it is firmly established. And so it is.

Nahar 6

River 6 -  To explain that receiving His divinity requires two conditions: 1) The Land, 2) The Word:
This is because the inspiration of His blessed divinity upon us comes through two things: Firstly, through the embodiment of this measure, which is the Divine Presence dwelling upon us in a foreign guise—that is, the external ministers through its spread in various ways. Therefore, one standing abroad accepts His divinity in this manner. However, this path will be called the worship of other gods because one receives influence from beneath the hand of the ministers. Regarding this, it is said, "They have provoked Me to jealousy with a no-god; they have angered Me with their vanities" (Deuteronomy 32:21). This refers to Israel standing in the Diaspora who worship idols in purity. These individuals do not truly accept His divinity since they are considered somewhat idol worshippers because they influence externally.
The second path is through the shedding of a foreign garment. Meaning, there should be no separation between him and the divinity except the Shekhinah dwelling through the holy levels upon Israel. This is referring to one residing in the Land of Israel, which is not clothed in physical matter but directly, through the entrance of the Temple, the emanation from the sphere of Sefirah spreads and mingles. The Shekhinah resides in the air of the Land of Israel, eagerly awaited by the Wisdom, which is the wisdom of Solomon. Therefore, the Land of Israel is the Kingdom because its atmosphere is a dwelling place for the Shekhinah. The Shekhinah does not reside among the uncircumcised because it does not connect with the external uncircumcised. Hence, the dweller in the Land of Israel must circumcise his flesh; otherwise, he defiles the land. It is learned that the acceptance of divinity depends on dwelling in the land, and dwelling in the land depends on circumcision, and this requires completeness. Also, the acceptance of divinity depends on circumcision, but if they do not merit the land, it is not complete because it is through embodiment, as we explained. This is revealed to Babylon, the Shekhinah among them was exiled upwards, and to Edom, the Shekhinah among them, through the merit of circumcision, as it says, "And I will be to you for a God," etc.


Nahar 7

To explain the rectification of holiness and all its levels in the dwelling of Israel in the Land:
Know that every portion of the land is assigned to a nation that corresponds to that portion. This is as it says, "For I have given the city to the descendants of Lot as an inheritance," referring to the descendants of Lot, which is the city. Similarly, for Esau, the Mount Seir, and our Sages have interpreted that it is Edom and its land is red, indicating a direct correlation between the land and the nation residing in it. The reason is that the ruler who governs the nation also has a relationship to influence that particular portion of the land. Likewise, those impure souls are part of the klipah (husk) corresponding to the impure earth, and this involves three relationships: the relationship of the nation, the relationship of the land, and the relationship of the ruler in terms of souls and providence. This concept applies literally to Israel in the Land of Israel, their souls, their Torah, and their divinity. For the Land of Israel is holy soil, and the people dwelling in it are a holy nation. Their souls are sacred, their Torah is sacred, and their divinity is sacred, as it governs Israel.
Not only that, but just as the Torah has no comparison in the majority of its commandments with other lands, so too, it has no comparison to the Land of Israel with the other laws and statutes of the nations, which are wicked. Therefore, it says, "You shall not do any of these abominations, for all these abominations, and the land will become impure." The Holy Torah and the Land of Israel share a joint connection. Similarly, Israel has a connection with the holy land undoubtedly due to the relationship with their souls. The proof is in Ezekiel, where each tribe's portion in the Land of Israel is correlated with their borders. According to the tribe's connection, its dwelling is against the border that corresponds to its nobility, so that there will be an abundance upon it. The commandments performed in the land adorn and uplift every border in the secret of the soul of each tribe. This involves the completeness of the souls in their portion in the land, and the land's dominion in the portion of souls that comes to it, resisting its essence. The concept is that, just as the point of Zion is a point from which the world was created, as is known, and it relates to the Shekhinah, so too, the other parts of the land are portions related to the Shekhinah in the secret of the twelve borders that spread from the central point. This is the secret of the measure of the land mentioned in the verse in Ezekiel, "And there was a sanctuary within it, under the wings, full of breadth of the land."
As the Shekhinah is not complete while the place of the Temple is not complete and not properly established, so too the Shekhinah is not complete when the Land of Israel is not complete, with its borders extending from the River of Egypt to the great Euphrates River. Each Israelite dwells in his designated portion as determined by his true opposing fate. Therefore, Israel is not praised for its perfection, and the Shekhinah is not praised for its perfection, except at this time, with the help of God. At this time, all Israel will enter it, and all of them will fill it entirely. This is the true perfection, and then the Shekhinah, which is standing above it, and the living beings, which are below it, with twelve faces corresponding to the twelve cattle mentioned, will be rectified. The honored throne will also be rectified, which is not complete in its perfection. Since the Shekhinah, which is above it, and the living beings, which are below it, do not rectify themselves automatically, it implies that it itself is not in its completeness. Thus, the Land of Israel itself will be rectified, and the rectification of the Land of Israel is through the Shekhinah dwelling in it and through the laws. After the Shekhinah did not serve in it properly, even during the days of Joshua when only two and a half tribes were outside the Land of Israel, the Land of Israel is not rectified in its completeness. Israel themselves will also be rectified, being all together in the Land of Israel. Then, the perfection of the tribes will be great because they will all be included, each of the twelve tribes, in the spirituality of their souls. They will all be included in the secret of unification, as explained elsewhere, and there is no need to elaborate. And the Holy One, blessed be He, knows.

Nahar 8

To explain that the supreme unity is achieved specifically through the prayers of Israel in the Land of Israel and not through the prayers of Israel abroad:
The idea is that man, through his prayer, carves out fiery sparks. This reality is the secret of the rectification that is formed and fixed in the atmosphere of the world. It does not depart from the illuminated world until the end of the prayer, until after "Alenu L'Shabbe'ach," and this rectification adorns the air in an orderly and embellished manner. Afterwards, when it is entirely painted and arranged together, it rises in the air of the world from one firmament to another until the entrance of the hall of the sapphire. As mentioned in the Zohar, Pekudei, where the hall, standing there in the first firmament, is mentioned until the end of all the congregations of Israel and all their prayers. Then, in that firmament, all the prayers of Israel will gather together, connect, and ascend there, as mentioned in the Zohar.
Certainly, one should be meticulous about this delay that they should wait until all the prayers of Israel are gathered, especially when Israel is on their own land. In the Land of Israel, one does not anticipate sunrise in one city before another by less than half an hour, as the Land of Israel is somewhat like a cow's hide. Therefore, it is possible to wait. However, now that Israel is scattered in the four corners of the world, if we say that they should wait, many prayers will be delayed during the early hours of the eastern dawn over the western, and it amounts to about twelve hours. This results in a mixing of prayers because during the western dawn, it is sunset in the east, and then they have the evening prayer. If so, how will this matter be resolved? If we say that they should not wait for each other, then the supreme unity will occur several times because one community will unite now, and another an hour later, and another after that, and so on, continuously uniting and moving. In this way, it becomes difficult because the supreme watches are fixed for evening and morning. So, how will it be when, sometimes, some have night, and others have dawn? In this way, it becomes difficult for the rest on the Sabbath, with some observing it and others working. How will this matter be resolved? In Sefer Yesod Olam (by יצחק בן יוסף הישראלי), in the second article of the sixteenth essay, this matter was addressed, and it was explained by prominent rabbis, as mentioned [elsewhere].
 Indeed, Rabbi Moshe Cordovero (of blessed memory) wrote, and I say regarding this matter, that all this falls under what our sages of blessed memory explained: that the Israelites standing in the diaspora worship idols in purity. They intended by this that the divine governance is not conducted based on the sunrise in the east or the west, not the north or the south, but rather on specific points in the Land of Israel, chosen for settlement, with the opening of the Hall of the Sapphire facing them. The sunrise in the Land of Israel signifies the morning for the morning watch, and the evening in the Land of Israel signifies the night for the rule of the night. In this way, the watches will be governed. The number of days will not be lessened or increased compared to what the physical sun and moon constitute in the Land of Israel. We should not be concerned about the appearance of the moon in the diaspora, or if it does not appear because the main focus is on the Land of Israel. There, the court establishes and sanctifies new months, holidays, and times, and the Holy One, blessed be He, agrees with them and sanctifies. In the diaspora, they do not establish, and if they establish, they do not sanctify because they lack substance. The Sabbath day in the Land of Israel is the essence of everything since the rest of the Sabbath depends on the spread of the sanctity of the Sabbath through the entrance of this hall downward, which is in the Land of Israel, as mentioned above. The Holy One, blessed be He, skillfully arranged the movements of the celestial sphere with His wisdom, chose the designated place facing the celestial sphere, and it lacks nothing and has no excess. This designated place is the Land of Israel. The prayers are not delayed for each other except in the Land of Israel specifically, and not in any other place. This is because the Land of Israel is crucial for the matter of uniqueness, and uniqueness occurs not frequently, but only at one specific time, which is the hour of unity when being with the Lord in the Land of Israel. This is the time when they complete and rectify their prayers, as it is the time of uniqueness.
indeed, the light of uniqueness emanates from this central point to all the ministerial levels where the Israelites are found, as sparks of the Divine Presence spread upon them in the secret of the exile of the Divine Presence. The diffusion of this uniqueness is brought about by the prayers of the Israelites residing there. They do not unify the times of uniqueness but the appointed time within the jurisdiction of the minister under whose authority they are subjugated. These are the worshipers of idols in purity, who do not unite in the uniqueness of the higher time but in the uniqueness of the time of the external ministers. However, in the sanctity of the Divine Presence that clothes itself in that minister's domain.
And in this manner, the sanctity of the Sabbath precedes or delays for them based on the emanation of the Divine Presence that clothes itself there, even though this Sabbath is not real but a central point where the true cessation occurs. Despite all this, rest is attributed to the side of the emanation that spreads or delays their rest. In this way, festivals may be delayed or advanced based on the sunrise or sunset of the flesh. However, the Sages established two festivals, and the second day is called the second festival of the diaspora, certainly in the secret of the diaspora, and the emanation of the Divine Presence that spreads in it caused the second day. Yet, they did not do so for the Sabbath because the cessation of the Sabbath is agreed upon by the external forces, and they are not satisfied with it because even Gehenna rests, and the ministers rest with a delay or advancement based on the sunrise of the sun, whether they are near or far. However, they do not acknowledge the festival days, and they are satisfied with their sanctity. Therefore, one must distinguish between day and day, and they are two festival days. The first one is from the Torah, clothed in the rabbinic day, as holy light clothes itself in the light of exile.

Nahar 9

River 9 - To explain the difference between the Divine providence over the people of Israel when they are in the land of Israel or when they are abroad:
The matter is that when Israel is on their own land, it is their protection, even for each individual detail. This is when the Divine presence is clothed in the levels of its own holiness down below with Israel, as it says, "For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp" (Deuteronomy 23:15). The reason for this is because the air of the land of Israel is holy, fitting for the Divine presence. And on the border surrounding the land of Israel, there is a surrounding shell to guard that no authority from outside will enter, like a tent stretched over it so that no foreign border will pass it. This tent, its ropes and borders extend to encompass all the air of the land of Israel until opposite the entrance of the open sapphire hall, which is always open. Thus, the land of Israel is found to be the gate of heaven, and angels ascend and descend from it, from the land of Israel to the halls and from the halls to the land of Israel. The Divine presence extends from above to below upon its children, ascending and descending upon them all day, through the separating screen mentioned. And this screen is the secret of a stormy wind, a large cloud, and a consuming fire, which are the secrets of foreign air. Similarly, it is the desert, the fiery serpent, the scorpion, and the thirst. However, one pure shell guards over everything, so that the impure do not enjoy the radiance of holiness, and this is pleasant to it all around. And everything beyond the land, a stormy wind, a large cloud, and a consuming fire, meaning the external impure air of the lands of the nations, and this is the secret of the Divine presence guarding over Israel in the land of Israel itself.
However, abroad it is not so, may it never happen. Rather, by the will of the shells to rule over the land of Israel to destroy it, the Divine presence departs from the land of Israel and ascends to the heavens, and after the gate of the Temple closes, permission is granted to the shell to breach the walls of Jerusalem, that is, the separating screen that is luminous. They entered and corrupted, laid their hands on the people of Israel, destroyed all physical chariots, and exiled what they could. The Divine presence pursued its children, but how can it descend into the impure air of the diaspora, and with its children abandoned there, it cannot, as explained earlier. Therefore, it is in the celestial palaces, with its chariots in a state of degradation, like they said, "I will reduce the wings of the cherubs," and similar to the story of the king's son, as stated in the Zohar. That which was not done until now, that is, the Divine presence, which is a spark, and its providence, is clothed in that flesh under whose hand Israel is, in a mystical and kingly manner in all its dominion. That is, ten letters clothe in ten shells to subdue them, so that they cannot harm Israel and so that the children of Israel cannot be assimilated among them, as explained earlier. This is similar to the sun, which is in the heavens, and its light shines below on the earth, and similarly, the Divine presence is primarily in the heavens, and its spark descends below in the diaspora with Israel to watch over them, as Ezekiel said, "I am among the exiles," not its bones themselves, but a spark of its light. Therefore, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God, implying that it is above in the heavens, as explained, and its spark clothes in flesh, as I explained. This is similar to "They kept watch over the vineyards during the time of exile," And this is the Jews in the diaspora, who worship idols in purity, as it is written, "For they have driven me out today from being attached to the inheritance of the Lord," and the verse concludes.

Nahar 10



And behold, those who are not in the land of Israel, our sages of blessed memory explained that it is similar to someone who has no God, meaning that his soul is distant from the holy place. In truth, the power of the kelipah (impure spiritual shell) does not truly rule over him, because the portion of the Lord is with him, and he is not a portion of the ministers. Thus, it is found that the minister does not rule over him fundamentally, and even the Shekhinah (Divine presence) does not rest upon him, because he is within the depths of the impure nations' atmosphere, which is enveloped by the impure spiritual shell, and from their side, he is impure and causes impurity. Therefore, according to this, he has no God, and there is no doubt that his soul, spirit, psyche, and body are clothed within the shells and impurity, except that his actions and Torah are not pure because they are clothed in the atmosphere of the impure nations. However, at the time of death, the soul does not ascend in purity because it is clothed in that kelipah unless it needs to wander from place to place until it comes to the land of Israel, where the gateway to heaven is for the entry of the soul into the Garden of Eden, as explained by our sages of blessed memory, for the way of the Cave of Machpelah is the entrance of the soul into the Garden of Eden below and from there to the Garden of Eden above.
And when we discern the virtue of the land of Israel compared to outside of it, we find it in three aspects, except that under each aspect there are several sub-aspects: 1. The first aspect pertains to the observance of the commandments with purity and cleanliness throughout one's life in the world. 2. The second aspect pertains to the departure of the soul from the body.3. The third aspect pertains to the resurrection thereafter. 
Now, these three divisions will not be equal, for someone whose entire life was in the land of Israel finds his soul, even when entering the body, in a state of purity and cleanliness, untainted by the atmosphere of the impure nations. This is of great elevation and assistance to his spiritual work. Even if a person enters the land of Israel in his youth, before the age of thirteen, he will merit some aspect of this, for the good inclination and soul are not present in a person until the age of thirteen, as our sages of blessed memory have said. Sometimes the spirit and sometimes the soul, as mentioned in the Zohar, and likewise all his commandments that he performs with purity and cleanliness until his departure from this world. Thus, he grows in good name and departs in good name. Now, ascending to the land of Israel in one's old age does not encompass this aspect, and one only merits it concerning the years related to departure and also resurrection, as will be clarified. Ascending after death in one's bones, this certainly does not merit this aspect but only resurrection alone. Also, concerning the elevation of the soul to the bones, "And your bones will be quickened" refers to being in purity in the land of Israel.
And now, when we come to enumerate the greatness of the first division, they are numerous: The soul has never been defiled, nor has it ever been clothed in the atmosphere of the impure nations. His commandments, all of which he performed with utmost purity, and that spirituality derived from the commandments and Torah were not clothed in that shell and impurity. The influence emanating from Torah and commandments did not reach the rulers because the Israelite standing in the diaspora and observing the commandments and purity would certainly be influenced by those commandments, and that influence cannot reach him if not through that ruler who is present in his portion of land, and this is straightforward. This was specifically during the time when the Shekhinah was primarily in the land of Israel, for then it certainly would be accepted through the ruler. This is what King David, peace be upon him, meant when he said, "For they have driven me out today from being joined to the inheritance of the Lord, saying: 'Go, serve other gods.'" Literally, it means he served and influenced other gods, which are the rulers, as we have explained. Additionally, there are several mitzvot that are permitted only in the land, and there is no doubt that due to the great stature of these commandments, it is not appropriate to fulfill them in the diaspora, for such a holy power is not suitable to be derived in the diaspora. This is why our sages of blessed memory said, "One does not bring challah from the diaspora to the land of Israel, and if one does, it shall be burned like leaven on the eve of Passover." Similarly, with regard to tithes, offerings, and many other such mitzvot. This is certainly because of the greatness of these commandments as mentioned.The prayer of the land of Israel is more proper, desirable, and accepted, for there are not so many detractors, because those letters formed by the mouth are not clothed in impure air. Therefore, they are desirable and immediately become a crown and a diadem to the head of the King of the world, unlike in the diaspora, where they need to be clothed in impure air, and there are several external factors that detract from them until they are brought into the land of Israel. Afterward, purity and cleanliness are required to ascend to a higher place.
When we come to recount the greatness of the second division, we find many aspects: 1. That the one who dies in the land of Israel does not die by the hand of the Angel of Death, but rather by a holy angel who clothes himself in strength to perform that action. It is like an animal slaughtered with a fine knife, and it is pure. However, the one who dies in the diaspora, it is by Samael with a flawed knife, and he becomes a carcass. 2. That the one who passes away in the diaspora, their soul upon leaving their body becomes clothed in the powers of the atmosphere of the impure nations, and thus becomes defiled. Certainly, it requires considerable effort until it reaches the gates of heaven, where it purifies itself from its impurity in order to ascend to its resting place afterward. 3. The toil of its transmigration until it comes from its place of residence in the diaspora to arrive in the land of Israel, and even if it needs to pass through the borders of many rulers until it reaches the land of Israel, for certainly, they will seize it with ropes and chains. Concerning this and similar cases, our sages of blessed memory said, "It is not like grasping the living."
When we come to recount the greatness of the third division, we find many more aspects: 1. The toil of transmigration from chamber to chamber according to its essence and deeds. 2. That the resurrection of the dead precedes in the land of Israel over the diaspora, as our sages of blessed memory explained. 3. That at the beginning of every lunar month and Sabbath, the souls visit the body, as mentioned in the Zohar. And when buried in the diaspora, the soul will inevitably become defiled by the atmosphere of the impure nations when it comes to visit the body. There will not be for them together a pleasant experience.
And now, regarding what is written about the virtue of the Land, it is explained that the virtue of one who dwells in it is eternal, from the day of his birth until after his death, for he has merited all the virtues completely. And one who enters it in his youth will merit them, but not to the same degree, for he was already born in the air of the lands of the nations. However, one who stands and grows up, and then later comes, even if he merited to engage in some mitzvot in the Land of Israel, he will not attain that great virtue, but he will attain some of it. But one who enters it and dies in it, he will attain two aspects alone, for the first one has already been lost to him. And one who ascends in his bones alone, he will only merit the third aspect, which is the revival and appointment of the soul alone. And one who ascends in his flesh after his death, he will merit further, for the dust which is the dust of the altar, since the person was created from the place of his atonement, and behold, we the created beings are certainly obligated to bring it back to the place it was quarried, which is holy. And it is known that the law is that the dust of the Land of Israel that went out to the Diaspora, its law is like the dust of the Diaspora, and the dust of the Diaspora that entered the Land of Israel, its law is like the dust of the Land. And this is the secret of the converts. Therefore, one whose flesh decays in the dust of the Land, his virtue is great, and if the opposite, then the opposite. And this is the reason for our father Jacob's command that he be brought up immediately after his death.
However, it remains for us to know what is the virtue of one who sees it from afar if he does not enter it, for the Scripture says "if a man sees these people" etc., for it seems that the seeing itself is a virtue. Moreover, our teacher Moses was granted a great elevation near his death, as it is written "Ascend this mountain of the Abarim" and it is written "And Moses ascended" and "And the Lord showed him the entire land" - all this indicates that there is some virtue for one who sees it, even if he does not enter it. And this matter we have already written about in the eye of the reader in River 33, see there, and this is what he said:

Nahar 11

River 11 - To Explain the Secret of the Difference Between the Land of Israel and the Diaspora and Their Inhabitants, the Difference in the Conduct of Israel and the Nations of the World, the Difference Between Prophecy and Sorcery, and the Ba'al Teshuva and the Convert:
The matter is that the dwelling place of the external forces is above the heavens, and this chaotic conduct is at times under a higher dominion. So too is the conduct of the body - this aforementioned conduct is found in all living beings, both of the nations and of Israel, for they are foundational elements established since the creation of man, without additions or subtractions for any person. Only that Israel will imbue them with a higher sanctity and sanctify them, especially due to the preparation of his father and mother at the time of his birth. Therefore, he will clothe these lives with sanctity, while the gentile will clothe them with impurity. However, in terms of these lives, all human beings are equal.
Indeed, there will be a change in the secret of the two mentioned governance aspects, for the nations are under the control of the external ministers and the life force mentioned when impurity spreads, and Israel draws upon the sanctity of humanity in the mentioned lives, as if the supreme holiness governs the heavens and the externals yield. And as the secret of this governance depends on human action, if their deeds are righteous, the shells and externals will yield, and this governance will be entrusted to the holy ones. If, God forbid, they behave corruptly, it will be entrusted to the externals. So it is with a person, when he increases the holiness within him, which is the holy soul and other details explained, this entire governance will be directed towards holiness and will become sanctified. And when he strengthens the aspect of impurity, the entire governance will be given to the external forces.
Now, with this, you can imagine in your mind the two matters previously discussed. The first is the governance of the Land of Israel, which is the governance of the holy ones and the prophets who purified their physical bodies and rectified themselves in all their senses and intellects to sanctify themselves. They controlled the emotional traits and subjected them to holiness, having no materialistic emotional traits at all, similar to how they controlled the celestial bodies and subdued them to their will. The second is the governance of the outside world, where everything is drawn towards the ministers. This is the wisdom of sorcerers, magicians, and other external wisdom, which subjected their emotional traits to the needs of those wisdoms. They were akin to Balaam and his disciples.
And it is known that there are now two types of behaviors under these, which are similar to these. The first, one who resides in the land and goes out to the diaspora, meaning that he goes out from the holy conduct to the conduct of the rulers. Just like Israel, who subjected himself to negative traits and allowed his spiritual powers to be subservient to the will of his evil inclination, this is akin to one who externally controls himself and subjects his spheres under the control of the aforementioned rulers, namely, one who was in the land and goes out beyond. The second, in reverse, that is the convert who converts and the wicked person who repents, and the like, meaning that he was outside and the evil inclination ruled over his spiritual levels. And now the evil inclination has been subdued, and he enters into holiness, and he controls himself with superior holiness and subjects his powers to the holy ones. This is the interpretation of this matter.

Nahar 12

River 12 - To explain the distinction between the souls of Israel dwelling in the land of Israel and the souls of Israel dwelling outside the land:
Know that the souls of Israel residing in the diaspora have always been from the realm of Sandalphon, which is the world of cycles, and they are called the House of Jacob, and they are called slaves, and one is called a Hebrew slave, for their calculation is based on the letters of "nachash" (snake). And the Israelites dwelling in the land are from the realm of the ten spheres of creation, and they are called the Children of Israel, and they are called sons, and are called the sons of the Living God. And behold, when a person is in the diaspora, he has a soul from the world of cycles, and when he merits and enters the land, a new soul from the world of creation comes to him and clothes itself within the old soul that he had. And on the first night he sleeps in the land, two souls depart and ascend upward, and upon their return, only the new one returns, and for this reason, it is not deserving of punishment because it has not sinned, and for this reason, our sages said that we forgive him for all his sins.
Know that anyone who resides in the land of Israel is called righteous, even if they are not righteous as they appear, for if they were not righteous, the land would vomit them out, as it is written, "and the land will vomit out its inhabitants." And since the land does not vomit them out, they are certainly called righteous even though they may seem to be wicked. And know that residing in the land of Israel and leaving to dwell in Egypt is the same transgression that causes a ruler from the evil inclination to rule over him. And anyone who commits himself to dwell in the land of Israel all his days and not to descend to dwell in Egypt is considered as if he has been careful all his days under the reign of the Divine Presence. And know that the land of Israel does not atone for deliberate sins committed therein, only for unintentional transgressions. But deliberate sins committed in it are only forgiven through suffering or by one who repents of his transgression and studies Torah.

Nahar 13

River 13 - To explain the secret of Jerusalem and other places in the land of Israel:
Know that Jerusalem in small gematria is 19, and kingdom in small gematria is also 19.
And Shechem is the secret of the foundation because Shechem hints to Joseph, and therefore Shechem was given to Joseph since his attribute is foundation.
And Tiberias in big gematria is 19, and Hod rises to 19 with three letters and the word. And the meaning of Tiberias is derived from the word "tavor" (burial), the land's navel, and "aretz" (land) hints to kingdom, and the essence of Tiberias hints to Hod. Also, Tav-Beit-Reish rises in the Holy Temple to 13, receiving power from the 13 attributes....
zfat hints to Netzach (victory), Netzach in the Holy Temple rises to 22, like Tzfat with the inclusive, and Tzfat in the Holy Temple rises to 21, like the calculation of the name Eh-yeh (the Four-Letter Name of God), to hint that they behave with it using the thirteen attributes of complete mercy from the crown, and therefore it is one of the cities of refuge that save souls. Also, Tzfat in the Holy Temple is 21, and with the word, it's 22, like the calculation of the 22 letters of the Torah, to hint that Tzfat is ready and prepared to attain the deep secret of Torah within it, and there is no air as pure in all the land of Israel as the air of Tzfat. Additionally, Netzach in gematria 58 hints to the secret "if there is no flour, there is no Torah."
Maran hints to Torah, as the translation of "tzon meranah" (flock of sheep), and "tzon" hints to Torah, from the language of "maran debeshemya" (our Master in Heaven) hinting to Torah. Also, "tzon" in the Holy Temple rises to 12, and with the word, it's 13, and the attribute of Torah is called "Emet" (truth) in the Holy Temple, which is 9, and with three letters and the word, it rises to 13, to hint to the thirteen attributes of mercy mentioned.
The Cave of the Patriarchs, located in Hebron, is known to be beyond the lower Garden of Eden. This is because it is related to the gematria of "Sohar" (merchandise) in the acronym of "Orach" (merchant) to "Gan" (garden). Also, related to the gematria of "Chatzer" (courtyard) in the acronym of "Gan" (garden) to hint that the cave is like a courtyard to the Garden of Eden, as will be explained in its place with divine secret. Similarly, it relates to the gematria of "Tekoa" (assurance) to hint that all who reside in Hebron are assured. Likewise, the deceased buried there merit the ascension of their souls, for it is like a firm peg to pass to the lower Garden of Eden without delay, not like those who delight themselves with their own hands to go to the Garden of Eden without sorrow.
The word "Tekoa" is hinted at three times in the Torah in three places: firstly, in the verse "And Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain," secondly, "And Laban pitched his brethren in the mount Gilead," where Jacob pitching implies his intention to pitch his tent, meaning his wife, and the word "et" includes himself, "in the mount" referring to the Cave of the Patriarchs, which are two mountains, one above the other, with two caves in the lower mountain and two caves in the upper mountain. The word "Tekoa" in the gematria refers to passing to the merchant, meaning that the Cave of the Patriarchs is a passage to the Garden of Eden, as mentioned. Therefore, one who prays to the Lord with the intention in his heart to merit burial in the Cave of the Patriarchs, he and his wife, as decreed from the six days of creation.
And Laban pitched his brethren - meaning, since in his cunningness, like his lips, he intended to copy Jacob, that Jacob would not merit burial in the Cave of the Patriarchs, but rather he intended to kill him, and to pitch his brethren means Esau and Ishmael, that they would merit passing through the Cave of the Patriarchs to the Garden of Eden. It is already known that Ishmael and the sons of Keturah are attached to our forefather Abraham, and Esau and his descendants are attached to our forefather Isaac. For if, God forbid, Jacob were not buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs, none of the Israelites would pass through there, and all the nations affiliated with Esau and Ishmael would enter through there by the hands of Esau and Ishmael, who have a hold on Abraham and Isaac buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs. This is what our sages meant when they said, "And Laban sought to uproot everything," as it says, "An Aramean sought to destroy my father."
Similarly, Samael with Jacob, as it is written, "And he touched the hollow of his thigh," and know that his intention was to make Jacob blemished so that he would not be buried in the cave, and so that Esau and his wife would be buried there, but it did not come to fruition, for immediately the Almighty healed him, as it says, "And Jacob came whole." Our sages said that he came whole in his body, for the Almighty, in His abundant kindness, turned Samael's intention, and he fixed Jacob with a peg fixed in a faithful place to be buried in the mentioned cave in order for his descendants to pass through there to the Garden of Eden.
Likewise, "Tzfat" in the gematria of "Tekoa," to hint that everyone who resides in the city of Tzfat has an advantage over all other cities in the Land of Israel, for one who passes away there, because it is a high place and its air is purer than all other cities in the Land of Israel, his soul swiftly floats in the Cave of the Patriarchs to pass to the lower Garden of Eden.

Nahar 14

River 14 - To explain the defects that emerge from the Land of Israel to abroad:
The matter is that regarding the shells, there are five changes, and likewise, the changes of the shells that attach to generations abroad are divided into five levels, and one who merits to reside in the Land of Israel is exempt, clean, and free from all of them. The first level is dwelling in Syria, outside of Damascus and beyond, where there is Beit Rimon, which is one of the four kingdoms of Samuel, as will be explained in Ein Ganim River 12 with God's help. However, in all other towns of Syria, wherever they may be, his soul will be from the kingdoms of Sandalphon, and upon it will be clothed the first shell from the kingdoms of the world of transformations, and on that shell will be clothed the second shell from the kingdoms of Samuel, and upon it will be clothed yet another third shell from the kingdoms of the world of RHB, no more. The second level is dwelling abroad, far from Syria but not beyond the sea, his soul is from the kingdoms of Sandalphon, and upon it is clothed the first shell from the kingdoms of transformations, and two shells from the world of Samuel, and the first shell from the world of RHB. The third level is dwelling abroad beyond the sea and beyond, his soul is from the kingdoms of Sandalphon, and upon it is clothed the first shell from the world of transformations, and upon it is clothed another three shells from the world of Samuel, and upon it is clothed the first shell from the world of RHB. The fourth level is dwelling abroad in one of the four kingdoms of Samuel, his soul is from the kingdoms of Sandalphon, and upon it is clothed the first shell from the world of transformations, and upon it are clothed four shells from the world of Samuel, hinted in the four winds, which are opposite to the four legs of the chariot, and upon it is the first shell of RHB. The fifth level is dwelling in Egypt, his soul is from the world of Sandalphon, and upon it is clothed the first shell from the world of transformations, and upon it are clothed four shells of Samuel mentioned, and upon them are clothed four shells of the world of RHB.
The matter is that the impure worlds are three, and they are transformations: Samael, RHB, and the shells of transformations are called "excrement," and the shells of Samael are called "filth," as it says, "So you shall say to him, 'Thus said the Lord: Behold, so are called excrement and filth without a place.'" And the shells of the world of RHB are called "venereal discharge," from the language of menstruation blood.
And know that when one leaves the Land of Israel to permanently reside in Syria, once he goes beyond the boundaries of the Holy Land into the diaspora, his soul, which originates from the World of Formation, departs from him, and a soul from the world of Sandalphon enters into him. Upon it, the first shell from the world of transformations is attached, followed by a shell from the world of Samuel, and upon it, a shell from the world of RHB. The principal is Samuel, who governs over all the diaspora. When one leaves the Land of Israel to reside permanently in the diaspora but not beyond the sea, such a person, when leaving the Land of Israel with no intention to return, will have his intellectual soul, which is from the World of Formation, replaced with a soul from the World of Action. This is because the animalistic soul does not change through all the transformations. Upon it, a shell from the world of transformations is attached, followed by two shells from the world of Samuel and one from the world of RHB. When one leaves the Land of Israel to reside permanently in the diaspora beyond the sea, which is on the left side of the world, he will then be enveloped by a soul from the World of Action. Upon it, a shell from the world of transformations is attached, followed by three shells from the world of Samuel and one from the world of RHB. The principal among them are the three shells of Samuel. When one leaves the Land of Israel to reside permanently in Egypt, his soul of action, as mentioned, is enveloped by a shell from the world of transformations, four shells from the world of RHB, and four shells of Samuel. When one goes to reside permanently in one of the four kingdoms of Samuel, as will be explained in secret, a shell from the world of transformations is attached to his soul of action, followed by four shells from the world of Samuel and one from the world of RHB.
And know that one who leaves the Land of Israel for abroad with the intention to return quickly, leaving his wife and children in the Land of Israel, his soul from the World of Formation does not depart from him. Instead, another soul from the World of Action clothes upon him. Therefore, he must observe the festivals and pilgrimage festivals abroad as he did when he was in the Land of Israel, since his intention is to return. All of this is for his benefit because if a soul from the World of Action did not clothe upon him, when the shells would clothe upon the soul of Formation, immediately the soul of Formation would become contaminated from external impurity. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, in His mercy and goodness, clothes the soul of Action upon the soul of Formation before the shells clothe upon him, so as not to contaminate him. The shells will then clothe according to the place, as mentioned above. All of this applies to someone born in the Land. <br>However, someone born abroad who comes to reside permanently in the Land, upon nearing the ladder, all the shells depart from him, and only his soul, which was always of Formation, enters the Land. That soul of Formation enters into the soul of Action, which was his, like a knife in a sheath. If afterwards he leaves for permanent residence, the new soul of Formation remains in the Land and does not leave with him, but rather his old soul of Action clothes upon him, clothed in shells according to what we mentioned about the four transformations of places. <br>And know that one who ascends from abroad to the Land of Israel for temporary residence, when he arrives in the Land and reaches the ladder from the outside, all the shells depart from him, and only his soul from the World of Action enters the Land. However, a soul from the World of Formation is not given to him because his intention is not to reside in the Land. Therefore, he must observe festivals and pilgrimage festivals as he did abroad.

River 15: On the Superiority of the Death of Those in the Land of Israel vs. Outside of It:
It is said that there are generally four levels:                                                                 1. The most praiseworthy of those in the Land of Israel.                                              2. The rest of the inhabitants of the Land of Israel.                                                      3. The most praiseworthy of those outside the Land of Israel.                                    4. The rest of the inhabitants outside the Land of Israel.                                               And this applies to the holy people of the Lord. The first level, the most praiseworthy of those in the Land of Israel, is not appropriately described by the term "death" at all, except metaphorically. For them, the term "passing away" is used. They are likened to a person lying on their bed, confined to their house, neither going out nor coming in. So is the praiseworthy person, whose flesh rests securely, as in the case of Rabbi Eliezer, who remained a year without burial as mentioned in the Talmud, Tractate Bava Metzia, and similarly, Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya, and other such individuals throughout generations. Among them, with additional virtue, are the patriarchs. This is because they sanctified themselves even in what was permissible to them, even in thought, and they are as if they do not die at all.
And close to this level is the status of the holy ones who die outside of the Land of Israel, like Jacob. Therefore, his body's ascent to the Land of Israel was not hindered, as it was known that there was no claim against him by external forces since he did not benefit from it. Such was the sanctity of Rabbi at the time of his death when he raised his ten fingers and declared that he did not derive benefit, as our sages of blessed memory stated. Similarly, the status of Moses our teacher, peace be upon him, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, personally attended to at his burial, and the status of the deaths of Aaron and Miriam — all share the same level due to their sanctity. These individuals are not required to undergo bodily decay in the earth because they distanced themselves from the sin of Adam and purified themselves from it as much as possible. They became a divine chariot, and their bodies remain intact. They did not die but rather passed away gently, and they are the sleepers in the dust.
.The third level is the status of the deceased among the rest of the people in the Land of Israel. They are not obligated to the klipah (impurity) because they were nourished by the delights of the world without having consumed from it, as the sustenance and provisions of the Land of Israel are under the hand and authority of the Creator. Therefore, when questioned about what they ate, it will be said, "Did I eat and drink of yours? I ate and drank of Mine." However, they are obligated to bodily decay due to the sin of Adam, from which they did not distance themselves and thus came under the punishment "for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." As a result, the body perishes, and the soul becomes sanctified. For this reason, they become impure through contact and carrying, because of the initial klipah (impurity) that Adam introduced and that adhered to them, resulting in death.

The Virtue of Sleep in the Land of Israel and Abroad:
Sleep is a fraction of death. Just as death outside the Land of Israel occurs through the Angel of Death, while in the Land of Israel for Israelites it occurs through a holy angel, so too sleep outside the Land is induced by the external shell, while in the Land of Israel it is through holy beings, without any external shells entering, as mentioned in the Zohar, Parashat Terumah. Just as death provides rest for the soul to ascend to the Garden of Eden, sleep provides rest for the soul to ascend and attach itself to holiness, enjoying a sweet, superior light. In contrast, due to their sins, the souls of the wicked are cast away and cut off from holiness at death, mirroring their experience in life. Therefore, the wicked are referred to as "dead" even while alive. However, there is a significant difference between death and sleep: in actual death, external forces dominate the soul to punish it according to its wickedness, while in life, the body provides some protection, preventing these forces from fully dominating, only mocking them. This is the rationale for reciting the Shema before bed, to ward off any other force during the soul’s ascent, as previously explained.

Nahar 17

Different Types of Death in the Diaspora and the Land of Israel:
There are three types of death according to the secret of death. The first type is slaughter with a defective knife, which is considered "neveilah" (carrion). This refers to those who die at the hands of Samael, whose knife is defective due to the defects of cruelty and chaos. However, those who die in the Land of Israel do not die by a knife with any of these defects, but rather by the sword of the Holy One, blessed be He. The common people, who are like animals, die through a knife and slaughter, meaning that the suffering of death atones for them and purifies them, in the sense of "And His land will atone for His people." They die through a kosher angel who ascends, takes permission, and then takes the soul like a snake, but not an actual snake, unlike in the Diaspora where it is an actual snake. <br>However, Torah scholars who engage in the Torah of the Lord, which is the Tree of Life, do not require slaughter by any of the three types of knives mentioned (two defective and one kosher). Instead, they are gathered like the fish of the sea. The Shechinah (Divine Presence) reveals itself to them with the help of all the righteous in the Garden of Eden, and they separate themselves from physicality and materialism, joining their people with the Shechinah. Their gathering to the glory of the Lord purifies them. The concept of being gathered like the fish of the sea refers to the sea of Torah, and their gathering from the sea means that when they cease their study, they immediately die, as in the cases of Rabba and King David mentioned in Tractate Moed Katan.

Nahar 18

River Yud-Chet - The Secret of Death in the Diaspora and the Land of Israel:
Know that there are two appointed angels over death. One is appointed over the death of the Diaspora, named Samael. The other is appointed over the death in the Land of Israel, named Gabriel. Each of them has numerous legions, and all their legions are called angels of death. These two appointed angels serve under Metatron, and the Holy One, blessed be He, informs Metatron daily who and how many are destined to die on that day. Metatron commands Samael, his servant, to take the souls destined for death on that day in the Diaspora, and commands Gabriel to take the souls destined for death in the Land of Israel on that day.These two appointed angels never take a soul themselves. Instead, each sends one of their legions, as there is one angel for each soul. Each angel approaches according to the appropriate level of the soul it is about to take.
After the angel takes the soul and delivers it into the hands of the appointed one who sent it, that particular angel ceases to exist in the world, for it was created solely to take that one soul, as our sages explained based on the verse "As soon as they finish them off" (Deuteronomy 4:4). Just as a bee's life depends on its sting remaining in the flesh of a person, and therefore it dies immediately, so too these angels rejoice in their deaths to grieve human beings. Similarly, each angel among the angels of death rejoices in taking a soul, contemplating how it was granted the strength and permission to take a soul from the seed of the Holy People.

River 20- Regarding the Prohibition of Laying Out the Dead in the Land of Israel:
Know that it is forbidden to lay out the dead on the ground at night in the Land of Israel, as this causes the defilement of the holy land, as it is said, "And you shall not defile your land." The matter is that there is no permission for the spirit of impurity and the left side's "Other Side" to enter during the day in the Land of Israel, only specifically at night. Even at night, they have no permission except when there is a dead body lying on the ground. However, when there is no dead body lying on the ground, there is no permission whatsoever for any spirit of impurity to enter the land, even by the mere trampling of a foot. During the day, they have absolutely no permission, even if there are many dead bodies lying on the ground. Therefore, it is prohibited to lay out the dead.

Nahar 21

River 21 - Regarding the Secret of Manna and the Fruits of the Land of Israel:
It is worth questioning why the holiness of the Land of Israel is lacking the spiritual manna. One can say that the reason for this is that the wilderness, with all its physical aspects, which are external and impure, flourishes in the lands of the nations, which are governed by rulership. Therefore, its fruits are not suitable vessels to receive the holy spirituality, as an impure body cannot serve as a vessel for holy spirituality. If that holiness were in its fruits and sustenance, it would be governed by the rulership. However, this is not the case with the manna, which comes from heaven and has no part with rulership at all. Indeed, the fruits of the Land of Israel are imbued with holiness, and that specific spirituality suitable for manna clothes itself in those holy fruits. Therefore, there is no manna in the Land of Israel [but only in the wilderness].

Nahar 22

River 22 - The Elevation of Honor in the Land of Israel with the Coming of the Messiah:
Know that it is a received tradition in our hands that on that day when the Messiah comes with the ingathering of the exiles to the Land of Israel, on that day there will be found in the Land of Israel seven thousand of the children of Israel. On that day, the dead in the Land will come to life, and on that day the wall of fire will depart from Jerusalem. On that day, the Temple will be built with good stones and precious gems. On that day, the dead in the Land of Israel will return at the time of their revival in a new spiritual form. Similarly, the seven thousand who are alive, all will be in a new spiritual form, akin to the form of Adam before sin and like the forms of [Enoch and] Moses our teacher, peace be upon him, [and Elijah], and they will soar in the air like flying eagles, and so forth. All this will be seen by the people of the ingathering of the exiles.
When the children of the ingathering of the exiles see that their brethren have become a new creation, and they flourish in the air to go and dwell in the lower Garden of Eden to learn Torah from the mouth of the Blessed One, then the children of the ingathering of the exiles will be filled with concern in their hearts and anguish in their souls. They will yearn for the King Messiah and say, "Are we not children of Israel like them? From where did they merit to be spiritual in body and soul, which is not the case with us? Why are we lacking?"
And the Messiah says to them: "It is already known and widely proclaimed that all the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, measure for measure. Those who were in the diaspora and made efforts to come to the Land in order to merit a pure soul, not caring about their wealth or their bodies, whether by sea or land, not fearing to drown in the sea or be robbed on land, or to be captured by harsh lords. Because they acted primarily from their spirit and soul, not from their body or wealth, therefore, they returned in spiritual measure for measure. But you, who were capable of coming to the Land like them, were degraded to come for the sake of material wealth, and you were concerned about your wealth and your body. You made the essence secondary, from your soul and your spirit. Therefore, you remain materialistic measure for measure. <br>"For the love of wealth that you coveted, the Holy One, blessed be He, will give you wealth without measure. For all the silver, gold, precious stones, and gems sunk in the sea all these days, the sea is sworn to bring them to Jaffa within three days of their sinking, and everything that sank from the six days of creation until the time of Solomon, all that the sea vomited out on land and from there Solomon became rich. And what sank from the time of Solomon until the time of the ingathering of the exiles, all of it the sea of Jaffa will vomit out on land. The Messiah will distribute them to every righteous person, their portion, as it is written: 'The wealth of the seas will flow to you.' And all the hidden treasures under the dust, the earth is destined to roll and bring forth all the treasures of the kings, and lead them to the Land of Israel, as it is written: 'The hidden treasures of the sand will be revealed.' And all will be revealed within the Land of Israel to the King Messiah, and he will distribute them to the people of the ingathering of the exiles, each their portion. <br>"And they will swear a great oath to those who cared about their wealth and their bodies: they will remain materialistic and satiated with wealth. But those who did not care about their bodies and their wealth, but only about their spirit, the Holy One, blessed be He, will make them a new creation and lead them to the lower Garden of Eden, as mentioned."

Nahar 23

River 23 - The Secret of the Resurrection of the Dead in the Land of Israel
Know that we have a tradition that the resurrection of the dead in the Land of Israel precedes the resurrection of the dead outside of Israel by forty years. However, anyone who has passed away outside of Israel and has a close relative in the Land of Israel, so close that they are obligated to mourn for them, whether male or female, that relative in the Land of Israel has the power to revive all their close relatives outside of Israel—all those who are obligated to mourn for them. This secret is hinted at in the Talmud, Pesachim, in the chapter "The Daily Offering is Slaughtered," where our Rabbis of blessed memory say: "The righteous will revive the dead, as it is written: 'Thus says the Lord: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with their staff in hand,' and it is written: 'Lay my staff on the face of the boy,' until here."
The reason that the power of resurrection is attributed to old age and not to righteousness is to hint that all who dwell in the Land of Israel are called righteous, as it is written: "Your people are all righteous," as we explained above. However, this merit of resurrection requires that they be Torah scholars, who are referred to as elders, as it is said: "Show respect for the elderly," and our Rabbis of blessed memory explained that an elder is one who has acquired wisdom.

River Kaf Dalet - The Secret of Why Moses Was Not Buried in the Land of Israel, His Bones Were Not Brought Up, and Why Joseph's Bones Were Brought Up but Not His Body, and Why Jacob's Actual Body Was Brought Up:
The reason why Joseph's body was not buried in the land, only his bones, is because he emitted a drop of seed with the intention of that foreign woman (Potiphar's wife). However, since the act was not completed, his bones were allowed to be buried in the land of Israel.
As for Moses, although he did not emit a drop of seed, he did take a Cushite woman, as mentioned in the chronicles of Moses, and took her as a husband takes his wife. Therefore, even his bones did not merit burial in the land of Israel, which is called "a woman who fears the Lord."
Jacob, on the other hand, because Timna, the concubine of Esau, came to him asking to be married and he refused, therefore both his bones and his body were buried in the land. This is from the words of Rabbi Kalonymus, of blessed memory. And this is what has been written.

Nahar 25

River 25 - Explanation of the Righteous Person's Merit in the Land of Israel, Both in Life and in Death:
The matter is that just as a righteous person during his lifetime in the Land of Israel brings greater benefit to the world than the benefit derived from him being outside the land, so too does the passing of a righteous person in the Land of Israel cause more harm to the world than if he had passed away outside the land. The idea is that the Land of Israel is the heart of the world because it is the gateway to heaven, as mentioned earlier. Just as the heart is the source of life, distributing vitality to all the body’s organs, so too, when the Land of Israel is healthy with righteous people dwelling in it, this health spreads to all the inhabitants of the world collectively. The health of the Land of Israel is due to the righteous people who draw down sustenance and life from above. There is no way for the sustenance to spread to the whole world except from the Land of Israel and nowhere else. This is what the sages meant when they said that the essence of the Land of Israel nourishes the world. As we have said, the Land of Israel is like the heart that distributes life to the entire body. The doctors say that the clearest and purest blood nourishes the heart, and then the brain from what remains pure, and then the liver, and then the other organs according to their levels. Similarly, the world as a whole: the purest and cleanest of the sustenance nourishes the Land of Israel, and then the other lands according to their levels, thus thickening the nourishment of their souls as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the sages intended to say that the essence of the Land of Israel nourishes the world, as mentioned.
However, during the time of destruction, when the sustenance is cut off due to sins, all the organs gradually weaken because the heart is not in its full health and lacks nourishment, similar to a day of fasting. Therefore, there is no day since the destruction of the Temple that its curse is not greater than the previous day, as they gradually weaken due to the lack of sustenance. Just as on a fast day, when nourishment is cut off, the heart is sustained by the organs. When the organs see that the heart is weakening and fear death because their own life depends on the heart’s vitality, they give it their blood to strengthen it so that its power does not diminish, even though their own milk and blood are reduced. Similarly, during the time of destruction, the Land of Israel drinks from the essence of the Diaspora. For the Land of Israel has no sustenance and stability except from the Diaspora, as is the case today.
And behold, the righteous who dwell in the Land of Israel facilitate the flow of sustenance from above. Since spiritual sustenance cannot descend to the physical earth except through the righteous, who are a divine portion from above, through their deeds and Torah they draw down sustenance contrary to its nature. The purity of the place assists them, much like a good wick and pure oil, which hold the light, enabling the spiritual light to descend, despite its natural tendency not to do so. Our Sages said that the world is never without thirty righteous individuals like Abraham, as it is stated, "And Abraham will surely become a great nation," implying that there will always be righteous people in the world comparable to him. If the generation is meritorious, most of them will be in the Land of Israel. The intention of our Sages is that the sustenance of the world depends on the righteous, who work and draw down sustenance to the earth. When most of them are in the Land of Israel, they draw down a large amount of pure and clean sustenance. The minority in the Diaspora can then draw from what has already descended to the Land of Israel. However, when the minority is in the Land of Israel, they cannot draw much sustenance from the gates of heaven. The extent to which the wick is thick and strong determines the size of the flame that clings to it. Therefore, even if most of the righteous are in the Diaspora, they cannot draw down much sustenance, as they can only draw from what has already descended to the Land of Israel through the minority present there.

Or it can be explained differently: the righteous, when they are in the Land of Israel, have the ability to protect all places. This is because, as we have said, the Land of Israel is like the heart, providing life and sustenance to all the other organs. However, the righteous in the Diaspora can only benefit their own location, as they are like the life force of a specific organ that does not benefit others.
Similarly, upon their passing, a righteous person who dies in the Land of Israel, just as they benefited the entire world while alive, causes harm to the entire world upon their death, not just to the people of their own location. This is what the scripture means when it says, "And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba... in the land of Canaan." It is noteworthy that it first mentions the specific location, Kiriath-arba, and then the general location, the land of Canaan, which encompasses all of Israel. This can be understood according to what we have discussed: the intention is to hint at Sarah's greatness, that her merit benefited the people of her immediate location and also all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan. Now, with her passing, everyone has suffered a loss, as her benefit and protection have been removed from all of them.

Nahar 1

River 1 - The Secret of Man Being a Microcosm:...
The idea is that the entire world, as a whole, mirrors the existence of man in a strikingly similar way. Just as man has a body, so too does the world have a body, which is the tangible, physical part that is visible to our eyes. Man perceives only this physical part of the world, just as he only sees the physical aspect of another person. Just as man has an evil inclination derived from impure shells, the physical world is also enveloped in impure air, which is the dwelling place of impure external forces. This aspect is accessible to magicians who refine their vision to perceive demons. Occasionally, ordinary people may suddenly perceive these demons, shifting from viewing the physical world to seeing this impure air, losing sight of the physical realm entirely because they have transitioned from the physical to this mentioned part. Similarly, just as man has a good and holy soul that counters the evil inclination, the world also has a holy covering, which is the secret of the soul of Assiyah. This is the dwelling place of the souls of the righteous, and it is referred to in the Talmud as the "courtyard of death." This is the realm into which Samuel entered after detaching from the physical part, as did Rabbi Ila'i and others. Just as man has a spirit, the world has the Holy Spirit, which is the secret of the earthly Garden of Eden. And just as man has a part that is the soul, the world also has a part that is clothed with the soul.
The soul aspect in the land of Israel is more beautiful than the soul aspect outside of Israel, which is why dying in Israel is considered praiseworthy, as previously mentioned in "The Eye of the Land." The reason is that the Malchut (Kingship), which represents the soul, has many aspects. The central aspect within it is the main point of unification, where the light of Tiferet (Beauty) is revealed, and this occurs in the land of Israel. However, the other aspects of Malchut, which are the soul for the other parts of the world, do not have the light of Tiferet revealed in its essence. The divine Ari, of blessed memory, wrote that humanity is created in the image of God. Just as all the heavenly beings are dependent on and cling to His divine form, so too all the lower creations are dependent on and cling to the form of the human being, and through him, all are blessed. This is the deeper meaning of the text.

Nahar 2

 The River 2 - On the Secret of the Four Elements Serving as Chariots for Holiness and Impurity:
The idea is that a person can either be a chariot for the good inclination or for the evil inclination. Therefore, within the human body, there are specific organs that serve as chariots for each aspect of the four elements of the klipot (impurities). The klipa of each element dwells in the corresponding organ and spreads throughout the body from there. The human body consists of four elements: water, fire, air, and earth. These elements serve as chariots for the four angels, who are the four chayot (living beings): Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. These angels govern the human body through specific organs, corresponding to the four bodily humors: white, red, green, and black. Each humor is associated with a particular organ and spreads its influence throughout the body. The white humor is in the lungs, the red humor in the liver, the green humor in the gallbladder, and the black humor in the spleen. These humors are also chariots for the four klipot: Avon (sin) in the white humor (water), Mashchit (destruction) in the red humor (air), Af (wrath) in the green humor (fire), and Cheima (fury) in the black humor (earth). They directly oppose the mentioned angels.
The concept is that these organs can act either for evil or for good. For evil, such as cooling oneself with laziness in performing mitzvot, heating oneself with joy in committing a sin, expressing anger against the lovers of God, or showing sadness in matters of holiness. In these cases, Avon, Mashchit, Af, and Cheima rule over the person. However, if one cools oneself from sins and shows mercy and a soft heart towards the poor by performing acts of kindness, heats oneself with zeal for holy matters, rushes to perform a mitzvah with alacrity, contends with the enemies of God, becomes angry at them, disciplines students harshly to teach them Torah, or shows sadness and concern over one's sins and weeps over them, then one expels Avon, Mashchit, Af, and Cheima from oneself. Instead, the four holy chayot, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael, will rule over the person, connecting them to higher realms until the level of Atzilut (Emanation). This is the deeper meaning.

Nahar 3

 River 3 - On the Superiority of Humans Over All Creatures:
The idea is that humans are cherished more than other creatures because they were created in the image of God, as explained in the Mishnah. This means that the human form is similar to the Divine form, as we have elaborated. It is known that God made humans in His image. Just as all the higher beings are connected and sustained by God's form, so too all the lower creatures are connected and sustained by the form of the human. Through humans, all creatures receive their blessings.
Therefore, a person who recites "Perek Shira" and knows how to align each of these lower creatures with their corresponding parts within himself, and recites their songs, causes an influx of blessings to all creatures dependent on him. This is what our sages meant when they said in "Perek Shira" that whoever recites it daily merits many great benefits.
Moreover, all worlds were created solely for humans, not only the physical worlds but even the spiritual ones, such as Seraphim, Chayot, and Ofanim. These beings were created to assist humans. Their assistance comes when a person performs their prayers; these beings are tasked with receiving the sounds, breaths, and words of their prayers and elevating them upward to the Sefirot to cause unification. This is also explained in the Tikkunim in the section on Bereshit. This is the meaning of the verse, "For a bird of the sky will carry the voice, and one with wings will tell the matter." The voice refers to the recitation of the Shema, and the speech refers to prayer, as explained elsewhere in the Tikkunim. This is the deeper meaning.

Nahar 4

River 4 - On the Benefit of the Soul Descending to This World:
The ancients questioned the purpose of the soul's descent [into the body], considering that it becomes vulnerable to sin, the defilement of the impure material, and the temptations of the evil inclination. They argued that the soul is far from its reward, for once it departs from this material world, who can ensure it will return to its Creator as pure as it was given? If it ascends, it will not rise above the place from which it was hewn. Therefore, what is the purpose of its creation and descent? The answer to this is that the soul, before its descent, is stored in a specific treasury for souls that have not yet come into the world. There, the soul does not enjoy the vision of the Divine light and life; it is like a modest princess who receives a fixed portion from her father, the king, but does not see his face from the day of her birth because she is naked, devoid of commandments and good deeds. It is impossible for her to be clothed to appear before the king, her father, without the garment of mitzvot and Torah. There is a vast difference between a soul before it comes into the world and after it has come, performed mitzvot, and ascended. This is what is said in the Zohar, Pekudei, page 412: "And in this garment that it wears, which is the garment of mitzvot mentioned there, it will benefit and see in the heavenly mirror," etc. The idea is that by descending into this physical world, being integrated with spirit, soul, and body, performing mitzvot and good deeds, and then ascending and being clothed in them in the World to Come, the soul is then integrated into all worlds. Only then can it appear before the king, its father. If it were not integrated into all worlds, as mentioned, it would not be able to appear there. This is what is meant by "But the righteous shall give thanks to Your name" in this world; these are the ones who "will sit in uprightness before Your face" in the World to Come. Therefore, only a few, the righteous who did not descend into this world, will not sit before His face in the World to Come, as mentioned.
The main reason is that the soul originates from the throne of Binah, the spirit from Tiferet by an angel, and the nefesh from Malchut by an ofan. If one does not descend to this world, the nefesh will not bind with the spirit, and the spirit with the soul. This separation above means that Binah does not illuminate Tiferet, and Tiferet does not illuminate Malchut, for the actions of the branches affect the roots.
However, by descending into the world, the soul connects with the spirit, illuminating it, and both illuminate the nefesh, and all three illuminate the body. Similarly, above, these three connect to illuminate this world. Thus, one enjoys a semblance of this unity in the World to Come, as it is said, "to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in His temple." And this is what has been stated.

Nahar 5


River 5 - On the Existence of the Human Body from the Power of the Letters and the Four Elements:The concept is that four types of compositions were created in the world: inanimate, vegetative, animal, and speaking (human). This is because the world was created by the power of the four letters of the Divine Name, Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh (יהוה). It is known that the secret of these four letters of the Divine Name corresponds to four modes of governance: The inanimate, which is represented by the last "Heh" (ה) of the Divine Name, signifies silence and stillness. About this, it is said, "I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good." This corresponds to the stone and the earth, as known, thus the inanimate is certainly represented by this. The vegetative, which derives from the "Vav" (ו) of the Name, refers to trees and all types of plants that grow and live due to its influence. Hence, in the third, which is Tiferet (the "Vav"), various plants were created, as known, referring to the "plant of the righteous." The animal, represented by the first "Heh" (ה) of the Name, comes from Binah, which is the secret of the "Mother of all living," referring to beasts, animals, birds, and all creeping and swarming things. The essence of life extends within them from the Land of Life and the Living God. The speaking, represented by the "Yud" (י) of the Name, signifies the human being created from Chochmah (wisdom), which is called Adam (אדם) and Mah (מה) Chochmah (חכמה) indeed. This refers to the speaker, as the words and speech emanate from it, and the foundation of speech lies in Chochmah, from which comes wisdom, the source of intellectual capacities, known as the 32 paths of wisdom. Hence, from there, human intellect is derived.
There are four things in the four types of compositions, and all of them are in the human being. The inanimate is only perceived through the last "Heh" (ה) and has the boundaries of the body, resembling the inanimate. Beyond this is the vegetative, which ascends and grasps the "Vav" (ו). The animal surpasses both, having the boundaries of the body like the inanimate and the growth like the vegetative. Beyond both is the living, moving being, which is included in the Divine Name and ascends to the upper "Heh" (ה). The human being encompasses the entire Name, being the most complete of all creations. All other creations are lacking because they do not include the entire Name, but the human includes the boundaries of the body, growth, movement, and rational speech. Thus, the human being includes the whole Name, which is the greatness of humans over all other creations, in addition to other qualities, and rational speech. It is known that anyone who holds only part of the Name does not hold any of it, because the Name is indivisible and cannot be separated. Whoever attempts to divide it loses it entirely. Therefore, other creations do not truly grasp the Name since they hold only part of it. However, the human encompasses the entire Name together in unity and is held by it. This is the human's superiority over all living beings and other creations.
And behold, this body is constructed from particulars and elements; the body does not emerge as simple but rather as composite. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, first created the four elements: fire, wind, water, and earth. These were like the building stones from which the entire body, whether vegetative, animal, or human, was created, as previously explained. These four elements originate from the secret of Keter, though they do not manifest there because these elements extend from one state to another until they reach the secret of water (Chesed), fire (Gevurah), wind (Tiferet), and earth (Malchut). It is known that these primary elements are rooted in these four attributes in Atzilut, and from there, they expand into Beriah, then Yetzirah, and finally Asiyah, until reaching this physical world. However, their existence begins hidden within Keter, where they are in a state of "nothingness," then extend to Chochmah where their entity begins, and to Binah where they start to separate in a hidden manner. They then reach their place and are revealed in the essence as emanated elements. From there, they continue to spread from one state to another until they become these earthly, physical, dense, and thick elements. Afterwards, they begin to combine with each other in such a way that they are bound together above, where the higher emanated existence is constructed from their unification. All of them are connected in water, all are connected in wind, all are connected in fire, and all are connected in earth.
However, their order in the lower world is such that the upper fire, known to be Gevurah, ascends above so that the world does not perish instantly. For if Gevurah were to extend to the lower realms, they would be consumed and destroyed, as mentioned in Parashat Terumah. Thus, Gevurah pertains only to the upper realms, while the lower realms exist through Chesed. Therefore, fire ascends upward to the level of the concave surface of the lunar sphere, indicating that the primary role of Gevurah is to serve the upper realms, while Chesed extends downward to sustain the lower realms. This means that Chesed is connected to the earth, represented by the outstretched right arm receiving the upper earth between these two arms.
Hence, water is close to earth to moisten its dryness, and wind is the secret of the body between these two arms, that is, wind between the upper fire and the lower water. Because there is a foundation of Chesed established above everything, water is above the heavens as it is written, "For Your mercy is great above the heavens" (Psalms 108:5).
Now, from these four elements, all existences are constructed by their connection together. No part of them is found separate from another; rather, everything is always four interconnected and united. This is the foundation of every existence below, and the upper realms are also composed of these elements, but in the form of four spiritual elements similar to the heavens.
Thus, above as well, there are four, indicating that these elements are not found solely in the lower realms but also in the upper realms, and even in the external ones. Everything is founded on these four elements, which are the foundation for every created existence. And this is what was meant earlier.

Nahar 6

Nahar 6 – Regarding the Well of Health for Body and Soul:
Know that there is no body, soul, spirit, or soul-life that was not created by the 22 letters of the Torah. Each of these entities possesses the 22 letters of the Torah, and they reside within, while the skin of a person acts as a covering, akin to the sky or a veil. However, the righteous have within their soul the ability to shine through this veil, and the letters of the soul manifest externally. But the wicked do not have discernible letters visible externally, as the "husks" (klipot) obscure their soul, preventing it from illuminating. This is the secret of the letters that are revealed on a person's forehead, reflecting the inner letters of the soul. These letters expose all of a person's transgressions upon their forehead, as explained by Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Komarno (the holy Harayra"Y of blessed memory).

Nahar 7

Nahar 7 – Concerning Adam in His Original Creation:
At the time of Adam's creation, he was in the Garden of Eden, but the rest of the world was not created without purpose. Adam was meant to leave the Garden for the needs of his body and all his physical requirements. The Garden served him like a temple or synagogue for prayer, a house of study for engaging in Torah and fulfilling the commandments, and a place for prophecy in the name of God. The rest of the world was designated for his physical possessions and all his material needs. However, his tranquility did not last long, as our sages have explained. And as was stated above.

Nahar 8

The idea is that a person's spiritual potential (their merit and righteousness) is directly connected to the secret of their life. The soul of a person comes from a fine realm that lies between the forces of impurity and holiness. It is like the shell of a nut that is eaten along with the nut itself. At times, the soul attaches itself to holiness and becomes purified, while at other times, it clings to the external forces and becomes impure. The soul, hewn from that place, is subject to a person's free will and choices. If a person conducts themselves righteously, their soul will cleave to holiness, and they will merit eternal light. If they act perversely, their soul will cleave to impurity, leading to eternal death, which is the punishment of *karet* (spiritual excision).
If a person merits through their deeds, they will receive a purer, more internal soul. If they merit further, they are granted *ruach* (spirit), which is another level of holiness, akin to the subtlety of an angel. If they merit even more, they are granted a *neshama* (soul), and they can ascend through the levels of *nefesh*, *ruach*, and *neshama* from the world of Atzilut (the highest spiritual realm). The increase in life depends on a person’s righteousness in their actions, meaning the life of the soul, not the body.
The concept is that the infinite light (Or Ein Sof) flows and descends through the chain of levels until it reaches the absence of life, which is death. The Or Ein Sof does not spread to the external forces, which represent death, as death has no life in it at all.
Thus, since this is the case, when mitzvot and good deeds performed by people ascend upwards, although the mitzvot are physical actions, they contain life. Just as the body performs the physical act of the mitzvah, the life-force within a person acts within the mitzvah. The amount of life in the mitzvah corresponds to the life-force of the person performing it. If the person is wicked, and their soul is spiritually excised with little connection to the Or Ein Sof due to its closeness to the absence of life (death), then their mitzvah contains little light and life, almost incapable of ascending to the true world of reward. Such people are paid in this world, as the verse says, "He repays His enemies..." (Deuteronomy 7:10).
However, if the person’s soul is alive and the Or Ein Sof shines within them—especially if they have *ruach*, and even more so if they have a *neshama*, or if they have attained the level of Atzilut—then the life-force in their mitzvah is exceedingly great. When that mitzvah ascends, it adorns the corresponding sefirah (divine attribute) with the soul of the righteous. The sefirah is then included in the lower levels of life, which are truly the Or Ein Sof shining in the soul. This occurs through the merit of Torah and mitzvot performed by the individual. 
And as was explained above.

Nahar 9

...**Nahar 9 – On the Vital Spirit in Man:**
There is within a person a vital spirit, which emanates from the heavens and the rotation of the celestial spheres. This refers to the body, which is composed of the four elements, and the life-force within it, which comes from the life in the heavens. The concept is that, just as these elements are lifeless bodies and combine with one another through the rotation of the spheres, life is then breathed into the elements from the life-force of the heavens. This life-force is also composed of four spiritual elements, as everything that exists from the level of Chesed and below is composed of four spiritual elements, each ascending level by level.
Upon these elements, a second reality exists, which is the life-force of a person. It is analogous to the life-force that governs the world and its four elements. This is the secret of a created power in the heavens that extends upon the earth, from which life is bestowed upon living creatures. The most refined of this life-force is conferred upon humans, due to the elevated nature of their body and its creation in the image and likeness (of God).
However, the secret of this vital spirit within man rides upon these physical organs and enables the function of the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, and smell, which are rooted in the head, and touch, which is distributed throughout the entire body.
And as was stated above.

Nahar 10

Know that the letter Aleph (א) resembles the brain, and its shape consists of a Yud (י) above, resembling a small round shape, and another Yud below, with a Vav (ו) in the middle connecting them. The Vav represents two spheres attached to each other. The Vav in the letter Aleph should be thicker on both ends and thinner in the middle, resembling the shape of the brain.
These four aspects of the brain each have a specific function: the first governs thought, the second governs memory, the third governs imagination, and the fourth governs the production of seed. Each of these four aspects of the brain has four corners, corresponding to the four directions of the world.
- The brain responsible for thought is connected to four types of thinking. When a person thinks about Torah, that thought comes from the southern direction. When they think about secular wisdom or external books, that thought comes from the northern direction. Thoughts related to mitzvot (commandments) come from the east, and thoughts related to sin come from the west.
- Similarly, the brain responsible for memory has the same four directions: southern for remembering Torah, northern for external books, eastern for mitzvot, and western for sin.
- For the brain responsible for imagination, the southern direction governs imagining Torah-related wisdom, the northern governs imagining science and geometry, the eastern governs imagining objects and structures for mitzvot, like a synagogue, Torah scroll cases, tefillin, or a sukkah. The western direction governs imagining objects and structures related to idolatry or mundane purposes.
- The brain responsible for producing seed also operates through four directions. From the southern and eastern directions, seed for males is produced. The southern direction produces the seed for a seven-month pregnancy, and the eastern for a nine-month pregnancy. From the northern and western directions comes the seed for females, for both seven-month and nine-month pregnancies, as explained.
And as stated above. Written in the book of traditions (Masachiy).

Nahar 11

**Nahar 11 – On the Creation of the Embryo and the Soul:**
Know that when a man has relations with his wife and she conceives, the angel Gabriel sends one of his messengers to take the drop (of seed), and for each drop, an angel is sent that is appropriate for it. The idea is that under Gabriel, there are ten camps, corresponding to the ten lineages among Israel. As our sages said, the angel appointed over pregnancy is named "Lailah," and the numerical value of *Lailah* (ליל"ה) in small gematria is 12, just like Gabriel, whose value in small gematria is also 12, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel. Gabriel is only assigned to Israel, not to the nations.
The Holy One, blessed be He, sends an angel in charge of souls, who brings one specific soul, and God tells that soul, "Enter this drop, for from this drop your body will be built."
He commands the angel in charge of the treasury of forms (images) to bring that soul so it can choose its form according to its desire: tall or short, complete or blemished, weak or strong, beautiful or ugly, and so on. He says to the soul, "Know that the world you are going to is called *Life of the Moment* (the temporary life), and after the resurrection, it will be called *Life of Eternity*. Whoever is tall in this generation will be the shortest in the generation after the resurrection. The same applies to being rich or poor, weak or strong, beautiful or ugly, and other such characteristics. The choice is in your hands. Some choose what is close (the present life) and not what is far (eternal life). Others choose what is far, which is the long-term. Some prefer to be average in both the near and far. Accordingly, no one can complain to their Creator, asking why their fellow is beautiful and they are not, or similar questions, since everything depends on their own choice."
This is the meaning of what our sages said: "What does 'and all their hosts' mean? It teaches that everything in creation was made in its full stature and its unique form." The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the angel in charge of the unclean animals and their souls, "Do you want to be created with the understanding that you will be subservient to humans for riding and carrying burdens?" They replied, "Yes." He said similarly to the angel in charge of the pure animals and their souls, "Do you want to be created with the understanding that you will serve humans for their enjoyment and food?" They replied, "Yes." If this applies to animals, who were only created in their specific forms, how much more so does it apply to humans....And when the soul is lowered from the light of the upper world to the dark and lowly world, it descends step by step to gradually adjust and endure the transition. At first, the soul is taken through gardens and orchards, then through fields and vineyards, after that into a city, from there to an alley, then to a courtyard, from the courtyard into a house, and finally, it is placed into the womb of a woman through the nostrils. The male soul enters through the right nostril and the female soul through the left nostril. Since the soul is not accustomed to this and does not want to descend by its own will, it is brought down against its will but for its own good, which is the meaning of "against your will you are formed," as the sages have said.
Know that everything depends on a person's choice: whether they will be weak or strong, rich or poor, short or tall, ugly or beautiful, despised or honored, coarse or sharp. However, being male or female, wise or foolish, does not depend on one's choice. Being male or female is determined necessarily, as a male soul cannot be embodied in a female body, and vice versa, as mentioned in the Zohar (Parashat Vayelech). All the spirits that emerge from above are created male and female, and afterward, they separate, and so on. The soul does not have the option of choosing to be male in this world and female in the next, as a male soul cannot be embodied in a female body.
Regarding wisdom and foolishness, no person would willingly reject wisdom and choose foolishness. Whoever is wise in this world will certainly not become foolish after the resurrection. Our sages have expounded on the verse "And a teacher, he too shall teach" (Isaiah 30:20), explaining that anyone who merits to be a teacher of Torah in this world will also merit to be a teacher in the world to come. However, the decree of being wise or foolish is not based on one's choice; it is determined by the Holy One, blessed be He, based on the actions of the person's parents. If the conception occurred after eating heavy food and early at night, before the food was properly digested, the soul of a wise person will not enter. But if the conception occurred after midnight and following the consumption of light food, then a wise soul will enter.
The divine Rabbi Yeshaya Horowitz, of blessed memory, wrote: When a man is intimate with his wife, if both intend for good and for the sake of the mitzvah, then the child born from that union will be a complete tzaddik (righteous person), with an encompassing and internal light. The opposite is also true: if both have negative intentions, the child will be the opposite. However, if the father has a positive intention and the mother has a negative intention, the child will have a good encompassing light and a negative internal light. Over time, the encompassing light will overpower the internal one, transforming it to become good. Conversely, if the encompassing light is bad and the internal light is good, the bad will overpower the good, making the child wicked. This is because the encompassing light surrounds the internal light and transforms it according to its nature.
If you see a person who is as swift as an eagle or as quick as a deer in all his actions, being swift in his work, this indicates the dominance of the father's energy in him. On the other hand, if the person is heavy and lazy, it is the mother's internal energy that is dominant. Everything depends on the situation: if the father had a positive intention, the child will be swift in spiritual matters and become a great person. But if the father's focus was on worldly matters, the child will be quick in worldly tasks. This is the secret of Asahel, who was extremely light on his feet, as our sages said, able to run on the tops of stalks of grain without breaking them, which was true in the literal sense. The secret of this is that most or all of Asahel's nature came from his father's intention, without influence from his mother, and thus his encompassing light grew to its fullest extent. The power of agility comes from the encompassing light, which moves and propels the person effortlessly.
This is why you will find some children who remain still and others who cannot stay still for even a moment. Everything depends on what we have mentioned, and this is what I wished to clarify.

Nahar 12

River 12 - To explain the secret of the levels within the people of Israel:
Know that there are six levels among the descendants of Jacob, and this is their order from lowest to highest. 
The first level is someone who possesses neither Torah nor a profession (referred to as *derech eretz*, or the way of the world). Without a profession, such a person is inclined toward stealing from others because they lack a means of sustenance. They are likened to sheep, which have no craft. Scripture refers to this group as "worthless people" (*bnei naval*).
The second level is someone who does not possess Torah but does have a profession. This group is compared to cattle, for they have the craft of plowing and threshing, and they eat from their work, as it is written, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is threshing." This group is similarly compared to oxen. Scripture calls them "without a name," because, without Torah, they do not merit a divine connection to have an angel sent to protect them.
The third level is someone who possesses Torah but has only studied the Written Torah (*Mikra*) without engaging in the study of Mishnah. Since they have the Written Torah, they possess an intelligent soul. However, because they lack knowledge of the Mishnah, they are called "barren land," as the Written Torah is likened to a field, and the Mishnah is likened to the plants that grow from it. A field without plants is called a "barren field," and so someone who has only studied the Written Torah without the Mishnah is called "barren land." Nonetheless, since they possess the Written Torah, they are deserving of the final letter "Hey" of the Divine Name (*Hashem*) to be sent to them as protection.

The fourth level is someone who possesses knowledge of the Written Torah (*Mikra*), the Mishnah, and the Talmud but lacks knowledge of *Midrash*, Agadah, and the secrets of the Torah. This group is referred to as the *am ha’aretz* (people of the land) in the Torah, as it is written in the Zohar on Parashat Vayikra, "If a soul sins unintentionally from among the people of the land..." This group has an intellectual soul from the attribute of *Malchut* (kingship) and an intellectual spirit from the attribute of *Tiferet* (beauty). Therefore, they merit the two final letters of the Divine Name (*Hashem*), and two angels are sent to protect them, as it is said, "He will command His angels concerning you."
The fifth level is someone who possesses the Written Torah, the Mishnah, the Talmud, as well as Midrash, Agadah, the secrets of the Torah, and *Sefer Yetzirah*, but has not yet perfected themselves in the wisdom of Kabbalah, as they have not delved into it properly. Such a person is called wise and understanding but is not referred to as *maskil* (enlightened). For this individual, the majority, if not the entirety, of the Divine Name is employed for their protection, as it is said, "Hashem is your guardian; Hashem is your shade."
The sixth level is someone who is fully complete in all the aforementioned areas, reaching the ultimate level of perfection. For this individual, the Divine Name is fully employed to guard them, as it is said, "Hashem will guard your going out and your coming in from now and forever."
In the top three levels, the "smoke of their offering" refers to the breath that exits their nostrils on a day of fasting, diminishing their blood and heart. This is considered an offering to Hashem. Additionally, the breath that comes from their mouths during prayer is also considered a sacrifice to Hashem.

Nahar 13



Nahar 14



Nahar 15

Chapter 15 - On the Mystery of Service and Attachment to the Divine Presence (Shekhinah):**
Know that the indwelling of the Divine Presence (Shekhinah) depends on the righteous actions of a person on earth. As long as one's service is steadfast, their soul remains firmly within them, and the Shekhinah dwells in their soul. This is because the Shekhinah does not dwell on the body directly, but upon the soul. The soul, in turn, only remains in the body through service [and prayer]. Therefore, the Shekhinah strengthens its presence in a person only during moments of service and prayer.
If someone makes their spiritual service primary and everything else secondary, their soul remains firmly within them, because they are constantly engaged in service [and prayer]. Such a person only withdraws from serving the Blessed Creator as much as is necessary to sustain the body due to its material needs, which are meant to support their service.
However, if someone does not make their spiritual service their primary concern but instead focuses on their business affairs as central and their service as occasional, their soul does not remain firmly within the body, and the Shekhinah does not dwell upon them. Thus, we conclude that the measure of one's soul is proportional to the measure of their service, and the presence of the Shekhinah is proportional to the measure of the soul.
The reason for this is that souls resemble the Shekhinah in all its aspects. Just as the Shekhinah rests upon the worlds of Beriah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah (BYA), so too do souls correspond to these worlds. The collective souls are like maidens who follow after the Shekhinah, and they behave within the body according to how the body engages in spiritual service, as previously mentioned.
This is what is revealed.

Nahar 16

**River 16 - To Explain Types of Service for Its Own Sake (Lishmah) and Not for Its Own Sake (Shelo Lishmah):**
The matter is that serving and revering the Holy One, Blessed Be He, *not for its own sake* refers to someone who serves God and distances themselves from what the Torah prohibits out of concern that they will lose their life, the lives of their loved ones, or their possessions. This is certainly considered *not for its own sake*.
However, there is another type of *not for its own sake* that is close to being *for its own sake*. This refers to someone who refrains from doing what their Creator hates, out of fear of the punishment of the World to Come, the loss of their soul, and its destruction, God forbid, but not due to worldly concerns. There is a more inner level of serving *for its own sake*, which is when a person refrains from sin because they are aware that the punishment for sinning before the Holy One, Blessed Be He, is that the reward for one sin is another sin. A small impurity leads to greater impurity. Therefore, they are cautious not to create even a small breach, lest it opens a large door for external forces. This is very good, and is almost the concept of "making a fence for the Torah."
However, there is an even more profound level of perfection, which is when a person encounters a forbidden matter and distances themselves from it with the intention that their actions affect the higher spiritual worlds, specifically the *Sefirot*. Just as they subdue their evil inclination, they cause the left side (the side of impurity) to be subdued before holiness, as their evil inclination, which is a branch of impurity, is subdued before the good inclination, which is a branch of holiness.
The idea is that the general category of positive commandments (*mitzvot aseh*) corresponds to Chesed (Kindness), while negative commandments (*mitzvot lo ta'aseh*) correspond to Gevurah (Judgment/Restraint). The reason is that when a person refrains from sinning, they prevent blemishes and avoid increasing impurity. This corresponds to the 365 gates of Gevurah, which are closed so that the external forces (the *chitzonim*) cannot draw from them. These are the 365 gates, and when a person breaks through one of them, they create an opening for the *chitzonim* to grasp onto judgment, God forbid. Conversely, when a person performs acts of kindness and goodness, they open 248 gates, which are the gates of Chesed, to illuminate the *Sefirot*. This is service *for its own sake*.
However, when one's intentions are for personal benefit, they can only draw from the angel Metatron, who is a servant that receives reward from his Master. But when a person unites their actions with higher spiritual purposes, they influence the *Sefirot* themselves, because every action follows the intention behind it.
And this is what was said.

Nahar 17

Here is a translation of the passage from *Even Shetiya, Maayan 4, Nahar 17*:
To clarify the flaw and the merit of man:
The idea is that the Shekhinah (Divine Presence) dwells in the lower realms, and it has no throne in these realms except in man, through the aspects of *nefesh* (soul), *ruach* (spirit), and *neshamah* (higher soul). If it were conceivable that the human race ceased to exist, the Shekhinah would depart, and the world would cease to exist as well. This is the meaning of the verse, "And no plant of the field was yet in the earth… because there was no man…"
The true throne of the Shekhinah is the righteous person, whose actions are fitting. This is hinted at in the phrase "And God ascended from Abraham," and is also the secret of the teaching that "the Patriarchs are the chariot." This phenomenon can only be found in a person who has not blemished any of their limbs, for if one limb is damaged, then the throne is not complete but is lacking by one limb. In that specific limb, an evil spirit takes residence, and holiness departs from it for two reasons: the first is the deficiency of that limb, since the throne that holds the Shekhinah in the lower realms must be a person with 248 limbs; this throne is missing one. The second reason is that the Shekhinah and the evil spirit are rivals to each other, and since the evil spirit rests on the person due to that flaw, the Shekhinah departs, and the evil spirit takes hold of all 248 limbs.
This is the flaw of the Shekhinah, for it has been cast out from its place, and its place is the person, for whom it was created. This is the flaw of its throne, and it has been removed and cast away. There is no rectification for this unless the person purifies themselves completely, for one who says, “I will be righteous in all of Torah except for a particular mitzvah (commandment),” is considered a traitor to that mitzvah, as per the reasoning mentioned.
And thus it was said above.

Nahar 18

Here is a translation of the passage from *Even Shetiya, Nahar 18*:
--- To explain the aspects and efficacy of speech: The concept is that every word spoken—whether it is words of Torah or words of gratitude—leaves an impression, as does harmful speech. Each word has its own path. The ascent of positive speech is through the spiritual essence of the letters formed by the five articulations in the mouth. This breath rises through the soul (*nefesh*) within a person, all within the lower world. This progression continues through the levels of *nefesh*, *ruach* (spirit), and *neshamah* (soul). Upon reaching the world of angels, called "the sapphire stone," the *nefesh* remains behind, while the *ruach*, *neshamah*, and *neshamah of the neshamah* (the highest soul aspect) ascend further, as the humble *nefesh* cannot rise beyond this point. The essence of the letters in *nefesh* remains there, while *ruach* and *neshamah* continue ascending from chamber to chamber until reaching the chamber of the Holy of Holies. There, the *ruach* of the letters stays behind, unable to rise further. The *neshamah* and *neshamah of the neshamah* proceed to the Throne, where the *neshamah* of the Throne is left behind, unable to ascend further. The essence of the letters in *atzilut* (the world of emanation) ascends to the highest unity. If it is worthy, a response descends from this level, step by step: from *atzilut*, it clothes itself in the *neshamah* of *atzilut*, then meets the *neshamah* of the response from the Throne of Glory. These two responses combine and clothe each other, descending into the *ruach* level of the response, and then into the *nefesh* of the response, until reaching the realm of Creation.This light crowns the righteous person who initiated it. This is also the path for mitzvot (commandments), sacrifices, and all things that ascend via the levels of this ladder, both in ascent and descent, for positive speech.
Here is a translation of the passage:
---
This is the meaning of "new heavens" created from the innovations in Torah, as mentioned in the *Zohar* on *Bereshit* and *Kedoshim*. Through engagement in Torah, the letters formed and combined in a person's mouth generate spirituality and a delightful essence. This is also the nature of prayer, in which Akatriel (an angelic figure) receives and binds connections for his Master. Thus, if a mitzvah (commandment) is performed without intention, it is like a body without a soul. The greater the intention, the more elevated the spirituality of the mitzvah, allowing it to rise higher and higher. Therefore, the sages said that mitzvot require intention; if one does not intend to fulfill it, they do not fulfill it.
However, when harmful speech ascends, it does not go up through the ladder but instead reaches only one level: the World of Action (*Asiyah*). Then, the evil force (the *klipah*) emerges to meet it and absorbs it but does not bring it through the entrance to the chamber of the sapphire stone. Sin and transgression are not driven by the *ruach* (spirit) or *neshamah* (soul) since it is written, "A soul that sins." Therefore, this type of speech ascends from behind the chambers, only reaching the third chamber from the outside, opposite the Chamber of Merit, with no further ascent. From there, it calls to the fourth chamber, the seat of judgment. Judgment enters, with "the eyes of God that roam" bearing witness to the matter. The matter is judged, and the decree descends to the forces of the *chitzonim* (external forces) through the "Female of the Great Abyss," where these external forces unite. Woe to the result of such harmful actions.
If harmful speech is used for good, such as confession (*vidui*), it ascends properly through the ladder, as described earlier, and then descends in the manner described for harmful speech. This process brings the flaw downwards to be cast into the *klipot* (shells or husks of impurity), as in "You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." Since a person sins through the 22 letters, which are the 22 supernal lights that can sometimes be blemished, it is beneficial to confess using all of them, thereby transferring the flaw to the *klipot*, all through one path.
And thus it was said above.

Nahar 19

Here is a translation of the passage from *Even Shetiya, Nahar 19*:
---
To explain that souls are a mixture of good and evil:
The idea is that all souls contain a mixture of good and evil. Sometimes, the good part of a person’s soul is given to a wicked individual. This is why there are some wicked people who occasionally perform mitzvot properly, even though they are otherwise fully wicked. Conversely, there are completely righteous people who have certain sins they cannot detach from and in which they stumble—sins that would not ensnare an average person. This is because the evil part within them is drawn toward that specific area or transgression, depending on the blend of the soul’s components.
A bit of a righteous person’s goodness may be mixed with the wicked, and a bit of a wicked person’s evil may be mixed with the righteous. Therefore, a person must work to bring merit to the wicked, so that by doing so, the good within the wicked person will be transferred to the righteous, and the evil within the righteous will be transferred to the wicked. When a righteous person brings merit to someone who is guilty, the good within that wicked person mingles with and gravitates toward the righteous individual, thus transferring the good within the wicked to the righteous and the evil within the righteous to the wicked. In this way, the elements of the soul become clarified and refined.
This is the meaning of "If your enemy is hungry," for the wicked despise the righteous, as it is written, "Do I not hate those who hate You, O Lord?" And it says, "If your enemy is hungry, feed him bread"—meaning the bread of Torah, and the waters of Torah. By doing so, "you heap coals of fire upon his head," symbolically transferring all sins to him, as in "the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities." The verse concludes with "and the Lord shall reward you," meaning He will complete the goodness you were lacking, making you whole.
From this, one can understand the concept of the perfectly righteous person, the intermediary, and the completely wicked person—each one assessed by the portions of good and evil sparks within their soul.
And thus it was said above. From the teachings of the Ari z"l.

Nahar 21 - To explain the rectification of Adam by the later righteous individuals:
Know that with the arrival of each and every righteous person, Adam is gradually completed, making up for what was diminished at first due to his sin. For each righteous person is like a specific organ or part of him. The concept is that all the souls that come into the world are rooted in the souls that fell from Adam, and they also come from the souls that remained within Adam himself, etc. And know that after the coming of the Messiah, with God’s help, all of Adam’s flaws will be rectified, and he will be restored to his original wholeness. This includes both the souls that fell from him and those that remained within him, as they will all return to shine as they did initially. This is as was previously explained by our teacher, Rabbi Yitzchak Abarbanel, of blessed memory.

Nahar 22

There are three primary ways higher pleasures reach those who experience them: (1) light, (2) fragrance, and (3) eating and drinking. Understand that pleasure for humans exists across three worlds: in This World, through eating and drinking; in the lower Garden of Eden, through fragrance and the scents of the garden; and in the World of Souls, through the radiance of the Divine Presence.
The reason that, in the World of Souls, which is at the level of the Throne of Glory, they draw from Binah is that their pleasure resembles that of Binah, as it is said about the World to Come, “there is neither eating nor drinking.” In the lower Garden of Eden, where they draw from Tiferet, they enjoy the scent of the garden of Eden. In This World, where sustenance comes from Malchut, pleasure is through eating and drinking.
These three types of pleasure enter the recipients through their own designated pathways. Light enters through the eyes, corresponding to the right and left (Chochmah and Binah). Fragrance enters through the nose, corresponding to the Vav of Tiferet. Eating and drinking enter through the mouth, representing Malchut.
In ancient times, when people directed all their intentions toward heaven, they would bring incense and bless it to connect This World with the World of Souls, allowing enjoyment also from fragrance, which corresponds to Tiferet via the nose, and from light (symbolized by the menorah, which corresponds to the eyes), and from eating and drinking through the mouth, which represents Malchut, as mentioned above. When they unified these with intent in the pleasure of Shabbat, they connected all the worlds. Therefore, lighting the Shabbat candle is a great mitzvah.


However, the sustenance of the world through fragrance or light currently exists only in the World of Souls or in the World to Come, as mentioned. This is experienced only by those to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has granted a taste of the World to Come, as in 'they beheld God, and they ate and drank,' meaning that they enjoyed the radiance of the Divine Presence. Or, by those who have entered the Garden of Eden, as discussed in Avoda d’Yenuka (The Service of the Child) in the story of Rabbi Ilai: the Torah scholars who saw Rabbi Ilai enjoyed the fragrances of the Garden of Eden for seven days. These individuals merited a taste of those higher worlds during their lifetimes. But in This World, it is impossible to sustain oneself in such a way, except through the physical sustenance provided to all lower beings, which is through eating and drinking, as previously mentioned. What is material for humans serves as a metaphor for the higher attributes, as the lower worlds are dependent upon the higher worlds. And this is as was previously explained."


Nahar 23

River 23 - To explain the concept of those sages who entered the Garden or encountered various parts of the spiritual realms, places where souls dwell. What was this world to them?
Similarly, regarding the story of Samuel who descended to the ‘Courtyard of Death,’ and likewise, in the Genesis portion where Rabbi Ḥiyya saw Rabbi Shimon, and other such cases—what was this world to them, and where did they go?
We have already explained elsewhere (earlier in River 1) that this world is called the 'Courtyard of Death,' and in it, souls reside. This means after the soul resides in the grave, it possesses an inner aspect, which is the Ruach (spirit) of Yetzirah, extending into Asiyah. This Ruach is subtler than the Nefesh (soul) in the way the soul is subtler than the body. It is a dwelling for the spirits of the righteous and is called the lower Garden of Eden. It has a connection to this physical realm, which our sages called the earthly Garden of Eden.
The nature of the souls when they enter the abode of souls known as the 'Courtyard of Death'—which Samuel entered and likewise Rabbi Ḥiyya and others—is that these souls do not engage with the physicality or occurrences of this world. Physicality does not harm them, and they derive pleasure from the subtleties of earth and heaven, which are akin to their refined souls. Through this refinement, they establish a 'grip' to connect with the Divine.
In this way, they are refined spirits within refined spirits, with the hosts of souls engaged in Torah study, dwelling in serene and tranquil rest. They only attain the spirits of the Garden of Eden on Sabbaths and new moons. Likewise, our physical bodies correspond to those souls. Only the especially virtuous and the highest saints could merge soul with soul, enter that refined realm, and depart from this coarse world. It is impossible for them to perceive both realms at once, where they would see the physical world and souls simultaneously. Rather, permission must be granted from above for the soul to descend and enter this world, or for a person to ascend from this physical world to enter that spiritual realm. To see both worlds at once is impossible; one can either perceive the physical or the spiritual."
And those sages who attained insights into those worlds, such as the story of the ‘cabin bearers’ and the case of Rabbi Ila’i—all of them would separate themselves from the matters of this world and enter a realm of subtlety, where they would no longer see any part of this world, neither the sky nor the earth. They did not need to go far outside the settled areas [of the Land of Israel], only enough to prepare nature for the vision. It appeared to them as if they were entering beneath the ground in caves, but God forbid that rest is found beneath the ground.
Similarly, regarding the incident of Yo’ezer in the Zohar, who descended into a cave—all of it was a temporary vision to align the consciousness for the proper understanding of that level, to enter the atmosphere of the Garden of Eden. And this is what was previously explained."

Nahar 24

River 24 - To explain the concept of soul-to-soul connection:**
In the Zohar (Aharei Mot), Rabbi Ḥiyya expressed wonder, asking, “Is there anyone who knows how to inform…?” It isn’t merely about crying or praying at a grave, as this doesn’t require any special knowledge. Rather, the deeper meaning is that even if a person goes and weeps at the graves of the righteous, this alone will not awaken the soul, for the soul is not truly in the grave, Heaven forbid.
This is the mystery of the souls of the righteous who would encounter Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Elazar, and other colleagues in the mystical realm of their souls. But this ability was not given to everyone. Although it may seem physical, the experience doesn’t take place in cemeteries, study houses, synagogues, or deserts as some might imagine, including those lacking understanding.
Instead, this matter is attained and perceived in the secret of the “garment” that existed for humanity before the sin of Adam, within the mystery of the “garments of light” (*kotnot or*). After the sin, the physicality thickened, and it was decreed, “For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.” Yet, this refined “garment” and subtle realm are the inheritance of their souls. This secret is only accessible to those of pure intellect, who have elevated their spiritual soul above physicality and subdued bodily forces. They then pass through the veil of the physical world, entering the world of souls, where they perceive according to their level of purity, hearing them or even seeing them directly.
This is how Rabbi Shimon and his companions experienced such visions, as described in the Zohar in several places. Rabbi Ḥiyya, too, saw Rabbi Shimon after his passing, as mentioned at the beginning of the Genesis portion. Similarly, Rabbi Perachiah saw visions, as recounted in the Midrash on Ruth, and Rabbi Ila’i had such encounters in the Balak portion, among many other examples.
This is the secret of the “soul-to-soul connection,” which is granted only to those living in this world who can bind their soul, even while in physical form, to the soul of the righteous. This connection is made by pouring out one’s soul at the grave of the righteous, merging one’s soul with theirs, conversing with the soul of the righteous, and informing them. The soul of the righteous then awakens other souls. This phenomenon has been confirmed in our own time, and true reports testify about Rabbi Isaac Luria (the Arizal) and his disciples, who achieved this connection. And this is as was explained above.

Nahar 25

River 25 - Concerning the Connection with the Righteous and Prostration at Their Graves:
To connect one’s spirit to the spirit and soul of the righteous, one must purify themselves greatly, sanctify themselves to an extraordinary degree, and experience immense joy by witnessing the Divine beauty of God, gaining insight into the path where divine light dwells in all one’s actions. The righteous will then reveal true insights to them, so they do not err in their pursuits, provided they conduct themselves with holiness, humility, fear of sin, and keep God’s holy and awe-inspiring name before them always, uniting the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Presence through awe and love, connecting the letters Vav and He through Yud and He. There is no doubt that one should not think that the righteous, upon their passing and as they rest in the earth, are removed from service and union with God, Heaven forbid. Rather, they continuously unite in the secret of their soul, spirit, and nefesh (soul aspect), which ascend above and unite Wisdom with Understanding in the mystery of their soul; Tiferet with Malchut in the mystery of their spirit; and produce “feminine waters” in the mystery of their soul. Especially at midnight, God delights in the spirit of the righteous in the Garden of Eden, as explained in the Zohar. Additionally, they continually unite in the Garden of Eden, generating souls for proselytes, as discussed in the portion of Shelach Lecha. Furthermore, while the righteous were alive, their service and spiritual unifications constantly renewed and grew stronger, adding boundless light in the realm of Atzilut (the world of Emanation) each day, illuminating more than the day before. Even after their passing, they continue to make these unifications as they did in life, and they also pray for the living. As it says regarding the patriarchs of the world, they would pray on the new moon, as discussed in the Talmud (Bava Metzia) and in the Zohar on the portion of Shemot. Were it not for the prayers of the deceased, the living would not be able to endure.
Here's the translation of the passage:
---
**Translation:**
And after introducing that the righteous continually serve and unify through the secret of their spirit, soul, and higher soul (*nefesh*, *ruach*, and *neshamah*) in the upper worlds, when a person performs the unification, they should intend to align each unification according to what corresponds to their connection: soul to soul, spirit to spirit, and higher soul to higher soul. They should focus on attaching their own *nefesh*, *ruach*, and *neshamah* to those of the righteous one during the act of unification. Then, without doubt, their soul will connect with the righteous soul, and they will merit knowing everything they seek. 
This process requires deep concentration, where one clears their thoughts entirely and, so to speak, sets aside their physical self from their soul, lest they endanger their life, Heaven forbid. Know that if a person merits the levels of soul, spirit, and higher soul — and further, *neshamah* to *neshamah* — they will connect fully with that righteous individual and attain a profound and wondrous understanding. But if they have only reached three levels, or if they have not attained all three, then their perception will be diminished accordingly. And according to the level of their righteousness, so will their attainment and connection grow.
May the Almighty reveal wonders from His Torah, and may He bring us closer to His service, reverence, and love — Amen, may it be so forever and ever.
And know that, although it says in the *Zohar* that the soul (*nefesh*) of the righteous is in the grave, their spirit (*ruach*) in the Garden of Eden, and their higher soul (*neshamah*) by the Divine Throne, this applies to one who has only attained *nefesh*, *ruach*, and *neshamah* in the realms of *Beriah*, *Yetzirah*, and *Asiyah*. But for one who has merited *nefesh*, *ruach*, and *neshamah* from the world of *Atzilut*, there is no doubt that their soul rises to *Malchut*, their spirit to *Tiferet*, and their higher soul to *Binah*, for everything returns to its root, as is known.
These are the words of the Rabbi Yitzchak Ashkenazi (the Arizal) on this matter.

Nahar 26


The reason for the knowledge of the holy souls regarding future events is that the soul is naturally suited to know everything that exists and will be. Do not be surprised at the soul’s capacity for knowledge, for even spirits (*shedim*) know what occurs in the farthest reaches of the earth, as they are somewhat spiritual, and for this reason, people consult them. However, they are not always accurate because they deceive and mock humans, as their nature is rooted in falsehood and external forces. Just as a physical person can sense what occurs within their entire body at once, so too a spiritual being can perceive the entire reality all at once, as nothing impedes them. Similarly, the spiritual soul, flowing from the higher source of spirituality, resembles the upper intellect that illuminates all and knows every detail of existence — both the fixed and the accidental — much like the mind knows what will happen to the body. Thus, the soul that is connected to the spiritual intellect, which illuminates all, knows all the particulars of existence. In principle, all souls are suited to attain this knowledge. However, because they are clothed in material form, this materiality becomes a dividing veil that darkens the sight of their intellect, allowing them only to perceive this body, their dwelling place.
The righteous, whose souls are not confined by their physical forms but are rather connected to the higher spirituality, constantly know all details of existence due to their souls’ spiritual nature, drawing from the upper source. The spirits (shedim) draw their knowledge from the external spirituality of the world of Asiyah (Action), and they know all of existence in an instant. The angels, who draw from Yetzirah (Formation), their world of being, know everything that occurs below them.
Thus, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, Rabbi Elazar, and other holy ones were able to perceive all of reality with the vision of their souls because their souls were bound to the higher spirituality. In this way, the entire world was like a body to them, and their soul was attached to the intellect that governs all, knowing everything.

Nahar 27

...The matter of Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair’s donkey is indeed puzzling. Is an animal subject to punishment? From the *Zohar*, it appears that they punished the animal for standing in an impure place, as well as other behaviors mentioned there. However, this teaches us about the secret of *gilgul* (reincarnation). Due to the consequence of “being cut off,” a soul may be punished in this way by being clothed in an animal—sometimes impure, sometimes pure, sometimes a bird, and in all living beings, depending on the sin. The soul is placed there until its sin is atoned. Sometimes, this is insufficient, and it may be decreed that the soul itself dies. If it is pleasing to the Creator, it may reincarnate into an animal used for a sacrificial offering. If not, it may be placed in an animal for food; if further removed, as carrion for dogs; or otherwise, into a camel or donkey; or, in the most severe case, to die harshly, even within an animal like a donkey or dog—each according to its circumstance. This was the case with Rabbi Pinchas’s donkey, in which a soul had merited some purification and received punishments suited to it. The soul clothed within an animal perceives and experiences like a spirit (*shed*) because it is not bound to the animal's body as closely as a human soul is to a human body. This phenomenon is called *gilgul* (reincarnation) and *ibur* (temporary possession). In humans, it reincarnates fully, while in animals, it temporarily possesses (*ibur*) and remains partially detached from the material form, experiencing profound suffering beyond human understanding.
The divine Arizal, of blessed memory, wrote the following:
Behold, Adam HaRishon had within him clarified levels of souls until he sinned, at which point they fell back down. Furthermore, when he gave names to all the animals and beasts, we do not find that he assigned names to the inanimate (domem) or plant (tzomeach) kingdoms. The reason is that he refined and elevated all the aspects of the animals and rectified them, and this is the meaning of "naming" them. However, regarding the inanimate and plant kingdoms, he did not complete their rectification, and therefore, eating meat was forbidden to him. He was only permitted to eat vegetation. The rationale behind eating is to refine the sparks of holiness that exist within a living creature or inanimate substance, as they are, and these sparks are refined and elevated through eating. Since Adam HaRishon had already refined these sparks within the animals, their consumption was forbidden to him because their rectification was already achieved to the extent necessary for them.
Even though when Adam HaRishon ate from the Tree of Knowledge, all living beings also sinned by eating from it and became corrupted, nevertheless, through the offering Adam sacrificed, they were rectified again — something that did not occur for the inanimate kingdom.

River 30 – On the superiority of the righteous over angels
...To understand this, one must know how all existences, in the heavens and on earth, are emanated from a lofty source. For this reason, it is forbidden to speak negatively about anything. The matter is as follows: Above, there exist the roots of the four elements, which are: Chesed (Kindness), corresponding to the element of water; Gevurah (Might), corresponding to the element of fire; Tiferet (Beauty), corresponding to the element of air; and Malchut (Kingship), corresponding to the element of earth. These roots are united in true unity.  These upper, subtle elements descended from their place, step by step, from cause to effect: from Atzilut (Emanation) to Beriah (Creation), from Beriah to Yetzirah (Formation), and from Yetzirah to Asiyah (Action). Within each of these four levels, there are also subdivisions of the four worlds (ABiYA: Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah). For example, in Atzilut, there are levels of ABiYA, but all remain within Atzilut. In Beriah, there are levels of ABiYA, but all remain within Beriah, and so on across all levels. An analogy can be drawn to a silversmith who divides silver into four types: perfectly pure silver, silver that is pure but not as refined as the first, silver that is half impure, and silver that is mostly impure. Inevitably, each type contains some mixture resembling the others. This is how the levels of ABiYA function. The Asiyah within Atzilut is subtler than the Atzilut within Beriah, and the Asiyah within Beriah is subtler than the Atzilut within Yetzirah, and so on.  Through the descent of the four elements across these four levels, all worlds were drawn forth—from the Sefirot to the Thrones, from the Thrones to the Heichalot (sanctuaries), from the Heichalot to the Klipot (husks), from the Klipot to the heavens and constellations, and from there to the coarse, dense elements visible to us. 
Thus, Atzilut serves as the root for Beriah, Beriah serves as the root for Yetzirah, and Yetzirah serves as the root for Asiyah. Consequently, this world draws from the Klipot, which include the seventy external ministering forces that mediate between the constellations and the holy angels. These ministers draw from the holy angels, who are at the level of the Heichalot in Yetzirah. The Heichalot draw from the Thrones, the Thrones from the Sefirot, and the Sefirot from the infinite essence of the Divine (Ein Sof) that extends and illuminates them. From this, we see that the four elements present in the heavens, though spiritual, are fundamentally the same four elements found in Yetzirah, and so on up to the highest realms. However, due to the chain-like descent, they become denser as they grow more distant from their source. As they descend, they reveal themselves and become coarser and more tangible.  Therefore, nothing in the world is devoid of spiritual influence from above. However, the influence becomes denser and more materialized as it descends from its lofty origins to the lower levels. Consequently, there is nothing in this world that does not contain a spiritual essence corresponding to its material form and the degree of its distance from its source.
When coarse matter is elevated to the proximity of more refined matter, the superior quality of the refined matter illuminates within it. This can be compared to a lamp burning in the middle of a large palace: objects located at the corners of the palace do not receive the same illumination as those near the lamp. The closer an object is brought to the lamp, the brighter it becomes. In the same way, this applies to the vegetative soul. When the four elements combine and mix through the planting of a seed of its kind, the material takes on a specific form, producing grass or a tree. By assuming this superior form, the elements ascend to a higher level and draw closer to the supernal light. What was previously under the dominion of angels overseeing the elements now exits their domain and begins to draw from a higher light through the angel appointed over that particular plant. As the sages said: "There is no blade of grass on earth without an angel above it striking it and saying, 'Grow!'" The "striking" refers to the illumination and impact of the supernal light on the plant through the angel, which serves as a conduit for the concealed light within the mystery of the world of Formation (Yetzirah) and the angelic realm. The angel illuminates the plant through the specific star associated with it, as stars belong to the world of Action (Asiyah) and act as servants to the forces of Formation. 
Thus, sometimes the growth of plants is attributed to the angel and sometimes to the star, but both explanations refer to the same process. Similarly, this process applies to the animal soul. When the four elements combine and take on the form of a living being, their composition becomes more refined than before, ascending to a higher level closer to the supernal light. What was previously under the dominion of the angels overseeing plants now exits their domain and begins to draw from a higher light through the angel appointed over that particular living being. The light flowing into it becomes its soul, but it possesses no additional spirit or soul beyond its vital, animating force. In truth, this is not a soul in the fullest sense. Upon the death and destruction of the animal, its elements separate, and it becomes distanced from the supernal light it had acquired through its form. It has no spirit or soul that ascends or descends, as it existed merely like a fly flying through the air. When it approaches the lamp, the light illuminates it, and this light is called its vitality. When it moves away to the far corners of the palace, the light is extinguished due to the distance, signifying its death. It has no soul that returns upward to its source. This is the meaning of the verse, "And the soul of the beast descends downward to the earth," meaning it returns to its original source—the element of earth—and remains as it was at the beginning.
In a similar manner is the form of a person created through the combinations of the letters of the alphabet in Sefer Yetzirah. Such a person would not possess a spirit (ruach) or soul (neshama), only basic vitality akin to the life-force of an animal. However, its vitality is superior to that of an animal due to the refinement of its form, which is more elevated than the form of an animal and closer to the source of the supernal light. Yet, it would not have a ruach or neshama. Therefore, when such a being perishes and is gathered back, its components simply return to the elements, much like the death of an animal, whose parts disintegrate, and its dust returns to the earth as it was. Thus, there is no prohibition or concern regarding the killing of an animal or such a human, as there is no harm to any ruach or neshama, only the return of the elemental parts to their source. 
Similarly, regarding the vitality of a human born naturally: when the four elements are combined through the power of the seed and take on the form of a person, the refinement and elevated nature of this form bring it very close to the supernal light. As a result, it begins to draw sustenance and light from the highest levels. This light serves as its living soul (nefesh chayah). Through this vitality, the person can later be imbued with a higher ruach and neshama. For this reason, it is prohibited to destroy the form of a human being.

Similarly, the nature of the angel is as follows: When the four elements of the spiritual worlds above in the heichalot (palaces) of the level of Yetzirah are gathered, they are shaped into a more refined and exalted form than that of a human being. By taking on this exalted form, the angel draws closer to a more elevated light and flow of divine energy than what it previously received. This light will serve as its vitality and soul, with nothing else attached to it.Now, from the perspective of the elements, the angel's level is higher than that of a human. This is because the human being is composed of a mixture of the coarser, darker elements, while angels are composed of the finer, more spiritual, and radiant elements. Therefore, the nature of the angel is more exalted than that of the human. However, in the regard that the angel's function is only to channel pure light, as it does with all created beings, the human being is different. In addition to the light shining through the combination of the elements, the human also receives a higher and purer ruach and neshama, a portion of the divine above. Thus, in this respect, the human's level is higher than that of the angel. When a person elevates his soul above his physical elements, his soul will shine with an even more exalted light than the angel’s light. The soul of the human is composed of the four worlds (Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah, and Assiyah), and it does not need to receive its light through any intermediary level; rather, it shines and draws its light directly from the source of its soul. Moreover, even the angels and all the worlds will draw light and blessing through the righteous person. Additionally, through the human being, all things are uplifted to the light of life and can draw energy and light from the divine presence. Therefore, as long as the righteous person maintains his soul in its pure and elevated state, it will not be under the dominion of the angels, because the level of his soul is above them, and from him will be the source of the flow to them. He has the ability to change the natural order and the celestial spheres. However, if a person strays from the path of the Torah, his soul and the light from above will withdraw from him, and he will fall under the dominion of the angels of the world of Yetzirah, who will judge, punish, and decree upon him.

And with what we have explained, there is room for doubt as to what Chanoch and Eliyahu gained by becoming angels. As we have mentioned, they descended from their elevated status, for if they had remained at the level of the righteous, they would be above the world of Yetzirah, the realm of the angels. It can be explained that the soul of Chanoch ascended to the place of souls, in the secret of the Gan Eden above, just like all the other righteous ones, and his status did not diminish at all. Rather, his spirit, which had been standing in the lower Gan Eden like the other righteous souls who do not ascend further, was granted the merit to elevate his spirit and become an angel, the chief of the angels, to become a vessel for receiving the flow of energy descending from the Divine Throne, in order to distribute and share it with all the other angels and worlds below. Moreover, his physical body was transformed into fiery flames, as mentioned in the Heichalot books, which is not the case for the other righteous, whose bodies decay into dust, and their souls are clothed in another garment that resembles their physical form. In that garment, they remain in the lower Gan Eden. However, Chanoch’s body and soul were both transformed into a spiritual form and ascended to become a permanent angel, and his soul ascended to its place. A similar process also occurred with Eliyahu, although his case was not exactly the same as Chanoch's. While Chanoch's spirit and physical body both ascended, his body transformed into fiery flames, as described. In contrast, Eliyahu's spirit expanded from his body and clothed itself in a different garment before ascending. His original body was concealed in the storm, and when he descends again for missions, he is clothed in that garment and appears to people in that form, as mentioned in the Zohar in the parsha of Vayakhel, in the verse "Who has ascended to heaven and descended."
...And after it has been explained that the virtue of Chanoch (Enoch) and Eliyahu (Elijah) is greater than that of other righteous individuals, as mentioned, there arises a question as to why the Patriarchs of the world did not merit this level. One could answer that the virtue of the Patriarchs was even greater, for they were a chariot (Merkavah) to the Divine Presence (Shechinah) and to the essence of the Sefirot, as mentioned in the Zohar. This is a higher level than that of the angels and is known as the "virtue of the chariot." Their souls were a chariot and a sanctuary for the Divine Presence, united with an essence of the Sefirot itself, such that it became a pool and source of the abundance that flows from that Sefirah. Through them, this abundance was drawn and transmitted to all the angels and lower worlds, as their souls served as a conduit for the outflow of Divine abundance from the Shechinah to all worlds. As long as such a righteous individual exists on earth, the Shechinah does not manifest through Metatron in the same way. It appears that this is preferable to the chariot of Metatron. This level is attainable by someone worthy, whether during their lifetime or after their death, and it is the highest possible level—the level of the Patriarchs.







Thus, we now find that in this matter there are four levels: The lowest level is that of the angels, who are conduits through which the supernal light manifests and shines as a distant light from its source. A level greater than the first is that of the righteous individuals, who are conduits for the supernal light, with Tiferet extending into them, for the souls themselves are an extension of Tiferet. The third level is that of Chanoch and Eliyahu, as mentioned.The fourth and highest level is that of the Patriarchs and others like them, who served as a chariot for the Sefirot, as explained above.

**River 31 - To Explain the Analogy Between an Ignorant Person and a Torah Scholar:**  
The matter is as follows: There are people who are like earthenware vessels, who, due to their sins, intensify the element of earth within them and contaminate the air within themselves. The evil inclination inside them pollutes their inner atmosphere, making them susceptible to impurity—these are the "ignorant people" (*amei ha'aretz*).  
There are others who are only susceptible to impurity externally; these are the Torah scholars (*talmidei chachamim*), whose inner sanctum is holy and dedicated to the Divine. Even if they occasionally sin, their repentance rectifies them. However, regarding the *amei ha'aretz*, it is said, "A boor cannot fear sin, and an ignoramus cannot be pious," and their "breaking"—meaning their death—is what purifies them.  
The Godly Rabbi Isaac Arama (of blessed memory) wrote: Know that there are 613 sparks (*nitzotzot*), and all of them are Torah scholars. After these sparks, there are numerous others who are the *amei ha'aretz*, comparable to a tree that produces fruit surrounded by many other trees and branches. And this explains the matter as stated.

Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (may peace be upon him) entered the realm of souls, reaching that refined spiritual level through his piety. There, he studied Torah with the soul of the *Ra'aya Meheimna* (the Faithful Shepherd, referring to Moses). In that realm, the *Ra'aya Meheimna* composed teachings for the needs of the generation, as mentioned in the *Tikkunim*.  
Even now, the *Ra'aya Meheimna* radiates within the 600,000 sparks of Moses' soul. His soul bears the suffering of the holy people of Israel, who are unable to flourish and multiply in their Torah study due to the poverty and afflictions of exile. This aligns with the verse, "He was wounded for our transgressions..."—through the sins of Torah scholars, the Holy One, Blessed Be He, decrees upon them the tribulations of poverty in exile.  
Thus, the soul of Moses, our teacher (may peace be upon him), suffers due to the consequences of our sins and transgressions. His sparks, reincarnations, and radiance manifest among the righteous of Israel, who serve as vessels for the presence of his soul. However, the other people, those who are ignorant, harsh, and brazen, are external sparks cast among Israel by the wicked *Lilith*. These individuals are brazen-faced and strong-armed, causing harm and acting cruelly toward Torah scholars.  
Concerning this, Moses, our teacher, alluded when he said, "And He assigned the wicked to their graves." This means that Moses' radiance shines among the righteous, who dwell amidst the other wicked, brazen individuals of the generation. It is as though Moses, our teacher, is buried among the wicked.  
And this clarifies the matter.

**Nahar 33 - To Explain That a Living Person Is Planted, and in Death Uprooted, and the Concept of Union:**
The idea is that as long as a person is not planted in this earth, they cannot produce fruits. For a person is like a tree, whose roots are planted in this material soil, and its branches produce fruits above. This is the secret of the representations they have in the higher *sefirot*, so that their deeds create unifications above. These deeds are the fruits borne in the *sefirot*, and their unifications bring forth lights and spiritual influences. Thus, as long as a person is not planted in this earth, they cannot produce fruits. Even if they perform all the good deeds in the world, these acts will not yield fruits unless they are planted in this material realm. Therefore, the souls—whether before they are clothed in earthly bodies, or those that were in the earth and have departed from it—all continuously perform service in Gan Eden. However, they do not receive their true reward from this. On the contrary, the good they experience is the result of the efforts they made in this world. Their actual reward exists solely for the toil they exerted while in this world.
The reason is that all reward is based on resisting the temptations of the evil inclination, which entices a person in this world, and not succumbing to it. Furthermore, when a person is clothed in a physical body made of the four material, earthly elements, they encompass all levels of existence, from the highest to the lowest. For all levels are included within a person, arranged in order, down to the lowest level. A person can only encompass all these levels, from top to bottom, when they are planted in this earthly realm. A person is like a tree whose roots are planted in this soil, and its branches bear fruits in the *sefirot*. This planting in the earth (referenced twice with "this earth") aligns with the secret of "two faces" (*du partzufim*), meaning when a person takes a wife. This is the true planting, and their fruits succeed, creating a spiritual unification. Therefore, it is good for a person to marry at the age of thirteen, as that is when their fruits begin and are immediately complete. For the fruits of one who has no wife are almost insubstantial. The planting without a wife produces fruits that are neither proper, nor complete, nor mature; instead, they are like unripe, fallen fruit (*novlot*). As long as one has not reached the state of male and female together, they have not completed their nature to bear proper fruits. This concept is explained in the portion of *Vayikra*. And this is what was previously discussed.

Nahar 34

**River 34 – To Explain What Our Sages Meant by "A Soul that Sins Before Entering the World":**  
This concept, described in the Zohar (Parashat Acharei Mot and Shir HaShirim), refers to the idea that a soul can err even before descending into the physical world. It is a difficult notion to grasp since there is no evil inclination (yetzer hara) in the spiritual realm, so how can sin or transgression be possible? Moreover, how can there be distancing from the Shechinah (Divine Presence) or attraction to the forces of impurity (klipot) surrounding Gan Eden, as it is written: *“The wicked walk in circles”* (Psalms 12:9)? This is analogous to sins committed in this lower world, where a person leaves their holy "Father and Mother" (Divine origins) and cleaves to a "wife of harlotry."  
### Explanation:
After souls are emanated, they do not immediately descend to the lower world. Instead, they remain in the presence of the Holy One, blessed be He, engaging in Torah study and spiritual preparation according to their capacity in that realm. They are not permitted to descend to this material world until they are granted permission by their Creator.  
However, some souls "rebel" against their Maker. They wish to descend to the physical world prematurely, before their appointed time, and "force the moment" (*dochkin et hasha’ah*). This rebellion is fueled by external forces (the klipot) that seek to entice these souls by urging them to descend prematurely and partake of the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." In this context, this means being drawn toward material desires and the physical aspects of the world.  
### The "Sin" of These Souls:
The sin lies in their impatience and eagerness to descend to this world before they have completed their spiritual maturation and preparation in the upper realms. This premature descent reflects their inclination toward the klipot and worldly materiality.  
When these souls ultimately do descend, they bring their improper tendencies with them. As they were in the spiritual realm, so too are they in the material one. Such souls often come into the world through sinful or impure means, such as acts of immorality, and are born into spiritually compromised circumstances—whether as illegitimate children (*mamzerim*) or from relationships involving impurity (e.g., children of *nidah*). These children, tainted by impurity, are more likely to lean toward negative traits and behaviors.  
### Divine Oversight:
Nevertheless, this process occurs under the providence of the Creator, who allows such souls to enter the world for a purpose. As it is written, *“The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them”* (Genesis 3:21). These "garments of skin" symbolize the impure and material body, akin to the serpent's skin, which serves as the vehicle for the soul’s journey through the trials of this world.  
This is the deeper meaning of the matter.

Nahar 35

**River 35 – To Explain the Mystery of Spiritual Damage (Pgam):**
The matter is as follows: just as there are "delicacies" that Jacob prepared for his father (Isaac), representing good deeds and righteous actions that ascend to the Divine, there are also "bitter delicacies" that God abhors—these are the sins and corrupted deeds performed by those dwelling below. Such actions do not ascend through the holy "forces of grinding, swallowing, and digestion" (symbolized by the esophagus, stomach, and digestive system, which correspond to sacred processes of refining deeds). Instead, they pass through unholy forces, namely Samael and his legions.  These unholy forces "cook," "prepare," and derive pleasure from the sinful deeds committed below, becoming bound to those actions. This is the meaning of what we say in the confessional prayer (*viduy*): "We have clung to falsehood and deceit." "Deceit" refers to Lilith, while "falsehood" refers to Samael. Through sinful actions, these forces attach themselves and bind to the sinner.  After binding to a sin, these forces produce a "smoke" that rises and obscures the "eyes of the upper realms." This is akin to the bitterness that Esau brought to Isaac and Rebecca, as it is written: *"And they were a source of bitterness to Isaac and Rebecca"* (Genesis 26:35), and further: *"His eyes grew dim, so he could not see"* (Genesis 27:1). These bitter "delicacies" create a spiritual "smoke" that clouds the higher realms, the exact opposite of the "pleasing aroma" of righteous deeds, which brings satisfaction to the Divine spirit.  This bitterness corresponds to harsh judgment (*din kasheh*) awakened by sinful actions. Judgment then flows downward to the external forces (*chitzonim*) to empower them. This harsh judgment grants permission to act in the lower world, resulting in harm and punishment, as described: *"Behold, smoke has risen in My nostrils, a fire burning all day"* (Isaiah 65:5). This is what stirs the anger of God, the antithesis of spiritual rest and satisfaction.# Just as the right side of holiness awakens goodness, descending to the lower realms as blessings, abundance, wisdom, children, wealth, knowledge, honor, life, and all other good occurrences, so too does the left side awaken judgment. This judgment descends into the lower realms as illnesses, suffering, harsh occurrences, and bitterness worse than death.  Ultimately, *“this corresponds to that”* (Ecclesiastes 7:14): the forces of holiness and impurity are parallel opposites. Each action awakens its corresponding spiritual reality, for better or worse. This duality defines the spiritual interplay between righteousness and sin.
Know that when a person sins and becomes entrenched in the mire of their corrupted deeds, their *nefesh* (soul on the level of vitality and basic life force) is severed and lost. However, their *ruach* (spirit) and *neshamah* (higher soul) are never utterly destroyed or completely severed. Nevertheless, even the *neshamah* becomes tainted and damaged.  The impurity of the *neshamah* arises because, as it is emanated through the divine levels and descends, it leaves traces of its existence at each stage of its journey, step by step, until it reaches the physical body in this world. This process creates a chain-like descent, resembling a ladder standing on the ground with its head reaching the heavens.  Thus, even though the *neshamah* withdraws from the sinful body, it remains connected to it through the chain of descent and is inevitably damaged. This damage occurs because just as the spiritual levels draw pure and holy influence downward, they also draw impurity from sin when connected to defilement. Just as one who sanctifies themselves and straightens their ways draws holy influence upon their *neshamah* from above, one who corrupts their ways and defiles themselves from below brings impurity to their *neshamah* from above. This leads to a connection with the *klipot* (spiritual husks or shells of impurity). The severity of the sin determines the degree of impurity that attaches to the *neshamah*, and this impurity then flows back into the physical body.  This defilement becomes a stain and blemish upon the *neshamah*, which cannot be removed except through *teshuvah* (repentance), as will be explained. When a person repents and humbles themselves to the same degree that they had been immersed in the *klipot*, they break the hold of those *klipot* and their *neshamah* returns to its holy place.
The intention here is not that the **klipah** literally enters the realm of holiness, God forbid, but rather that it makes a legal claim, declaring: "This soul belongs to me." As a result, the **neshamah** and its corresponding place in the higher realms are damaged, and the **neshamah** becomes entangled with the **klipah**.  However, this does not mean the **neshamah** is uprooted from its place and wholly immersed in the **klipah**, God forbid. Instead, it means the **neshamah** becomes a conduit for the flow of influence from the side of **gevurah** (strict judgment, associated with the left side) to the **klipah**. Through the **neshamah**, influence is drawn downward, feeding the **klipah** and sustaining it through the holy source connected to the person's soul. This influence extends from the person's spiritual source in the higher realms to all the sacred levels in which the **neshamah** is rooted. The bitterness of the left-side flow affects these levels and brings negative influence to the corresponding places of the **neshamah**. There is no greater blemish than this, for it forces the holy attributes to draw sustenance from the left side and channel it to the **klipah** via the person’s soul.
Just as when a person performs good deeds, they bring positive influence (shefa) into the world, leaving a portion of this influence for themselves as a "garment" of light to clothe their neshamah (soul), so too, the negative influence produced by a sinner who empowers the klipot (husks of impurity) remains with them. From this, a defiled garment is formed for the neshamah to wear upon its departure from the world. Explanation of the Verse: “But to the wicked, God says: What right have you to recount My statutes?”  Since the wicked person is entangled within the realm of the klipot, when they study Torah, the energy they generate flows into the klipot. The klipah then makes a claim, saying, “This person’s prayer is from our domain,” and it takes the influence derived from their actions. This is the secret of the verse, “A maidservant who inherits her mistress”—an inversion where impurity usurps holiness. The Power of Teshuvah (Repentance):  Nevertheless, through the power of teshuvah (repentance), all damage can be repaired, restoring things to an even better state than before. Through repentance, a person subdues and shatters the power of the klipah, reclaiming all the influence that had been taken due to their sins. This reclaimed influence ascends as a reiach nichoach (pleasing fragrance) to God, and even their sins are transformed into merits, as explained elsewhere with Divine assistance. And so it is written. Zeh me’she’amru l’ma’alah. ("This is what was explained above.")

Nahar 36

River 36 – To Explain How the Sin and Its Damage Can Be Perceived and Recognized Through the Pulse:
The matter is as follows: The secret of the pulse (דפק) lies in the extension of the life-force of the Infinite One, Blessed Be He (Ein Sof), within all of Ze’ir Anpin (the partzuf representing divine emotions) and its manifestation within wisdom (chochmah), as expressed in the verse, "You made them all with wisdom" (Psalms 104:24).  This means that the vital force that beats within the veins is the spirit of the Infinite, and the pulse itself represents wisdom, which serves as a vessel for the life-force of Ein Sof. Since this energy spreads through the body only in a diminished, "backward-facing" manner, it is called *dafeq* (pulse), corresponding to the back (achorayim) of the Name of 72 (Shem Ayin-Bet), which has a numerical value of 184 (קפ"ד).  Know that the degree to which there is sin or transgression determines the extent to which the divine light is diminished from that place. The specific sin or damage is recognized according to the dominant characteristic of the pulse, as this reflects the area where the blemish lies. This relates to the verse: "You gather their spirit, and they expire" (Psalms 104:29).
The concept refers to the ten types of pulsations (d'fika) mentioned in the Tikkunim (Kabbalistic texts), corresponding to different vowel points: Tzeirei, Segol, etc. For example:
If you place your hand on the pulse, you might feel it beat once, then again in a manner resembling two points, akin to Tzeirei.
Sometimes, one beat occurs above another, resembling Sh'va.
Occasionally, the first beat is elongated while the second is a single point, resembling Kamatz.
This phenomenon reflects the particular form of vitality emanating from wisdom (Chochmah) at that time. For instance:
If the pulse feels like Kamatz, it signifies the dominance of the crown (Keter) within Chochmah, radiating energy and life to all limbs.
A Patach-like beat indicates vitality stemming from Chochmah within Chochmah, and so forth for other vowel points.
Sometimes two beats may appear together, forming patterns like Sh'va, Tzeirei, and others.
This understanding also reveals a person's sin or spiritual flaw. For instance:
A pulse resembling Kamatz could indicate a sin in Keter, as its dominance may signify an effort to prevent its energy from being removed due to the transgression.
On the contrary, it may also indicate a mitzvah (commandment) performed in that realm.
However, the deeper implications remain concealed, as only divine wisdom knows the full meaning of these signs.

Nahar 37

**River 37 – To explain the secret of confession (Viduy):**
The concept is that when a person sins, they cause damage above, creating a blemish of judgment and darkness. This blemish attaches itself to the location of the transgression, according to the measure of the sinner's misdeed and its intensity. However, when the sinner confesses their sin, along with the sins of all of Israel, they bring about a purification of the higher attributes, cleansing them of this blemish.Through this act of confession, a specific flow descends from above, removing and cleansing the blemish. This is the meaning of "bearing iniquity and passing over transgression"—a reference to the purifying waters washing away the defilement. As it is written, *"When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from within her midst..."* (Isaiah 4:4). These discarded impurities become sustenance for the external forces (the *klipot*) Thus, it is necessary to confess during prayer, particularly in the blessing of *Shomea Tefilah* ("He who hears prayers"). One should direct their intention to arouse the purifying waters from above, to cleanse all the sins and blemishes affecting the higher attributes and to cause the resulting energy to flow downward. This process will cast out and purify all imperfections. The confession is structured using the *Aleph-Bet* (the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet) to purify each of the 22 letters of the Torah that have been blemished. The Zohar (in *Parashat Pekudei*, Heichal 7) explains this concept: Through this prayer and confession, a portion is allocated to the *other side* (*sitra achra*) to sustain it. This refers to all the sins and transgressions confessed, which are handed over to the *klipot* as sustenance, as in the verse, *"You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea"* (Micah 7:19). These are the external forces that receive the remnants and waste as their portion.
And I say that when a person confesses and concludes with the words, *"But You are righteous concerning all that has come upon me" (Nehemiah 9:33)*, they thereby accept their suffering and acknowledge the justice of Heaven's decrees. 
There are sins for which repentance suspends judgment, but suffering brings atonement. Therefore, when the scapegoat "bears all their iniquities to a desolate land" (Leviticus 16:22), it is as if the sinner declares, "Exact payment from me through such-and-such suffering." They accept this with joy, understanding it as the force of judgment purifying them for their wrongdoing, under the rulings of the Heavenly Court.
However, if the sinner does not confess, they do not submit themselves fully to the Heavenly Court. Consequently, no punishment is decreed, as suffering cannot bring atonement without confession. This aligns with the principle: *"One who comes to purify themselves is assisted" (Shabbat 104a).* Through confession and repentance, one initiates their purification. The suffering they endure serves as assistance, drawing them closer to purity and reconciliation.
This is the explanation of the matter.

Nahar 38

...**River 38 – The Mystery of Confession**
Know that sin is compared to a rope of two threads, transgression to a rope of eight threads, and rebellion to a rope of twenty threads. This is in the secret of *bosha* (shame), *cherpa* (disgrace), and *kelima* (humiliation), whose initials correspond to *Keter*, *Chokhmah*, and *Binah* (the upper sefirot).
Understand that atonement applies to sins (*chata’im*), forgiveness to transgressions (*avonot*), and pardon to rebellions (*pesha’im*). The proper order of confession is as follows: 
"I am ashamed of my sins (*chata’im*), disgraced by my transgressions (*avonot*), and humiliated by my rebellions (*pesha’im*). Please, Hashem, atone for my sins, forgive my transgressions, and pardon all my rebellions. For I have sinned, transgressed, and rebelled—both I and my household, with the sins, transgressions, and rebellions that Your people Israel have committed."
Know that someone who commits a sin unintentionally (*chata*) four times consecutively turns it into a transgression (*avon*), which requires forgiveness. If they commit it ten times, it becomes rebellion (*pesha*), which requires pardon. Similarly, if someone commits a transgression (*avon*) willfully, it requires forgiveness. If they repeat it three times, it becomes rebellion (*pesha*) in a borrowed sense, requiring pardon.
This is the explanation. May it be written for your merit.

Know that one who does not adhere to the simple meaning (*Peshat*) of Scripture damages the *Tiferet* of *Asiyah* (Action). One who does not bring evidence to support their understanding damages the *Tiferet* of *Yetzirah* (Formation). One who disregards the *Drash* (homiletic interpretation) of the Torah damages the *Tiferet* of *Beriah* (Creation). And one who neglects the *Sod* (mystical teachings) of the Torah damages the *Tiferet* of *Atzilut* (Emanation).  
The mnemonic for this is *Pardes* (the orchard), representing the four levels of Torah interpretation: *Peshat*, *Remez* (hint), *Drash*, and *Sod*. One who merits to delve deeply into all of these levels attains the highest of spiritual elevations.

You should know that Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, was born in Jacob's ninetieth year and her brother, Joseph, was born in his ninety-first year. And when Dinah was seven years old, she become pregnant from Shekhem, the son of Chamor; and she gave birth to Osnat when she was eight. And when she was nine, she married her brother, Simeon and gave birth to Saul, the son of the Canaanite. And when Dinah was forty, she went down to Egypt, and Joseph was thirty-nine year old. And when Jacob died, Joseph was fifty-six years old and Dinah was fifty-seven years old. And two years after the death of Jacob, Dinah married Job. She was fifty-nine years old and he was eighteen years old. It comes out that Job was born when Dinah was forty-one, and that year was the second year after she had gone down to Egypt. 
And you should know that Abraham and Nahor were brothers, and Isaac the son of Abraham and Utz the first born of Nahor were [cousins]. And Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, married Job, the grandson of Utz. And [about] that which is written, <i>There was a man in the land of Utz</i> (Job 1:1), you should know that Utz, the first born of Nahor, built a city close to the shore of Tiberias for himself, and he named the city after himself. And the translator [in the Targum] called this city, Armenia, and that is the first Constantinople. And Job was born in the land of Utz, which is Armenia, which is called Constantinople. Job was born in the second year that Dinah went down to Egypt. And when Job was eighteen years old, he was a prophet, a righteous man, and from the pious men of the nations of the world. And he went down to Egypt and married Dinah, his relative. And Dinah was also a prophetess, so she also knew that he was her relative. She also knew that he was born circumcised, and that is why he was called, unblemished. And that is why she was was willing to marry Job. Yet with all of this, if Jacob had been alive, she would not have married Job, even though he was a prophet, a pious man, and born circumcised. With all of this, he was still called uncircumcised, since he did not remove a drop of blood in order to convert. For Balaam was also born circumcised and [still] called uncircumcised.

...**Translation:**
**Nahor 55 – To Explain the Blemish of Adam HaRishon at the Time of His Sin:**
Know that Adam HaRishon possessed a *nefesh* (soul), *ruach* (spirit), and *neshamah* (higher soul) from the realms of Beriah, Yetzirah, and Assiah (BYA). Beyond these, he had a *nefesh*, *ruach*, and *neshamah* from the world of Atzilut, corresponding to Malchut, Tiferet, and Binah. These higher aspects are referred to as the *Zehara Ila'ah* (Supreme Radiance).  
When Adam sinned—before Cain was born—the *Naran* (nefesh, ruach, neshamah) from Atzilut departed from him. This departure is considered complete death, as it is written: *"For on the day you eat from it, you will surely die."* (Genesis 2:17).  
Know that Enoch received the *neshamah* of Adam, originating from the *Zehara Ila'ah* of Atzilut. Therefore, he became an angel in the heavens, known as the "Prince of the World," because this soul was from Atzilut itself, granting dominion over all the worlds.  
Furthermore, Elijah of blessed memory received the *ruach* from Atzilut that belonged to Adam HaRishon. For this reason, he too merited to become an angel and did not die.  
However, the *nefesh* from Atzilut that belonged to Adam was taken by Cain and Abel to repair the damage caused when good and evil became intertwined.  
Know that the *neshamah* portion of Adam HaRishon was later drawn into Joseph the Righteous. Therefore, Joseph inherited Adam's beauty, derived from this *Zehara Ila'ah*. Joseph received this *neshamah* on the night his servitude ended, elevating him to royalty. This is why he mastered the seventy languages, as he attained the *neshamah* connected to Metatron, who governs the seventy nations and knows all their languages.  
This is the matter as previously explained.

NAHAR 25 - Les GUILGOULIM de quelques TANAÏM et TSADIKIM que leur souvenir soit une bénédiction éternellement
Sache que YOKHEVED était le GUILGOUL de HAVAH et peut-être qu’aussi AMRAM était le GUILGOUL d’ADAM haRICHON et c’est la raison pour laquelle il s’est séparé de sa femme 130 ans et ensuite il a donné naissance à MOCHE en correspondance avec les 130 années durant lesquelles ont été créées les NITSOTSOT et à l’issue, est né MOCHE qui est CHET. Et sache que REOUVEN était GUILGOUL de KAÏN et n’a pas été réparé et sa NECHAMAH s’est réincarnée dans YITRO et elle a été réparée. Et sache que BILAAM est le côté mauvais d’HEVEL et MOCHE est le bon côté de HEVEL et c’est ainsi que quand tu soustrais la valeur de HEVEL (37) de celle de MOCHE (345), il reste KORAH (308) car en HEVEL, il n’y avait que 37 NITSOTSOT TOVOT et elles ont été réparées en MOCHE et les 308 mauvaises étaient celle de KORAH. Et de même YITRO est le bon côté de KAÏN et BALAK est le côté mauvais de KAÏN. Et de même AMALEK est le mauvais côté de KAÏN. Et aussi parmi les HEBREUX, il y avait deux catégories car ISRAEL est le secret de la KLALOUT (collectif) de MOCHE qui vient d’HEVEL et le EREV RAV est issu de KAÏN. Et sache que YITRO est la NECHAMAH de KAÏN et CHEMOUEL, le ROUAH de KAÏN et NADV et AVIHOU sont respectivement le NEFECH et le ROUAH et les deux se sont habillés dans l’âme de CHMOUEL. Et sache que le secret d’AVRAHAM est le secret d’ADAM haRICHON qui a pratiqué l’idolâtrie et c’est la raison pour laquelle une infime partie s’est réincarnée dans TERAH qui était un idolâtre pour expier sa faute et TERAH était de la racine de la NECHAMAH d’AVRAHAM et ils se sont réincarnés dans IYOV et dans sa femme car la mère d’AVRAHAM s’appelait AMTALAÏ BAT KARNEBO et elle s’est réincarnée dans DINAH bat LEAH qui s’est mariée avec IYOV.

Nahar 1


Know that the secret of Lilith is called the mother of the mixed multitude (Erev Rav), and the Erev Rav is called the 70 princes. The evil mixture of Lilith's wickedness gave birth to them through the union with Samael, and they are in the lowest of all the external levels, beneath all the chambers. They are 70 sparks, just as holiness has seven times seventy, so too do the external levels have seven external chambers, corresponding to the 70 nations with their 70 princes. And there is no prince corresponding to the Land of Israel, as they do not have a share in the land. However, in the Diaspora, their dominion is given, and they are indeed sparks that are dispersed outside the land, each one in its boundary at its edge, and its shape is like this.

Behold, these princes have dominion over the external forces, and their end reaches and extends to the upper heavens, and it rolls every day in the same way the celestial wheel moves daily. The princes themselves do not move nor roll; they are fixed in place, standing in front of their land, overseeing the boundaries allotted to them, as it is written: 'For the children of Lot I gave the city of Ar as an inheritance,' and 'To the children of Esau I gave Mount Seir.' Similarly, each nation below has a prince corresponding to its land above. He stands in front of his land and receives from ten crowns and seven impure chambers, and he influences the nation, whether the flow of souls or the sustenance they receive. Everything in their land is a flow coming from the prince who oversees it. For the upper heavens, his portion is there, and his army and his forces are positioned there, corresponding to the land. His army and forces are physical, just as his army and forces are spiritual. His people are like his people, his land is like his land, and the entire higher matter is like the lower, and the lower is like the higher. There is no king below who can conquer a king without first having a war between the two princes and their armies above. Concerning this, it is said, 'The Lord will visit the host of the high ones on high,' as explained in the Zohar in many places and in the words of our sages. The hint in the verse is 'He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.' Now, we learn from this the explanation of the words of the Zohar in Parshat Terumah: that the heavens revolve throughout the entire world, and as they come opposite each boundary, each prince influences the flow that comes through the boundary that belongs to them. Even if part of that heaven turns, it will still influence the part that comes opposite its boundary. The secret of all this is that the influence comes from the prince, and thus it is with all the princes.
However, the heaven corresponding to the Land of Israel has no dominion over it, because they [the heavens] draw from the prince (spiritual overseer) above them, which includes all levels of holiness: the ten holy crowns and the seven holy chambers, which open directly upon the Land of Israel. The gate of the Palace of Sapphire (Heichal Livnat HaSapir) exists exclusively for the boundary of the Land of Israel. Therefore, the air of the Land of Israel brings wisdom, by the secret of the wisdom of Solomon that rules within it, and its air is pure. On the other hand, the air of the Diaspora is entirely impure, as the husks (external impure forces) have dominion there.
Additionally, each boundary is influenced by the prince overseeing it, and the nature of its air reflects this influence—impure air originating from the prince who continually influences that place. However, the princes do not have the power to annul the dominion of the celestial wheel (galgal) entirely. Instead, the influence of the prince merges with the influence of the heaven (rakia) that rotates above it. 
The heaven has twelve constellations (mazalot), and the secret of the zodiac wheel (Galgal HaMazalot) is that it rotates over the Earth once every day, completing one cycle. This results in twenty-four divisions of influence—twelve constellations, with each constellation governing for two hours. Thus, when a constellation aligns with a prince, its influence merges with that of the prince, allowing the prince to convey his dominion through the constellation, but the constellation's authority is not nullified, as the prince lacks the power to nullify the constellation’s governance.
However, in the Land of Israel, it has been explained that the heavens are nullified completely. The constellations have no dominion at all before the Gate of the Palace of Sapphire. And so it has been said.

Nahar 2

**River Bet – To Further Explain This Teaching:**  
It is stated that, since it has been established that the flow to the constellations and stars originates from the sacred **heichalot** (heavenly chambers), as mentioned in the **Zohar**, there emerges an interaction between two domains of influence: the dominion of the **external forces** (the "chitzonim"), which is mediated by the **heavenly ministers** (the spiritual overseers of nations), and the dominion of the constellations and celestial spheres, which also stems from the **heichalot**.  Thus, the heavenly ministers cannot overpower the governance of the constellations because the latter derive their sustenance from a loftier source. Therefore, the constellations are allowed to exert their influence, resulting in a situation where the heavenly ministers—despite being exalted above the celestial spheres—are subordinate to the governance of the constellations. Consequently, the nations of the world (non-Jews) are subject to the influence of the constellations.  However, **Israel's spiritual source** is entirely distinct. The "minister" of Israel derives sustenance from a level above—from the opening of the **Heichal L’vanat HaSapir** (Chamber of the Sapphire Brick) and beyond. Below this level, the nations' ministers and the celestial forces have no connection or dominion over Israel at all.  This is the secret of the faith contained in the concept of **Shema Yisrael** and **Baruch Shem Kevod**, which spans from **Ein Sof (the Infinite)** down to the entrance of the **Heichal L’vanat HaSapir** alone. Below this point, the spiritual forces of the constellations hold sway. For Israel, however, these forces are nullified.  This explains the concept that "there is no **mazal** (astrological fate) for Israel." On the contrary, Israel actively nullifies the influence of the constellations, as indicated in the teaching that the celestial realms are upheld by the merit of the **Land of Israel**. Within the Land of Israel, the constellations neither influence nor determine anything, rendering them as though they do not exist.  In the Land of Israel, no dominion is given to the celestial spheres, stars, or constellations. Instead, all is governed by the Torah, as it is written: **“And let them serve as signs for the seasons, for days and years”** (Genesis 1:14). The celestial spheres merely function as markers of time, like a clock, but nothing more. This contrasts sharply with the reality outside the Land of Israel.  
**The Reason Why the Holy One, Blessed Be He, Did Not Allow the External Forces to Rule Alone Outside the Land of Israel:**  The Holy One, Blessed Be He, did not want the dominion of the external forces (*chitzonim*) to exist independently outside the Land of Israel, for otherwise, the inhabitants of the world would perish from famine. As it is written, *“They bow to nothingness and emptiness and pray to a god who cannot save”* (Isaiah 45:20). This shows that the external forces are devoid of any goodness or substance.  If so, how would these forces provide sustenance even for the *erev rav* (mixed multitude) that depends on them? The answer is that a measure of holiness is bestowed upon the celestial spheres through the **heichalot** (heavenly chambers). Each **mazal** (constellation) receives from the twelve facets of the celestial *chayot* (living creatures), and each star receives from a higher heichal.  This arrangement provides the heavenly ministers (*sarim*) with the treasures they distribute to the nations. Thus, the boundaries of any nation outside the Land of Israel are determined solely by the influence of the particular star ruling over it. However, other stars, whether from the northern or southern skies, that do not govern that region have no influence there. A minister cannot enter another minister’s boundary because it deviates from its domain.  As a result, specific herbs, metals, plant species, and various delicacies are absent in certain regions. In contrast, the Land of Israel, which is directly nourished by the Divine Source, is described as *“lacking nothing”* (Deuteronomy 8:9). The Source flows directly to the constellations, as mentioned.  The power of the **mazal** (astrological influence) is nullified only when it passes through the section of the sky corresponding to the Land of Israel—an area of 400 *parsa* by 400 *parsa* (a vast expanse). When within this section, the mazal's power diminishes. Upon exiting and entering the borders of the nations, its power ignites and intensifies again.  This phenomenon aligns closely with natural law. Sometimes a **mazal** “falls into a pit” due to certain causes. There is no greater cause for this than its passage over the portion of the sky corresponding to the Land of Israel.
**And Now It Is Found That While the Constellations Draw Sustenance from the Opening of the Chamber of the Sapphire Brickwork:**  As explained earlier and as mentioned in the portion of *Terumah*, the ultimate dominion of the constellations is directed toward the external crowns and chambers. These external forces are granted sustenance, allowing them to intermingle with and govern external management. When the power of the external forces diminishes and is subdued, the constellations receive their sustenance solely from holiness. Conversely, when the external forces prevail, they intermingle their influence with that of the constellations, weakening the holiness (Heaven forbid) that is channeled to the constellations. At times, the external forces may dominate entirely, distributing the sustenance of the constellations according to their will and governance.  This is the rule of the external forces and the mystery of idolatry from ancient times, whereby people used talismans and foreign incense offerings to draw the power of the stars and constellations. This phenomenon resulted from the dominion of the external higher crowns and their chambers over the constellations and stars, as previously explained.  Thus, the system of governance in the Land of Israel and outside it has been clarified.  However, one might ask: If those who performed such practices outside the Land of Israel found it understandable, what benefit was there to those performing them in the Land of Israel, where no dominion exists except externally?  The answer is that they undermined the celestial entourage, granting dominion to the heavens and external forces even as they passed through the Land of Israel. By doing so, they denied the power of the holy chambers.  This was a significant blemish that they caused in the Land, ultimately leading to their expulsion into exile.  And this is what was stated above.

Nahar 3

**River G – To Explain the Governance of Israel and the Nations:**  
The matter is as follows: Since the dwelling of the external forces is above the firmaments, and because this governance—known as the governance of the heavens—is fluctuating, sometimes under the higher dominion, the governance of the body functions in a similar manner. This governance exists for all living beings, whether from the nations or from Israel, as they are foundational elements established at the creation of humankind. These elements do not increase or diminish for any person.  
However, Israel strengthens these elements with supreme holiness and sanctifies them, especially due to the preparation of the father and mother during procreation. Therefore, in these aspects of life, holiness is imbued within them, whereas the nations are cloaked in impurity.  
Nonetheless, in the essential structure of life, both the nations and Israel are equal in their physical being. They diverge, however, in the two aforementioned types of governance. The nations are under the dominion of external forces, drawing from the life-sustaining energies mentioned earlier when impurity prevails. In contrast, Israel draws its sustenance during the sanctification of these same life elements.  
This dynamic mirrors the governance of the firmaments, wherein the external forces are subdued under the dominion of holiness.  
Just as the governance of the heavens depends on the actions of humanity—when their deeds are good, the external forces are subdued, and governance is entrusted to the holy; when their deeds, Heaven forbid, are corrupt, governance is given over to the external forces—so too is the governance of an individual.  
When a person amplifies the side of impurity, they transfer governance to the external forces. However, when they strengthen the holiness within them—such as their sacred soul and other elements—they entrust governance entirely to holiness and sanctify themselves.  
And this is what was previously explained.

Nahar 1

 Explaining the Secret of "Who can make the pure from the impure":
Indeed, the Infinite is distant from all substances, from all multiplication, deficiency, law, and the like. The question arises for all of them: Where did the deficiency come from? Where did the multiplication come from? Where did the purpose and limit come from? Up to this point for all of existence. These questions are only raised by those who affirm the primordial denials of creation ex nihilo. However, the assembly of God, the believers in creation ex nihilo, does not have a question about this at all because everything comes from nothing. Just as existence emerges from absolute nothingness, so does purity come from impurity. For indeed, existence being derived from nothing is more avoided than something coming from nothing until things become interchangeable. The question of multiplicity is also more avoided, as it is more elusive to derive existence from nothing than to derive two from one or a thousand from two. Therefore, we have escaped all these questions, and we, the believers, have not delved into the questions themselves but rather based on the truth of the matter itself.
And now, it is stated, "Know that absence is not as people have thought, that absence is nothing, heaven forbid. Rather, the primordial nothingness, meaning the Infinite alone, has no place for any absence, for it is itself all of existence, and there is no absence, heaven forbid. For absence is only considered when you depict the existence and portray the place of the existence and its absence. However, if you depict the Infinite alone, it is He and there is none besides Him. Indeed, He fills all of existence, and there is no emptiness that would have absence in it, heaven forbid. If the Infinite is depicted alone, He is Himself, and there is nothing besides Him. He fills all of existence, and there is no emptiness that would have absence in it, heaven forbid. So, depict that all of existence is simple, and it is the essence and the true existence that will never be absent and in which all of existence is present, lacking nothing. Do not let it enter your mind to say that this completeness, which does not have absence and will never lack, heaven forbid, is the existing, sustaining, never-lacking, never-absent essence. Indeed, it is the existing essence that stands forever and will never be absent, yet it clothes, conceals, and hides its essence. The revealed waves of intellect reveal approximately its primordial essence. It stands and exists without adding or subtracting to or from the existence of this intellect that comes into being and renews itself, called "nothing," neither before its existence, called "intellect," nor after its existence, called "existent." This intellect that brought itself into clothing is not external to it, for it was none other than it. Rather, it is truly its concealed and hidden power, standing by itself, emerging from itself. Behold, this intellect, the clothing called "existent," is approximately equivalent to what preceded, which was nothingness. However, it is not in the sense of the absence that was, for it and its knowledge are one. In this, you will settle in your heart all doubts and understand. And this is the intended meaning.


Nahar 2

River 2 - To explain from where the body and matter originated
This question, researchers have asked, and they said that from the shape, material is not drawn, and for this reason, they spoke about God aimlessly. However, they thought that they knew the shapes and materials, and for this reason, they stumbled and did not know and did not understand, they would walk in darkness. Because they thought that the form is not complex but simple, and for this, they foolishly considered it. They also thought that the rain from the sky is simple, and with this, they reached what they reached. Now, our sages have explained that they are called "shamayim" (heavens), which are made of fire and water. And to this extent, they thought about the upper existences that are simple, and they did not stand on the secret of God but are indeed composed. The soul and the spirit and the breath are composed of four spiritual elements, as it is written, 'From the four winds, come, O breath!' as mentioned in the book of Shemot. Moreover, the living creatures of holiness are living beings composed of four spiritual elements, and each one includes all of them. Also, the holy throne has four foundations, which are the four spiritual elements: kindness of water, strength of fire, beauty of wind, and sovereignty of earth. There are also other foundations rooted in the depths of understanding, and they ignore them.
Now it should be said that in this manner, the concept of existence will spread and descend from Atzilut to Beriah, from Beriah to Yetzirah, and from Yetzirah to Asiyah, by the will of the desires to spread the actions. As they descend, they take the form of shape and matter because the Ein Sof (Infinite) is the shape to Atzilut, and Atzilut is the vessel and matter to the sublime shape, metaphorically speaking. Atzilut is the shape to Beriah, and Beriah is the matter to Atzilut. Yetzirah is the matter to Beriah, and Beriah is the shape to Yetzirah. Yetzirah is the shape to Asiyah, and Asiyah is the matter to Yetzirah. They will descend from Eilah (upper) to Alul (lower) from shape to shape, and they are matter to shape, and shape to matter, until the matters reach from existence to existence with a purpose directed in proportion and weight and measure, for each existence, there is a measure of its existence, and a place of its standing, and its matter, and all are measured by the Emanator through the secret of essences and vessels. They will spread from the Supreme Will, and will first come out from His simple unity with will. From there, they will descend from existence to existence until they reach the place of their standing. There is nothing that will not be matter for what is above it, and there is nothing that will not be a shape for what is below it. We, however, at the lower end, perceive these lower materials and are indifferent to the upper shapes. Therefore, this difficulty arises for us. But in the reality of truth, there is no difficulty at all, as mentioned and explained.

Nahar 3

River 3 - To explain the secret of the existence of the Klipah (husk):
 The matter is that any transfer from one existence to another, the permissible, when the change comes from light to water and from water to firmament, will occur. The concept is that the upper emanations follow their order from emanation to action, and the main ones are Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet. These three are the foundation and basis for the other emanations. In Chesed, there is a thin light, and when Gevurah spreads, it becomes denser, like water that is denser than light and is approximately like the firmament that thickens within the water. The impurity that does not spread does not thicken, and it remains stagnant water below the firmament. By this, you should understand that the guidance will spread from the emanations of Atzilut to the emanations of Beriah, and there will be a light of water in the firmament. Everything that we call in Atzilut will become similar to it below in Beriah, and later, the same will happen in Yetzirah. Through this, the externalities will be permitted, and the secret of the permissible will descend to the outside.
And behold, their upper existence is not an external essence at all, but an existence rooted in roots that are established. Just as any existence guided by the descending entities and necessary for creation is rejected, so too the very secret of this root, which is not proper to conduct the secrets of governing and the conclusions of might in it, is rejected. Also, creation is rejected because the world should not be judged based on the roots of might and the permissible ones in the throne. Likewise, in the formation, until their existence descends from one existence to another, until it reaches the secret of their existence downward to the place where the permissible one performs its action, namely the external one, according to this, they truly fulfill their function in their place. They are rooted in creation, and the root whose root is in creation, and the root whose root is in emanation. Now, when they act downward, they will only act by grasping one existence in another, root in root, until they overcome from the perspective of the exalted degrees. And thus

Nahar 4

River 4 - To explain the matter of the Kelipot and their essence:
Just as the Holy Koma (Divine Measurements), which, with its specific elements, is encompassed by the four foundations (yesodot), meaning the secret of the ten Sefirot included in the four letters [of the Teragrammaton], so too, the externals (Chiztonim) themselves, with their specific measurements, are encompassed by the four foundations. These are the four Kelipot, literally four foundations. The foundation of water is the water inclined to white, its power is to induce laziness and lethargy and to cause sin in this matter concerning humanity, meaning the secret of a great cloud. The foundation of fire is the bitterness that embitters the world with its bitterness and burns the world with its fire, from which comes the secret of the fire of Gehenna, namely the consuming fire. The third foundation is the wind, a stormy wind coming from the north that stirs the entire world. The fourth is the black, dark, dark earth, the barren land, as it is said: "A pit that is empty of water." Behold, these moistnesses rule over all four foundations in the world to do harm. Similarly, they rule over man, and from there come to man bad and persistent illnesses under the rule of these over his existence. This is in the sense that they rule over the entirety of the world and over Israel in their exile, over man in his illness. This is also explained in the Tikunnim.
And know that holiness is undoubtedly a very precious thing, not easily found by a person except after much effort, and it is easy to lose. For if a person were to awaken with a holy spirit all his days, in a brief moment, he would descend to the utmost. Behold, David said, "For as a handbreadth between me and death," meaning that even though he was attached to an upper measure, he descended in his vacillation and went out, oscillating until reaching a level where there remained nothing between him and death except as a very thin matter, even though he stood in his purity. He also said, "My soul is nearly like the shadow," nearly with a great taste, nothing remained between him and a similar level except a very small thing because holiness is very precious to attain, and it is very easy to be lost. Conversely, in this respect, one who is attached to the evil inclination will not easily return to separation. How far and how different are those who descend compared to those who ascend, as this cursed one who adheres to a person does not separate easily, and once this cursed one attaches to a person, for several years, it clings to him until he separates completely from it. This is because it is easy to be found, ready for a person immediately, even if he is not pursuing it, it is found immediately and it presents itself to him. Those who prepare themselves for it, even more so. Therefore, these externals are called "Eloh," the signs, "These are your gods, O Israel," meaning those that a person points to with his finger, prepares himself for, and for this reason, they are called these externals. However, holiness is very hidden, a hidden matter of God, not found and not readily available. 
The reason is that the harlot, being unguarded, is found everywhere. If she is sitting in her seat, she sits at the entrance of her house, walking sometimes outside and sometimes in the streets. Whoever seeks her immediately finds a woman before him. However, holiness is not like this because it is a king's daughter sitting in her house, hidden, and the pursuer must traverse many very difficult paths until entering the king's palace, to the room with his daughter, who is not found by everyone, and not everyone gains access to her. Those who do, go through several levels and considerable effort. The reason is that the substance that was embedded in man by the sin of the first man caused holiness to disappear from him, and the external one immediately jumps on him. In a trivial matter, the external is attained, and one defiles oneself. Thus, man's nature is very distant from the holy side, in terms of substance and the nature that was embedded in him from the time he donned garments of skin, literally from the skin of the serpent. He stripped the serpent of its skin because the serpent was the king in this material world when man sinned and brought about the expulsion of the serpent from its place. The divine presence was also expelled with it, and when the serpent was expelled, it shed its skin and was deprived of its dominion, preventing it from confusing the world (God forbid). If it had retained the same control over matter as before the sin of the first man, it would have made garments of skin for man from this material, which the serpent shed.
And so, the hands of man have several forces of angelic divine spirit shining upon them from beneath their wings. Meaning, below these camps altogether, they spread throughout the world to assist those who repent. Those who repent from their sins are stripped of the foreign garment they wore in their transgressions to elevate them to the place where the Sabbath of the King stands. This is after being on duty in the service for several days and years. As they said, "One who comes to purify, they assist him," meaning that they send their maidens to him. However, one who comes to defile, they immediately open for him the holy steps within which he is making openings from all sides. They do not assist him in doing evil (God forbid); rather, he throws himself down from above to below. Anything heavy that ascends can easily throw itself down and descend. As soon as he descends, the external one jumps upon him. Outside, several external forces assist him in doing evil, and all their desire is to commit adultery with him. This is also assistance from their side.

Nahar 5

River 5 - To explain the secret of the operation of the klipah and the defect:
Know that since the main purpose of our work is to distinguish the Chitzoni [external forces of evil] from the holy, and this is the fundamental reason for the prohibition of "You shall not do" in the Torah, and since they are completely separated, it cannot be said that their actions themselves are without divine supervision (God forbid). They have no action except from within the holiness. Therefore, it is explained in the corrections that they are inferior crowns, they are the klipot to the ten spheres, and the ten spheres are the brains within themselves. The idea is that when guilt prevails among human beings below, the holiness will clothe itself in these klipot, and they will not be supervised by the holy. Instead, guidance will come to them from these external forces, so that their harm will not reach above, similar to the klipah on the tree that serves to protect it from all damage. Similarly, these (klipot) guard the holiness. This is what is meant by "And they are inferior crowns; they are klipot to the ten spheres." When harm comes to human beings, it does not come from the holiness but from these guardians on the side of holiness, ensuring that they do not sin with their souls.
The second [reason] is that they have no action independent of the supreme holiness at all because the supreme holiness is the one that enacts punishments. However, they (the klipot) bring judgments to human beings through these in the sense that the pure holy ones have no punishments, only decrees, and the punishments stem from the external forces. There is no action in reality that is not from the holy because these are lifeless bodies with no good in their hands. However, their action from the side of holiness, which is the soul, operates within them. They cannot perform their actions except through the internal brain within them. This is expressed in "And ten spheres are its brain within itself," meaning the spread of ten sparks to act in them. This means that it is said: "And His kingdom rules over all," indicating that they only act under the supreme judgment
There is a third aspect, that they actually become a barrier to separate and block the gates so that the supplications [of the righteous] will not enter until they receive their punishment. At that time, Israel is in great distress. This is expressed in the statement, "For your sins have separated between you and your God." Although it is said, "No evil will befall you," our sages of blessed memory explained that evil will not befall you from above. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, and His divine presence spread among the lower beings to guide them, through the garment that is known. It is further emphasized to say, "No evil will befall you," specifically in the way of exile. However, through a worldly path, it may rise at times, as mentioned, and even Satan may come, as stated: "And Satan came also among them." This is expressed in the boast of the axe against the one who wields it, where they are only tools of destruction, but the hand that wields it is from above, as mentioned. Therefore, it is a commandment upon us to nullify their actions entirely so that the King and Queen will spread from these garments....
A parable for the matter of the klipot is as follows: It is like a wise doctor who has a patient who became insane. The remedy for him is to inflict upon him severe and cruel beatings. The compassionate doctor, being wise, instructs to seek a merciless person who is also foolish to beat the insane until he is healed. Now, there are three opinions here: The wise doctor's opinion, which is merciful and instructs to administer all those beatings in order to heal the insane. The opinion of the foolish one being beaten, who judges according to his foolishness, claiming that there is no cruelty greater than the cruelty of the doctor who instructs to beat him. This is a lie, as the doctor pursues every means of healing to benefit the patient. The opinion of the one delivering the beatings, who has no intention other than to act cruelly according to his evil nature. He beats anyone he finds without considering any benefit. These three opinions are as follows: The first one is the higher intention and the governance of the laws from above, where everything is directed towards the necessity. The second one is the judgment of the person being judged, and all his benefit—if he had not strayed, there would be no need for this at all. The insanity of the one being beaten directly causes him to be beaten, namely, the evil inclination that sins. The third is the one delivering the beatings, the external forces that cause a person to sin and then strike him mercilessly because he is pursued by impurity.

Nahar 6

River 6 - to clarify the secret of the Kelipot
Know that just as holiness derives strength from human actions, so too Chitzoniot [the external forces of evil] truly draws strength from humans and their deeds. While holiness is genuine and unique, and wickedness is falsehood and separation, how the Divine Presence adorns itself with the deeds of humans, and how it corrects humans facing inner turmoil with rebukes for sin, it is found that it does not adorn its face downward but upward, as Moses did with the people of Israel, for below he showed them a face of anger and above he said, 'And He relented concerning the evil for your people.' Remember Abraham, remember their love and kindness. The upper countenance is good for Israel; thus, the actual countenance of the Divine Presence above teaches their merit and says, 'See, these have done such and such commandments.' However, below, the opposite is said, all judgment and all faces are wrathful. This is truly the way of the Divine Presence – bringing troubles upon the righteous, chastising them, and showing them a face of anger, adorning itself with their deeds above." And the cursed, impure, harlot is not so; rather, she shows them adorned faces, sweetens wickedness and transgression for them. She tells evil that it is good and good that it is evil, showing them faces. She takes from their deeds and shows them to her husband, saying to him, "Go up to bring anger, for they have done such and such evil deeds, continue the slaughter, sword and destruction." Her husband becomes bitter, angered by the bitter bitterness she throws upwards, immediately becoming cruel, rising, accusing, descending, and taking a soul. Indeed, the way of the deceitful one is found to be so; she adorns herself for strangers and despises her husband, giving him nothing but remnants of calamity. This is the analogy. 

Nahar 7



Nahar 8

River 8 - To explain the nature of the evil inclination and the good inclination:
Let us elucidate the essence of the evil inclination and the good inclination. The matter, in general, is that the arousal of Samael (סיים) occurs, and his spark spreads, touching this material and kindling it until he desires to seduce it. This is illustrated metaphorically by the mentioned harlot in the Zohar, portion Terumah. There is power in human hands to choose good and reject evil.
Just as the evil inclination is the arousal of Samael, and it has a presence in a person, entering into him, and that presence touching him is called the "Yetzer Hara," half of which is bound to matter and half is bound to Samael between his horns. So too, the good inclination is the arousal of the Divine thread of purity that extends from the Creator to the person. Half of it is bound above to the horns of the Creator's glory, and half is bound to the intellect of the person and his soul. This means that a person can strengthen either the good or the evil inclination within him. If he continues his attachment to the Creator, he will strengthen the good inclination, and this thread will become as thick as the rope of a heifer, increasing the arousal of his Creator. However, if Samael adds strength to his name, like a mighty man, and anyone greater than his fellow, his evil inclination becomes greater than him, and the wicked one cuts the thread of the cords of kindness and mercy of his Creator. He grabs the thornbush, the horns of the wicked Samael. Nevertheless, there remains in him the counsel of the good inclination. Once a day or twice, sparks of repentance awaken in his heart, as mentioned in the Zohar. If he has understanding, he will grasp onto the thread of repentance. The good inclination will return to its place, and this is why the good inclination is called the great sailor, the leader guiding the ship with the counsel of the Creator. It awakens through the arousal of the secret of the light of Atzilut, spreading from Beriah to Yetzirah. This explains the matter of the good and evil inclinations and their roots. This is the analogy.

Nahar 9

River 9 - To explain the nature of the evil inclination (Yitzer Harah), the demons, and the aspects of the soul:
The concept is that there is a soul in a person from the realm of nobility, and it is called the daughter of the Holy One, blessed be He. There is also a soul from the realm of creation, called a maidservant, and there is a soul lower than creation, called the common maidservant. Similarly, the evil inclination has several levels, for it is below the levels of holiness, meaning below the chamber of the white sphere, descending from there, and it has various aspects based on their proximity to holiness and their distance. Some are from the realm of pleasant secrets, like a tough husk, and there is another aspect, as will be explained.The concept is that there is a soul in a person from the realm of nobility, and it is called the daughter of the Holy One, blessed be He. There is also a soul from the realm of creation, called a maidservant, and there is a soul lower than creation, called the common maidservant. Similarly, the evil inclination has several levels, for it is below the levels of holiness, meaning below the chamber of the white sphere, descending from there, and it has various aspects based on their proximity to holiness and their distance. Some are from the realm of pleasant secrets, like a tough husk, and there is another aspect, as will be explained.The evil inclination was created to serve the soul, just as the serpent was created to serve humanity. This is similar to the husk of the walnut, which serves to protect the inner brain. Likewise, the evil inclination serves the soul as a ready tool for its work. It is also referred to as a servant, as it is written, "Spoiling his servant from youth." The evil inclination forces the soul to clothe itself in the body willingly acquired. Each person has an evil inclination, called a demon, residing in their body, tempting them. It is indeed a demon, as the evil inclination and the demons share the same origin. Thus, this evil inclination, based on its origin, is prepared for worldly matters. Therefore, every person has their own evil inclination, which is called a demon within their body, leading them to sin. It is certainly a demon, as the evil inclination and the demons share the same origin. Thus, this evil inclination, based on its origin, is prepared for worldly matters. Hence, some individuals have pure material, ready for all uses, while others have impure material – all depending on the nature of the evil inclination from which it originates.
...When the soul clothes itself in the secret of spirit and soul within the evil inclination, and the evil inclination in the body, there is no doubt that the soul, possessing the ten faculties, is certainly complete, and therefore it is Yud (10). As the soul prevails over the evil inclination, purifies it, brings it into holiness, and subjugates it to the service of the Name, let us now speak about this evil inclination, which is called the Jewish demon. At that point, the soul and the evil inclination unite through the intermediaries of spirit and soul. The evil inclination is purified by that soul, turning it into an angel. This means that it becomes a "Shadai" through that soul, specifically through the numerical value of Metatron, which is 314. If, God forbid, the opposite happens, and the soul is led astray by the evil inclination, not only will the soul and spirit be lost due to the evil inclination, but also the soul itself will incur excision, and conversely, the evil inclination causes the soul to become a demon. This is why the wicked are known to be harmful.
And know that the evil inclination influences a person through the secret of the klipah (husk) close to the brain, as mentioned elsewhere. Due to its proximity, it has the power to purify itself, draw closer, and enter the realm of holiness. This is how the evil inclination can become the good inclination because it has a sweet root. This is analogous to how tormosin (a type of date) are sweetened, as Solomon knew, and it all depends on the skill of the practitioner.Understand that the klipah itself, without the influence of holiness, has some potential. Everything is according to the evil inclination's design, as some evil inclinations are ready to accept all wisdom and desire it, while others are coarse and lust for physical pleasures and ugly traits. This aligns with what our sages explained about simple demons being derived from the klipot. They lack human composition, yet some possess wisdom, indicating that the klipah itself has inherent qualities, nature, and desire.
When the evil inclination revolves smoothly in a person from this klipah, he easily becomes wise in Torah. He becomes a Torah scholar due to his refined and close connection to knowledge. If he is not interested in engaging with Torah and matters of holiness, at the very least, he becomes wise in external wisdom, such as natural things and the like. These are things he can boast about before people, as the evil inclination only entices him with the pursuit of wisdom. This is because the evil inclination's chiseling comes from the refined chisel that desires wisdom....
And know that there are three types of demons themselves: scholars, philosophers, and the like who are not connected to the soul. Some adhere to the soul, Torah scholars who engage in the study of God's Torah. The evil inclination transforms from a snake to a minister (metatron), as mentioned. Others among the demons themselves are like animals, not pursuing anything except harm and corruption, ignorant of anything, due to the malicious nature of their chisel. Their dullness and thickness make them uninterested in any wisdom; they only pursue food, drink, and indulgence.
When the evil inclination, from this aspect, influences humans, there are two types: those who repent, tough Torah scholars, with deep analysis and understanding, coarse in their intellect, putting in great effort to achieve little, bearing the burden of their work like a heavy load. Eventually, they break free from the coarse husk. They struggle to purify themselves from various negative traits and undergo multiple hardships. Some are not repentant and are ignorant. They are the common people, their traits are negative, they hate the Torah and those who engage in it, they do not love the pursuit of wisdom, they have negative traits, and they delight in indulgence. However, the aspect of the repentant ones is as mentioned. This is the explanation.

Nahar 10

River Ten- To explain the secret of the portion given to the husk (klipah):
Understand that holiness and the husk (klipah) are adversaries, and there is absolutely no way in the world for them to coexist. Unlike in other parts of the universe, where everything complements and interconnects, benefiting from the divine radiance, the husk cannot coexist with holiness. The only options are for all to succumb to the husk, and the divine radiance (Shechina) will withdraw, leaving only the lowest world. This final confrontation is compelled and subdued under the husk. This is the secret of offering sacrifices to foreign worship, pouring libations, and other forbidden practices. In essence, all aspects of holiness withdraw from there, and then, empowered by the force of that sacrifice, the husks commit robbery and defile holiness. They breach the realm of angels and cause various evils.
And this is because it is necessary to know that the [sefirah of] Malchut (Kingdom) is the attribute that governs the world with justice and righteousness. Therefore, it desires those wicked individuals who are the husks (klipot) to afflict and chastise human beings. They are called plagues upon humanity and the staff of men, and they are a stumbling block and a rock of offense. According to the explanation, they travel and camp near the impure, punishing those who deviate from the right path. After that, the kingdom is obligated to provide for their sustenance, and they demand their sustenance from it, as it is written: "The young lions roar for prey," and it is written: "She rises while it is still night; she provides food for her household, a portion for her maidservants." They are fed daily with their allotted food. However, when sins and transgressions are found, they divide the spoil more and more until they cause a blockage in the holy channel and open a source of impurity. The place where the blood of valor was pure becomes milk, and their plundered breasts become blocked, turning the blood into impurity. Severe judgment is then difficult to impose on the wicked, and at that point, Joseph flees and goes outside, but they hold on to it. This is the exile of the Divine Presence, and then there cannot be any unity in holiness. Heaven forbid.
Also, know that when a person brings an offering in its proper and appropriate holy place, there is no doubt that the husks (klipot) derive no benefit there whatsoever. Even in a place called by the name of holiness, it has no hold at all unless, as mentioned in the Zohar, one is careful to mention the name of God and words of holiness in matters where the husk is removed. If, God forbid, they are mentioned in any matter in the world, even a broken word, they will seize that word or that matter, especially to say that this matter belongs to a certain demon. Many people say that this is truly like offering to idolatry. When a person does something of holiness, these evil forces, once they see that they have no hold either in speech or in action, rise above jealousy, where all forces are connected, and it is separated like a leper. It rises, goes, and accuses that offering or that joy. Therefore, it is necessary to give a portion to the klipah. The incident of Abraham during the festive meal of the calf, which brought about the binding of Isaac as explained in the Zohar, teaches that the klipah will not move away from before the Holy One, Blessed be He, until Isaac is sentenced to death. All this is caused by this evil if a portion is not given to it. This matter requires much understanding, for it is impossible to reconcile between them since they are adversaries to each other, as mentioned. Were it not for the wisdom of the Torah, which, in its command, has arranged to give it a portion, they would not have been reconciled.
And behold, the part given to the shell, the first is the goat given to Azazel. The second is the scapegoat. The third is the hair of tefillin. The fourth is the final waters. The fifth is circumcision in the dust. The sixth is the hair of menstruation and its nail, as mentioned in the Zohar. The seventh is the fruits of the uncircumcised tree. The eighth is the fruit of the festival. The ninth is the confession in sacrifice. The tenth is the flesh of the body that will decay in the dust, as mentioned in the Zohar in the verse 'The fool embraces his flesh.' The eleventh is the washing of hands from the bathroom and sleep, and there are many, and the intention in all of these is to distinguish, so that one does not engage in holiness and does not provoke, for in that part, there is joy and happiness, and it does not demand anything at all unless they initiate it with speech or action as mentioned, or in thought, such as in sacrifice or a commandment not for its own sake.
And behold, in this, there are several aspects, although, according to the general principle, they are two: one to give it impurity alone, and in this category is the Azazel goat, to which the name impurity of sins is given, and holiness is purified. Similarly, the final waters, as a person is drawn after food and wants to bless for holiness so that it does not have a share there, one gives it the impurity of the hands, which is the material desire that he ate with and wiped with his hands. Also in this category is the confession on the sacrifice. Similarly, in this category is the water for the washing of the bathroom, which is the removal of the husks from the body, which is the permissible that is expelled. In the bathroom, the spirit of impurity rules, and it rests in his hands when he enters there. It is necessary to give it that portion of wiping and remove it from his hands. Also in this category is the morning handwashing, which, through sleep, the spirit of impurity rests there, and one gives it its portion and purifies.
The second part is to give it [a portion] from holiness itself, namely the fruit of the festival, and similarly, the scapegoat for Rosh Hashanah, and also the hair of tefillin. This category is not intended to share it with holiness but to give it a portion there outside, within the cavity of the great abyss, and not to mix the portion of holiness at all. This is to avoid confusion between the portion of holiness and the portion of impurity. And so it is said.
