Chapter 1





























Rabbi Abba said, in many places we taught, that everything Hashem does above and below is truth, and what He does is truth, and there is nothing in the world that a person should reject and treat with disrespect, because everything is the truth, and everything is needed in the world.
For one time, Rabbi Elazar was walking on a path, and Rabbi Chizkiya was walking with him.  They saw a snake and Rabbi Chizkiya got up to kill it.  Rabbi Elazar said to him, "Leave it, don't kill it." [Rabbi Chizkiya] responded, "But it's a bad thing, for it kills people."  [Rabbi Elazar] said to Rabbi Chizkiya, "But it says in the verse (Koheles 10:11) 'If a snake will kill without a whisper'.  A snake does not bite a person until he is whispered to from Above to kill the person...
And everything is in the hands of Hashem, and everything is the work of His hands, and the world needs it, and if the world didn't need it, Hashem wouldn't have made it.  And this is why a person should not disrespect anything in the world.  And in the matters and actions of Hashem, how much more so.
