Come and see, one who desires to know the wisdom of holy unity should gaze upon a flame that rises from a coal, or from a lit candle. For the flame only rises when it is attached to a coarse (alt. other) object.
Come and see, in the rising flame there are two lights. One white, shining light; and one light to which black or blue (techelet) is attached. The white light is on top and it rises in a straight path. And the blue or black light is beneath it, and it is a seat to the white.
The white light rests upon it and they are attached to one another, forming a single unity. The light that is either black or a shade of blue that is below, is a throne of glory to the white [light]. 
And herein lies the secret of techelet. And this blue (or) black throne is attached to another object below it that kindles it and arouses it to attach itself to the white light (alt. above).
At times, this blue-black changes to red, but the white light above it never changes, for it is constantly white. However, the blue changes to these [other] colors; at times it is blue or black, and at times it is red. 
And it is attached on both sides. It is attached above to that (alt. supernal) white light, [and] it is attached to that object below that has been set to give it light (to serve as kindling) and to attach itself to it.




And resting above the white light is a concealed light that surrounds it. And herein lies a supernal mystery, and all of it can be found in the rising flame, in which the wisdom of the higher realms are present.
