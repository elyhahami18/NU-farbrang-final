Chapter 61






Because when the world was created, each and every thing did not come into being until it arose in Will to create man who could labor in Torah, and for him the world was brought into existence. Now anyone who gazes into the Torah and labors in her, it is as if he preserves the entire world. The Holy One (blessed be He) gazed into the Torah and created the world. A person gazes into the Torah and preserves the world. We find that the creation and the preservation of the entire world is Torah, and as a result of this, fortunate is the person who involves himself with Torah, because he preserves the world.
