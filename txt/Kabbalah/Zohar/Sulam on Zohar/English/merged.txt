Introduction



Paragraph 1

<b>Rabbi Ḥizkiya opened...</b><br><b>1. Rabbi Ḥizkiya opened</b> his discourse with the following exposition: <b>It is stated: “Like a lily among the thorns” [Song of Songs 2:2].</b> [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] asks <b>“what is this lily?”</b> and he answers, “<b>this is the Assembly of Israel,”</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>. For <b>there is</b> one type of <b>lily and there is</b> another type of <b>lily. Just as the lily that is among the thorns has</b> both the colors <b>red and white, so too the Assembly of Israel has both judgment and mercy. Just as the lily has thirteen petals, so too the Assembly of Israel has the thirteen measures of mercy that surround it on all of its sides. So too, <i>Elohim</i> that appears</b> in the verse <b>here</b> i.e.: “In the beginning <i>Elohim</i> created” [Genesis 1:1], <b>from the moment</b> [<i>Elohim</i>] <b>was mentioned, it generated thirteen words to surround and protect the Assembly of Israel</b>. They are: <i>et</i>, <i>hashamayim</i>, <i>ve’et</i>, <i>ha’aretz</i>, <i>ve-ha’aretz</i>, <i>hayta</i>, <i>tohu</i>, <i>vavohu</i>, <i>ve’ḥoshekh</i>, <i>al</i>, <i>penei</i>, <i>tehom</i>, <i>ve-ru’aḥ</i> [“the heavens and the earth. The earth was emptiness and disorder, and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit,” Genesis 1:1–2]. That is, up to [the words] <i>Elohim meraḥefet</i> [“God hovered,” Genesis 1:2].
Explanation: There are ten <i>sefirot</i> – <i>Keter</i>; <i>Ḥokhma</i>; <i>Bina</i>; <i>Ḥesed</i>; <i>Gevura</i>; <i>Tiferet</i>; <i>Netzaḥ</i>; <i>Hod</i>; <i>Yesod</i>; and <i>Malkhut</i>. But in essence they are only five: <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, as the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> incorporates six <i>sefirot</i> – <i>ḤGT NHY</i> [<i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>]. <i>Keter</i> is also called <i>Arikh Anpin</i> [“Long Face”], while <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> are called <i>Abba Ve-imma</i> [“Father and Mother”], and <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> are called <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> [“Small Face”] and <i>Nukba</i> [“female”] (for an explanation of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, see <i>“Introduction to the Wisdom of the Kabbalah”</i> (<i>Petiḥa leḤokhmat HaKabbala</i>), section 5).
Know that the mystical secret of the seven days of creation is the secret of the two <i>partzufim</i>: <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, and they contain seven <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated above. It is explained in these verses from the act of creation how <i>Abba Ve-imma</i>, which are <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, emanated them, from the start of their coming into being until the completion of their maturation, which transpires over six thousand years. This idea is progressively clarified here in the <i>Zohar</i> on <i>Bereshit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The main point of this paragraph, and much of this segment of following passages of <i>Zohar</i> and the Sulam commentary, is that the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> encompassed within the two <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> are the structure and meaning of the seven days of creation in the Torah. The roots of existence as we know it are found in the primal, divine plane of existence called <i>Atzilut</i>. The evolution of our world during the six-thousand-year period within which we currently reside is a manifestation of the template of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>.</i>
Rabbi Ḥizkiya began his explanation of the [<i>partzuf</i> of] <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in order to clarify the order of its emanation from [the <i>partzuf</i> of] <i>Imma</i>, that is <i>Bina</i>, which is called by the name <i>Elohim</i>. This is why he began by explaining the concept of the lily, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The "<i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>" refers to the relationship between these two <i>partzufim</i>. <i>Nukba</i> is the female counterpart to the male <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. In Kabbalistic thought, the concept of male is that of the giver, transmitting of his essence to the female. The female is the receiver who, upon receiving the essence of the male, constructs that essence with her own tools, creating a new being out of this process. As this section mentions, <i>Nukba</i> receives the light of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, itself having undergone a series of modifications from the levels before it, in order to bestow that light in a further modified form to the lowest levels of existence.</i> Since the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, at the completion of its development, is called the Assembly of Israel – as stated below – he says, “what is this lily; it is the Assembly of Israel.”
This lily has two states: A state of immaturity, which is her initial formation, at which point she has only one <i>sefira</i>, <i>Keter</i>, within which the light [of the level] of <i>nefesh</i> is enclothed, and her nine lower <i>sefirot</i> have fallen from <i>Atzilut</i> to the world of <i>Beria</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The states of immaturity and maturity referenced here are inextricably linked to the process called the second constriction.</i> and a state of maturity, at which point her lower nine <i>sefirot</i> have ascended from the world of <i>Beria</i> to the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, and she is fashioned with them into a whole <i>partzuf</i> of ten <i>sefirot</i>. She then ascends together with her husband, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, to an equal height with [the <i>partzufim</i> of] <i>Abba Ve-imma</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] enclothe [<i>Abba Ve-imma</i>]. Then &lt;&lt;<i>Ze’er Anpin is called by the name "Israel," whose [Hebrew] letters spell out <i>li rosh</i> [“to me a head”], while <i>Nukba</i> is called by the name "Assembly of Israel," because she assembles inside herself all of the lights of her husband, Israel, which she then passes on to the lower realms.</i>
The state of immaturity is called “a lily among the thorns” because the [<i>Nukba</i>'s] nine lower <i>sefirot</i> were emptied of the light of <i>Atzilut</i> and were left like thorns. The state of maturity is simply called “a lily,” or “the Assembly of Israel.” This is the meaning of the comment: <b>“For there is one type of lily and there is another type of lily.”</b>
Now, the reddish hue indicates that external forces have a hold there, through which the <i>kelippot</i> can absorb. This occurs during the state of immaturity, when [<i>Nukba</i>'s] nine lower <i>sefirot</i> are in <i>Beria</i>. [<i>Nukba</i>] also has a whitish hue, that is, in the vessel of her <i>Keter</i>, where external forces have no hold. Accordingly, [the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“Just as the lily that is among the thorns has red and white, so too the Assembly of Israel has judgment and mercy.”</b> This teaches that even in [<i>Nukba</i>'s] mature state, when she is called the Assembly of Israel, although she then ascends and enclothes <i>Bina</i> in her mature state, as explained above, she nevertheless retains the attribute of judgment. For [<i>Nukba</i>] requires the mystical partition that is forged within her for the purpose of fusion through collision, and the judgment in the partition strikes the supernal light and returns it backward. This process raises the ten <i>sefirot</i> of returning light, which is called “the light of judgment,” and [this returning light] draws into itself ten <i>sefirot</i> of direct light, referred to as "the light of mercy" (see the <i>“Introduction to the Wisdom of the Kabbalah”</i> (<i>Petiḥa leḤokhmat HaKabbala</i>), section 14). Accordingly, the Assembly of Israel also contains judgment and mercy, corresponding to the red and white colors of a lily among thorns.
This is the mystical secret of the pool made by King Solomon [see I Kings 7:23–26], which stood upon twelve oxen. For these, [<i>Nukba</i>'s] nine lower <i>sefirot</i>, which fell into <i>Beria</i> as stated, were rectified there through the secret of the twelve oxen. The point of the <i>Keter</i> that remained in <i>Atzilut</i> is the secret of the pool which was positioned above them, and their incorporation together is called the <b>thirteen petals</b> of the lily. The idea of this division of [<i>Nukba</i>'s] ten <i>sefirot</i> into thirteen will be explained below in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>.
The brains<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The term “brains” can be thought of as similar to the human concept of consciousness. When a person understands more, he or she can be thought of as “more conscious.” Similarly, when there are changes in particular levels, like when a level ascends to the level above it as a result of the process of expansiveness, it is described as having more “brains,” meaning increased exposure to the supernal light that is accessible at those higher levels.</i> of <i>Nukba</i> in her mature state, which contain some of the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, emanate from the thirteen names that are called “the thirteen attributes of mercy.” This is the meaning of the phrase<b>: “so too the Assembly of Israel has thirteen measures of mercy.”</b> The main idea that Rabbi Ḥizkiya seeks to convey in this comparison of a lily between the thorns and the Assembly of Israel, is to teach us that everything which is present in the mature state of <i>Nukba</i> must correspondingly exist, in a preparatory, preliminary form, already at her initial formation, that is, in her state of immaturity. This is why [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] states that parallel to the whiteness and redness of the immature state, judgment and mercy emerge in [<i>Nukba</i>] in the mature state; and parallel to the thirteen petals of the immature state, the thirteen measures of mercy emerge in her in their mature state. He cites this here in order to teach us how the verses before us elucidate these two orders of the state of immaturity and maturity, which are found in the <i>Atzilut</i> of <i>Nukba</i>, as he proceeds to explain: <b>“So too, the word <i>Elohim</i>, Lord, that appears here…”</b>
<b>“So too, the name <i>Elohim</i></b> that appears here <b>generates thirteen words.”</b> This teaches that the <i>Elohim</i> in this verse, “In the beginning <i>Elohim</i> created,” which is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i> that emanates the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, generates these thirteen words: <i>et</i>, <i>hashamayim</i>, <i>ve’et</i>, <i>ha’aretz</i>, <i>ve-ha’aretz</i>, <i>hayta</i>, <i>tohu</i>, <i>vavohu</i>, <i>ve’ḥoshekh</i>, <i>al</i>, <i>penei</i>, <i>tehom</i>, <i>ve-ru’aḥ</i>, that is, up to the second [instance of the word] <i>Elohim</i>. These thirteen words allude to those thirteen petals of the lily among the thorns, in the mystical secret of the pool that stands above twelve oxen, as explained above. These [thirteen entities] are the preparations for the Assembly of Israel, to receive the thirteen measures of mercy. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states <b>“surrounding and protecting the Assembly of Israel,”</b> because the thirteen attributes of mercy, which form the completed brains<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The term “brains” can be thought of as similar to the human concept of consciousness. When a person understands more, he or she can be thought of as “more conscious.” Similarly, when there are changes in particular levels, like when a level ascends to the level above it as a result of the process of expansiveness, it is described as having more “brains,” meaning increased exposure to the supernal light that is accessible at those higher levels.</i> of <i>Nukba</i>, are seen as surrounding her and illuminating her from all sides, all the way around. Through them [<i>Nukba</i>] is guarded from contact with external forces, for as long as she lacks the mature brains with the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from the thirteen measures, external forces can suckle from her.

Paragraph 2

<b>2. Afterward,</b> the name Elohim <b>appears once more</b>, that is, <i>Elohim meraḥefet</i> "[the spirit] of God hovered…”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:2.</i> <b>Why is it mentioned again? To generate the five hard leaves that surround the lily. These five leaves are called salvations, and they are five gates. It is stated with regard to this secret: “I will raise the cup of salvation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 116:13.</i> This is the cup of blessing, which must rest on five fingers, no more, just as the lily rests on five hard leaves, which correspond to the five fingers. This lily is the cup of blessing. There are five words from the second name Elohim to the third name Elohim,</b> and they are: <i>meraḥefet</i>, <i>al</i>, <i>penei</i>, <i>hamayim</i>, <i>va’yomer</i> (“hovered over the surface of the water. And said,”).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:2-3</i> These correspond to the five aforementioned leaves. <b>From this point onward,</b> when [the verse] states, “And God said: Let there be light,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3</i> this refers to <b>the light that was created and hidden away, and which is included in that covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Yesod</i> which corresponds to the male sexual organ.</i> as it entered the lily and seeded it. This is what is called the “tree that makes fruit, and its seed is within it”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:11.</i></b> [Genesis 1:11], <b>and that seed is actually in the sign of the covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained below, these "seeds" are found in the "sign of the covenant," referring to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. <i>Yesod</i> corresponds to the male reproductive organ, which the Torah requires to undergo circumcision. This procedure is the "sign of the covenant." Accordingly, the intent in the phrasing here is that these seeds are "inside the sign of the covenant," the conceptual circumcised organ of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>.</i></b>
Explanation: <b>“Five forceful leaves” –</b> This refers to the five restraints (<i>gevurot</i>) of the <i>Nukba</i>, which are the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the returning light that the <i>Nukba</i> raises up by means of the fusion through collision with the supernal light and is called the "light of judgment." The ten <i>sefirot</i> of the direct light are called five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>), ḤGT NH (<i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>), and these are enclothed in the five restraints of the returning light ḤGT NH. These five leaves are forceful, [representing] the forces of judgment that are in the partition, which prevents the supernal light from enclothing from the partition downward.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A useful way to understand this paragraph is by contrasting “giving” and “restraint.” The <i>Nukba</i>, identified and largely synonymous with the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, represents the will to receive the bestowal of the Creator. Because of the first constriction and the partition that rests upon <i>Malkhut</i>, this vessel for God's supernal light is unable to receive the light directly. Instead, the partition gives rise to the returning light, a new vessel for the direct light. The vessel of returning light cannot receive the full amount of the direct light, however. As a result, one can think of the returning light as a pipe that can contain a limited amount of the direct light. This limitation is associated with the power of judgment that lies in <i>Malkhut</i> and which is manifest through the partition. Thus, the five-<i>sefirot</i> structure of the returning light is described as "five leaves of restraint," forceful in their rejection of the supernal light in its direct form. In contrast, the five-<i>sefirot</i> structure of the direct light is described as "givings" (<i>ḥassadim</i>), reflecting the boundless nature of the supernal light in its primal, direct manifestation.</i>
This is why they are now called only <b>“five forceful leaves,”</b> since [the partition] is, as yet, unfit for fusion upon it. At the time of maturity, when the partition enters into fusion [through collision] with the supernal light, they are called five restraints, as was explained previously.
These five forceful leaves constitute the mystical meaning of the five words that appear from the second <i>Elohim</i> to the third <i>Elohim</i>: <i>meraḥefet</i>, <i>al</i>, <i>penei</i>, <i>hamayim</i>, <i>va’yomer</i>. This is why [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] asks <b>“why is it mentioned again,”</b> which implies that there is a new action here. He answers that it is in order to extract these five forceful leaves from the <i>Nukba</i>, which are the preparation for a fusion through collision during the phase of maturity.
The reason these ten <i>sefirot</i> of the returning light are called five restraints, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, and <i>Hod</i>, and they are not called <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, is because they draw forth only the light of giving (<i>ḥassadim</i>). Therefore <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> descend from their status and are called <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, while <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> are called <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>.
This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states <b>“five gates…the cup of salvation”</b> which is at the time of maturity, when the five forceful leaves become five restraints. At that point they are considered five gates, which are open gates to receive the five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) of the direct light. This is also the reason they are called “salvations.” Then the <i>Nukba</i> is called <b>“the cup of salvation,”</b> or <b>“the cup of blessing,”</b> since through the qualities [of the gates], the <i>Nukba</i> becomes a vessel that holds the blessing, which is those five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) mentioned previously.
Now, the number of <i>sefirot</i> have two aspects; either they are ten in number, which are essentially five levels, as stated above, or thirteen in number, like the thirteen attributes of mercy. The difference between them is that the number ten is indicative of the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, in which there is only light of giving (<i>ḥassadim</i>). The number thirteen indicates the brains of the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is received into <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. This issue is clarified in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, below.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There is a different numbering of the <i>sefirot</i> that the author of the <i>Sulam</i> explains later in his commentary. This alternate structure numbers thirteen, as referred to here, and corresponds to the thirteen attributes of mercy.</i>
[Rabbi Ḥizkiya] then states that <b>“the cup of blessing,”</b> which is representative of the five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) being drawn into the five restraints, as stated, <b>“must rest on five fingers,”</b> i.e., only in the number ten, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, and <i>Hod</i>, as stated, and <b>“no more,”</b> that is, to the exclusion of the number thirteen.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This means that instead of having the extra three <i>sefirot</i> here that would be a structure of thirteen, there is only a structure of ten, as a result of the "five fingers" (the five restraints, and no more) that are holding the cup of blessing (the five givings).</i> The reason [why it is only ten] is that the <i>Nukba</i> is fit to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> from the mystical meaning of the thirteen only through the enclothing of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the light of giving (<i>ḥassadim</i>). Therefore, it is first necessary to draw forth a blessing, which is five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) by means of specifically five fingers, which are the five restraints, and subsequently [the <i>Nukba</i>] can also receive from the thirteen.
The implication here is that [the five fingers] refers to the five fingers of the left hand, which [represent] five restraints, since the five fingers of the right hand constitute the mystical meaning of five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>). Accordingly, the cup of blessing must be raised with both hands, i.e., with the five fingers of the left hand as well, in order to allude to the aforementioned intention of the five restraints. Afterward, however, at the start of the blessing, only the five fingers of the right hand should remain on the cup, as one should not awaken the grip of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which suckles from the left.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since the overall concept here is that of the five givings becoming contained within the vessels of the five restraints, the author of the <i>Sulam</i> is now explaining a practical Torah custom that reflects this concept. In Torah thought, the right side of the body represents giving, while the left represents restraint. Thus, the five fingers of the right hand represent the five <i>sefirot</i> of giving mentioned in this section. Similarly, the five fingers of the left hand represent the five <i>sefirot</i> of restraint. Thus, the cup of blessing, representing the side of giving, must be held with both hands initially. At the point of blessing, however, the left side is meant to be reduced, so that only blessing is expressed, and no restraint should be exerted over the cup of blessing at that time. The final point here is the mention of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, literally "the Other Side." This concept is the result of God's own restraint in the universe, as He allows the created beings to make their own choices, even if those choices seem to negate the reality of God. It is this restraint that allows for <i>kelippot</i> to exist, external forces that appear to us as outside of God. Thus, an overemphasis on restraint in the wrong context (such as a blessing context) allows the forces of "the left" (the <i>kelippot</i>) to be strengthened.</i>
This is why [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] said, <b>“from this point onward, the light [etc.].”</b> This means to say that the third <i>Elohim</i> in the verse, “Let there be light etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3.</i> comes to emanate the aspect of maturity of <i>Nukba</i>, which is five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) and the thirteen attributes of mercy, as the five givings constitute the mystical meaning of the five mentions of “light” in the passage, which are: “Let there be light,” “and there was light,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3.</i> “that the light was good,” “between the light,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:4.</i> and “the light, day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:5.</i> The thirteen attributes of mercy are alluded to in the verse: “And there was evening and there was morning, one [<i>eḥad</i>] day,”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:5.</i> since <i>eḥad</i> is the mystical meaning of thirteen and it also has a numerical value of thirteen. These five lights constitute the mystical meaning of the statement of the Sages: “Through the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam could observe from one end of the world to the other. But when the Holy One, Blessed be He, looked upon the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion and saw their corrupt ways, He arose and concealed it from them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ḥagiga</i> 12a</i> This is why [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] says <b>“which was created and hidden away.”</b>
This is why [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] said, <b>“and was included in that covenant, which entered the lily.”</b> Meaning, these five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) were first incorporated in the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and did not come directly from <i>Bina</i>, which is called <i>Elohim</i>, to the <i>Nukba</i>. The covenant is the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which <b>entered the lily</b> and gave them to [the <i>Nukba</i>]. The reason will be explained presently.
Now, these five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) that emerge upon the five restraints (<i>gevurot</i>), as stated, are called “seed.” Also, you should know that the main power of the judgments and restraints in the partition, through the power of which [the partition] collides with the supernal light and rebuffs it [as returning light], is found only in the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The power of judgment and restraint is generally associated with <i>Malkhut</i> and the partition that was placed upon it after the first constriction. Every level and every <i>sefira</i> is made up of all ten <i>sefirot</i>. As a result, the bottom of <i>Yesod</i> is the level of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Yesod</i>, and thus, it possesses these forces and attributes of judgment and restraint. Additionally, the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Yesod</i> corresponds to the male reproductive organ on the human body. The "bottom" of that organ is the glans, referred to as an <i>atara</i> (literally, a crown, coronet or circlet).</i> which it drew from <i>Mazal ve-Nakeh</i> in the <i>dikna</i>, whereas the <i>Nukba</i> receives from it only an illumination and a branch.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Every burst of <i>shefa</i> must flow from the <i>Ein Sof</i> until the level to which it belongs, passing through various levels along its way. The <i>Zohar</i> does not always mention the various intermediating levels in such a process. In this context, the author of the <i>Sulam</i> references one of these intermediating levels. <i>Malkhut</i> (<i>Nukba</i>), in order to mature, must receive an illumination from the level called “<i>mazal ve-nakeh</i>,” literally, “the flow and the cleansing,” through the <i>Yesod</i> level of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. <i>Mazal ve-nakeh</i> is part of a level called the <i>dikna</i>, literally, “the beard,” referring to the “beard” of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> (the <i>partzuf</i> associated with <i>Keter</i>). The beard, in this context, represents the lights that belong to the mature aspect of the level, that expansive maturity that was constricted in the first constriction. Since the level is currently immature, as was mentioned above, it cannot contain this level of light, a level of maturity. Instead, the level uses returning light as a vessel to contain the lights, and that vessel, as a dynamic of encompassing containment, is described as “the beard,” since the beard surrounds the lower part of the head, which is the source of the higher lights under discussion. On the one hand, the beard is associated with the lights of maturity. On the other hand, the beard was generated as returning light resulting from the fusion through collision against the partition containing constriction and judgment, and thus, the beard is considered a force of judgment and restraint. When the phase of maturity arrives, the beard itself is divided up into thirteen levels of rectification which correspond to the thirteen <i>sefirot</i> that are present in the phase of maturity, as will be explained. When the beard of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is in this phase, its lowest <i>sefira</i>, the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is called the “<i>mazal ve-nakeh</i>,” the “flow and the cleansing.” The word “<i>nakeh</i>” stems from the thirteen attributes of mercy; <i>nakeh</i> is the thirteenth attribute in the Biblical text listing the thirteen attributes. The word “<i>mazal</i>” refers to the flow of <i>shefa</i> that this <i>sefira</i> transmits from the beard of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and ultimately, to the <i>Nukba</i>.</i> Therefore, the main fusion through collision on the partition, which raises the five restraints that extend and enclothe the five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>), the five aforementioned lights, is performed in the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and it is [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] which gives those [lights] to the <i>Nukba</i>. For this reason, [Rabbi Ḥizkiya] specifies that <b>“that seed,”</b> which refers to five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) and five restraints <b>“exists in the actual sign of the covenant.”</b> For it is in the sign of the covenant, which is the coronet (<i>ateret</i>) of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, that the full actuality of the restraints that draw forth five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>), which is called “seed,” is found. However, the [level of] <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> receives only a reflection of the restraints [of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], and therefore the <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> is called only by the name "reflection of the covenant."<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Nukba</i> receives the five givings enclothed within the five restraints from the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. As the author of the <i>Sulam</i> explained above, the partition of the <i>Nukba</i> gives rise to the returning light that is represented here by the five restraints, serving as containers for the five givings. The section concludes with the observation that the <i>Nukba</i> receives from the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, but the <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> itself, used to transmit to lower levels of existence is only a reflection of the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. This is similar to the male/female relationship of intimacy, in which the female receives from the male, then "transmits" the function of <i>Yesod</i> back a "reflection" of what she received (a child).</i>

Paragraph 3

<b>3. And just like the reflection of the covenant was sown in forty-two fusions from that seed, so was the engraved and explicit name seeded with the forty-two letters of the act of creation.</b>
Explanation: The mystical meaning of the forty-two lettered name [of God] is simple <i>Havaya</i>, and a “filled” <i>Havaya</i>, and a “filled” of a “filled” <i>Havaya</i>, which contain forty-two letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The "simple" <i>Havaya</i> is simply the four letters <i>yod-heh-vav-heh</i>. A "filled" spelling of this name actually spells out the pronounced letter's name, like "<i>yod</i>" being spelled with three letters (<i>y-o-d</i>), instead of just the one letter <i>yod</i>. A "filled" "filled" spelling involves actually spelling out the already spelled out letters, like <i>yod</i> being spelled out as <i>yod</i>-<i>vav</i>-<i>dalet</i>, spelling out <i>yod</i>. The simple spelling is four letters, the filled spelling is ten letters, and the filled spelling is twenty-eight letters, for a total of forty-two.</i> This will be explained in in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>. That seed which is present in the sign of the covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous sections, this refers to the coronet (<i>ateret</i>) of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, corresponding to the circumcision on a Jewish man's reproductive organ, the "sign of the covenant" of <i>Brit Mila</i> (ritual circumcision).</i> which is five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) and five restraints (<i>gevurot</i>), as stated previously, is drawn from the forty-two-letter name [of God].
This the meaning of <b>“just like the reflection of the covenant,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>, <b>“was sown in forty-two fusions from that seed, so was the engraved and explicit name sown in the forty-two letters of the act of creation.”</b> The explanation: one can discern two aspects in the <i>Nukba</i>: The first is the construction of her <i>partzuf</i>, built by the <i>Bina</i>, which is explained here in the act of the creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the phase of immaturity.</i> The second is her fusion with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called “the secret of the unification.” This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] says, <b>“just like the reflection of the covenant,”</b> which is the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i>, <b>“was sown in forty-two fusions from that seed,”</b> of the sign of the covenant, as this phenomenon is through “the secret of the unification,” i.e., in the mystical meaning of the fusion. Through this you can extrapolate to the order of the emanation of the construction of the <i>Nukba</i> by means of <i>Bina</i>, called “the act of creation,” that it was also in the mystical meaning of the name of forty-two.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that one can extrapolate backward from the seeding of <i>Nukba</i> from <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, through the forty-two fusions, to the actual formation of the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Nukba</i> itself, which transpired through <i>Bina</i> and similarly used the forty-two letter name.</i>
As you know, there are two phases in the construction of the <i>Nukba</i>, phases of immaturity and maturity. Now, the immaturity is called “engraved,” which means engravement of a receptacle for the lights of the phase of maturity, as everything that is received by the <i>Nukba</i> at the time of maturity requires preparation and qualification during the phase of immaturity (as stated in section 1, above, in the paragraph beginning “The brains"). [The immature phase] is therefore called “engraved.” [The <i>Nukba</i>'s] phase of maturity is called “explicit,” because everything that was embedded during the phase of immaturity is clarified and becomes known at the time of maturity. This is [Rabbi Ḥizkiya's] meaning when he states: <b>“So was seeded the engraved and explicit name”</b> – the <i>Nukba</i> is called “name,” and “engraved” is her immaturity, while “explicit” is her maturity. They too were sown and constructed through the forty-two letters, like the forty-two fusions in “the secret of the unification” in the sign of the covenant. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] says, <b>“in the forty-two letters of the act of creation”</b> is the forty-two letters which appear here from <i>Bereshit</i> [“In the beginning”] until the letter <i>bet</i> of <i>va-vohu</i> [“and void,” Genesis 2:2].

Paragraph 4

<b>4. “In the beginning. Rabbi Shimon etc.”</b><br><b>“In the beginning.” Rabbi Shimon began</b> [his discourse with the following exposition]: <b>“The sprouts appeared on the earth</b>; [the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land” [Song of Songs 2:12]]<b>. “The flowers” – this</b> is <b>the act of creation – “appeared on the earth.” When?</b> It is <b>on the third day, as it is stated: “And the earth brought forth”</b> [Genesis 1:12] <b>then they appeared on the earth. “The time of singing [<i>zamir</i>] has come” – this</b> is <b>the fourth day, when there was the pruning [<i>zamir</i>] of tyrants,</b> as this is why it is written on [that day]: “Let there be <b>lights”</b> [“<i>me’orot</i>”; Genesis 1:14], <b>without a <i>vav</i></b>, which implies a curse [<i>me’ora</i>]<b>. “And the voice of the turtledove” – this</b> is <b>the fifth day,</b> regarding which <b>it is stated: “Let the waters swarm</b> with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven” [Genesis 1:20]<b>, to produce offspring. “Is heard” – this</b> is <b>the sixth day,</b> regarding which <b>it is stated: “Let us make man”</b> [Genesis 1:26], <b>who in the future will make “doing” precede “hearing,” as it is written here “let us make man,” and it is written there: “We will do and we will hear”</b> [“<i>na’aseh ve-nishma</i>”; Exodus 24:7]. <b>“In our land” – this</b> is <b>the day of Shabbat, which is like the land of the living</b>, the World-to-Come<b>.</b>
The explanation of this: <b>“The sprouts – this</b> is <b>the act of creation.”</b> That is, the six days of creation, which are the six extremities, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, from which the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are constructed. For the <i>Nukba</i> has nothing of its own and its entire construction is from that which <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> gives it. [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain here how the <i>Nukba</i> was gradually constructed from the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. He states: <b>“appeared on the earth – when? On the third day,”</b> for the <i>Nukba</i> is called “earth,” and he says that the sprouts, which are the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, were received and appeared in the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called “earth,” on the third day of the act of creation. Now, [the past tense of] “appeared” implies that [the sprouts] once appeared in that fashion and now they appear differently. This is why [Rabbi Shimon] asks, “when was this?” and he answers that it was on the third day, which is <i>Tiferet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Given that the seven days of creation correspond to the seven lower <i>sefirot</i>, the third day corresponds to <i>Tiferet</i>.</i> The meaning is that [the <i>Nukba</i>] was initially emanated in the mystical meaning of “the two great lights” [Genesis 1:16], at which stage [the <i>Nukba</i>] was equivalent to <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Thus, she was emanated on the third day, together with <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called the third day of the act of creation. He then states: <b>“it is like [</b>the phrase] <b>'they appeared on the earth,'”</b> i.e., since this state [of equivalency] would not remain in the <i>Nukba</i>, as [Rabbi Shimon] explains below, the verse therefore says <b>“appeared on the earth,”</b> meaning [the past tense], that they appeared once in that form, after which <b>“the time of pruning has come.”</b>
<b>“This is the fourth day, when there was the pruning of tyrants”</b> – for on the fourth day the moon, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, was diminished, as the Sages said that the moon complained, saying that it is impossible for two kings to use a single crown, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to her: “Go and diminish yourself” [<i>Ḥullin</i> 60b]. [<i>Nukba</i>] then descended into a point under the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is in reference to the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.</i> and her lower nine [<i>sefirot</i>] fell into <i>Beria</i>, such that [<i>Nukba</i>] was left with nothing in <i>Atzilut</i> other than the point of her <i>Keter</i>, while she was positioned under the <i>Yesod</i>. From here onward, she is gradually constructed by <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as Rabbi Shimon proceeds to explain. This is called <b>“the pruning of tyrants,”</b> because the diminishing becomes a preparation and a receptacle for receiving the brains<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, "brains" refers to a particular level of supernal light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. <i>Nukba</i>'s access to this light "prunes" the destructive lower forces that are blocked off from that higher supernal light.</i> of <i>ḥaya</i>, as these brains cut off all of the <i>kelippot</i> that hold onto the <i>Nukba</i>. <i>Zamir</i> [“pruning”] is an expression of cutting off, while <b>“tyrants”</b> are the externalities and the <i>kelippot</i> that surround the rose.
He then states: <b>“And the voice of the turtledove – this is the fifth day.”</b> The turtledove is <i>Netzaḥ</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, while “the voice of the turtledove” is <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and that is the fifth day of the act of creation. Since <i>Nukba</i> receives from the <i>Hod</i> which is incorporated in <i>Netzaḥ</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, this reception is therefore called “the voice of the turtledove.”
[Rabbi Shimon] proceeds: <b>“Is heard – this is the sixth day.”</b> In other words, the voice of the turtledove is received into the <i>Nukba</i> only by means of the sixth day, which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> that incorporates <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> together and gives them to <i>Nukba</i>. Accordingly, [Rabbi Shimon] states that it is heard by the <i>Nukba</i> only on the sixth day. This is the rule: The <i>Nukba</i> receives only from the middle line of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is <i>Da'at</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> [together], or [individually] from either <i>Da'at</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, or <i>Yesod</i>.
<b>“As it is written, ‘Let us make man,” who in the future will precede ‘doing’ to ‘hearing.’”</b> “Hearing” is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i>, as seeing and hearing are <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, while “doing” is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i>. It is known, with regard to the mystical meaning of the second constriction, that the lower <i>heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> in the second constriction.</i> ascended to the apertures of the eyes,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The "aperture of the eyes" refers to the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the head of a <i>partzuf</i>.</i> in order for [<i>Malkhut</i>] to participate with the attribute of mercy which is the supernal <i>Bina</i>. Thus, the father removed the mother outside,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As the author of the <i>Sulam</i> explains, this refers to the ejection of <i>Bina</i> from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> as a result of the second constriction.</i> while the father himself was established like a male and female.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In the state of the second constriction, in the level of <i>Atzilut</i>, each <i>partzuf</i> received a female component of <i>Nukba</i>. Thus, the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> (the <i>Ḥokhma</i> <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>) receives a female component.</i> For the eyes are the mystical meaning of the father,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The eyes of the head of a <i>partzuf</i>, referenced above, are the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of that <i>partzuf</i>. <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the flow of the animating supernal light of the Creator, represents the "masculine waters," the flow from the Creator to the created beings. Accordingly, the level of the eyes are described as "father."</i> and by virtue of the ascent of the lower <i>heh</i> to him, the fusion through collision of the head was at the lower <i>heh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">When <i>Malkhut</i> ascends in the second constriction, this allows <i>Malkhut</i> to participate in fusion through collision in the upper areas of the head meaning the apertures of the eyes.</i> which is called the apertures of the eyes. As a consequence, the mother, which is <i>Bina</i>, left the head for the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, this refers to the ejection of <i>Bina</i> from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and its descent to the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.</i> This is the mystical meaning of the fact that in <i>Arikh Anpin</i> there is only <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> in its head, while <i>Bina</i> emerged to the body.
The result is that “doing,” which is the lower <i>heh</i>, <i>Malkhut</i>, precedes “hearing,” which is <i>Bina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Malkhut</i>, representing the level of "doing," is operating in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, it "precedes" <i>Bina</i>, representing "hearing," in the chain of transmission from above to below.</i> This is the mystical meaning of the statement in the <i>Tikkunim</i> [69]: “‘I am sleeping’ [<i>yeshena</i>, Song of Songs 5:2] is certainly second [<i>sheniyah</i>] to <i>Ḥokhma</i>”; see there. For the father is established with a <i>Nukba</i> which is called “I [<i>ani</i>],”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, received a pairing <i>Nukba</i> as a result of the second constriction. Thus, the "father is established with a <i>Nukba</i> which is called 'I.'" The point from the <i>Tikkunim</i> is that "I," meaning this <i>Nukba</i>, is "second," meaning parallel to <i>Ḥokhma</i> in its ranking of second relative to <i>Keter</i>, above.</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> became like the father, the second <i>sefira</i> after <i>Keter</i>. [The <i>Tikkunim</i>] expounds that <i>yeshenah</i> [sleeping] has the same letters as <i>sheniyah</i> [second], and “I am [<i>ani</i>] sleeping” is like “I am [<i>ani</i>] second”; see there.
On account of the ascent of the <i>Malkhut</i> to the apertures of the eyes, she became greatly tempered there, and she subsequently became fit to ascend and enclothe the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and to receive the brains, which are the brains<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, "brains" refers to a particular level of supernal light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. In this context, since <i>Malkhut</i> ascended and became fit to enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, <i>Malkhut</i> now has access to the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to which <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> have access.</i> of <i>ḥaya</i>, like the [the <i>partzuf</i>] of the supernal mother. This is the mystical meaning of the moon in its fullness.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Malkhut</i> was diminished when it was paired with <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> initially, but through this process, <i>Malkhut</i> regains access to the supernal light and returns to its "fullness."</i> Therefore, at the giving of the Torah, Israel said “we will do” before “we will hear,” and [thus] they made “doing” precede “hearing.” They thereby merited to receive the Torah [see <i>Shabbat</i> 89b]. The “doing,” which is <i>Malkhut</i>, ascended and enclothed the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and the mystical meaning of the Jubilee was revealed, which is the fiftieth gate.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the fifty gates of <i>Bina</i>, accessed during the spiritual process at Mount Sinai during the giving of the Torah.</i>
This is the meaning of the statement here that the hearing was therefore on the sixth day, as it was on that [day] that this rectification was performed, to make “doing” precede “hearing,” as at the Giving of the Torah. Consequently, the <i>Malkhut</i> on the [first] Shabbat of Creation became like “the land of the living,” which is the mystical meaning of the [<i>partzuf</i> of the] supernal mother, as [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain. This topic is extremely profound; see the <i>Marot HaSulam</i> here, where we elaborate on this matter.
<b>“In our land – this is the day of Shabbat, which is like the land of the living.”</b> The supernal mother is called “the land of the living.” By means of that which was bestowed on the sixth day, the <i>Nukba</i> ascended on the Shabbat of <i>Bereshit</i>, [the seventh day of Creation] up to the supernal mother, and the <i>Nukba</i> also became like the land of the living. For this is the rule – if a lower entity ascends to a higher one, it becomes exactly like it.

Paragraph 5

<b>5. An alternative explanation: The flowers, these are etc.</b><br><b>An alternative explanation: “The flowers”</b> [Song of Songs 2:12] – <b>these are the Patriarchs, who entered into thought and entered into the World-to-Come,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, <b>and were concealed there. From there, they emerged in concealment and were hidden in the true prophets. Joseph was born, and they were hidden in him. Joseph entered the Holy Land and established them there, and then they “appeared on the earth” and were revealed there. When are</b> they <b>seen? When the rainbow is seen in the world. For when the rainbow is seen in the world, then they are revealed. And at that hour, “the time of pruning has come,”</b> that is, <b>the time to chop off the wicked from the world. Why were they spared? Because “the flowers appeared on the earth.” Had they not appeared already, they would not have remained in the world, and the world would not have survived.</b>
Explanation: Here [Rabbi Shimon] explains the verse cited above, with regard to the attainment of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> itself. He says that the flowers surround <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are called the Patriarchs. For the <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are called “sons,” and they<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These two groupings of <i>sefirot</i> each represent one <i>partzuf</i> structure.</i> are two <i>partzufim</i> that are split apart on the chest of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, since <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> are called the large [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, while <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> are called the small [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. [Rabbi Shimon] is therefore precise in telling us that [he is discussing] the large [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which is why he says <b>“Patriarchs.”</b> They are called “flowers,” which means sprouts, because they progressively grow, like sprouts. Their level was initially like <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, and subsequently they became [of the level of] <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, through the drawing in [of light in infancy], after which, in the first maturity, they became [the level of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i> of <i>neshama</i>, and then, in the second maturity, they became <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i> of <i>ḥaya</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The author of the <i>Sulam</i> is describing four phases in the development of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, represented by each of the four structures of <i>sefirot</i> mentioned here.</i>
He then states: <b>“Entered in thought and entered into the World-to-Come.”</b> This is referring to the gestation<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first of four phases in the evolution of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> in the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. In this phase, the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> are embedded inside of the lower <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, "gestating" within them.</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, since at the time of its gestation it ascends to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>, the <i>partzuf</i> that gives the aspects of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> access to the supernal light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> when <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> ascends to receive it.</i> which is called “thought” and “the World-to-Come”; the father is called “thought” and the mother is called “the World-to-Come.” The beginning of the construction of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in “three within three” occurs there, meaning that that <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> are enclothed within <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. This is the mystical meaning of [the statement]: “The sprouts were like antenna of grasshoppers” – they were uprooted from there, planted elsewhere, and grew. The plantings are the Patriarchs, as stated, who, at their root, are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>. Through their ascent for purposes of gestation into <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, that is, when they are planted elsewhere, these [aspects of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] obtained there the tempered <i>Malkhut</i>, which is fit for brains at the time of maturity.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The purpose of these phases of gestation, infancy and maturity (which has two phases itself) is to develop the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> to receive the "brains," the lights of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This also requires a "tempering" of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> through a complex process, since the presence of the first constriction upon <i>Malkhut</i> repels the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> They thereby grew slowly through gestation, and subsequently through infancy, and then through the first maturity, and finally through the second maturity, as [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain. The meaning of <b>“from there, they emerged in concealment”</b> is that after <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> receive all the brains of gestation, they are born and emerge from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The ascent of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> marks the gestation phase in which the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> ultimately emerge from <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. At this point, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> gain access to an increased amount of the light of giving, the "brains" of that level which is the light of <i>ruaḥ</i>. The <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> is still not complete at this point, so the light is still "diminished."</i> to their place below, <b>“and emerge in concealment,”</b> since even after their emergence from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> to their place they still remained in concealment, that is, in diminished light.
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“And were hidden in the true prophets.”</b> In other words, through the attainment of the brains of infancy, the designated light is drawn to the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are called <b>“the true prophets.</b> Then the <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> spread forth from the <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> attained the six extremities. And yet, [the six extremities] remain hidden, as they are still concealed from the [the first three <i>sefirot</i>, which are the] brains of the head, and they have only [the lights of] <i>nefesh</i> and <i>ruaḥ</i> alone. This is why [Rabbi Shimon] stated <b>“and were hidden within the true prophets.”</b> The true prophets are <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>, [the vessels] that were attained through infancy, but [the Patriarchs] were hidden in them and their light was still concealed and not revealed. Know that there is always an inverse relation between vessels and lights. This is because in the case of the lights, the light of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, which is <i>ruaḥ</i>, is attained through infancy, whereas in the case of the vessels, the vessels of <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> are attained through infancy, and the light of <i>nefesh</i> that was in <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, descends in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Here the Sulam references a core principle in spiritual mechanics. Kabbalah structures revolve around the linked constructs of "vessels" and "lights." There are five main vessels corresponding to five main lights. The point here is that the process of development of these two groups has an inverse relationship. Vessels always develop from the highest level of vessel and downward, with the lowest vessel developing last. In contrast, lights populate the existing vessels from the lowest light and upward, with the highest light entering the vessel structure last. This means that if there is only one vessel developed in a structure, it will be the highest vessel, that of <i>Keter</i>. Additionally, the light populating that lone vessel would be the light of <i>nefesh</i>, the lowest light.</i> Similarly, with regard to the brains of maturity,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the next level above infancy of lights in the development process, the brains of maturity.</i> in relation to the lights, it is considered that the lights of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i> have been attained, whereas in relation to the vessels, it is considered that the vessel of <i>Yesod</i> of maturity has been attained, as stated below.
This [preceding statement] is what [Rabbi Shimon] meant when he said: <b>“Joseph was born, and they were hidden in him.”</b> After the completion of the brains of infancy, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ascends for a second gestation for the brains of the first maturity. Through these brains, [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>'s infancy,] <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> become <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>, [forming] the head [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], and the <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> that [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] acquired through infancy become <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> for [the <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. New [vessels of] <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> are born, which are called “<i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of the brains of maturity.” Those [<i>sefirot</i> of] <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> are called Joseph, who is the <i>Yesod</i> of maturity, which incorporates <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> of maturity. This is the meaning of <b>“Joseph was born,”</b> i.e., the <i>Yesod</i> of maturity.
[Rabbi Shimon] says <b>“and they were hidden in him”</b> to teach us that <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> still do not have the complete lights of maturity and they remain in concealment [from the complete lights]. This is because in the first maturity <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> obtains only the brains of <i>neshama</i>, which are still considered the back<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In this context, the term "back" indicates a comparative lack of importance, like when a person carelessly tosses something behind him.</i> in relation to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. He therefore says that <b>“they were hidden in him,”</b> i.e., they remained in concealment.
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“Joseph entered the Holy Land and established them.”</b> After the brains of the first maturity, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> begins to receive the brains of the second maturity, which are the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. The <i>Nukba</i> is subsequently excised from <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and is constructed as a whole <i>partzuf</i> with the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. Then, the <i>Nukba</i> is called <b>“the Holy Land,”</b> because the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> are called “holy.” [Rabbi Shimon] thus said that Joseph, who is the <i>Yesod</i> of the maturity of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>“entered the Holy Land,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>,<b>[</b>when it is] face-to-face with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, at an equal level.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The imagery here is sexual in nature. As the <i>Nukba</i> is separated from <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and formed into a separate <i>partzuf</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> enter into a state of pairing (like "mating") or "fusion." The <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> conceptually represents the sexual organ of the male, "transmitting" to the female (in this case, <i>Nukba</i>). This is the meaning of "Joseph (the <i>Yesod</i>) entered the Holy Land (the fully formed <i>Nukba</i>).</i> <b>“And established them there”</b> means specifically in the "Holy Land," since the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, are drawn out only at the time of fusion, when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are in the mystical [state of] of oneness. The [brains of <i>ḥaya</i>] remain only in the domain of the <i>Nukba</i>, since [the <i>Nukba</i>] is the cause of the drawing down of [these lights] during the time of copulation. That is why [Rabbi Shimon] states “<b>and established them there,”</b> i.e., in her home. The reason [why these lights remain only with <i>Nukba</i>] is that the quality of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> with respect to the <i>Nukba</i> is like the quality of the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> with respect to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> requires the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, in addition to the light of giving. This <i>partzuf</i> is the lower <i>partzuf</i> of the level of <i>Bina</i> in <i>Atzilut</i> (and downward). <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> generally refers to the upper <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Bina</i> which, in contrast to <i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, only draws the light of giving. Similarly here, <i>Nukba</i> draws the greater light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the light of <i>ḥaya</i>, while <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> is more like <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, drawing relatively more of the light of giving.</i> Consequently, the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, is revealed only in <i>Nukba</i>, which is considered <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> [in relation to <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. This is the meaning of the ensuing statement, <b>“and then they appeared on the earth and were revealed there.”</b> In other words, they are now revealed in the proper quality of maturity, but until now they were considered hidden and concealed.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“When are they seen</b> etc.” One should not ask: But he already explained this earlier, that they are revealed when Joseph ascends to the Holy Land, that is, at the time of the copulation, and he also informed us that the place of the manifestation is in the <i>Nukba</i>, and if so, why does he again ask, <b>“when are they seen”</b>? The explanation is that even at the time of the copulation there are two aspects, as there is the incorporation of the left in the right, i.e., in the mystical meaning of the five givings (<i>ḥassadim</i>) in the male, and there is the incorporation of the right in the left, in the mystical meaning of the five restraints in the <i>Nukba</i>. He therefore asks when they are seen, whether in the mystical meaning of the incorporation of the right in the left, or in the mystical meaning of the incorporation of the left in the right.
He answers: <b>“When the rainbow is seen in the world.</b> The <b>“rainbow”</b> is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; <b>“in the world”</b> means the <i>Nukba</i>, which is the incorporation of the right in the left at the time of the fusion, in the mystical meaning of “I have set My bow in the cloud etc.” [Genesis 9:13]. He is saying that the higher brains are drawn only from that aspect, and this is the meaning of <b>“then they are revealed,”</b> i.e., only from the incorporation of the right in the left.
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“And at that hour, the time of pruning has come, the time to chop off the wicked from the world.”</b> When the wicked multiply in the world, on whose account the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> have gained a strong footing, as occurred in the time of the generation of the flood – on account of which every living thing was wiped out – at that stage, the inhabitants of the world have no remedy other than through the revelation of the aforementioned supernal brains, which are the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, as [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain. The clause <b>“why were they spared – because the flowers appeared”</b> means the following: Why are people spared destruction, as occurred in the days of the flood? It is because <b>“</b>the flowers appeared on the earth.” [This refers to how] the revelation of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> remove the <i>kelippot</i> from the earth, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, and [the <i>kelippot</i>] no longer have a hold upon it. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant” [Genesis 9:16].
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“Had they not appeared, they would not have remained in the world</b> etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained, each usage of "they" in this line refers to something different.</i> There is a great secret here. For the <i>Nukba</i> was initially constructed in the mystical meaning of the two great lights,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See the end of the Sulam's "Introduction to the Commentary of the Sulam," where this is explained fully. The core concept here is that the textual reference in Genesis 1:16 to the two "great lights" of the sun and the moon refers to <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>.</i> at which time the <i>Nukba</i> had an equal level to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. However, [<i>Nukba</i>] stands at the back of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is why the moon complained that two kings cannot use a single crown. Therefore, these brains [attained by <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> in that state] are considered the brains of the back,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">These are the incomplete brains of the first maturity of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>.</i> and they are accordingly called the brains of the six extremities of <i>Nukba</i>, which are the brains of her immaturity, i.e., [the brains of] her initial formation. At that time, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are considered “small faces,” and they are called “children,” “youths,” and “youngsters.” However, once <i>Nukba</i> has been completed with these brains [of the back], she returns for a second gestation to the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and then [the <i>Nukba</i>] is built as a major structure, with the brains of the face-to-face with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and then they are called the “large faces.” It is known that there is no change or loss in the spiritual, and [thus] those [previously attained] brains of the back, the small face, remain in [<i>Nukba</i>] even at the time of the brains of maturity. Furthermore, the cause of the drawing down of the aforementioned brains of <i>ḥaya</i> lies primarily in the vessels of the brains of the back in the mystical meaning of the small face.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the vessels for the lights of the brains of the back are the activating cause of the drawing down of the higher lights of the brains of the face.</i> And this is the meaning of: <b>“Had they not appeared already, they would not have remained in the world.”</b> That is, had those flowers [representing the brains of the back] not appeared in the <i>Nukba</i> already at the time of her immaturity, i.e., in the construction of her back, the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> would not have remained in [the <i>Nukba</i>] during the time of maturity either, since she would have had no vessels in which to receive them.

Paragraph 6

<b>6. “And who sustains the world etc.”</b><br><b>And who</b> is that who <b>sustains the world and causes the Patriarchs to be revealed?</b> It is <b>the sound of children engaged in the Torah, and on account of these children of the world, the world is saved. Corresponding to them,</b> it is stated: <b>“We will make you circlets of gold”</b> [Song of Songs 1:11] <b>– these are children, lads, and youngsters, as it is stated: “And you shall make two cherubim of gold”</b> [Exodus 25:18].
Explanation: The <b>“children of the world”</b> are the brains of the back that were mentioned just above, which are called the “small face.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above and throughout this section, the "brains" refer to different levels of supernal light manifesting within the vessels of the <i>partzuf</i>.</i> Likewise, the <b>“children of the world,”</b> as well as the <b>“children, lads, and youngsters”</b> [refers to the brains of the back]. The aspect of their fusion in this state is called <b>“the sound of children engaged in the Torah.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the <b>“circlets of gold,”</b> and the mystical meaning of the <b>“two cherubim,”</b> which are the “small face,” without which these brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, which are drawn through the mystical meaning of the incorporation of right in left, would not be received in the <i>Nukba</i> whatsoever. All of this was explained just previously. This is why [Rabbi Shimon] states: <b>“Who is that who sustains the world,”</b> i.e., at the time of increase of the <i>kelippot</i>, which have the power to destroy the world as in the days of the flood. There is no remedy [for this destruction] except by drawing the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> in the mystical meaning of the rainbow in the cloud, as stated, since through this, <b>“the world is saved.”</b> And who is that who sustains and saves the world at that time, <b>“and causes the Patriarchs to be revealed,”</b> causing the manifestation of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> in the mystical meaning of the brains of the head, when <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> become <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i> of <i>ḥaya</i>? [Rabbi Shimon] says that the cause of all this is <b>“the sound of children engaged in the Torah,”</b> that is, the brains of the back, which is the mystical meaning of the sound of the children and the circlets of gold.

Paragraph 7

<b>7. “In the beginning. Rabbi Elazar etc.”</b><br><b>“In the beginning.” Rabbi Elazar began</b> [his discourse with the following exposition]: <b>“Lift up your eyes on high and see: who [<i>mi</i>] has created these”</b> [Isaiah 40:26]. <b>“Lift up your eyes on high” –</b> he asks: <b>To which place?</b> He answers: <b>To the place where all eyes turn. And what is that?</b> [It is] <b>the opening of the eyes</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i><b>. There you will know that this hidden ancient one, to whom the question applies,</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This "question" will be explained below.</i> <b>“has created these.” And who is</b> [the one who created these]<b>? He is the one called <i>Mi</i></b> [“Who”?]<b>,</b> which is the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, <b>that which is called, “from the edge of the heavens above,” and all lies in its demesnes. And since the</b> [concept of] <b>question refers to this</b> [aspect of the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>]<b>, and this is concealed, it is called <i>Mi</i></b>, the language of questioning<b>. For above this</b> [level]<b>, there are no questions. This edge of the heavens</b>, where the question is found, <b>is called <i>Mi</i>.</b>
Explanation: <b>“Rabbi Elazar began” –</b> his purpose is to clarify the interpretation of the creation of heaven and earth that appears in the Biblical account of <i>Bereshit</i>. For heaven and earth are the totality of the seven days of creation, which are the <i>Ze’er</i> [<i>Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The world of <i>Atzilut</i> is the root of everything below it. The levels of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> (the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> that correspond to the six extremities and <i>Malkhut</i> respectively) of <i>Atzilut</i> represent the seven days of Creation.</i> If so, why is it written “<i>bara</i> [“created”], which is <i>Beria</i> rather than <i>Atzilut</i>; it should have said <i>he’etzil</i> (emanated).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse is explained by Rabbi Elazar as referring to <i>Atzilut</i>, it should not have used the word <i>bara</i>, which is a reference to the world of <i>Beria</i>, the lower world beneath <i>Atzilut</i>.</i> He then says: <b>“And what is that? The opening of the eyes.”</b> The <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is called <b>“the opening of the eyes,”</b> as the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the head is called “eyes.” As is known, there are only <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As a result of the second constriction, the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> are ejected from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. The implications of this ejection are elaborated upon in the next paragraphs.</i> and therefore its <i>Malkhut</i> is called “the opening of the eyes,” since with its opening the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> flow from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to all the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The presence of <i>Malkhut</i>, resulting from the second constriction, effectively blocks and controls the flow of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to the lower levels.</i> This is why [Rabbi Elazar] states <b>“to the place where all eyes turn,”</b> as the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> are called “eyes,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, all lower levels of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the different <i>partzufim</i> ("eyes") turn toward the "opening of the eyes," the <i>Ḥokhma</i> that is within the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.</i> and there are no brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in all of the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, except by opening the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.
<b>“There you will know” –</b> i.e., at the opening of the eyes, which is the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. There you will know this secret, how the <i>Bina</i> created the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, as the word <i>bara</i> means <i>lebar</i> [“outside of”] the level of <i>Atzilut</i>. Since <i>Bina</i> herself emerged to outside of the level of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As referenced above, this emergence of <i>Bina</i> from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> took place as a result of the ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> in the second constriction.</i> and thereby became considered <i>Beria</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Bina</i> was ejected from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, <i>Bina</i> is viewed here as a level of <i>Beria</i> (considered "outside") relative to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. This is the case despite the fact that the <i>Bina</i> under discussion is the <i>Bina</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, and in fact, this <i>Bina</i> is still in the level of <i>Atzilut</i>, as will be explained.</i> in relation to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, it must be [the case] that she created the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> as well. The [<i>partzuf</i>] of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> became <i>Yetzira</i>, because what emerges from <i>Beria</i> is called <i>Yetzira</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i> became <i>Asiya</i>, since whatever emerges from <i>Yetzira</i> is called <i>Asiya</i>. However, they must not be compared to the actual <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, which are below the diaphragm of <i>Atzilut</i>, because these [<i>partzufim</i> of] <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are positioned above the diaphragm in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>. Rather, it refers to [them as <i>Beria</i> relative] only to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Therefore, there are two kinds of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>: The first is a <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation, which were separated from all of <i>Atzilut</i> through the diaphragm, which is the floor of the world of <i>Atzilut</i> that is positioned over [those lower worlds] from above. The second is <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of the world of <i>Atzilut</i> itself, which are the <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Nukba</i>. These [<i>partzufim</i>] are only outside of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and they are still <i>Atzilut</i>, except that the diaphragm inside the intestine of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The various structures of the <i>partzufim</i> are described in human terms as "limbs" and "organs." The diaphragm in the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> will be explained more fully in the next sections.</i> at the place of its chest, is positioned over them from above. For this reason, these [<i>partzufim</i>] are separated from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and are considered a body without a head. That is, the [lower <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>] lack the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is called a head, with respect to the world of <i>Atzilut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the brains of <i>Atzilut</i> are the lights of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. As these lower <i>partzufim</i> are cut off from this light, they lack access to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and are only the composite level of a body without a head.</i> This is because the world of <i>Atzilut</i> is usually considered <i>Ḥokhma</i> of all four worlds: <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, and therefore that which lacks <i>Ḥokhma</i> there is regarded as a body without a head.
The meaning of <b>“that this hidden ancient one</b> etc. <b>has created these”</b> is as follows: The <i>Bina</i> that emerged from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> from the force of the <i>Nukba</i> that ascended<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the second constriction.</i> to <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where [the <i>Nukba</i>] formed an endpoint of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> – as this is why [<i>Bina</i>] emerged to <i>Beria</i> and the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, as stated – [this <i>Bina</i>] is therefore divided into two aspects: The first three [<i>sefirot</i>] on their own, and the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] on their own.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Every individual <i>sefira</i> or structure is formed of all ten <i>sefirot</i>. Thus, this level of <i>Bina</i> is made of ten <i>sefirot</i>, and as a result of the ejection of <i>Bina</i> from the head, there is a structural distinction between the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> and the lower seven.</i> The reason is that it is not in the nature of the <i>Bina</i>, in her source of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the direct light,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The "nature" of a given <i>sefira</i> in the myriad structures of existence is always a reflection of its primary root <i>sefira</i> in the structure of direct light, the light flowing from the Creator to creation through a set of ten <i>sefirot</i>. The level of <i>Bina</i> in the direct light structure only draws the light of giving, not the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> at all, but only the light of giving, in the mystical meaning of the verse “because He delights in <i>Ḥesed</i>” [“mercy”; Micah 7:18] – and not [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> (see <i>Petiḥa leḤokhmat HaKabbala</i>, section 5). Therefore, the emergence [of <i>Bina</i>] to the body does not impair [<i>Bina</i>] at all, since even when [<i>Bina</i>] is in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, [<i>Bina</i>] does not receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> from there. Thus, [<i>Bina</i>] is not lessened at all on account of her position below the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and now too [<i>Bina</i>] is fully considered a head, and it is as though she never emerged from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> only draw the light of giving, there is no change in the situation of <i>Bina</i> when it is ejected from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to an environment lacking access to the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> The first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> are established in the mystical meaning of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, who enclothe <i>Arikh Anpin</i> from the mouth to the chest. The second aspect [of <i>Bina</i>], which is the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, are from the incorporation of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in <i>Bina</i>, which are the roots of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that are in <i>Bina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of any structure consist of six extremities (<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>) and <i>Malkhut</i> (<i>Nukba</i>). Thus, the lower seven of <i>Bina</i> mentioned here serve as roots for the lower level <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> called <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>.</i> These [lower seven <i>sefirot</i>] therefore require the illumination of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> for the [lower <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and consequently these [lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>] were impaired by their positioning in the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, for they became devoid of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and these [lower seven] are considered <i>Beria</i> and six extremities without a head.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">While the ejection of <i>Bina</i> from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> did not impair the first three of <i>Bina</i>, which do not need the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the lower seven were impaired, since they require the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> It is with regard to them that it is stated that "the father removed the mother outside,"<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Here the "father" is <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and the "mother" is <i>Bina</i>.</i> i.e., outside of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. These [lower seven] are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and they enclothe <i>Arikh Anpin</i> from the chest to the navel, while their sons, [the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, enclothe from the navel and below, of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, until the end of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>. This is the mystical meaning of the diaphragm that is inside the intestine of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which is positioned at his chest. For [this diaphragm] is the force of the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which ejects the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> outside of the head and disrupts them from receiving [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. For although this partition is positioned at the mouth of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, nevertheless it does not effect [change] there in any way, since the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> are positioned there [below the mouth], and they are the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are still considered the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, for the reason stated above. Accordingly, it is only at the place of the chest, i.e., above the lower seven of <i>Bina</i>, that the power of the partition has impact, removing the lower seven of <i>Bina</i> that are underneath it, to outside of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Remember this.
Therefore, the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> are called <b>“this hidden ancient one,”</b> as the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is called “the holy ancient one.” Since the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> are considered as though they are still positioned at the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">As was explained in the previous section, since the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> are unchanged by their ejection from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, it is as though they are still positioned within that head and are thus referred to as "this hidden ancient one."</i> despite being [positioned] below the mouth of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, these [first three <i>sefirot</i>] are therefore also called ancient, like the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. However, on account of their position in the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, they are called “hidden ancient one.”
This is why [Rabbi Elazar] states <b>“that this hidden ancient one, to whom the question applies, has created these,”</b> i.e., only the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of this hidden ancient one, which are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, <b>“to whom the question applies,”</b> that is, to receive the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> within them<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of feminine waters is meant as an analogy for the dynamic of "yearning from below," in which a lower level yearns to receive the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from a higher level. This yearning ascends to the level above and is described as a manifestation of that lower level within the higher level. This yearning is the meaning of the "question" mentioned here, a request of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. <i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> receive this yearning manifestation from below and escalate the process further to ultimately release the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to the lower levels.</i> by raising the feminine waters. This is because the “question” refers to the ascent of the feminine waters, as in the phrase “we ask for rain” [<i>Ta’anit</i> 1:1]. He is saying that only the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of this hidden ancient one, which are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, are ready for the question, i.e., to receive the feminine waters in order to draw forth the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, since [these lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>] are devoid of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Before that [these lower seven <i>sefirot</i>] are considered <i>Beria</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As has been explained, only the lower seven of <i>Bina</i> are truly called a level of <i>Beria</i>, since the first three remain unchanged from their previous state despite being ejected from the head.</i> and therefore [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] <b>“created these,”</b> which are the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, known as “these.” [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] were also created, in their strengths, devoid of a head, like [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>]. For the word <i>bara</i> indicates the lack of a head with respect to <i>Atzilut</i>. This is why [Rabbi Elazar] states: <b>“And who is this? It is the one called <i>Mi</i></b> [Who]<b>.</b> The lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are ready for a question [of feminine waters], are called <i>Mi</i>, and the word <i>bara</i> refers to them, as stated, since they themselves became <i>Beria</i>, on account of the diaphragm of the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which separates [the lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>] from the illumination of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, as stated. This is why [Rabbi Elazar] says: <b>“From the edge of the heavens above, and who is in possession of everything.”</b> The lower seven of <i>Bina</i>, which are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and are called <i>Mi</i>, are considered <b>“from the edge of the heavens above,”</b> since the heavens are <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and he receives only from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is called <b><i>Mi</i></b>. Therefore, <i>Mi</i> is called <b>“from the edge of the heavens above, and all lies in its demesnes,”</b> as the heaven and earth, which are [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and similarly the lower three worlds of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, all receive from this <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is called <i>Mi</i>. Consequently, “all lies in its demesnes.”
This is why [Rabbi Elazar] says: <b>“Above this there are no questions, and this edge of the heavens is called <i>Mi</i>.”</b> In other words, above, i.e., the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are the [<i>partzuf</i>] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, <b>“there are no questions,”</b> as these [first three] do not receive the feminine waters for drawing forth [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, since the [first three] are only the light of giving and they do not lack <i>Ḥokhma</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since the first three are of the light of giving, they do not lack or yearn for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> and therefore they are not called <i>Mi</i>. The [first three] are also not considered the <b>“edge of the heavens,”</b> because they are not at the behest of the request of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [through feminine waters] for the illumination of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. It is only the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>], which are <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which are established to [receive] the question – i.e., to receive the feminine waters from the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and to ascend to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to receive the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> on their behalf – that are therefore regarded as “the edge of the heavens above,” because the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called “heaven,” receives from them.

Paragraph 8

<b>8. “And there is another one, below etc.”</b><br><b>And there is another one, below, which is called <i>Ma</i></b> [“What?”]<b>. What is the difference between this one and that one?</b> He answers: <b>[Regarding] the first, hidden one, called <i>Mi</i>, a question applies to it. [Regarding the second], since the person questioned and investigated, to examine and know from one level to another until the end of all levels,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>once he has arrived there,</b> that is <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> meaning: <b>“What did you know?” “What did you observe?” “What did you investigate?” Yet, everything is as concealed as before.</b> <i>Mefashpesh</i> means “investigate,” as <i>ḥeker</i> [“searched out”; Job 8:8] is translated into Aramaic as <i>pishpesh</i>.
Explanation: The <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, when it is with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> [in a state of] face-to-face, is also called <b><i>Ma</i></b>, just like <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [The <i>Nukba</i>] is [also] considered “the lower edge of the heavens,” since it is the end of all the levels and is the endpoint of <i>Atzilut</i>. It follows that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called “heavens,” is positioned between the [the <i>partzuf</i> of] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is called “the upper edge of the heavens,” and the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called “the lower edge of the heavens.” [Rabbi Elazar] thus states: <b>“Since man questioned and investigates, to observe.” “To observe [<i>le-istakala</i>]”</b> is referring to the coupling of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the <i>partzuf</i> structure of the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> discussed in the previous sections. As will be explained, when the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (literally: father and mother) ascend to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, they serve as a bridge for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to reach the lower levels. This is accomplished through the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> components "facing each other" and fusing. This is a sexual imagery, with the transmission of the light to lower levels serving as a "reproductive" expression of this fusion.</i> which is called the gazing [<i>histaklut</i>] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> at each other as a result of their ascent to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. At that stage, the <i>Bina</i> returns to receive the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> for the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. The reason is that even <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which are the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, do not need the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> for themselves, since with respect to themselves the seven lower ones of <i>Bina</i> are similar to the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>] and [thus] do not need to receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since the level of <i>Bina</i> is of the light of giving, even the lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> do not need the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> for themselves. They only need to transmit it through to <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> below.</i> Nevertheless, when the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend as feminine waters to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> awaken for [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>] to ascend to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. However, even the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> do not ascend as feminine waters to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, except through the ascent of feminine waters from the people of the lower levels to the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. The process is that the souls of people ascend as feminine waters to the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and then the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend as feminine waters to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> ascend to <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and become one <i>partzuf</i> with <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. At that stage, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> gaze at each other and draw forth [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> for the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>.
Accordingly, [Rabbi Elazar] states: <b>“Since man questioned,”</b> meaning [man] raised feminine waters, <b>“and investigates,”</b> that is, [man] investigates his actions in order to raise the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> for the coupling of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>], i.e., <b>“to examine [<i>le-istakala</i>],”</b> in order that <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> will gaze [<i>yistaklu</i>] at each other and draw forth [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. <b>“And to know from one level to another until the end of all levels.”</b> For the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that is drawn forth through the ascent of feminine waters and fusion, as stated, is called “knowledge [<i>yedi’a</i>]” or “<i>Ḥokhma</i> by means of <i>Da'at</i> as the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that ascend as feminine waters are there considered <i>Da'at</i> for <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, as [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] cause their coupling. [This] fusion is called “knowledge,” as in the phrase: “And the man knew Eve his wife” [Genesis 4:1]. [Rabbi Elazar] states: <b>“And to know,</b>” i.e., to draw forth the brains [of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] in the mystical meaning of the <i>Da'at</i>, <b>“from one level to another,”</b> from <i>Da'at</i> of the level of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] to the brains of the level of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. <b>“Until the end of all levels</b>” – from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called “the end of all levels.” The meaning of the ascent of feminine waters (see <i>Petiḥa leḤokhmat HaKabbala</i>, sections 94 and 85) is that <i>Bina</i> is positioned back-to-back with <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as [<i>Bina</i>] is only the aspect of [the light of giving], and only turns to be face-to-face with <i>Ḥokhma</i> for the sake of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>; see there.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As explained throughout this section, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> are the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are the lower seven. This entire process revolves around the ascent of feminine waters triggering an ascent of the different aspects of <i>Bina</i> into a format in which they serve as a conduit for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to flow from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>.</i>
[Rabbi Elazar] says: <b>“Once it has arrived there, it is <i>Ma</i>.”</b> Once the brains arrive there, to the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, the <i>Nukba</i> is called <i>Ma</i>. She is called by this [name] for the reason explained in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Teruma</i> 127a): “<b>The lower level, which is the mystical meaning of the lower world, is called <i>Ma</i>, and we learned: Do not read <i>ma</i> but <i>me’a</i>,</b><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the Gemara’s exposition [<i>Menaḥot</i> 43b]: A person is obligated to recite one hundred blessings every day, as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what [<i>ma</i>] does the Lord your God require of you” (Deuteronomy 10:12).</i> <b>since all the upper levels are in their wholeness here.”</b> Thus, [<i>Nukba</i>] is necessarily called <i>Ma</i>, to indicate that the total wholeness of those brains comes only after the brains have arrived at the <i>Nukba</i>. He adds: <b>“What did you know; what did you observe; what did you investigate? After all, everything is as concealed as before.”</b> This is also explained in that passage of the <i>Zohar</i> in <i>Teruma</i>: <b>“Furthermore, why is she called <i>Ma</i>? Even though the drawing down of the supernal [light] that was drawn is not revealed until it is completed here, as this is the place of the end of all the levels, the destination of all the drawn down [supernal light], where it stands revealed. [Yet] although it is more revealed [there] than [in] any [of the other levels], it is ready for the question [of] ‘<i>Ma</i>?’ ‘What did you see?’ ‘What did you know?’ as it is said: ‘For you saw no manner of form’</b> [Deuteronomy 4:15]<b>”</b>
You can see from the words of the <i>Zohar</i> that although the higher brains have already been drawn to [<i>Nukba</i>] through the ascent of feminine waters, and [the <i>Nukba</i>] was already completed through [those brains], nevertheless, [<i>Nukba</i>] is still poised for a question, just like <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> were before the ascent of feminine waters. This is also the meaning of Rabbi Elazar’s statement here: <b>What did you know; what did you observe; what did you investigate? After all, everything is as concealed as before,”</b> i.e., similar to the words of the <i>Zohar</i> in <i>Teruma</i>, that after the ascent of feminine waters and the drawing forth of the brains, everything remains concealed within the <i>Nukba</i>, as it was before the ascent of feminine waters. That is, [the <i>Nukba</i>] is still ready for a question, meaning the ascent of the feminine waters (as stated in the last paragraph of section 7, above).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that although the <i>Nukba</i> received the brains of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as a result of the ascent of feminine waters (the yearning "question" from below), that light is now concealed within the <i>Nukba</i>, and can only be accessed with a further ascent of feminine waters.</i>
These ideas require explanation: If [this is the case, that the light remains concealed in <i>Nukba</i>], what is the utility of the lower [beings] raising feminine waters, and why were the brains drawn to [<i>Nukba</i>], if they are not revealed at all? Furthermore, it is stated there in the <i>Zohar</i> in <i>Teruma</i>, with regard to the first reason as to why the <i>Nukba</i> is called <i>Ma</i>, that it is the mystical meaning of “do not read <i>ma</i> but <i>me’a</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Me'a</i>, meaning "one hundred."</i> [<i>Menaḥot</i> 43b], which is the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings that the <i>Nukba</i> gives to the lower [levels]. Accordingly, how can it be said that the <i>Nukba</i> is still poised for a question, and everything is concealed as it was before?
The meaning is that there are two aspects of the brains of maturity in the <i>Nukba</i>, which are called “the first maturity” and “the second maturity.” In the first maturity, only <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> ascend to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, not <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. Although they become one <i>partzuf</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">When <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> ascends back to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> ascends to the area above the chest and below the mouth of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the position previously occupied by <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. Since <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are now above the diaphragm that previously separated between <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i><i>,</i> these two aspects of <i>Bina</i> are now considered one total <i>partzuf</i> again.</i> <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> still remained in the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, only [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] ascended to the previous position of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>&gt;&gt;], i.e., it enclothes from the mouth to the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Therefore, on the one hand, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> became the aspect of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, since it became one <i>partzuf</i> with <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> that are now positioned at the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and likewise [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] ascended above the diaphragm of the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> illuminates, in the manner that was explained earlier<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since the level of <i>Bina</i> does not require the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, only the light of giving, the ejection of <i>Bina</i> below the mouth of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> does not change <i>Bina</i>’s connection with the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Only <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> positioned below the diaphragm, was affected, as was explained in the quoted section above. Now that <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> has ascended to the area above the chest (the diaphragm) and below the &lt;&lt;mouth, it="" is="" considered="" part="" of="" the="" head="" of="" &lt;i=""&gt;Arikh Anpin</i> again, despite still being below the mouth. (see above, third paragraph of section 7) with regard to [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] themselves, who were positioned there even before the ascent of the feminine waters. As a result, [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] transmit completed brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] to the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i> becomes the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings, as stated. For by means of these brains, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are elevated and ascend to the position <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> was in before the ascent of the feminine waters, i.e., from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. The <i>Nukba</i> is thus in the place of the <i>Imma</i> ("mother"),<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the world of <i>tikkun</i>, all levels of <i>partzufim</i> operate as pairs, in which there is a "male" and "female" aspect. While the term <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> generally refers to the <i>partzuf</i> of the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> (made up of male and female <i>partzufim</i>), these terms can also be applied to all the roles within the paired <i>partzufim</i> structures that exist below the second constriction. Thus, in the new structure discussed here, formed after the ascents of the various <i>partzufim</i>, <i>Nukba</i> serves as the female <i>partzuf</i> aspect of the level below the chest, previously occupied by the paired male-female <i>partzuf</i> structure of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> (a similarly male and female pair of <i>partzufim</i>). As a result of this positioning, <i>Nukba</i> is called "<i>Imma,</i>" as <i>Nukba</i> takes the place of the female aspect of the <i>partzuf</i> structure of the level.</i> and therefore the <i>Nukba</i> becomes the mystical meaning of "one hundred," like the <i>Imma</i>, because the aspect of "one hundred" is in the <i>Imma</i>, while [the aspect of] "thousands" is in the <i>Abba</i> ("father"), and the lower [entity] that ascends to the upper entity] becomes like it, as is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, when a particular entity ascends to a new level, the entity becomes like the preceding entity that occupied that level.</i>
However, on the other hand, the <i>Nukba</i> is only similar to <i>Mi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the <i>Nukba</i> has only reached the status of <i>Mi</i> and no further, as will be explained.</i> which is poised for a question, i.e., precisely as <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> was before the ascent of feminine waters and the drawing forth of the brains. This is due to [<i>Nukba</i>] enclothing the place [where] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> [was during the period] of immaturity, i.e., from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. [The <i>Nukba</i>] is thus positioned below the diaphragm that is within the intestine of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and the illumination of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> stops above this diaphragm, as stated above (third paragraph of section 7; see there carefully). Consequently, from this position the <i>Nukba</i> did not attain the brains and head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, for which all the ascents of feminine waters occurred, and everything is as concealed as before, as it was prior to the ascent of feminine waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the purpose of the ascent of feminine waters, the attainment of <i>Nukba</i> access to the brains and head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, was not achieved.</i> However, from a different perspective, the <i>Nukba</i> gained the aspect of the <i>Imma</i> (mother), as [the <i>Nukba</i>] ascended to the place of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is called <i>Imma</i>, and this is the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings, as stated above.
For this reason, these brains [of the first maturity] are considered only the six extremities of maturity, <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>Nukba</i> lacks access to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, due to the presence of the diaphragm at the chest (above the <i>Nukba</i>'s new position), this <i>partzuf</i> is now six extremities, meaning only having access to the level of light of those lower <i>sefirot</i>.</i> since [the <i>Nukba</i>] cannot receive the head of maturity, as [the <i>Nukba</i>] is below the diaphragm of the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, as stated. However, [<i>Nukba</i>] level is now equal to that of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> when [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] is of the level of six extremities, before the ascent of feminine waters, when [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] was positioned from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. This is certainly a significant maturity for the <i>Nukba</i>, but it is [only] the six extremities of maturity and [the <i>Nukba</i>] still lacks the [lights] of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of maturity. The attainment of the first three of maturity is called “the second maturity of the <i>Nukba</i>.” This will be explained below in the section “Who created these, of Elijah.”
You can now thoroughly understand the meaning of the <i>Zohar</i> in <i>Teruma</i> cited above, with regard to the two reasons it presents as to why the <i>Nukba</i> is called <i>Ma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph summarizes the preceding sections.</i> In the first reason, [the <i>Zohar</i>] explains the higher brains that the <i>Nukba</i> attained, which are called “one hundred blessings.” This is why [the Sages] said, “do not read <i>ma</i> but <i>me’a</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Me'a</i> means "one hundred" in Hebrew.</i> This [mystical state of "one hundred blessings was attained] by means of the ascent of [the <i>Nukba</i>] to the position of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> through the strength of these [higher] brains. The second reason emphasizes that even so, since [the <i>Nukba</i>] ascended only to the place of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> of immaturity, meaning, where [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] was still poised for a question, which is from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, it follows that the [attained higher] brains of <i>Nukba</i> are completely similar to [that <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] as well, and the <i>Nukba</i> establishes [itself in] the state of being poised for a question. [This state] means [the <i>Nukba</i> has] the six extremities without the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of the head]. However, the distance [of <i>Nukba</i> from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] is admittedly very significant,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that although the <i>Nukba</i> is now very similar to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, these two <i>partzufim</i> remain distinct as a result of their different positioning, as explained.</i> because [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] is the six extremities of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Now that <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is positioned above the diaphragm, this <i>partzuf</i> serves as the six extremities below the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> described in the preceding paragraphs. This higher <i>partzuf</i> serves as the head, the first three <i>sefirot</i> for the lower <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.</i> i.e., the six extremities of maturity. Likewise, when it is stated in this section as well: “What did you know, and what etc. After all, everything is as concealed as before,” the phrase “as before” does not mean as the <i>Nukba</i> was before the ascent of feminine waters. Rather it means as <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> were before the ascent of feminine waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the <i>Nukba</i> is in the state of concealment that was previously applied to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.</i> However, the <i>Nukba</i> gained much through the ascent of feminine waters. [The <i>Nukba</i>] now received the aspect of the <i>Imma</i> (mother), which is the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings, only they are the six extremities of maturity and [the <i>Nukba</i>] thus remains [in the state of] poised for a question, like <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> [was] before the ascent of the feminine waters. Understand this well.

Paragraph 9

<b>9. “And with regard to this secret etc.”</b><br><b>And with regard to this secret, it is stated: “What shall I take to testify to you? What shall I liken to you”</b> [Lamentations 2:13]. <b>For when the Temple was destroyed, a Divine Voice emerged and declared: What [<i>ma</i>] shall I take to testify to you, and what [<i>ma</i>] shall I liken to you? That is, I shall take that <i>ma</i> to testify to you.</b> For <b>on each and every day I testified to you from the ancient days, as it is stated: “I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day”</b> [Deuteronomy 4:26]<b>. “What shall I take to testify to you?” – in that very same manner, I crowned you with holy crowns and granted you his dominion over the world, as it is stated: “Is this the city that men called the perfection of beauty,</b> the joy of the whole earth?” [Lamentations 2:15]<b>. I called you “Jerusalem, which is built as a city that is compact together”</b> [Psalms 122:3]<b>. “What shall I liken to you” – just as you sit, so it is above, as it were</b>, i.e., in the Jerusalem above<b>. Just as now, the holy people do not enter you in holy formations, so I swear to you that I will not enter above until your armies [<i>akhlusekh</i>] enter you below. This is your comfort, since I equate you to that level,</b> i.e., to the Jerusalem above, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>in everything. And now that you are here, “your breach is great as the sea”</b> [Lamentations 2:13]<b>. And if you say that you have no existence and healing, “who [<i>mi</i>] can heal you?”</b> [Lamentations 2:13], <b>meaning, it is that concealed, supernal level, called <i>Mi</i>, by which everything exists,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, <b>which will heal you and raise you up.</b> “<i>Akhlusekh</i>” means the troops of your armies, as <i>gedud</i> [troop] is translated into Aramaic as <i>ukhlasa</i> [Job 19:12].
The explanation of these things: The destruction of the Temple occurred because Israel committed the sin of idolatry. They were unwilling to raise up feminine waters for the coupling of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. Instead, they wished to draw the <i>shefa</i> to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is called “other gods.” For this reason, that coupling of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> was broken and the one hundred blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the preceding sections where the <i>Zohar</i> and the Sulam explore these concepts in depth.</i> were lost from the <i>Nukba</i>, and the Temple was destroyed.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says: <b>“A voice emerged and declared: What shall I take to testify to you</b> etc. <b>on each and every day I testified to you from the ancient days.”</b> These [days] are the six extremities of [the state of] maturity that the <i>Nukba</i> receives in the mystical meaning of <i>Ma</i>, as stated above. They are called “ancient days,” and this is the mystical meaning of the verse: “For ask now of the days past, [which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth,] and from one edge of heaven to the other” [Deuteronomy 4:32]. These [days] are called by this name because they are the six extremities of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous section of the <i>Zohar</i> for a more extensive discussion of this point. When <i>Nukba</i> enters this state of maturity called "<i>Ma</i>" it ascends into the place where <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> was previously positioned, from the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to the navel, and below the diaphragm. In this place, <i>Nukba</i> is referred to as six extremities of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which was the role <i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> played before ascending to the area above the diaphragm.</i> since the <i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] (section 7, third paragraph; see there). The seven days of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are the first ones for the seven days of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, the <i>partzuf</i> structure that is above <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and represents the first three <i>sefirot</i> of the structures below (as opposed to the six extremities which are the lower <i>sefirot</i>) is the "template" for the seven days represented by <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. This is because the lower level is an expression and reflection of the levels above.</i> <b>“as it is stated: I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day.”</b> For this verse, which is written there in that chapter [Deuteronomy 4:26], is referring to the coupling of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which are called heaven and earth. The verse is warning about the preservation and maintaining of the coupling, as otherwise, the verse warns, “you shall soon utterly perish from off the land etc.” This is the mystical meaning of: “What [<i>ma</i>] shall I take to testify to you” – I warned you with regard to those one hundred blessings, to preserve and perform them, and you violated them. Therefore, [the verse] “you shall soon utterly perish from off the land etc.” was fulfilled in you.
Accordingly, the <i>Zohar</i> says: <b>“What shall I take to testify to you? – in that very same manner, I crowned you with holy crowns</b> etc. <b>as a city that is compact together.”</b> For these one hundred blessings that the <i>Nukba</i> receives from the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in the fusion of <i>Ma</i>, are [achieved] in [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>'s] ascent to [the place of] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. There, the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> becomes the aspect of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is formed of a male component (<i>Yisrael Sabba</i>) and a female component (<i>Tevuna</i>). This follows the pattern of all the <i>partzufim</i> after the second constriction beginning in the World of Tikkun. Thus, when <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, also male and female components, ascend to the position of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, they take the place of their male and female counterparts at that level of the structure.</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> becomes the aspect of <i>Tevuna</i>, at which point the lights [of the <i>Nukba</i>] become the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings, like the lights of <i>Tevuna</i>, as stated. With regard to this, the verse states: <b>“As a city that is compact together,”</b> because the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called a city, has combined together with the <i>Tevuna</i>, and thus the <i>Nukba</i> has become the aspect of [the level of] <i>Tevuna</i>. [The <i>Nukba</i>] receives from there the brains of <i>Tevuna</i>, which are called “holy crowns,” and she is subsequently called “the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth,” and she receives <b>“his dominion over the world.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says: <b>“What shall I liken to you – as you sit,”</b> meaning, on account of Israel’s sin, which caused the Temple to be destroyed and [Israel] to be exiled from their land, they also thereby caused the withdrawal of the <i>Nukba</i>, as her nine lower [<i>sefirot</i>] fell to the <i>kelippot</i> and [the <i>Nukba</i>] returned to the [state of being a] point under the <i>Yesod</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“What [<i>ma</i>] shall I liken to you</b> etc.” and adds: <b>“who [<i>mi</i>] can heal you?”</b> That is, if the children of Israel repent, rectify their deeds, and raise up feminine waters to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, then the supernal brains will once again be drawn to the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i> will again ascend to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is called <b><i>Mi</i></b>, and then you, [the <i>Nukba</i>,] will be healed.

Paragraph 10

<b>10. “<i>Mi</i> is the edge of the heavens etc.”</b><br><b><i>Mi</i> is the edge of the heavens above</b>, which is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>; <b><i>Ma</i> is the edge of the heavens below</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i><b>. This is what Jacob inherited,</b> who is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>who “passes through from edge to edge”</b> [Exodus 26:28] <b>– from the first edge, which is <i>Mi</i>, to the last edge, which is <i>Ma</i>, as [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is positioned in the middle</b>, between <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and <i>Malkhut</i><b>. Therefore, “who has created these</b> [<i>eleh</i>,” Isaiah 40:26]<b>.</b> As <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, who are called <i>Mi</i> ("who"), created <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, which are called <i>eleh</i>.
Explanation: It would seem that the verse should have said “from the top of heaven to the [bottom] edge of heaven.” Why does it say, “from one edge to the other edge” [Deuteronomy 4:32], implying from end to end, which does not mean anything? He therefore states: <b>“<i>Mi</i> is the edge of the heavens above,”</b> i.e., <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is poised for a question and which enclothes from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is the default state of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> before any ascents result from feminine waters, and the yearning from below. See the preceding sections in order to understand the foundations of this section.</i> <b><i>Ma</i></b> is the <i>Nukba</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nukba</i> is the female <i>partzuf</i> counterpart to <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and corresponds to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>.</i> before the ascent of feminine waters, which is the end of all the levels from the chest of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and below. Jacob is positioned between [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] – he is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, who starts to enclothe from the place of the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> until the <i>Nukba</i>, which means he passes from the end of <i>Mi</i> [the bottom of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] to the end of <i>Ma</i> [the top of <i>Nukba</i>, the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>]. For the <i>Mi</i> concludes at the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where Jacob begins, as stated, and the <i>Nukba</i>, which is <i>Ma</i>, is positioned at his conclusion, as stated.
However, the verse is speaking [of the stage] after the drawing of the brains<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The "brains" refer to particular levels of supernal light. One of the main themes of these sections is the required adjustments in the structures of the <i>partzufim</i> to attain access to higher brains, levels of supernal light.</i> to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, as it written, at the start of the verse: “For ask now of the days past etc.” [Deuteronomy 4:32]. This is referring to the time when the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend and receive the brains of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which are called “the days past,” as stated. For then, the edge of the heavens below, which is <i>Ma</i>, i.e., the <i>Nukba</i>, ascends and enclothes at the edge of the heavens above, that is, on the <i>Mi</i>, which is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and thus they are literally both in one place. This is why the verse states “from edge to edge” [Deuteronomy 4:32], as they have both now become the aspect of one edge of heaven. For the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> receives “the days past,” which are six extremities from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the male component of the <i>partzuf</i> structure of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.</i> <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, while the <i>Nukba</i> takes <i>Tevuna</i>, i.e., the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Bina</i>, which is now at the edge of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called “heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is the layout of how <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> matches with <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Nukba</i> with <i>Tevuna</i> during this phase.</i> However, with respect to the quality that precedes the brains, she is considered the head of heaven.
There is also a second explanation [of the verse]: The heavens above is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i>, which incorporates the six first days, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Bina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Recall that <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are the lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Bina</i> of the level of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> here is the lower six of <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Tevuna</i> is <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Bina</i>.</i> The edge of the heavens above is the <i>Tevuna</i>, which is the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Bina</i>. The verse should thus be understood as follows: From the edge of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> to the edge of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called “the heavens below.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“Regarding who has created these.”</b> That is, it is in reference to these brains that the verse states <b>“who [<i>mi</i>] has created these,”</b> for <b><i>Mi</i></b> is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is positioned in the place of <i>Beria</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, i.e., from the chest to the navel, below the diaphragm that is inside the intestine of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, since the illumination of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> no longer reaches there (as stated above, in section 7, third paragraph; see there).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The world of <i>Beria</i> lies below the diaphragm positioned at the "bottom" of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>. Similarly, in the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the area below the diaphragm in the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is positioned, is the region corresponding to <i>Beria</i>. As mentioned previously, the light of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> does not penetrate below the diaphragm.</i> This is why [that region] is considered <i>Beria</i>, i.e., outside [<i>bar</i>] of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and therefore [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] is poised for a question. Thus, once the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> attain the brains [of this region], by ascending and enclothing this <i>Mi</i> and taking its place from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, their brains, too, are now only <i>Beria</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. This is the meaning of the verse: “<b>Who [<i>Mi</i>] has created [<i>bara</i>] these,”</b> i.e., the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> took the brains of <i>Beria</i> from the <i>Mi</i>.

Paragraph 11

<b>11. “Rabbi Shimon said etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar my son, stop talking and you will discover the sealed, supernal secret that the people of the world do not know. Rabbi Elazar was silent. Rabbi Shimon wept and stood for a moment. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, what is</b> <i><b>eleh</b></i><b>? If you say that it is the stars and the constellations, they are always visible. They were created with <i>Ma</i>,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>as it is stated: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made”</b> [Psalms 33:6], i.e., the heavens were made with <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called “the word of the Lord<b>.</b>” And <b>if [the word]</b> <i>eleh</i> <b>was said in reference to sealed matters, it was not necessary to have written <i>eleh</i> [regarding the stars and constellations], as</b> the stars and the constellations <b>are revealed.</b>
Explanation: Rabbi Elazar revealed here only the brains of the first maturity, whereas Rabbi Shimon wanted to reveal the mystical meaning of the brains of the second maturity,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the preceding sections of <i>Zohar</i> for the complete discussion of these two phases of maturity. This refers to the process through which the levels of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, the <i>partzufim</i> that govern our world, receive access to increasing levels of supernal light from above.</i> which is the supernal brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. [Rabbi Shimon] therefore instructed [Rabbi Elazar] to stop talking and he would reveal to him the sealed, supernal secret that the people of the world do not know, as these brains were not yet revealed in the world, and Rabbi Shimon revealed them here.
[Rabbi Shimon] thus states: <b>“What is</b> <i><b>eleh</b></i><b>? If you say that it is the stars and the constellations</b> etc.” Rabbi Shimon asked him, what is <i>eleh</i>? What novelty is the verse teaching us, when it states: “who [<i>Mi</i>] has created these” [Isaiah 40:26], which are the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>? If you say that it is the stars and the constellations, meaning, [it is] with regard to the brains of the six extremities of maturity that [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] attained, and that the verse “who [<i>Mi</i>] has created these” is referring to that – since the brains of the six extremities are called “stars and constellations” – [Rabbi Shimon] raised a difficulty against this claim: What novelty is this, as <b>they are always visible</b>, i.e., they are the regular brains of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> which can always be drawn forth, meaning even on weekdays, and these [brains] are not such a novelty that the verse “who [<i>Mi</i>] has created these” would apply to them.
Nor can it be explained that these brains are always in effect, without pause, as that is not the case, for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> only routinely has six extremities without a head, and it is only through the raising of feminine waters and prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Prayers and performance of commandments is the yearning from below that raises feminine waters and invokes changes in the structures under discussion here. This yearning causes changes to allow new flows of supernal light, the "brains," to reach the lower levels of creation, specifically <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> in this context.</i> that these brains are drawn forth. Rather, the meaning is as stated above, that they can always be drawn forth, i.e., even on weekdays, as they are in fact drawn forth every day at the time of the Morning Prayer. [Rabbi Shimon] raises a further difficulty to him: <b>“And with what [<i>Ma</i>] were they created?”</b> For these brains are not linked to <i>Bina</i> but to the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is called <i>Ma</i>, for [these brains] emerged from them, as it is stated: <b>“By the word of the Lord,”</b> which [refers to] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and its <i>Nukba</i>; the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called <b>“the Lord,”</b> while <i>Nukba</i> is called <b>“the word.”</b>

Paragraph 12

<b>12. “However, this secret etc.”</b><br><b>However, this secret was revealed only on a certain day when I was on the shore of the sea, and Elijah came and said to me: Rabbi, do you know who has created these?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase of "who has created these," used throughout these sections of the <i>Zohar</i>, is not just a question, but a reference to the verse (found in Isa. 40:26).</i> I replied: These are the heavens and their hosts, the work of the Holy One, blessed be He, for people should look at them and bless Him, as it is stated: “When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,</b> [the moon and the stars…] <b>O Lord, our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth”</b> [Psalms 8:4, 10].

Paragraph 13

<b>13. “He said to me: Rabbi etc.”</b><br><b>[Elijah] said to me: Rabbi, there was a sealed matter before the Holy One, blessed be He, and He revealed it in the assembly above, and it is as follows: When the most sealed of all that are sealed wished to be revealed, He initially made a single dot,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>and this ascended to become a thought,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, i.e., the <i>Malkhut</i> ascended and was incorporated in <i>Bina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This incorporation refers to the second constriction.</i> <b>He depicted all of the pictures in it; he engraved all of the engravings in it.</b>
The explanation: The <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Atik</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the highest <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.</i> is the first head of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, and it is called “the most sealed of all that are sealed.” With regard to [<i>Atik</i>], they stated (<i>Idra Rabba</i>, 174): <b>“Any head of a people that is not rectified first, his people are not rectified. From where do we learn this? From the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, since as long as it was not rectified in its rectifications, all those who need rectification were not rectified and all the worlds were destroyed.”</b> It is likewise taught (<i>Idra Zuta</i>, 74): <b>“We learned: When the holy <i>Atika</i>, the most sealed of all that are sealed, wished to be rectified, it rectified everything as male and female</b> etc. Likewise: <b>As this <i>Ḥokhma</i> spread and <i>Bina</i> emerged from it, and they are found to be male and female</b>,<b>”</b> and this is the mystical meaning of the rectification of the second constriction.
This is what he is clarifying here when he says: <b>“When the most sealed of all that are sealed wished to be revealed, He made in the head a single dot.”</b> For when the holy <i>Atika<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is another term for the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Atik</i>.</i></i> wished to be revealed to the worlds, through the force of the rectification that was rectified in the second constriction, <b>“he made in the head”</b> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, i.e., in the <i>Ḥokhma</i> [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>], <b>“a single dot.”</b> That is, [<i>Atik</i>] raised the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called a dot, to the [place] of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. There, the <i>Nukba</i> that raises the returning light was established, to enclothe the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> became concluded at the <i>sefira</i> of the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>. And the <i>Ḥokhma</i> <b>“was found to be”</b> like <b>“male and female,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> in the second constriction leads every <i>partzuf</i> structure to have a male and female component.</i></b> and <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> emerged to the outside of the head, i.e., to the level of the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. This is the mystical meaning of <b>“<i>Ḥokhma</i> spread and <i>Bina</i> emerged from it,”</b> that is, <i>Ḥokhma</i> removed [<i>Bina</i>] to the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This segment describes the result of the second constriction, in which <i>Malkhut</i> ascends to <i>Bina</i>. In the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, this ascent creates a new ending point below the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the head, instead of at the mouth (the original position of <i>Malkhut</i> before the ascent). This ejects <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> to the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.</i>
He then says: <b>“And this ascended to become a thought.”</b> In other words, this dot of <i>Malkhut</i> that ascended to <i>Ḥokhma</i> – and by means of which the <i>Ḥokhma</i> was established as male and female – it ascended on this account and became a thought, i.e., <i>Bina</i>, which is called a thought. The reason is simple – since [this dot] stands in a state of fusion with <i>Ḥokhma</i>, it receives from <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and that which receives from <i>Ḥokhma</i> is considered <i>Bina</i>, not <i>Malkhut</i>. Thus, even though [the dot] is <i>Malkhut</i> from its root, the aspect of a dot, on account of its ascent it has become <i>Bina</i>. This is the meaning of: <b>“And this ascended to become a thought,”</b> as this caused the dot to become <i>Bina</i>, which is called a thought.
You should know that in the <i>Zohar</i> the term “thought” sometimes refers to <i>Ḥokhma</i> and sometimes to <i>Bina</i>. The reason is that “thought” means the <i>Nukba</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the female aspect of <i>Ḥokhma</i> resulting from the second constriction.</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and therefore it can be called by the name of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, since it is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. However, with regard to [thought's] own nature, it is <i>Bina</i> rather than <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated. Additionally, <i>Bina</i> is only called by the name "thought" when it is the head together with the <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Keep this in mind.
This is what is meant by <b>“he depicted all of the pictures in it; he engraved all of the engravings in it.”</b> Through this dot which ascended to become a thought, he depicted and carved all five <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which are <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. That which it says <b>“depicted in it”</b> and <b>“engraved in it”</b> is alluding to a great matter: <b>“Depicted in it”</b> means that all the pictures, which are the five <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> were emanated through it. That is, by means of the [fusion though collision] performed on the partition of this dot<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As explained, the dot is <i>Malkhut</i>. <i>Malkhut</i> has a partition upon it and the effects of this partition are carried with <i>Malkhut</i> when <i>Malkhut</i> ascends to <i>Bina</i>.</i> that ascended to become a “thought,” the level of the six extremities of the returning light and direct light in the vessels of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> emerged in each <i>partzuf</i>. By contrast, <b>“he engraved all of the engravings in it”</b> refers to deficiency, that is, with the ascent of the dot to become a thought, deficiencies and engravings were formed, which are preparations for the aspect of a receptacle upon the lights in all the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. Since this matter is the foundation of all the brains of <i>Atzilut</i>, it must be thoroughly clarified.
The meaning is that the ascent of the dot to the aspect of thought, which is <i>Bina</i>, leads to the formation of a new conclusion to the ten <i>sefirot</i> of each level. The dot, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i> with the partition upon it – which was positioned for a [fusion through collision] at the place of <i>Malkhut</i> of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the head, called “mouth,” and concluded the head there – now ascended to the place of <i>Bina</i> of the head, which is called the apertures of the eyes,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The structure of a <i>partzuf</i> corresponds to the structure of a human body. The head of a <i>partzuf</i> has the five features of skull, eyes, ears, nose and mouth, each corresponding to one of the five main <i>sefirot</i>.</i> i.e., <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is <i>Bina</i>. The [fusion through collision] was performed on the partition [of <i>Malkhut</i>], there in the place of the apertures of the eyes, concluding the head there.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The partition blocks the flow of the direct light and creates returning light. The position of the partition in the structure of the head determines where the endpoint of the head lies.</i> And the three <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of the head, which are called “ear, nose, mouth,” descended below the place of the conclusion of the head, i.e., to the level of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Malkhut</i> ascended to <i>Bina</i>, following the principle that nothing can be lost in spiritual reality, only added, the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> of the head remains at the position of the mouth and descends with <i>Bina</i> and <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> to the body.</i> In the same manner, this necessarily transpired in the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the body as well. The <i>Malkhut</i> that concludes the body of the <i>partzuf</i>, which previously stood at the place of the middle point – which is <i>Malkhut</i> of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the body, called “the end of the legs” – now ascended to the place of <i>Bina</i> of the body, called <i>Tiferet</i> (since <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of the body are <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>), and concluded the body there at <i>Tiferet</i>, in the place of the chest. These three <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Bina</i>, and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of the body, which are called <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, emerged from <i>Atzilut</i> and fell into the level of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation.
Thus, on account of the ascent of the dot to become a thought, each level was split into two halves, with the upper half, <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i>, remaining in the level, while <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of each level were lost from [the level] and descended to the level below. This is the mystical meaning of the division of the name <i>Elohim</i> into [the letters] <i>Mi Eleh</i>. A complete level of ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er</i> [<i>Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> is called by the holy name of <i>Elohim</i>, which consists of five letters corresponding to the five <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>: <i>Alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> are <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, while <i>yod</i>-<i>mem</i> are [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. Now, after each level has been divided into two halves, with <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> remaining, and <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> falling from it, as stated, it follows that only the two letters <i>Mi</i> remained in each level, while the three letters of <i>Eleh</i> fell from each level to the level below.
One should not ask: According to this, shouldn’t the two letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed</i> [<i>el</i>] have remained in the level, while the [letters] <i>yod-heh-mem</i> should have fallen from it to the level below?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The logic here is that ostensibly it should be the first letters that remain, since it is the first <i>sefirot</i> that remain in the level.</i> The reason is that there is a consistent inverse relationship between the vessels and the lights. This is the rule: In the case of the vessels, the higher ones come first, i.e., first comes the vessel of <i>Keter</i>, then the vessel of <i>Ḥokhma</i>,... until lastly the vessel of <i>Malkhut</i>. It is the reverse in the case of the lights; with regard to them, the lower ones come first: First comes the light of <i>Malkhut</i>, then the light of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, then the light of <i>Bina</i>,... until lastly the light of <i>Keter</i>. Therefore, if of the vessels there are only the two vessels of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i>, they contain only two of the lights, the light of <i>Malkhut</i> and the light of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are called the six extremities. Consequently, we can discern that only the two letters <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i> [<i>Mi</i>] remained in the level, which are the mystical meaning of the light of <i>Malkhut</i> and the light of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> of the name <i>Elohim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the last two letters of the name <i>Elohim</i>, corresponding to the two lowest lights, remain in the level.</i> But the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Corresponding here to the three higher lights.</i> fell from them, and therefore each level became lacking in its first three.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“He depicted all of the pictures in it; he engraved all of the engravings in it.”</b> This is alluding to the division of each level into two halves through the force of the ascent of the dot to become a thought. <b>“He depicted all of the pictures in it,”</b> i.e., on the two letters <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i> [<i>Mi</i>] that remain in the level, he depicted the picture of the direct light. <b>“He engraved all of the engravings in it,”</b> i.e., the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>], which fell from each level and became lacking in [the levels], since on account of their absence only the light of <i>Malkhut</i> and the light of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> remained in the level, whereas the three lights of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i> are lacking in them, since there is no light without a vessel. Thus, if the levels were to obtain once again the vessels of <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, the [levels] would immediately obtain the first three of lights as well, for one depends on the other. Keep in mind these matters that have been clarified here, as they are the basis for the entire wisdom.

He wished to be revealed and called by this name</b> of <i>Elohim</i>, <b>and Hhe enclothed Himself in a precious garment that illuminates</b>, which is the light of giving. <b>[He] created these [<i>eleh</i>] and</b> the letters of <b><i>eleh</i> ascended into the name</b> <i>Elohim</i><b>,</b> as <b>the letters combined with each other,</b> i.e., the letters <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i> [<i>Mi</i>] with the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>], <b>and the name <i>Elohim</i> was completed. As long as He did not create <i>eleh</i>, it did not ascend to the name <i>Elohim</i>. Those who sinned with the calf said about this secret: “This [<i>eleh</i>] is your god, O Israel”</b> [Exodus 32:4].
The explanation: By means of the ascent of feminine waters from the lower realms, a new light was drawn forth from <i>Ab</i> and <i>Sag</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Ab</i> and <i>Sag</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> are the <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>. These <i>partzufim</i> are above the second constriction which begins only below, in the world of <i>Nekudim</i> (as explained in the previous section). Because lower levels "mimic" the levels above, the flow of light from these higher <i>partzufim</i> causes the lower levels to match them. Since the higher <i>partzufim</i> do not have a second constriction, the lower levels remove <i>Malkhut</i> (the dot) from <i>Bina</i> (the thought) to match the construction of those higher <i>partzufim</i>.</i> This light from <i>Ab</i> and <i>Sag</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is [from] above the aforementioned second constriction which split each level into two. Therefore, when this light is drawn forth to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, it once again lowers the dot from the thought, which is the place of <i>Bina</i>, back to her place, to the place of <i>Malkhut</i> of the head, as it was before the second constriction. And the three <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, which fell from the head, revert to the head, for the [fusion through collision] was performed in the place of the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is below them.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Malkhut</i>, with its partition and process of fusion through collision, has now been restored to its original place below <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> of the head, these three lower <i>partzufim</i> are now above that process of fusion through collision, a marker indicating their return to the head.</i> It is discerned that the name <i>Elohim</i> was revealed once again, since the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>] rejoined the <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i> [<i>Mi</i>] in one level, and the name <i>Elohim</i> was completed in the level. And since <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of the vessels returned [to the level], the first three of lights also returned, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous section. Once the lower vessels return to the level, the higher lights can now populate the vessels, leading to a full set of <i>sefirot</i> within the level.</i> and <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of lights were enclothed in the five letters of the name <i>Elohim</i>: The lights of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, in <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>; and the lights of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in <i>yod</i>-<i>mem</i>.
Remember this well, that the fallen <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> are the vessels of <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that are missing from the level. However, when the <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> combine in the name <i>Elohim</i>, they become lights of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, on account of the inverse relationship between the vessels and the lights, as stated. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And he engraved in the holy, sealed lamp,”</b> that is, a partition and a place for a [fusion through collision] was engraved afresh in the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which is called “the holy, sealed lamp.” It is <b>“an engraving of one sealed picture, holy of holies,”</b> as this new engraving draws forth one picture, i.e., a height of ten <i>sefirot</i>, which is holy of holies, the height of the first three, which is called “holy of holies.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The result of this process is that the first three <i>sefirot</i> are complete with their corresponding lights, forming a full height of ten <i>sefirot</i>.</i> Because it <b>“emerges from the thought”</b> – since this dot that ascended to become a thought has once again emerged now from a thought and arrived at its true place, the place of the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head – the three vessels: <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Nukba</i>, which are <i>eleh</i>, have therefore now returned to the level of the head, and the name <i>Elohim</i> was completed there. The reason why he calls this height of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] by the name of <b>“sealed picture”</b> will be explained below.
This is why it says: <b>“It is called <i>Mi</i>, the beginning of the structure.”</b> In other words, even though <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> have already combined with <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i>, and the name <i>Elohim</i> was formed, as stated, it is still called only <i>Mi</i>. It is “the beginning of the structure,” the start of the construction of the name <i>Elohim</i>, because the structure is not yet complete, as [the <i>Zohar</i>] proceeds to explain.
He thus says: <b>“It stands and does not stand.”</b> That is, on the one hand, the structure is already standing fully complete, since the place of the [fusion through collision] returned to its place at the mouth of the head,” and <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> returned to the level, and similarly the first three of lights [returned], and the name <i>Elohim</i> was completed. However, on the other hand, the structure of the name is still not standing, because <b>“it is deep and sealed in the name.”</b> In other words, the lights of the name <i>Elohim</i> are still deep and sealed, and do not illuminate in <i>eleh</i>, which are <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that ascended to the place of the head. The reason is that due to their ascent to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where only <i>Ḥokhma</i> illuminates, there is only light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> at this level. And since [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] are the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>], and [<i>sefirot</i> of the] lower seven that ascended are unable to receive the [light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> without being enclothed within the [light of giving], and there is no [light of giving] there, therefore [these lower seven] cannot receive the [light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> either.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The level of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> requires the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to be enclothed in the light of giving. Without this, the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> does not shine into the lower seven <i>sefirot</i>.</i> Consequently, it is regarded that the name is <b>“deep and sealed”</b> and does not yet spread in the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>. For this reason, the structure of this level is still considered “not standing,” and <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> are as yet not revealed in it. This is why he says that beforehand <b>“it is called only <i>Mi</i>,”</b> since the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> are still hidden in the name <i>Elohim</i>, and there is only <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i> [<i>Mi</i>] there.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He wished to be revealed and called by name,”</b> since the name was already complete, because <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> already ascended to the head, and despite this they [still] do not illuminate at all. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says: <b>“He wished to be revealed and called by this name</b> of <i>Elohim</i>, <b>and Hhe enclothed Himself in a precious garment that illuminates.”</b> This means that since the whole sealing of the name, that it cannot illuminate in <i>eleh</i>, is due to the lack of clothing of [the light of giving], as the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] cannot receive the [light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> without [the light of giving], as stated, therefore there was a reversion and performing of the [fusion through collision] of immaturity, like when [the lower seven] were in the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> . This drew forth the height of [the light of giving], and the height of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> was enclothed in the light of giving that was drawn forth. That [light of giving] became <b>“a precious garment that illuminates”</b> for that level, such that through this enclothing [of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] in the [light of giving], it can illuminate the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> into the lower seven, which are <i>eleh</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] therefore states: <b>“Hhe enclothed Himself in a precious garment that illuminates, and created these [<i>eleh</i>], and <i>eleh</i> ascended in the name.”</b> That is, by means of that precious garment, the height of [the light of giving] that was received from the [fusion through collision] of the body below the chest,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The fusion through collision of immaturity, mentioned in the previous paragraph.</i> which is called <i>Beria</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As explained previously, the level of a structure that lies below the diaphragm (the chest) corresponds to the world of <i>Beria</i>.</i> <b>“He created these [<i>bara eleh</i>],”</b> i.e., He bestows that light to <i>eleh</i>, through which <b>“<i>eleh</i> ascended in the name.”</b> Since the [lower seven] have a precious garment from [the light of giving], they can also receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> through [the garment]. Then <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> were revealed in the name <i>Elohim</i>, since now the <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are illuminating in [the name] in their full, complete state, and it can be discerned that the name of <i>Elohim</i> is now complete and revealed. Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“The letters combined with each other,”</b> i.e., the letters <i>mem</i>-<i>yod</i> with the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, <b>“and the name <i>Elohim</i> was completed,”</b> since now <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> receive the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> because they have obtained the clothing of [the light of giving], and all five letters of <i>Elohim</i> illuminate in their fullness. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“As long as He did not create <i>eleh</i>, it did not ascend to the name <i>Elohim</i>,”</b> since before the <i>mem-yod</i> gave them the light of giving to wear, the <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> could not receive anything from the <i>mem-yod</i>, and only the <i>mem-yod</i> illuminated in <i>Elohim</i>, as stated. [The <i>Zohar</i>] then says: <b>“And those who sinned with the calf</b>… <b>“This [<i>eleh</i>] is your god, O Israel.”</b> For they damaged that precious garment that illuminates, and therefore the <i>mem-yod</i> separated from the <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, and accordingly they said: <b>“This [<i>eleh</i>] is your god,”</b> and the <i>shefa</i> went out to other gods.

Paragraph 15

<b>15. “And as <i>Mi</i> combined etc.”</b><br><b>And just as <i>Mi</i> combined with <i>eleh</i></b> and they became the name <i>Elohim</i>, by means of the precious garment that illuminates, which is the light of giving, <b>so too the name always combines</b> through the precious garment that illuminates<b>. It is through this secret that the world exists</b>, as this is the mystical meaning of the verse: “The world is built through giving” [<i>ḥesed</i>, Psalms 89:3]<b>. Elijah then flew away and I did not see him. But I knew the matter from him, for I comprehended his secret and concealment. Rabbi Elazar and all the colleagues came and bowed before</b> [Rabbi Shimon]<b>. They wept and declared: “If we had come into the world only to hear that, that would have been enough for us.”</b>
Explanation: In the same manner that was explained that <b>“it did not ascend to the name <i>Elohim</i>”</b> until the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> was enclothed in the precious garment that illuminates, and then <i>Mi</i> combined with <i>eleh</i> and ascended to the name <i>Elohim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the undoing of the second constriction described in the preceding sections, in which the three lower <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> returned after being ejected by the ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.</i> <b>“so too the name always combines,”</b> as this is how it exists forever and ever, and it does not otherwise merit the name <i>Elohim</i>. <b>“It is through this secret that the world exists.”</b> The lower world as well, which is <i>Nukba</i>, called <i>Ma</i>, receives the brains through this manner of combining <i>Mi</i> with <i>eleh</i>, and it is fully completed like the upper world, as Rabbi Shimon proceeds to explain. This is in opposition to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, who said with regard to the lower world: <b>“Once is has arrived there,</b> [it is] <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> [meaning:] <b>“What [<i>ma</i>] did you know?”</b> etc. <b>After all, everything is as concealed as before”</b>; see there [section 8, above]. It turns out that according to [Rabbi Elazar's] opinion, the lower world was not established like the upper world. This is why [Rabbi Shimon] states: <b>“It is through this secret that the</b> [lower] <b>world exists”</b> in the same manner as the upper world. For this reason, Rabbi Shimon paused from his previous comments. Now, Elijah explained only the order of the brains and the construction of the name <i>Elohim</i> in the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first <i>sefirot</i> within the level of <i>Bina</i> that was ejected from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> then returned to the head in the processes of maturation described in the preceding sections.</i> He did not clarify the order of the structure of <i>Elohim</i> in the <i>Nukba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, as a response to Rabbi Elazar's idea that the process of <i>Nukba</i> acquiring higher brains is different than that of the upper worlds.</i> and that is what Rabbi Shimon himself explains, until the end of the teaching.

Paragraph 16

<b>16. “Rabbi Shimon said etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon said: Therefore, the heavens and their hosts were created with <i>Ma</i>,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>as it is stated: “When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers etc.”</b> (Psalms 8:4)<b>, and it is</b> earlier <b>written: “How [<i>Ma</i>] glorious is Your name in all the earth, whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens”</b> (Psalms 8:2)<b>.</b> Thus, the heavens were created with the name <i>Ma</i>, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, and the phrase <b>“above the heavens”</b> – referring to <i>Bina</i>, called <i>Mi</i>, which is above <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, termed heavens – means that <b>it ascends through the name</b> <i>Elohim</i><b>.</b> That is, <i>Ma</i>, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, ascends and is incorporated in <i>Bina</i>, which is called <i>Elohim</i>, <b>after He created light for its light</b>, i.e., after He created the light of giving as a precious garment for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the name <i>Mi</i> (as stated in section 14, above)<b>.</b> Then <b>they were enclothed in one another and</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>ascended through the supernal name</b> of <i>Elohim</i>, which is the name of <i>Bina</i>, in which <i>Malkhut</i> is incorporated. <b>Therefore</b> [it states]: <b>“In the beginning, <i>Elohim</i> created”</b> (Genesis 1:1)<b>, which is the supernal <i>Elohim</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Bina</i> rather than <i>Malkhut</i><b>. For <i>Ma</i>,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>is not so, and was not constructed</b> in the mystical meaning of <i>Mi eleh</i>, as we have said<b>.</b>
Explanation: Since the lower world, <i>Ma</i>, draws forth the brains of the name <i>Elohim</i> in the upper world, there was therefore the ability for the heavens and their hosts to be constructed by means of <i>Ma</i>, since there are no offspring without these higher brains, which are the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says: <b>“Therefore,”</b> since also the lower world, <i>Ma</i>, is perpetuated through the name <i>Elohim</i> from the upper world, <b>“the heavens and their hosts were created with <i>Ma</i>”</b> – there was strength in <b><i>Ma</i></b> to produce these offspring, <b>“the heavens and their hosts.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, since the level of <i>Ma</i> drew down the brains of the higher levels, <i>Ma</i> was able to generate this "offspring."</i></b> 
This is why the verse states: “Whose majesty [<i>hodekha</i>] is rehearsed above the heavens,” to teach us that the brains are drawn forth from the name <i>Elohim</i> of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> by the combination of <i>Mi</i> with <i>eleh</i>, which are above the heavens, [which are] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This section is predicated on the concepts developed in the previous section.</i> This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Above the heavens</b> – <b>it ascends through the name,”</b> that the <i>Hod</i>, which is the brains, is above the heavens, [meaning] above <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is [the region of] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, through which the name <i>Elohim</i> ascends, and that is “Who [<i>Mi</i>] has created these [<i>eleh</i>],” as stated. However, in heaven itself, which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, there is no <i>Mi</i> there, only <i>Ma</i>, as we have said.
Now, after the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> was drawn forth, due to the dot that returned and emerged from the thought,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous sections, this refers to the reversal of the second constriction.</i> a fusion of the level of six extremities was once again performed, to draw forth the light of giving and the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> was enclothed in the light of giving, and then <i>Mi</i> illuminated in <i>eleh</i>, as stated. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“After He created light for its light,”</b> i.e., the light of giving for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <b>“they were enclothed in one another and it ascended by means of the supernal name”</b> – the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> was enclothed in the light of giving. Consequently, the brains transitioned from <i>Mi</i> to [the level of] <i>eleh.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As was explained at length in the previous sections, the combining of the letters of <i>Mi</i> and <i>eleh</i> form the full five-letter name of <i>Elohim</i>, representing all five lights, a full set of brains within the level.</i></i> The letters combined with one another, and ascended as the name of <i>Elohim</i>, as stated. This [process] is <b>“through the supernal name,”</b> i.e., above the heavens, from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, in which there is <i>Mi</i>, but not in heaven, which is <i>Ma</i>.
He then says: <b>“<i>Ma</i> is not so and was not constructed.”</b> <i>Mi</i>, which is <i>Bina</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mi</i> referred in the previous sections to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> of the level of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.</i> did not contain any constriction at all from the time of the first constriction, since the constriction was not there, but only on the middle dot, which is <i>Malkhut</i>. [<i>Malkhut</i>] was restricted, so as to not receive light in itself, and [<i>Malkhut</i>] was established [with a partition] for the mystical meaning of a fusion through collision, in order to raise returning light.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The first constriction only impacted <i>Malkhut</i> directly, causing the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to be unable to reach its appropriate vessel, the receiver vessel of <i>Malkhut</i>. <i>Bina</i>, and the other <i>sefirot</i> above <i>Malkhut</i> were not constricted.</i> However, the first nine were clean of any constriction and were worthy of receiving the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. It is only in the second constriction, in order to temper the <i>Malkhut</i> with the attribute of mercy, [which is <i>Bina</i>], the <i>Malkhut</i> ascended to the <i>Abba</i> [which is <i>Ḥokhma</i>], and the <i>Abba</i> was established through [the presence of <i>Malkhut</i>] as male and female,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> in the second constriction essentially gives rise to a "female" counterpart to every level (<i>Malkhut</i> is described as conceptually "female" in Kabbalistic language, indicating its role as a receiving vessel).</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> received the place of <i>Bina</i>. And the dot, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, ascended to become a thought, <i>Bina</i>. From that point, <i>Bina</i> was also restricted and was placed with a partition, to avoid receiving the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> within her, in order to receive the fusion through collision and to raise returning light, as stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The repositioning of <i>Malkhut</i> in the second constriction means that the effects of <i>Malkhut</i> were now carried over to the level of <i>Bina</i>.</i>
Thus, in its original [form], <i>Bina</i> was fit to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> without any constriction. [<i>Bina</i>] only received the constriction and partition within itself to temper the <i>Malkhut</i>. Therefore, by raising feminine waters from the lower realms, a new light was drawn forth from <i>Ab</i> and <i>Sag</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, which lowers the dot [of <i>Malkhut</i>] back from the place of <i>Bina</i> to its place, to <i>Malkhut</i>, as it was in the first constriction, and the dot emerges from the thought. The <i>Bina</i> is thereby purified from any constriction and once again receives the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated above. Once the height [of the light] of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is enclothed in the [light of giving], <i>Mi</i> illuminates in <i>eleh</i>, and the name <i>Elohim</i> is revealed there. Now, this entire construction of the name <i>Elohim</i> is completely impossible in <i>Ma</i>, since the <i>Ma</i> is the edge of the heavens below, which is the <i>Malkhut</i> itself, in which there was constriction at her source, including the first constriction as well, and <i>Malkhut</i> is unfit to receive any illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> within her. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“<i>Ma</i> is not so, and was not constructed,”</b> since the whole construction of the name <i>Elohim</i> is only relevant in <i>Mi</i>, as a result of the return and emergence of [<i>Malkhut</i>] from the thought, and not in <i>Ma</i>.

Paragraph 17

<b>17. “But when they are drawn forth etc.”</b><br><b>But when these letters, <i>eleh</i>, are drawn forth from above,</b> from <i>Bina</i>, <b>to below,</b> to <i>Malkhut</i> <b>– for the mother lends her garments to the daughter and adorns her with her ornaments –</b> then the name <i>Elohim</i> extends from <i>Bina</i>, which is the mother, to <i>Malkhut</i>, the daughter. <b>And when does she adorn her with her ornaments properly?</b> That is, <b>when all males appears before her, as</b> then <b>it is written</b> with regard to her: <b>“Before the Master, God”</b> (Exodus 23:17)<b>. Then</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>is called “Master</b>,<b>”</b> which is in the masculine form<b>. As it is stated: “Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Master of all the earth”</b> (Joshua 3:11)<b>.</b> Thus, the verse calls the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is termed “the ark of the covenant,” by the name “the Master of all the earth,” which is a masculine name. This is because <i>Malkhut</i> received the vessels called “garments,” and the brains, which are called “ornaments,” from the mother, which is <i>Bina</i>. <b>Then</b> the [letter] <b><i>heh</i> leaves</b> <i>Ma</i>, <b>and is replaced by a <i>yod</i></b>, and the <i>Malkhut</i> is called <i>Mi</i>, like the <i>Bina</i>. At that time, [<i>Malkhut</i>] <b>is adorned in male garments</b>, i.e., the garments of <i>Bina</i>, as stated, <b>corresponding to all the males in Israel</b> [see Exodus 23:17]<b>.</b>
Explanation: As was explained (section 13, above), after <b>“he made in the head”</b> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> <b>“a single dot, and this ascended to become a thought”</b> – for the <i>Ḥokhma</i> was established through [the dot] as male and female – then <b>“he depicted all of the pictures in it,”</b> as all the levels of the five <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> were depicted in it, in such a manner that there is only <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> in every level, in <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. And <b>“he engraved all of the engravings in it,”</b> that through [the dot's] force, the three <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, separated from each [of their] levels [and descended] to the level below: <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> fell into the [level of] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>; <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> fell to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>; and <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> fell to <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>; see there.
It was explained in the <i>Sulam</i> there that these two <i>sefirot</i> that remained in the level, which are <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i>, are called <i>Mi</i>, whereas those three <i>sefirot</i> that were separated from every level are called the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>].
[The <i>Zohar</i> thus says]: <b>“When these letters, <i>eleh</i>, are drawn forth from above to below,”</b> that is, when the dot ascended to become a thought, as stated, and then the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> separated from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother) and fell to the level below them, [the level of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, as stated. It is then considered that [the letters] <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These letters refer to the three lower <i>sefirot</i> of the given level, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, which were separated by the second constriction and descended to the level below.</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which are in [the level of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, were drawn from above to below and enclothed within the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, since <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> of <i>Abba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the male aspect of the male-female paired <i>partzuf</i> structure of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.</i> which is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the male aspect of the male-female paired <i>partzuf</i> structure of <i>Yisrael Sbaba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the structure of the lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.</i> was drawn to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> This represents the male aspect of the male-female paired <i>partzuf</i> structure of, and <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> of <i>Imma</i>, which is <i>Tevuna</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the female aspect of the male-female paired <i>partzufim</i> structure of <i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the structure of the lower seven <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.</i> was drawn to <i>Nukba</i>.
Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“The mother lends her garments to the daughter and adorns her with her ornaments,”</b> that is, at the time of the arrival of the brains of maturity, as clarified in the words of Rabbi Shimon above, when <b>“an engraving of one sealed picture, the holy of holies, a deep structure that emerges from the thought,”</b> is drawn forth. This means that the dot reverted, emerging from the thought to its place, to <i>Malkhut</i>, as the three vessels: <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, were thereby restored to the level, and the three lights of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, which are called <b>“holy of holies,”</b> were drawn forth; see there.
Know that when the vessels <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, were returned from the body to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother) that enclothe them were also drawn with them, and <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> too ascended to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> received those brains of the holy of holies at the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. The reason [that <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> also ascended] is that there is a rule that a higher entity which descends to a lower level becomes like [that level], and likewise a lower entity that ascends to a higher level becomes like [that higher level]. Therefore, in the phase of immaturity, when <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> separate from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and fall to the body [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] – where they are enclothed by the [<i>partzuf</i>] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> from the mouth [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] and below – <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> become the actual aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>. Consequently, in the state of maturity, when <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> return to the level of the head, they take with them the [aspect of] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> as well, for they have already become a single level [with <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] during the phase of immaturity. As a result, in the phase of maturity, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> ascend with [<i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> because [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] became equal to them, and they receive the same brains of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> that are called “holy of holies.”
In the very same manner, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, since once <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> receive the brains of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the dot emerges from the thought in them as well, to the place of <i>Malkhut</i>, through which their <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are restored to their level [of origin] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, as stated above with regard to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Now, at the same time that the vessels of <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>], ascended once again to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, they took with them the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that enclothe [the <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] and the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> also ascend to [the level of] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, and receive the brains of the holy of holies that are there.
This is the meaning of [the <i>Zohar</i>'s] statement: <b>“The mother lends her garments to the daughter and adorns her with her ornaments.”</b> In other words, since the three letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> of the mother were drawn to the <i>Nukba</i> in the phase of immaturity, as we said, it is considered that the <b>“mother lends her garments to the daughter.”</b> By means of the departure of the three vessels <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> (which are <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>) from the mother and their falling into the <i>Nukba</i>, they become actual <i>Nukba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, they unite with the level of <i>Nukba</i> and take on its characteristics.</i> because a higher entity that descends to a lower level becomes like it. It is considered that the mother lent her vessels of <i>eleh</i> to the daughter, which is the <i>Nukba</i>, since now the <i>Nukba</i> is using them. And yet, [the mother] also adorns [the daughter] with her ornaments, i.e., at the phase of maturity, as the three vessels <i>Eleh</i>, [meaning] <i>Bina</i>, and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, of the mother return to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of the mother, and the <i>Nukba</i> also ascends to the mother with them, as stated. Then the <i>Nukba</i> receives the brains of the holy of holies that are in the mother, since a lower entity that ascends to a higher [level] becomes like it, as stated. It follows that now, since the mother lends her garments of <i>eleh</i> to the daughter at the phase of immaturity, she therefore adorns her with her ornaments (which are the brains) in the phase of maturity, and she is thus adorned with the ornaments of the mother.
<b>“And when does she adorn her with her ornaments? When it is proper.”</b> There are two types of ornaments from the mother to the <i>Nukba</i>, which are the brains<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the brains, which are the first three lights in their vessels, are of two different levels in the case of the <i>Nukba</i>.</i> of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]: Either from the lower mother, called <i>Tevuna</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is the female component of the <i>partzuf</i> called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and represents the "lower mother" here.</i> located from the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and below, or from the higher mother, located from the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and above. When the <i>Nukba</i> ascends to <i>Tevuna</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> adorns her with her ornaments, it is considered that these ornaments are not yet in their proper state, because then the <i>Nukba</i> is still poised for a question, like the <i>Tevuna</i> before the raising of feminine waters as stated above (section 8, 4th paragraph).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The state of being "poised for a question" is discussed extensively in the previous sections and refers to the lower state of brains of <i>Nukba</i> referenced here.</i> Hence, [the ornaments] are not in their proper state. Rather, [it is] when the <i>Nukba</i> ascends to the place of the higher mother, from the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and above, and the higher mother adorns the <i>Nukba</i> with her ornaments, then her ornaments are considered proper, as [the <i>Zohar</i>] proceeds to explain.
<b>“When all males appear before her</b> etc. <b>then she is called Master.”</b> [This is] when the <i>Nukba</i> ascends to <i>Tevuna</i> and receives the brains from her. At this point, the ornaments are not yet in their proper state, for [the <i>Nukba</i>] is still poised for a question, meaning she still requires the raising of feminine waters in order to be fully complete, as stated. [In this stage] it is considered that the males of Israel receive from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, who ascended to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i>. However, when the <i>Nukba</i> ascends to the higher mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the ascent of the <i>Nukba</i> to the female component of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, in which <i>Nukba</i> acquires the higher level of brains.</i> she is fully completed and is no longer poised for a question, i.e., to receive feminine waters. [The <i>Nukba</i>] is then considered a male, and the males in Israel receive from her.
This is the meaning of [the <i>Zohar</i>'s] statement: <b>“When all males appear before her,”</b> i.e., all the males in Israel appear before [<i>Nukba</i>] and receive from her, <b>“then she is called Master [<i>Adon</i>],”</b> that is, she is no longer called by the name of <i>Adonai</i>, which is feminine, but by the masculine name <i>Adon</i>. This is because she is no longer poised for a question, as the dynamic of raising feminine waters no longer applies to her, and therefore [<i>Nukba</i>] is considered a male. [The <i>Zohar</i>] then states: <b>“Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Master of all the earth”</b> – the ark is called the <i>Nukba</i>, since the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called “covenant,” enters her. Thus, the verse calls the <i>Nukba</i> by the name: “Master of all the earth,” which is a male name. [The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Then <i>heh</i> leaves, and is replaced by a <i>yod</i>.”</b> In other words, the <i>heh</i> of <i>Ma</i> is removed from [<i>Ma</i>], for this <i>heh</i> of <i>Ma</i> indicates being poised for a question, as stated previously, which is: <b>“What did you know</b> etc. <b>After all, everything is as concealed as before”</b>; see there [section 8]). Thus, the <i>heh</i> of <i>Ma</i> denotes being poised for a question. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that this <i>heh</i> of <i>Ma</i> is removed from it, and a <i>yod</i> replaces the <i>heh</i>, and [the <i>Nukba</i>] is [then] called <i>Mi</i>, like the mother. Then [the <i>Nukba</i>] is constructed in the name <i>Elohim</i>, like the mother.

Paragraph 18

<b>18. “The other letters etc.”</b><br><b>The other letters</b>, i.e., <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, <b>are drawn forth by Israel from above</b>, from the <i>Bina</i>, <b>to this place</b>, that is, to the <i>Malkhut</i> that is now called by the name of <i>Mi</i>, like the <i>Bina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As was explained in the preceding sections, when <i>Nukba</i> achieves the higher brains of maturity, it reaches the level of <i>Mi</i>, beyond the previous level of <i>Ma</i>.</i> <b>“These [<i>eleh</i>] things I remember”</b> (Psalms 42:5) means: <b>I hereby recall</b> these letters <b>in my mouth, and I pour out tears with the desire of my soul, in order to draw forth these letters</b>, <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, from the <i>Bina</i>. <b>Then “I will lead them” from above</b>, from <i>Bina</i>, <b>“to the house of <i>Elohim</i>,”</b> <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>so that</b> <i>Malkhut</i> <b>will be</b> called <b>“<i>Elohim</i>,” like</b> the <i>Bina</i>, which is called <i>Elohim</i>. <b>And with what</b> shall I draw them? <b>“With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday”</b> (Psalms 42:5). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: My silence built the Temple above,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, <b>and it built the Temple below</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i><b>. Certainly,</b> it is as people say: <b>“If a word is worth one <i>sela</i>, silence is worth two”</b> (<i>Megilla</i> 18a)<b>. “If a word is worth one <i>sela</i>” – that which I said and noted. “Silence is worth two” – this is the silence that I maintained, which is worth twice as much, for the two worlds</b>, <i>Bina</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>were built and created together.</b> Had I not refrained from speaking (as stated in section 11, above), I would not have attained the union of these two worlds.
Explanation: After the <i>heh</i> was removed from <i>Ma</i>, to be replaced by a <i>yod</i> alongside the [letter] <i>mem</i>, so that it is called <i>Mi</i>, then Israel, by raising feminine waters draws forth different letters, i.e., <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, to this place, i.e. <i>Mi</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i> ascends through the name <i>Elohim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As extensively discussed in previous sections, the ascent of <i>Nukba</i> transpires through the acquisition of all five lights, the brains represented by the five letters of the name <i>Elohim</i>. Thus, <i>Nukba</i> ascends through the power of these higher brains.</i> The nature of this drawing forth has already been explained above. <i>Alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> of the higher [level] fall to the lower [level] in the phase of immaturity, and therefore [<i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>] draw up the lower [level] in the phase of maturity. When the <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of the higher [level] – which are the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> – return to the head of the higher [level],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, in the phase of maturity, when the effects of the second constriction are reversed.</i> they take the lower [level] with them as well. The lower [level] then acquires the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> and the brains in them, since [the lower level] is together with them in the head of the upper level, as a lower [entity] that ascends to an higher [level] becomes like [that higher level] (as stated in section 17, third paragraph).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“The other letters</b>, etc. <b>These [<i>eleh</i>] things I remember</b> etc. <b>in order to draw forth these letters.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the raising of feminine waters, as Israel raises feminine waters in order to draw forth the brains of maturity by means of drawing the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> of <i>Imma Ila'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, "supernal mother," in this context, this term refers to the female component of the level of <i>Bina</i>, the level of brains acquired by <i>Nukba</i> in this phase of maturity.</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“These [<i>eleh</i>] things I remember,”</b> i.e., to draw them forth, and therefore <b>“I recall in my mouth, and I pour out tears with the desire of my soul.”</b> This is referring to prayer at the gate of tears, which is never returned empty [see <i>Berakhot</i> 32b]. Then, after the feminine waters have been raised, <b>“I will lead them from above”</b>; I will draw forth the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> from above, from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), to the house of <i>Elohim</i>, meaning, to the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called <b>“the house of <i>Elohim</i>.”</b> After the drawing forth of the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, the <i>Nukba</i> itself is called <i>Elohim</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“So that it will be called <i>Elohim</i>, like it,”</b> i.e., like the mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, like <i>Bina</i>.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says: <b>“If a word is worth one <i>sela</i>, silence is worth two,”</b> as Rabbi Elazar’s statement raised the <i>Nukba</i> to the <i>Tevuna</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As was explained in the previous sections, <i>Tevuna</i> refers to the female component of <i>Yisrael Saba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the level of brains acquired by the <i>Nukba</i> prior to this higher phase of maturity.</i> which is below the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, for then [the <i>Nukba</i>] is still poised for a question, as stated, and is called “a <i>sela</i>.” This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“If a word is worth one <i>sela</i>.”</b> However, by means of Rabbi Elazar’s silence, which gave room for Rabbi Shimon to reveal the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> – which is through the ascent of the <i>Nukba</i> to the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, "supernal mother," in this context, this term refers to the female component of the level of <i>Bina</i>, the level of brains acquired by <i>Nukba</i> in this phase of maturity.</i> – two worlds were built as one. The lower world, <i>Nukba</i>, became one with the higher world. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Silence is worth two – for the two worlds were built and created together,”</b> as the <i>Nukba</i> ascended to <i>Imma</i> [<i>Ila'ah</i>] and became a male, like the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i>.

Paragraph 19

<b>19. “Rabbi Shimon said etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon said: From here onwards,</b> [we have] <b>the completeness of the text, as it is stated: “The One who brings out by number their host”</b> (Isaiah 40:26)<b>.</b> For <b>there are two levels, each of which needs to be imprinted</b>, meaning demarcated<b>. One is that about which it is stated <i>Ma</i>, and one is <i>Mi</i>. This one</b>, <i>Mi</i>, <b>is the higher one, and that one</b>, <i>Ma</i>, <b>is the lower one. The higher</b> level <b>records and says: “The One who brings out by number their host,”</b> in which the definite article of <b>“the One who brings forth”</b> alludes to <b>the one who is known and with whom none can compare</b>, i.e., <i>Mi</i><b>. Similarly, “The One who brings forth bread from the earth” –</b>the definite article of <b>“the One who brings forth”</b> alludes to <b>the one who is known, which is the lower level,</b> i.e. <i>Ma</i>, <b>and it is all one.</b> They are both within a single level, <i>Malkhut</i>, except that the higher one is <i>Mi</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, whereas the lower one is <i>Ma</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. “The One who brings out <b>by number”</b> means that the number <b>600,000 are</b> the stars <b>that are positioned together, and they bring forth hosts according to their kind, which have no number.</b>
Explanation: After Scripture hinted to us, with the phrase: “Lift up your eyes on high and see: who [<i>mi</i>] has created these [<i>eleh</i>]” (Isaiah 40:26), that we should reflect upon the structure of the <i>Nukba</i> in her name <i>Elohim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This has been extensively explored in the previous sections.</i> in which [<i>Nukba</i>] draws from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> – by which the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i> adorns her with her ornaments, as stated – the verse fills in and completes this explanation in its continuation: “The One who brings out by number their host, He calls them all by name; by the greatness of His might, and as He is strong in power, not one is missing,” as Rabbi Shimon proceeds to explain.
He thus states: <b>“There are two levels, each of which needs to be imprinted.”</b> “Imprinted” means “demarcated,” by means of the definitive article. Two levels require demarcation in the <i>Nukba</i>, namely the level of <i>Mi</i> and the level of <i>Ma</i>. The brains of the first three that [<i>Nukba</i>] receives through her ascent and enclothing of the upper world – through which the <i>Nukba</i> becomes like the upper world itself – is called <i>Mi</i>, since the <i>heh</i> of <i>Ma</i> is removed from it and is replaced by a <i>yod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This was explained at the end of the <i>Sulam</i>'s commentary on section 17.</i> The <i>Nukba</i> is also called <i>Mi</i>, like the upper world, as she adorns herself with male garments, as stated. However, at the same time, [<i>Nukba</i>’s] former level, which is <i>Ma</i>, is not lost from the <i>Nukba</i>. Rather, <i>Ma</i> must also be in [the <i>Nukba</i>] as before. The reason is as explained above, that the level of <i>Mi</i> is necessary to draw forth the completeness and the aspect of holy of holies to the offspring. But the bearing sons and being fruitful and multiplying depend solely on the name <i>Ma</i>. Therefore, if either of those levels is missing in the <i>Nukba</i>, she will be unfit to propagate.
[The <i>Zohar</i> continues]: <b>“The upper one records and says: The One who brings out by number their host.”</b> In other words, the verse states with regard to the level of <i>Mi</i> that the <i>Nukba</i> inherits from the higher world: “The One who brings out by number their host.” The definite article of “the One who brings forth” alludes to the complete brains that [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which are the aspect of being ornamented in male garments, as mentioned previously, when the <i>heh</i> is removed and the <i>yod</i> enters. This is the meaning of <b>“The One who brings forth – the one who is known and with whom none can compare,”</b> as this is the ultimate stature of the brains that operate in the <i>Nukba</i> for 6,000 years. Thus, it is written <b>“The One who brings forth bread</b> etc. <b>which is the lower level, and it is all one.”</b> That is, the definite article of “the One who brings forth bread” also alludes to the brains of the first three, i.e., <b>“the one who is known,”</b> but they are the brains of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> which the <i>Nukba</i> receives, and is known by them, and this is the level of <i>Ma</i>, as Rabbi Elazar explained earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See section 16 and earlier for the detailed explanation of <i>Nukba</i> with the brains corresponding with the level of <i>Ma</i>.</i> That level must also be imprinted in the <i>Nukba</i>, and this is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and it is all one,”</b> i.e., both of them, <i>Mi</i> and <i>Ma</i>, are incorporated in the <i>Nukba</i> together, as one <i>partzuf</i>, this one higher and that one lower.
One should not raise a difficulty from the statement in the <i>Zohar</i> in <i>Parashat Teruma</i> (771) that the phrase “the One who brings out by number their host,” and similarly in any case where the definite article is written, is from the lower world that was more revealed, whereas here it says that it is from the upper world. The explanation is as was written above, that here too it is referring to the revealed world, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. The reason why [the <i>Zohar</i> here] calls it the “higher one” is because of the level of <i>Mi</i> [within] the <i>Nukba</i>, which [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives only when it ascends and enclothes the higher world, which is the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i>. It is on this account that [the <i>Zohar</i>] calls [the aspect of <i>Mi</i>] the “higher" one,” and it calls the level of <i>Ma</i> of the revealed world the “lower one,” as was written above. As for the statement in <i>Teruma</i>: “Regarding all things that are from the upper, hidden world, the <i>heh</i> is hidden from there,” that is referring to when the revealed world does not ascend and enclothe the higher world, as then the higher world is concealed and does not illuminate to the lower realms. Therefore, [in such a context,] it is not written with the definite article [the letter <i>heh</i>], as it is hidden. See there, thoroughly.
[That which the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“By the number of these 600,000, that are positioned together, and that bring forth hosts after their kind, which have no number.”</b> “Number [<i>mispar</i>]” denotes ultimate completeness, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “The heavens declare [<i>mesaprim</i>] the glory of God, and the firmament shows His handiwork” (Psalms 19:2). This is as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Teruma</i>, 185-6): “What is the meaning of ‘declare’ etc. Rather, they illuminate and sparkle in the glitter of the supernal light, and ascend in the name that is incorporated in the brilliance of the supernal completeness etc. As a result, they ascend in a complete name, and they illuminate with a complete light, and they sparkle in a complete sparkle etc.” See there, thoroughly. Thus, “number” indicates the illumination of total completeness. One can understand from here that an incomplete illumination is regarded as a non-number, as something which has no number, which indicates that it lacks the perfection that is termed “number.”
Know that these aforementioned brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> transmits to the <i>Nukba</i>, are the mystical meaning of the verse “the heavens declare the glory of God.” “The heavens” are the mystical meaning of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; “the glory of God” is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; and “declare” is the <i>shefa</i> of the brains of the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. These brains are the mystical meaning of the 600,000, as the levels of <i>Nukba</i> are considered units, the [levels] of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are tens, those of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are hundreds, those of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> are thousands, and those of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> are tens of thousands. Additionally, there are two aspects in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>: Relative to themselves, [their levels] are regarded as thousands. Relative to the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] receive from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, [the levels in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are considered tens of thousands, like [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>]. However, [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are only considered the [level of] six extremities of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, since [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] enclothe from the mouth of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and below. Therefore, regarding the relativity [of the levels] [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are only of [the level] of the six extremities of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> which is [itself] tens of thousands.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is tens of thousands, while <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, the six extremities of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, are sixty, so together they form sixty ten thousands, or 600,000.</i> The six extremities are sixty, [thus together] they are the mystical meaning of 600,000. Consequently, when the <i>Nukba</i> ascends and enclothes <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, [the <i>Nukba</i> receives a complete number, which is 600,000: “Sixty” means the six extremities, since [the <i>Nukba</i>] still lacks, even then, the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. “Ten thousand” indicates the levels of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> that illuminate into <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, i.e., into <i>Arikh Anpin</i>’s six extremities, which are enclothed in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. Thus, the <i>Nukba</i> has the number 600,000.
Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“By number – 600,000 are those that are positioned together, and they bring forth hosts after their kind, which have no number.”</b> It has been explained that two levels, <i>Mi</i> and <i>Ma</i>, are imprinted in the <i>Nukba</i>, as follows: <i>Mi</i> is the mystical meaning of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which enclothe in the <i>Nukba</i>. [The <i>Nukba</i>] thereby becomes an aspect of the higher world, and in that respect [the <i>Nukba</i>] then has the mystical meaning of the number 600,000. <i>Ma</i> in the <i>Nukba</i> is the mystical meaning of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which enclothe in the <i>Nukba</i> in the aspect of “poised for the question <i>Ma</i> [‘what?’],” as explained previously. In this respect, the [<i>Nukba</i>] has the mystical meaning of the lower world. These two aforementioned levels, <i>Mi</i> and <i>Ma</i>, become one <i>partzuf</i> in her, as from [the <i>Nukba</i>’s] chest and above, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> are enclothed in [the <i>Nukba</i>], and from the chest and downward, [the <i>Nukba</i>] enclothes <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. Thus, they are one <i>partzuf</i> in [the <i>Nukba</i>], as written above, that “it is all one.” Therefore, these two levels are discerned in the offshoots<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> can be thought of as the blueprint for the lower worlds and levels. Therefore, that which is within the <i>Nukba</i> is reflected in the lower outgrowths of this <i>partzuf</i>.</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> as well. From the perspective of the higher world, the <i>Mi</i> in [<i>Nukba</i>] is the mystical meaning of “the One who brings out by number their host,” i.e., <b>“by the number 600,000.”</b> From the perspective of the lower world, the <i>Ma</i> in her, the offshoots are regarded as having no number. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And they bring forth hosts after their kind, which have no number.”</b> That is, [the <i>Nukba</i>] produces the various types of offshoots without a number, meaning, they do not contain those brains of a number from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, but only from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which are without a number.
Perhaps one might say: If so, [the <i>Nukba</i>’s] offshoots are incomplete because they lack a number. In response, [Rabbi Shimon] says: <b>“By number – 600,000 are those that are positioned together, and they bring forth hosts</b> etc.” In other words, those two levels within [the <i>Nukba</i>], which are a number and without a number,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the aspects of <i>Mi</i> (the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, "a number,") and <i>Ma</i> (the &lt;&lt;brains of="" &lt;i=""&gt;Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, "without a number") are both within the <i>Nukba</i>. exist in [the <i>Nukba</i>] together, as they are combined in [the <i>Nukba</i>] literally in a single level, and therefore these two levels are also found in her offshoots as one [unified level]. On the one hand, the offshoots [of the <i>Nukba</i>] are considered to be of the number 600,000, while on the other hand they are without a number. As a consequence, the aspect of "without a number" is considered merely as an additional [level of] completeness, not as any kind of deficiency.
The logic [underlying this additional completeness] is that blessing and fruitfully [reproducing] and multiplying with seed are completely dependent upon the aspect of the lower world, <i>Ma</i>, which is considered to be without a number. This is the mystical meaning of the blessing of seed that is presented in the verse: “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if you able to count them; and He said to him: So shall your seed be” (Genesis 15:5). Thus, the blessing of seed comes only without a number, i.e., from the name <i>Ma</i>. Therefore, after all the completeness of the brains of a number that [the <i>Nukba</i>] obtained from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> [of] <i>Mi</i>, [the <i>Nukba</i>] has an addition to the blessing from <i>Ma</i>, in the mystical meaning of without a number – <b>“which have no number.”</b> She also has a blessing, and both [aspects] are incorporated in the souls and in the offshoots.

Paragraph 20

<b>20. “He calls them all, whether etc.”</b><br><b>“He calls them all,” whether those sixty</b> ten thousands [600,000], <b>or all their hosts,</b> which have no number, <b>“by name.” What is “calls them all by name”? If you say that</b> [it means] <b>He calls them by their names, that is not so, for in that case it should have said,</b> “calls <b>by His name.” Rather, when this level does not ascend through the name</b> <i>Elohim</i><b>, but rather is called <i>Mi</i></b> (as stated in section 14, above)<b>,</b> [the level] <b>does not birth and does not produce what is concealed</b> in it<b>, according to their kind, even though they were all concealed in it.</b> That is, even though the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> have ascended, they still lack the precious garment of the [light of giving], and thus they are concealed and do not merit the name <i>Elohim</i> (as stated in the <i>Sulam</i>, section 14, above). <b>After He created “these”</b> [the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>] <b>and they ascended through His name,</b> i.e., they were enclothed in the precious garment of the [light of giving], at this stage <i>eleh</i> combines with <i>Mi</i>, <b>and</b> [the total construct] <b>is called <i>Elohim</i></b>, as previously explained<b>. Then, by the strength of this name, He produced them in completeness. This is: “He calls them by name,”</b> meaning <b>by His own name He called and produced each and every kind, to exist through His completeness.</b> Thus, it is stated: “The One who brings out by number their host, He calls them all by name,” i.e., by the complete name of <i>Elohim</i>. <b>It is similarly written: “See, I have called by name</b> [Bezalel the son of Uri,” Exodus 31:2]<b>,</b> meaning <b>I mention My name so that Bezalel will exist in his full existence.</b>
Explanation: This follows the explanation in the previous section, that the great completeness of the brains – which is the mystical meaning of the name <i>Elohim</i> – resides upon the souls and offshoots [of the <i>Nukba</i>] in both of its levels together, i.e., both on the level of "sixty ten-thousands" in [<i>Nukba</i>] and on the level of "all their hosts which have no number."<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The unification of these two levels in <i>Nukba</i> is the topic discussed in the previous section of the <i>Zohar</i>.</i> The name is on both of them, as is alluded in the verse: <b>“He calls them all by name.”</b> This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“<i>Mi</i> does not birth</b> etc. <b>When He created ‘these’</b> [<i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>] etc. <b>by the strength of this name, He produced them in completeness.”</b> As explained in the adjacent previous section, the blessing of the seed is completely dependent on the name <i>Ma</i>, which has no number.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the level of <i>Ma</i> is of the aspect of "no number" described in the previous section.</i> The meaning of this is that the brains of [the level of] number are the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the complete name [of <i>Elohim</i>], and all of the aspects [of <i>Nukba</i>] are in complete wholeness.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The level of "number" refers to the level of brains the <i>Nukba</i> attains from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, giving the <i>Nukba</i> access to the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This illumination is then enclothed in the light of giving in the level of <i>Ma</i>.</i> The brains of "without number" that come specifically from the name <i>Ma</i> are the brains of <i>ḥassadim</i> (the light of giving) alone, and as explained above in Elijah’s teaching to Rabbi Shimon, the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is not received without the precious garment of <i>ḥassadim</i> (the light of giving). Without this [light of giving], even though the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> ascend to <i>Mi</i>, [the <i>Nukba</i>] still did not ascend through the name <i>Elohim</i>. This is the mystical meaning of: “Who [<i>Mi</i>] has created these [<i>eleh</i>]” – that He created light of the [light of giving] for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <b>“and they were enclothed in one another and it ascended through the supernal name.”</b>
This is the meaning of his statement here: <b>“<i>Mi</i> does not birth and does not produce what is concealed in it, according to their kind, even though they were all concealed in it.”</b> This is as stated above, that although the dot<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The "dot" refers to the <i>Malkhut</i> that ascended into <i>Bina</i> in the second constriction.</i> was already <b>“extruded from the thought”</b> to the place of <i>Malkhut</i>, and became an engraving of one picture, the holy of holies, and <i>Bina</i> and <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of the vessels and the first three of the lights returned [to the level], nevertheless they all [remain] concealed. Furthermore, <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first three lights, the "brains" of the higher level that require the [light of giving] in order to properly be received and utilized by the <i>Nukba</i>.</i></i> remain deep and concealed in the name, because they cannot receive illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> without the [light of giving].
However, <b>“after He created ‘these’</b> [<i>eleh</i>]<b>,”</b> meaning after He further performed a [fusion through collision] upon the partition of [the level of] <i>Ma</i>, which is the lower world, and produced a height of brains of the [light of giving] upon [the partition], [brains] which are called <b>“without a number,”</b> [He then] gave it to <i>eleh</i>, all of which is the mystical meaning of “created these.” That is, He placed the garment of the [light of giving] upon the [first three lights], which is called “created.” Then, <b>“they ascended through His name, and it was called <i>Elohim</i>.”</b> For now that they have attained the height of the [light of giving], they can receive the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which are the brains of the number 600,000. At this point, the letters combine with one another, and ascend through the name and is called <i>Elohim</i>. <b>“Then, by the strength of this name, He produced them in completeness.”</b> Consequently, that completeness of the name – which is the enclothing of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the [light of giving] – is also upon the souls and offshoots that emerged from the name <i>Elohim</i>. <b>“This is</b> [the meaning of]<b>: He calls them by name,”</b> as the name [of <i>Elohim</i>] is called upon the offshoots – <b>“by His own name He called and produced each and every kind, to exist in completeness.”</b> With this name, He produced the offshoots, both of the kind <b>“of 600,000,”</b> as well as of the kind <b>“which have no number,”</b> so that they would exist in the completeness of the name, i.e., that they would enclothe one in the other just as [these two aspects] are enclothed [one in the other] in the name. As for the statement, <b>“See, I have called by name,”</b> he is bringing a proof from Scripture that the phrase “calling by name” is indicative of existence and wholeness.

Paragraph 21

<b>21. “By the greatness of His might etc.”</b><br>He asks: <b>What is “by the greatness of His might”</b> (Isaiah 40:26)<b>?</b> He answers: <b>This is the head of the levels, upon which all of the desires rise and ascend through it in a concealed manner. “As He is strong in power” is the secret of the upper world,</b> called <i>Mi</i>, <b>which ascended in the name <i>Elohim</i>, as we said. “Not one of them is missing” from those 600,000 that He produced through the strength of that name. And since “not one of them is missing”</b> from the number 600,000, <b>in any place where Israel died and were punished for their sins, they were</b> later <b>counted and none of the 600,000 were missing, not even one, so that all will be in a single image,</b> both above and below<b>. Just as “not one of them is missing”</b> from the number 600,000 <b>above, so too “not one</b> of them <b>is missing”</b> from this number <b>below.</b>
Explanation: <b>“By the greatness of His might”</b> alludes to <i>Keter</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which is <b>“the head of the levels”</b> of these brains, the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which became <i>Keter</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, as <b>“all of the desires rise”</b> there, i.e., all of the levels receive from [this <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>]. And yet they <b>“ascend through it in a concealed manner,”</b> since it is the mystical meaning of “unknown air,” for the <i>yod</i> has not left the air [of <i>Bina</i>] [<i>avir</i>; <i>alef-vav-yod-reish</i>], as it is the mystical meaning of: “Because He delights in mercy” (Micah 7:18). Therefore, [this <i>Bina</i>] is in a state of ultimate completeness (as stated above, in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>), and this is why it is called “pure air.” He is teaching us that although the height of the [light of giving], which is called “air,” emerges upon the lower world, <i>Ma</i>, it is still in a state of ultimate completeness because this light draws from the first three of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which is the head of all the levels of <i>Atzilut</i>, i.e., <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. Therefore, the height of the [light of giving] within [the <i>Nukba</i>] is also considered pure air, as in the first three of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.
He then says: <b>“‘As He is strong in power,’ is the secret of the upper world,”</b> i.e., the aspect of <i>Mi</i> in <i>Nukba</i>, from where the number 600,000 is drawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These concepts were all explained extensively in the preceding sections of the <i>Zohar</i>.</i> [The <i>Nukba</i>] enclothes the upper world, which is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, as stated above.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous sections, the <i>Sulam</i> explained that the <i>Nukba</i> enclothed the levels of <i>Ma</i> (the level of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>) and <i>Mi</i> (the level of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>) within itself.</i> This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Not one of them is missing, from those 600,000 that He produced through the strength of that name,”</b> since from there [the <i>Nukba</i>] attains the brains of the number 600,000, as stated. He adds: <b>“Just as not one of them is missing above, so too not one is missing below”</b> – since the <i>Nukba</i> enclothed <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, in the mystical meaning of <b>“the mother lends her garments to the daughter and adorns her with her ornaments”</b> (as stated), [the <i>Nukba</i>] therefore became completely like <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. And just as the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> are complete in the mystical meaning of the number 600,000, and “not one of them is missing,” so too the <i>Nukba</i> is complete in that number, and “not one of them is missing.”

Paragraph 22

<b>22. “<i>Bereshit</i>, Rav Hamnuna etc.”</b><br><b><i>Bereshit</i></b> [“In the beginning”]. <b>Rav Hamnuna Saba said: We have found</b> in the words <i>Bereshit bara Elohim et</i> [“In the beginning God created”], <b>an inverse order of</b> their <b>letters. First,</b> it writes <b><i>bet</i>, and then</b> [another] <b><i>bet</i>, that is, <i>Bereshit bara</i>, next</b> it writes <b><i>alef</i>, and then</b> [another] <b><i>alef</i>, that is, <i>Elohim et</i>.</b> He answers: <b>When the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to make the world, all the letters were still concealed, and two thousand years before the creation of the world the Holy One, blessed be He, was observing and playing with</b> the letters<b>.</b>
Explanation: [Rav Hamnuna Saba] asks two questions: (a) Why are the letters <i>alef</i> and <i>bet</i> in reverse order at the start of the Torah, with the <i>bet</i> coming first and only then the <i>alef</i>? (b) Why are those two letters doubled, as the first two words, <i>Bereshit bara</i>, both start with a <i>bet</i>, and the next two words, <i>Elohim et</i>, each begins with an <i>alef</i>?
He answers: <b>“When the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to make the world,”</b> i.e., when the Holy One, blessed be He, which is <i>Bina</i>, wished to produce <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, which are called “world,” the letters, which are the vessels of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, were <b>“concealed.”</b> That is, they were incorporated in the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>], which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and the [letters] were not [yet] known. And <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> are called “two thousand years.” Before He created the world, the letters of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> were incorporated in <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>. Therefore, this incorporation of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> in <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> is described as <b>“two thousand years before the creation of the world the Holy One, blessed be He, was observing and playing with them.”</b> At that point, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> were regarded as feminine waters in the two thousand years, which are <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, and the feminine waters always bring playfulness to the upper realm. This is why [Rav Hamnuna] said that at that time, when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] became feminine waters in <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, was observing and playing with them.”</b>

Paragraph 23

<b>23. “When He wished to create etc.”</b><br><b>When He wished to create the world, all the letters came before Him, from last to first.</b> The letter <b><i>tav</i> began to enter first. She said: “Master of the worlds! It is good for You to create the world with me, as I am the seal on Your ring,</b> which is <b><i>emet</i></b> [truth], i.e., the last letter of the word <i>emet</i>, <b>and You are called</b> by the name <b><i>Emet</i>. It is fitting for the King to begin with the letter of <i>emet</i>, and to create the world with me.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: You are beautiful and straight, but you are unfit for the world to be created with you, since in the future you will be inscribed upon the foreheads of men of faith,</b> [as a sign] <b>that they kept the Torah from <i>alef</i> to <i>tav</i>, and upon your inscription they will die</b> (as is written in <i>Shabbat</i> 55a)<b>. Furthermore, you are the seal of death</b>, since <i>tav</i> is also the last letter in the word <i>mavet</i> [death]<b>. As you are such, you are unfit for the world to be created with you.” She immediately departed.</b>
Explanation: When He began to distil the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, which are called “world,” in order to create them, all the letters of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> came before the Holy One, blessed be He, starting with <i>tav</i>, the last of all the letters, and ending with <i>alef</i>, the first of them all. The reason why they came from last to first, rather than in their usual alphabetical order, was because they came by the mystical meaning of feminine waters, in which they are arranged in that manner, in the mystical meaning of <i>tav</i>-<i>shin</i>-<i>resh</i>-<i>kof</i> etc. The order of <i>aleph</i>-<i>bet</i>-<i>gimmel</i> applies only to the mystical meaning of masculine waters,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Feminine waters refers to the "yearning from below" of the created beings for the supernal light. "Masculine waters" is the counterpart, the "yearning from above" to bestow. As a result, masculine waters are said to flow "in order" from above to below, while feminine waters flow in "reverse," from below to above.</i> which are from above to below. By contrast, the feminine waters are always in the opposite order of the male waters, from below to above (as stated in the <i>Zohar Ḥadash</i>, <i>Shir HaShirim</i>, 284).
Now, this exposition on the letters is exceedingly profound. To clarify it a little, I will give you a brief introduction into the breadth of this exposition: The creation of the world means refinement and perpetuation in such a manner that the world can exist and complete the purpose for which it was created. It is known that “God made one thing corresponding to the other” [Ecclesiastes 7:14]. This means that corresponding to each force in holiness, the Holy One, blessed be He, made an equal force in the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> corresponding to the holiness. Just as there are four worlds, <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, of holiness, so too there are four worlds, <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, of impurity, corresponding to them. Consequently, in the world of <i>Asiya</i>, one who serves God is not recognizable from one who does not serve Him, i.e., there is no [visible] distinction at all between holiness and impurity (<i>Etz Ḥayyim</i>, section 3, introduction). Accordingly, it is very difficult to understand how the world can exist, for how can we differentiate good from evil, holiness from impurity?
However, there is one very important [method of] distinguishing [good and evil], which is that a foreign god is barren and does not bear fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, this term is <i>el aḥer</i>, literally "other power." This refers to forces in existence that appear to be "other" than God, like the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>.</i> Therefore, those who stumble in [following a foreign god] and walk along the path of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of impurity, their source dries up and they have no spiritual fruits for a blessing. They wither away until they are completely sealed up. The opposite is the case for those who adhere to holiness – their handiwork is blessed, as it is stated: “Like a tree planted by streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf does not wither, and in whatever he does he shall prosper” (Psalms 1:3). This is the only [method of] distinguishing [good and evil] in the world of <i>Asiya</i> by which one can know if he is in holiness or, Heaven forfend, the opposite. And this is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And try Me now with this, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall be more than sufficiency” (Malachi 3:10), and it is subsequently written: “Then you shall again discern between the righteous and the wicked, between he who serves God and he who does not serve Him” (Malachi 3:18). It is clearly stated that it is impossible to differentiate at all between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him, other than through the secret of the blessing alone, and not by any other means, as this is the implication of the phrase: “And try Me now with this.”
This is the key point of this exposition of the letters – every single one of the letters, without exception, came to create the world according to the theme of the level of holiness unique to that letter. For the twenty-two letters are the particulars of all the heads of the levels in the four worlds of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>. Each of the letters considered its own merit, that is, [each letter] assumed that by attaining her level, the people of the world would be able to make holiness prevail over the <i>kelippot</i>, in order to reach the desired state of complete rectification. But the Holy One, blessed be He, replied to each of them that corresponding to [each letter], the same force is in the <i>kelippot</i> as well, and therefore the people of the world will not attain any distinguishing [of good from evil] through them. Finally, the [letter] <i>bet</i> arrived, whose theme of her level is <i>berakha</i> [“blessing”], to which nothing corresponds in the <i>kelippot</i> at all, since a foreign god is barren and does not bear fruit, as stated. Then <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, told her: I will certainly create the world with you...”</b> as distinguishing and discernment [of good from evil] is possible only through her, to distinguish between a servant of God and one who does not serve Him, since there is nothing corresponding to her in the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Consequently, the world will certainly exist through her, to distinguish and enhance the holiness over the chariots of impurity, until death is swallowed up forever [see Isaiah 25:8] and they will achieve complete rectification.
One should also know the general division of the twenty-two letters into three levels, namely <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>. There are no vessels – which are the letters – above <i>Bina</i>. The twenty-two letters in <i>Bina</i> are called “large letters,” the twenty-two letters in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are known simply as “letters,” while the twenty-two letters in <i>Malkhut</i> are “small letters.” In the same manner, they each subdivide into three levels: <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, since there are [levels of] <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, in the twenty-two letters of <i>Bina</i>, and the same applies to the twenty-two in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and also to the twenty-two in <i>Malkhut</i>. The twenty-two letters themselves divide into three levels, of units, tens, and hundreds. The units, from <i>alef</i> through <i>tet</i>, are the nine <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>; the tens, from <i>yod</i> to <i>tzadi</i>, are the nine <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, while the hundreds are from the <i>Nukba</i>. This is why there are only four letters, <i>kof-resh-shin-tav</i>, in <i>Malkhut</i>, since [<i>Malkhut</i>] occupies only four of the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, from the chest of [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] and below, which are <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> – <i>kof-resh</i> are <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>; <i>shin-tav</i> are <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>.
One should not raise the following difficulty: Isn’t it known that the units are in <i>Nukba</i>, the tens are in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the hundreds are in the <i>Imma</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Imma</i> here refers to <i>Bina</i>.</i> The explanation is that there is always an inverse relationship between the lights and the vessels. In the vessels, the higher [vessels] appear first, whereas the opposite is the case in the lights, as there the lower [lights] appear first. Thus, if there are only [the level of] units of the vessels there, from <i>alef</i> to <i>yod</i>, there is only <i>Malkhut</i> of the lights there. If the [level of] tens of the vessels also arrive, the light of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> of lights comes as well. And if [the level of] the hundreds of the vessels, <i>kof-resh-shin-tav</i> are also completed, the lights of <i>Bina</i> appear, which are [the lights of the level of] hundreds. For this reason, the hundreds are considered <i>Bina</i>, the tens <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the units <i>Malkhut</i>. However, with respect to the vessels themselves, the reverse is the case – the units are in the <i>Imma</i>, the tens in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the hundreds in <i>Nukba</i>.
[Rav Hamnuna] then says: <b>“<i>Tav</i> began to enter first</b> etc.” That is, it is known that each of the letters of the alphabet has a unique level under her control. Therefore, the <i>tav</i> argued that she was better qualified to refine the world than all of the other letters because the truth is in her domain, and she is the seal of the King’s ring.
The meaning is as follows: It is known that the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> survives only on that which the [side of] holiness illuminates for it, a very small luminescence, which is the mystical meaning of [the verse]: “Her feet go down to death” (Proverbs 5:5) and the mystical meaning of [the verse]: “And His kingdom rules over all” (Psalms 103:19). This is the mystical meaning of the leg of the <i>kof</i>, which extends below the line of the letters. It alludes to the very small luminescence that the <i>Malkhut</i> gives to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Accordingly, you will not find a leg extending below in any of the twenty-two letters other than the <i>kof</i>, as she belongs to the letters of <i>Malkhut</i>, for <i>kof-resh-shin-tav</i> are in <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated previously. However, the left leg of the <i>tav</i> initially began to extend below the line and the Holy One, blessed be He saw that the grip of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> would be too strong, and therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, stopped her and drew her leg back so that it would end on the same level as the line of holiness. This is why [the <i>tav</i>'s] left leg grew thicker, for the part that extended [below the line], which He drew back, was folded over itself there. For this reason, no illumination reaches from [the <i>tav</i>] to the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. What is more, she was established as the seal of the ring, guarding the <i>kelippot</i> so that they would not draw near and suckle from the holiness via that path, and anyone who touches her would die. The very small luminescence that is required for the existence of the <i>kelippot</i> was made through the letter <i>kof</i>, since she is the highest letter in <i>Malkhut</i> and far from the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and therefore there is no fear of the <i>kelippot</i> gripping too tightly. For this reason, she is called <i>kof</i>, indicating that from her comes the start of the power to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i>, known as “wicked man,” so as to resemble the <i>partzufim</i> of holiness, the mystical meaning of [the verse]: “One thing corresponding to the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14). This is like the similarity of a monkey [<i>kof</i>] to a man, and people err with regard to the [wicked men] and they lie in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.
This was the claim of the <i>tav</i>: Since <b>“I am the seal on Your ring,”</b> as I am positioned at the end of every <i>partzuf</i>, and I do not allow the <i>kelippot</i> to approach and suckle from the holiness and lie in Your name, it is fitting for the world to be created with me, and all the distinguishing between the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and holiness will be through me, and all the people of the world will be assured of their destiny.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And You are called <i>Emet</i>; it is fitting for the King to begin with the letter of <i>emet</i>, and to create the world with me.”</b> In other words, since Your name is <i>Emet</i> [Truth], an indication that it is impossible to cleave unto You other than by obtaining the attribute of truth, it is fitting for the King to begin with the letter of <i>emet</i> and to create the world with me. For with my attribute, people will repel the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i> and they will cleave unto You. Then, all the people in the world will be assured of the completion of the rectification. This is as taught in the <i>Zohar</i>: <b>“The Lord is near to all who call upon Him”</b> (Psalms 145:18)<b>. To whom is He near?</b> [The verse] <b>reiterates: “To all who call upon Him in truth.” But is there anyone who calls upon Him falsely? Rabbi Abba said: Yes – this is one who calls without knowing to whom he calls. From where do we derive this? As it is stated: “To all who call upon Him in truth.” What is “in truth”? With the seal of the King’s ring, which is complete wholeness</b> (<i>Ha’azinu</i>, 210).
The Holy One, blessed be He, replied to [the <i>tav</i>] that she is unfit for the world to be created through her, since due to her strength, the judgments would be too harsh. Even the completely righteous – who have already been rewarded with an inscription of her seal and who have kept the Torah from <i>alef</i> to <i>tav</i> – are still punished by her harsh strength because they did not protest against the wicked, as stated in <i>Shabbat</i> 55a. Furthermore, [the <i>tav</i>] is also the seal of death, as through her strength death was created in the world, since people are rounded up for death only because the serpent falsified her seal and caused Adam to sin with the Tree of Knowledge, as stated in the <i>Tikkunim</i> (<i>Tikkun</i> 22). It is therefore impossible that the world would be able to exist through [the letter <i>tav</i>].

Paragraph 24

<b>24. “<i>Shin</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>shin</i> entered before Him. She said to Him: “Master of the worlds! It is good for You to create the world with me, as Your name is called by me, <i>Shaddai</i>, and it is fitting to create the world with a holy name. He said to her: You are beautiful, you are good, and you are true, but since the letters of falsehood</b> [<i>sheker</i>] <b>took you to be with them, I do not wish to create the world with you. For <i>sheker</i> cannot exist unless the letters <i>kof</i> and <i>resh</i> take you.</b>
Explanation: The <i>Nukba</i> has two endpoints; one is called <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the <i>tav</i>, and the other is called <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the <i>shin</i>. The explanation is that when [the <i>Nukba</i>] is without a structure from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous sections, the <i>Nukba</i> draws brains from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, building the <i>Nukba</i> into its proper structure.</i> the <i>tav</i> is considered the endpoint, which is a harsh judgment, as we stated just above.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous section of the <i>Zohar</i>.</i> And when [the <i>Nukba</i>] is in the structure of a <i>partzuf</i> by means of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, the letter <i>shin</i> is formed at the endpoint [of the <i>Nukba</i>], with the three heads of the <i>shin</i> representing the illumination of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of the <i>Imma</i>, which [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives through <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> into the endpoint [of the <i>Nukba</i>], in the mystical meaning of the verse: “The well, which the princes dug etc.” (Numbers 21:18). By means of this illumination [the <i>Nukba</i>] becomes a vessel to receive one hundred blessings from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, in the mystical meaning of: “A woman enacts a covenant only with the one who made her into a vessel” (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 22a). [The <i>Nukba</i>] thereby becomes a receptacle to receive one hundred blessings from <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. This endpoint is therefore called <b>“the middle point of the settlement,”</b> since the whole settling of the world comes from it, and it is also called <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i>.
Consequently, the letter <i>shin</i> is called a “letter of truth,” like the <i>tav</i>, and it is similarly called “the King’s seal,” like [the <i>tav</i>]. The word “seal” has multiple meanings: First, it denotes the end of the <i>partzuf</i>, like the seal of the king, which comes at the end of a document that is written in the king’s name. Second, the seal of the king is like the king Himself, as stated in the <i>Tikkunim</i> (<i>Tikkun</i> 22): “They fear the writing of the King’s seal as though it was the King Himself.” For this reason, the seal is called “a sign of truth,” since the whole truthfulness is thereby apparent from the seal. However, the <i>shin</i> has an advantage over the <i>tav</i>, since the <i>shin</i> is called by the mystical meaning of the name <i>Shaddai</i>, which means that He said to His world: “<i>Dai</i> [enough]; spread no further” (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 12a).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The name <i>Shaddai</i> mentioned here reflects God's ability to constrain and control reality, allowing it to serve as a stable context fit for populating. Thus, while the <i>tav</i> represents an intrinsic endpoint demarcating the edge of the realms of holiness, the <i>shin</i> demarcates reality in terms of its capacity for inhabitation.</i> This refers to the building of the world in terms of [its] settlement, which ended only with a <i>shin</i>, through which He said to His world: Enough, do not spread further into the aspect of the <i>tav</i>. Therefore, the end point of the <i>shin</i> is called the middle point of the settlement.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">"Middle point" means "the heart" of the settlement, its essence.</i>
This was the <i>shin</i>’s claim: <b>“It is good for You to create the world with me, as Your name is called by me, <i>Shaddai</i>.”</b> Having seen that He rejected the <i>tav</i> because of the harsh attribute of judgment [the <i>tav</i>] contains, the <i>shin</i> thought to herself that the Holy One, blessed be He, would choose her attribute for the creation of the world, since she has all the merits of the <i>tav</i> – as she too is the King’s seal, and she is likewise a letter of truth – and she has another merit, since the name <i>Shaddai</i> is called by her. She was selected for the endpoint of the <i>Nukba</i> with respect to the settlement of the world, not the <i>tav</i>. Accordingly, she found the inner strength to come before the Holy One, blessed be He, [to request] that He should create the world with her attribute.
The Holy One, blessed be He, replied to her, to the <i>shin</i>: “Although your attribute is great, as you claim, it is for this very reason that your opposite in the <i>kelippa</i> is very strong. Falsehood could not exist in the world had the two letters of forgery and falsehood of the <i>kelippot</i> not taken you, i.e., <i>kof</i> and <i>resh</i>.” In other words, there are two sources [of lifeforce] for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and all of the <i>kelippot</i>. One is a very small luminescence, which the [the side of] holiness itself shines for [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i>] so they can exist and not be negated, as long as they are needed in order to punish the wicked. [With respect to this source], their construction is not great because the illumination is very slight, merely enough to sustain them, as the male [aspect] of the <i>kelippa</i> is only six extremities without a head, while the <i>Nukba</i> [of the <i>kelippa</i>] is only a dot without any expansion at all. As you already know [from the previous section of the <i>Zohar</i>], this very small luminescence is drawn to [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i>] by means of the letter <i>kof</i>, since this is the beginning of their power to resemble the man<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The language of "man" here in Hebrew is <i>adam</i>, and is a reference to the structure of man that is present in all levels of creation.</i> of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of holiness, like a monkey [<i>kof</i>] in relation to man, which is the mystical meaning of: “God made one thing corresponding to the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, each created being on the side of holiness has a corresponding counterpart on the side of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>.</i> The second source [of lifeforce] for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is from the corruption of the lower beings, as through their evil deeds they draw away lights of holiness to the <i>kelippot</i>. The first corruption occurred at the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, through which a great structure was made for [the <i>kelippot</i>], with five <i>partzufim</i> and <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, just like there is for the [side of] holiness.
This second source [of lifeforce for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i>] is the letter <i>resh</i>, which indicates that [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i>] ascend and attach as high as <i>Bina</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the letter <i>dalet</i>. As explained above, the twenty-two letters of the <i>Malkhut</i> are divided into <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>: The units are <i>Bina</i>, the tens <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the hundreds <i>Malkhut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew alphabet, the first nine letters equal 1-9, the next nine are 10-90, the "tens" and the last four are 100-400, the "hundreds." In this example, the twenty-two letters under discussion are all within <i>Malkhut</i> but are divided up to correspond to the levels of <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> that are within <i>Malkhut</i>.</i> Thus, the <i>dalet</i> of the twenty-two letters of <i>Malkhut</i> is positioned at the start of the seven lower letters of <i>Bina</i>, since <i>alef</i>-<i>bet</i>-<i>gimmel</i> are the first three, and from the <i>dalet</i> and onwards, through <i>tet</i>, they are the six extremities of <i>Bina</i> in <i>Malkhut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The first three numbers correspond to the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, while the fourth, <i>dalet</i>, corresponds to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Ḥesed</i>, the beginning of the six extremities of the <i>Bina</i> level within <i>Malkhut</i>.</i>
The mystical meaning of <i>dalet</i> is the poverty and wretchedness that is in <i>Malkhut</i> in general, since <i>Malkhut</i> “has nothing of her own, except for what her husband,” <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, “gives her,” as is known.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Malkhut</i> receives from <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and has "nothing of its own," which is correlated to the meaning of the Hebrew word <i>dalut</i>, like the letter <i>dalet</i>, which means "poverty."</i> This attribute of [<i>Malkhut</i>] is inscribed in the <i>dalet</i>, because when [the letter <i>dalet</i>] is [written out in] full it is <i>dalet</i>-<i>lamed</i>-<i>tav</i>, connoting “poverty [<i>dalut</i>]” and “emptiness.” The <i>dalet</i> also has a protruding corner on its roof, which indicates the protrusion of [the light of giving] (<i>ḥassadim</i>) in [the letter], which the <i>dalet</i> takes from the <i>gimmel</i> that precedes it. This <i>gimmel</i> is from the first three [letters] of <i>Bina</i> [of <i>Malkhut</i>, [and this <i>gimmel</i>] receives from its corresponding aspect in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which itself receives from its corresponding aspect in <i>Bina</i>, where [the light of giving] are in great abundance. For this reason, [this letter] is called <i>gimmel</i>, from the phrase <i>gommel ḥassadim</i> [bestower of kindnesses, <i>ḥassadim</i>] (see <i>Shabbat</i> 104a), for [the <i>gimmel</i>] performs acts of kindness with the <i>dalet</i>, since [the <i>dalet</i>] has nothing of its own, and [the <i>gimmel</i>] bestows abundant giving [upon the <i>dalet</i>]. This protrusion of giving is alluded to by the corner on the roof of the <i>dalet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The right side of the roof of the <i>dalet</i> protrudes backward toward the <i>gimmel</i>, the preceding letter, to indicate that it is receiving the bestowal of giving from the <i>gimmel</i>.</i>
However, the opposite [counterpart] of <i>Malkhut</i> of holiness is “a backbiter alienates friends,” which is the mystical meaning of “an arrogant pauper” [see <i>Pesaḥim</i> 113b] who does not want to receive from the <i>gimmel</i> and submit to it. Instead, [this counterpart] pretends to be master, with great pride. Due to this flaw, the corner is erased from the <i>dalet</i>, which is the protrusion of [the light of giving] in [the <i>dalet</i>], and [the <i>dalet</i>] becomes poor and destitute [<i>rash</i>], since erasing the corner from the <i>dalet</i> gives it the form of a <i>resh</i>, i.e., <i>rash</i>, which is the mystical meaning of: “Even in his reign he was revealed as poor [<i>rash</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 4:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, in an impure version, the <i>dalet</i>, instead of viewing itself as poor and receiving from the <i>gimmel</i>, it views itself as the master, and cuts itself off from the source of the bestowal of giving. This erodes the right corner of the roof of the <i>dalet</i>, and the remaining shape is that of the letter <i>resh</i>, from the word <i>rash</i>, meaning destitute.</i> The unification of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> of holiness is in the mystical meaning of [the letters of] <i>eḥad</i> [“one,” <i>alef</i>-<i>ḥet</i>-<i>dalet</i>]. This is because <i>alef</i>-<i>ḥet</i> is the nine <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which gives from the <i>gimmel</i> of <i>Bina</i> [above <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] to the <i>gimmel</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, by which the <i>Malkhut</i> becomes the mystical meaning of a <i>dalet</i> with a protruding angle – with abundant [light of giving].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> serves as the bridge sharing the light of giving of the <i>gimmel</i> of <i>Bina</i> with <i>Malkhut</i>.</i> Through this, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> become “one” (<i>eḥad</i>) flesh in complete unification. Thus, when the lower beings corrupt their actions, they give power to <i>Malkhut</i> of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> to cling to the <i>dalet</i>, which is the <i>Malkhut</i>, in order to erase the angle that protrudes in [receiving the light of giving] and turn it into a <i>resh</i>. Then the <i>eḥad</i> becomes <i>aḥer</i> [“other,” <i>alef</i>-<i>ḥet</i>-<i>resh</i>], and other gods cling to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of holiness. This is the mystical meaning of: “A backbiter alienates friends” (Proverbs 16:28).
It is then considered that the letters <i>kof</i>-<i>resh</i> of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> expropriate for themselves the seal of the <i>shin</i>, which is the sign of “truth,” and the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i>, which is the receptacle of the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as stated previously. [The <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i>] now goes to another god, of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, because out of this <i>shin</i> a <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is built. Therefore, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> grows, with ten complete <i>sefirot</i> with a head, and the <i>shin</i> that [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] exploited becomes a point of destruction, because the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is built from the ruin of holiness. From here the [worlds of] <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of the “wicked man” are built. It has thus been explained how the <i>kof</i>-<i>resh</i> are the two sources of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and therefore they are called the “letters of forgery,” since the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> forged them in the above manner, in order to destroy the construction and unification of holiness, for [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] to be built on the ruin of the holiness, as stated. This is achieved primarily by drawing to [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] the <i>shin</i>, which is the form of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i>, into their portion and domain, by forging the <i>dalet</i> into a <i>resh</i>, which forges <i>eḥad</i> into <i>aḥer</i>, creating a structure for the <i>partzufim</i> of other gods. Thus, falsehood and forgery would not exist in such a large structure had the <i>kof</i>-<i>resh</i> of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> not expropriated the <i>shin</i> for themselves.
This is the meaning of the response of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the <i>shin</i>: <b>“You are beautiful, you are good, and you are true, but since the letters of falsehood</b> [<i>sheker</i>] <b>took you to be with them, I do not wish to create the world with you. For <i>sheker</i> will not exist unless the letters <i>kof</i> and <i>resh</i> take you.”</b> This is as we explained, that there would be no structure for falsehood and forgery of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> had it not expropriated the <i>shin</i> for itself, and therefore the world should not be created by means of the attribute [of the <i>shin</i>], as its opposite is balanced against it, and the completion of the rectification is not assured through it.

Paragraph 25

<b>25. “From here, whoever wants etc.”</b><br><b>From here</b> it is derived that <b>whoever wants to say a falsehood should begin with a foundation of truth, and then the falsehood will be maintained for him. For the letter <i>shin</i> is a letter of truth, the letter of truth through which the forefathers were united,</b> as the three lines in the <i>shin</i> allude to the three forefathers, who are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>while <i>kof</i>-<i>resh</i> are letters that are visible on the evil side</b>, because the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is cold [<i>kar</i>], without the heat of vitality, since [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] suckles from the <i>Malkhut</i> when she is a frozen sea (as stated in <i>Bereshit</i> I, page 47, s.v. <i>Yama de-kafu</i>)<b>. In order to survive,</b> [the kof-resh] <b>take</b> the letter <b><i>shin</i> within them, which</b> forms the combination <b><i>kesher</i></b> [“bond,” <i>kof</i>-<i>shin</i>-<i>resh</i>], a term of strengthening and sustaining<b>. When she</b>, the <i>shin</i>, <b>saw that, she departed from Him.</b>
Explanation: As was explained previously, the illumination of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Bina</i>, which are given to [<i>Nukba</i>] through <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, constructed the end point of the <i>Nukba</i> into a vessel and a receptacle for the one hundred blessings from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> are called “forefathers.” This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Through which the forefathers were united,”</b> and it is for this reason that [the <i>shin</i>] is called “a letter of truth,” as stated above; see there.
<b>“<i>Kof</i>-<i>resh</i> are letters that are visible on the evil side.”</b> This was already explained in the adjacently preceding section, that [<i>kof</i> and <i>resh</i>] are the two sources of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Thus, the <i>Zohar</i> says, <b>“In order to survive,</b> [<i>kof</i> and <i>resh</i>] <b>take</b> the letter <b><i>shin</i> within them, which is <i>kesher</i>.”</b> By erasing the corner [of the roof] of the <i>dalet</i> of <i>eḥad</i> [“one”], they expropriate to within themselves the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i> of holiness, which is the <i>shin</i>, and the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Nukba</i> of <i>kelippa</i> is constructed in the letter <i>shin</i>. They thereby have a very strong hold on holiness, which is called <i>kesher</i>, since a bond [<i>kesher</i>] indicates that the grasp is very strong and hard to detach.

Paragraph 26

<b>26. “<i>Tzadi</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>tzadi</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: “Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, as the righteous [<i>tzaddikim</i>] are sealed with me, and You, who are called <i>tzaddik</i>, are inscribed with me, as it is stated: ‘For the Lord is righteous and He loves righteousness’</b> [Psalms 11:7]<b>, and</b> [thus] <b>it is fitting to create the world with me.”</b> <b>He said to her: “<i>tzadi</i>, you are <i>tzadi</i>, and you are righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>], but you must be concealed. You do not need to be so exposed</b> that the creation of the world should begin with you<b>, so as not give the world a pretext.” What is the reason</b> that she has to be concealed<b>?</b> Because <b>she was</b> a letter <b><i>nun</i>,</b> and then the <b><i>yod</i> of the name, which is the holy covenant, came and rode atop</b> the <i>nun</i>, <b>and united with her</b>, becoming the <i>tzadi</i><b>. The mystical meaning of this matter is that when the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam the first</b> [man]<b>,</b> who is the mystical meaning of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>He created him with two faces</b>, i.e., a male face and a female face, attached to one another through their backs<b>. For this reason, the face of the <i>yod</i> is turned back</b> from the <i>nun</i> <b>like this</b> [image of the <i>tzadi</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew, there is a printed letter <i>tzadi</i> with this structural shape.</i> with the <i>yod</i> facing one way and the <i>nun</i> facing the other way, <b>and they are not returned</b> [to a state of] <b>face-to-face like this</b> [image of the <i>tzadi</i>]<b>.</b><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew, there is a printed letter <i>tzadi</i> with this structural shape.</i> Rather, the <i>yod</i> <b>looks upward like this</b> [image<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew, there is a printed letter <i>tzadi</i> with this structural shape.</i> of the] <b><i>tzadi</i> while</b> the <i>nun</i> <b>looks downward like this</b> [image of the]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew, there is a printed letter <i>tzadi</i> with this structural shape.</i> <b><i>tzadi</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: “Furthermore, in the future I will saw you,”</b> that is, separate you from your back-to-back attachment, <b>and make you</b> connected <b>face-to-face. “However, you will ascend to this</b> [state] <b>in another place,”</b> not immediately, at the beginning of the creation of the world, as then she must be back-to-back, which indicates that her illumination is hidden. Therefore, she must not be used for the creation of the world. The letter <i>tzadi</i> <b>left His presence and departed.</b>
Explanation: Having seen that the <i>tav</i> was rejected because of the harsh attribute of judgment she contains, and the <i>shin</i> because of the grasp of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> within her, [the <i>tzadi</i>] found the strength to suggest that she is certainly worthy for the world to be created with her, as she too has the qualities of a seal like them, and in addition there is no grasp of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> upon her. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“The righteous [<i>tzaddikim</i>] are sealed with me,”</b> which is the seal of the sign of the holy covenant, through circumcision and <i>peri’a</i> [uncovering of the glans],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is an essential aspect of the Torah's instructions for performing circumcision.</i> which rebuffs all the external forces. <b>“And You, who are called <i>tzaddik</i>, are inscribed with me,”</b> because also the Holy One, blessed be He, which is <i>Bina</i>, was established in the mystical meaning of <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i> [justice], like the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, [and <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i>] are the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> that were established <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, in the mystical meaning of “this trail of the father sits in that path of the mother,” and in the mystical meaning of the beloved <i>Ketarim</i> [crowns], which always embrace in a never ending fusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Referring also to the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>.</i> <b>“As it is stated: ‘For the Lord is righteous and He loves righteousness’” –</b> “righteous” alludes to <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Abba</i> [of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>]; “righteousness” alludes to <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Imma</i> [of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>], which is the aspect of <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>, called the “righteousness of the Lord.” And because the righteous [one] loves righteousness, the pairing [of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] never ceases. [<i>Tzadi</i>] therefore declared: “I am fitting for the world to be created with me, and through my attribute the world will be sustained in an assured path to the completion of the rectification.”
The <i>Zohar</i> continues: <b>“He said to her, ‘<i>tzadi</i>, you are <i>tzadi</i>, and you are righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>].’”</b> The letter <i>tzadi</i> is the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and when the <i>Yesod</i> is incorporated together with the <i>Nukba</i>, this [<i>Yesod</i>] is called <i>tzaddik</i>, since the nine <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are from <i>yod</i> to <i>tzadi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As is explained, the <i>tzadi</i> represents the ninth <i>sefira</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, which is <i>Yesod</i>. The next letter, <i>kof</i>, is the <i>Nukba</i>, so when this ninth <i>sefira</i> connects with the <i>Nukba</i>, it spells out <i>tzaddik</i>.</i> and the <i>kof</i> is the beginning of the <i>Nukba</i>, as stated. And when the <i>Nukba</i> is attached to <i>Yesod</i>, the <i>kof</i> is attached to <i>tzadi</i>, and then <i>Yesod</i> is called <i>tzaddik</i>. This is why the Holy One, blessed be He, praised her [by saying] <b>“you are <i>tzadi</i>,”</b> in your place in <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; and <b>“you are <i>tzadi</i>”</b> in My place, for you are inscribed in Me in a never-ending pairing,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the male and female pairing of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> mentioned above.</i> as you said. Also, <b>“you are righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>],”</b> since the <i>Nukba</i> is included in you as well, in the mystical meaning of the <i>kof</i> that follows the <i>tzadi</i>. But despite all of this, you are unfit for the world to be created with you, as [the <i>Zohar</i>] goes on to explain.
That which [Rav Hamnuna] says: <b>“You must be concealed. You do not need to be so exposed</b> etc. <b>What is the reason? She was a <i>nun</i>.”</b> The meaning of this is that <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> includes the <i>Nukba</i> with it[self], which is the <i>kof</i> in the mystical meaning of [the word] <i>tzaddik</i>, as the Holy One, blessed be He, alluded to her [in His comment]: <b>“You are righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>].”</b> When the <i>Nukba</i> is included in [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] in the form of the <i>tzadi</i>, [the <i>Nukba</i>] is represented in [the letter shape] as the letter <i>nun</i> [forming the bottom of the <i>tzadi</i>]. This is because the <i>nun</i> is the aspect of <i>Gevura</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. The [letters of] <i>yod</i>, <i>kaf</i>, <i>lamed</i> are the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and [the letters] <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i> are <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i>. With regard to this <i>nun</i> it is stated: “I am discernment [<i>bina</i>]; might [<i>gevura</i>] is mine” (Proverbs 8:14). For in [the phase of] maturity, when <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> become <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>, as is known, this <i>Gevura</i> becomes <i>Bina</i>. In [the phase of] immaturity, when the father removes the mother outside,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is a reference to the second constriction, in which the ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> causes <i>Bina</i> to descend to the level below, an "evicting" of <i>Bina</i>, which is described as female, from the connection with <i>Ḥokhma</i>, described here as male.</i> the <i>Bina</i> becomes <i>Gevura</i>, <i>nun</i>, and thus [the <i>nun</i>] alludes to <i>nefila</i> [falling], since <i>Bina</i> falls from the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to the [the level of] six extremities through the strength of the father, who removed <i>Bina</i> and <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> to outside of the head.
[Rav Hamnuna] thus says: <b>“You do not need to be so exposed, so as not give the world a pretext. What is the reason? She was a <i>nun</i>,</b> and the <b><i>yod</i> of the name, which is the holy covenant, came and rode atop her, and united with her.”</b> In other words, the <i>Nukba</i> that is incorporated in [the letter] <i>tzadi</i> is [represented by] the form of the letter <i>nun</i> within [<i>tzadi</i>], which is <i>Gevura</i> of the aspect of the fallen <i>Bina</i>, and the <i>yod</i> within [the <i>tzadi</i>] is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> itself, which is the name of the holy covenant. They are positioned in the form [of the letter] as back-to-back, with their backs attached to one another and their faces exposed outwards, as the face of the <i>yod</i> looks outwards rather than to the side of the <i>nun</i>, and the face of the <i>nun</i> likewise looks outward and not to the side of the <i>yod</i>. This implies that there is a grip [for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] on their backs, and therefore their backs must be concealed, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Their backs were inward” (I Kings 7:25), so that the external forces will not latch on to them. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“You do not need to be so exposed, so as not give the world a pretext.”</b> Since there is a deficiency in your back, you must be in concealment, so as not to give the external forces a pretext to grab hold there, between the attachments. Therefore, you are unfit for the world to be created with you, since in you too, there is a place of purchase for the <i>kelippot</i>. Through this force of the <i>tzadi</i>, as the <i>Yesod</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> in her are back-to-back, Adam the first man came out back-to-back as well, in the mystical meaning of two faces, as he said: <b>“The secret of the matter is that when the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam the first</b> [man]<b>, He created him with two faces.”</b>
[Rav Hamnuna] thus says: <b>“Furthermore, in the future I will saw you, and make you face-to-face. However, you will ascend to this</b> [state] <b>in another place.”</b> This means to say, you might suggest that it is possible for Me to create the world through you in the aspect of face-to-face, just as I will later saw you and make you face-to-face. However, that too is not a valid claim, since even when I will establish you face-to-face with the <i>Nukba</i>, it will not be in your place below, but only through an ascent to My place, the place of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. And since [the state of] face-to-face will not be established in your place, there will be a purchase for the <i>kelippot</i> on your level even then, and therefore you are unfit for the world to be created with you. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Furthermore, in the future I will saw you, and make you face-to-face,”</b> i.e., “it is true that in the future I will saw you and make you face-to-face. Yet this will not happen in your place”: <b>“However, you will ascend to this</b> [state] <b>in another place,”</b> in the place of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, since then you will ascend and enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, whereas in your own place this will not be established until the completion of the rectification. How, then, can I create the world with you, when there is a purchase for the external forces within you, as well.

Paragraph 27

<b>27. “<i>Peh</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>peh</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: “Master of the worlds! It is good for You to create the world with me, for the redemption that in the future You will perform in the world is inscribed with me, as it is</b> [the word] <b><i>pedut</i></b> [ransom; redemption]<b>.</b> In other words, the redemption is our ransom [<i>pedut</i>] from our oppressors, and since it starts with the letter <i>peh</i>, I am worthy of having the world created through me. <b>He said to her: “You are beautiful; however, concealed <i>pesha</i></b> [crime] <b>is imprinted with you, like a snake that strikes and then withdraws its head into its body.” Similarly, one who sins bends his head,</b> i.e., he conceals himself so as to not be seen, <b>and stretches out his hands</b> to sin<b>,</b> which is like the shape of the <i>peh</i>, whose head is bent inwards. He spoke <b>similarly</b> to the letter <b><i>ayin</i>,</b> with which the word <b><i>avon</i></b> [iniquity] is inscribed. <b>Even though she said: “I contain <i>anava</i></b> [humility],” <b>the Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: “I will not create the world with you,”</b> [and] <b>she departed from before Him.</b>
Explanation: <i>Purkana</i> means redemption, and the [letter] <i>peh</i> said that the future redemption for the world is inscribed with her, and therefore she is worthy for the world to be created with her. The exile and redemption that occur in the world depend on the <i>Nukba</i>, since when the <i>Nukba</i> lacks the construction of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called brains, [the people of] Israel were exiled from their land, the Land of Israel. This is because the Land of Israel below is situated such that it corresponds to the Land of Israel above, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and [when] there is separation above between <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called Israel, and <i>Nukba</i>, which is [the] land [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], so too Israel below are separated from their land. But when the children of Israel improve their ways, they cause Israel above to give to its <i>Nukba</i>, [which is] his land, and build [<i>Nukba</i>] with the brains and unite with her face-to-face. Then the children of Israel below also merit redemption and they too return to their land.
These brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the <i>Nukba</i>, which <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> builds, come to [the <i>Nukba</i>] enclothed within <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. The brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> are enclothed in <i>Netzaḥ</i> and the brains of <i>Bina</i> are enclothed in <i>Hod</i>, while the letters <i>ayin</i> and <i>peh</i> are <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as stated. This is the claim of the <i>peh</i>, which is <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, that <b>“the redemption that in the future You will perform in the world is inscribed with me,”</b> as the brains of <i>Nukba</i> that bring redemption to the world are enclothed in me. Therefore, if you create the world with my attribute, they will undoubtedly be fit to achieve complete rectification.
Why did the <i>peh</i> consider herself better suited for the creation of the world than the <i>ayin</i>? After all, the brains of <i>Nukba</i> are enclothed in the both of them, in <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>, which are <i>ayin</i> and <i>peh</i>, but mainly in <i>Netzaḥ</i>, which is <i>ayin</i>. If so, why did the <i>peh</i> regard herself as more worthy than the <i>ayin</i>? This is the meaning of his statement: <b>“As it is redemption</b> (<i>pedut</i>)<b>,”</b> since the <i>pedut</i> exists only in the attribute of <i>Hod</i>, which is <i>peh</i>. The meaning of <i>pedut</i> is that the mother first redeems the <i>Nukba</i> from the judgments [<i>dinim</i>], and then the <i>Nukba</i> is worthy of redemption. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “Like an eagle that would rouse its nest, over its fledglings it would hover etc.” (Deuteronomy 32:11). Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, expounded: This eagle has mercy for its offspring etc. and it says: “It is better for the arrow to pierce me rather than pierce my offspring” (see Rashi on Deuteronomy 32:11).
The meaning is as follows: It was explained above that the <i>Ma</i> is unfit for brains except through the rectification of <b>“for the mother lends her garments to the daughter.”</b> Since the <i>Nukba</i>, in its origin, is constricted from receiving light, meaning, from the time of the first constriction, [the <i>Nukba</i>] could not receive any brains. However, because the mother<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the emergence of <i>Bina</i> from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> during the phase of immaturity.</i> emerged outside the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and became six extremities without a head, the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>] were drawn to the <i>Nukba</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i>, too, was constructed in the name <i>Elohim</i> (see section 17, above, second paragraph of the commentary).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the sections of <i>Zohar</i> preceding this section of "the Letters of Rav Hamnuna Sabba" for the extensive detailing of this process. The main point here is that the letters <i>alef-lamed-heh</i> represent the higher lights that are the brains attained by the <i>Nukba</i> through this process.</i> The mother is called “an eagle,” who is merciful toward her offspring, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. She therefore emerged outside and her height was halved into [a height of] six extremities without a head. [This halving is] the aspect of an arrow,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew for "arrow" is <i>ḥetz</i>, which also means "half."</i> the mystical meaning of her statement: “It is better for the arrow to pierce me.” She thereby redeemed the offspring from the judgments<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">"Judgments" here essentially refers to restrictions within <i>Nukba</i> that prevent it from receiving the higher lights called brains.</i> and they became fit for receiving brains in her garments of <i>eleh</i>, as stated. This is the mystical meaning of <i>pedut</i> and <i>pidyon</i> – the mother redeems the <i>Nukba</i> from its judgments, as otherwise [the <i>Nukba</i>] would not be fit for the brains. This redemption [of the <i>Nukba</i>] applies primarily to the left line of the <i>Nukba</i>, as the judgments are there, as well as to <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is the letter <i>peh</i>. Consequently, the <i>peh</i> thought that she was more suitable than the <i>ayin</i>, since this redemption [<i>pedut</i>] from the mother is enclothed only in her and not in the <i>ayin</i>, because the judgments are on the left line, not on the right line.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hod</i> is the left side of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, so since that is the side of the <i>Nukba</i> requiring redemption from the restrictive judgments, the <i>peh</i> considered itself more likely to be appropriate for creating the world.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“You are beautiful; however, <i>pesha</i></b> [crime] <b>is written in you in concealment.”</b> All of the redemptions that occur during the six thousand years are of the aspect of the six extremities of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. The first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of these brains are the mystical meaning of the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother) that were manifest in <i>Nekudim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As is explained below, this refers to the <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> of <i>Nekudim</i> that were hidden away.</i> and they were hidden away and will be revealed only at the completion of the rectification, that is, after the rectification of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. When that sin was committed by Adam the first [man], he thereby drew the supernal brains to the level of the <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation, below the diaphragm, where there are no garments of the mother but [only] the constricted <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the diaphragm below <i>Atzilut</i>, where the lower five [which is the lower <i>heh</i>] of the first constriction now stand, enclosing the lights of <i>Atzilut</i> so that they do not spread from there downward. Through this [sin of Adam], by drawing the <i>shefa</i> below the diaphragm of <i>Atzilut</i>, crime [<i>pesha</i>] was inscribed in <i>Nukba</i>, which is the mystical meaning of: “The snake came upon Eve and infected her with contamination” (<i>Shabbat</i> 146a). This contamination will be rectified only at the completion of the rectification, as it is stated: <b>“He will eliminate death forever and The Lord God will wipe tears from all faces”</b> (Isaiah 25:8) as the lack of the brains of the inner <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> [of <i>Nekudim</i>] that were concealed is called “tears.” They are the mystical meaning of the two tears that God lets drop to the Great Sea, corresponding to two eyes, the inner <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> that were hidden away and are gone. Eyes are the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, and tears express a deficiency in them, due to the contamination that was intermingled and became a tear through the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, which caused the destruction of the two Temples (see <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> I, 254). The verse is saying that these tears will be wiped away from the face of the <i>Nukba</i> only when death will be swallowed up forever, i.e., when the sin of the Tree of Knowledge will be fully rectified. [At that time], crime, which is death, will be rectified forever, and then the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> will illuminate, which are the inner <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> [of <i>Nekudim</i>], and it will thus be found that the Lord God has wiped tears etc.
[Rav Hamnuna] thus says: <b>“You are beautiful; however, <i>pesha</i></b> [crime] <b>is written in you in concealment.”</b> Although you have a redemption at the hands of the mother, through which you bring redemption to the world, which is the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, by means of which all redemptions arrive, nevertheless these redemptions lack completion, for [the people of Israel] were once again exiled from upon their land and the two Temples were again destroyed. This occurred because <b>“<i>pasha</i> is written in you in concealment”</b> – the redemption of the mother is not yet able to wipe out the crime of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge entirely, and therefore there is still purchase for the <i>kelippot</i> in you, since the brains are necessarily only of the aspect of six extremities of <i>ḥaya</i> and they lack the aspect of the head of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. Since there is purchase for the <i>kelippot</i> in you, you are unfit for the world to be created with you.
[Rav Hamnuna] then says: <b>“Like a snake that strikes and then withdraws its head into its body.”</b> Since this crime is hidden, the power of the snake, which strikes the people of the world and brings death into the world, still retains its full strength and cannot be removed. It is like a snake that bites someone and immediately pulls its head into its body, as then it is impossible to kill it, since the serpent can be killed only by hitting its head. This is what he did to Adam, to sin through the Tree of Knowledge, and to his sons, that he <b>“bends his head and stretches out his hands.”</b> In other words, even the brains that are drawn through the redemption of the mother are considered a bending of the head, and only the hands, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, are revealed with those brains. Thus, the hold of the serpent is still in the <i>peh</i>, and therefore she is unfit for the world to be created with her, for she will not fit for the completion of the rectification, as explained.
[Rav Hamnuna] says: <b>“Similarly <i>ayin</i>, <i>avon</i>, even though she said: I contain <i>anava</i></b> [humility] etc.” The <i>Imma Ila'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally "the supernal mother," this term refers to the female component of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>.</i> is called <i>anava</i>. It is known that when <i>Netzaḥ</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is <i>ayin</i>, is enclothed with the brains in the <i>Nukba</i>, [the <i>Nukba</i>] ascends and enclothes the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i>, and the mother adorns her with her ornaments, as stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This was explained in the sections preceding the section of the Letters of Rav Hamnuna Sabba.</i> This is why [the <i>ayin</i>] said “I contain <i>anava</i>,” as “the mother, which is <i>anava</i>, is enclothed in me.” However, because of that <i>pesha</i> [crime], discussed above, which [these two letters] contain, concealed in these [<i>sefirot</i> of] <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i>, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to <i>ayin</i>: “I will not create the world with you.” 
The reason why <i>pesha</i> [crime] is called <i>avon</i> [iniquity] here, rather than <i>pesha</i>, as explained in [the section about] the <i>peh</i>, is that the essence of the <i>pesha</i> is inscribed in <i>Hod</i>, which is <i>peh</i>. <i>Hod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is of the incorporation of <i>Malkhut</i> within [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], to which the <i>kelippot</i> attached [themselves] by the power of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, as stated. However, <i>Netzaḥ</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is the attribute of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> itself, of which in truth there is no purchase for the <i>kelippot</i>. Rather, in the mystical meaning of: “The cabbage is damaged along with the thorn” (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 92a), the <i>kelippot</i> also grasped hold of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, as is known. Therefore, this corruption is discerned in [<i>Netzaḥ</i>] with the name <i>avon</i>, to indicate that [<i>Netzaḥ</i>] is in fact upright, but was warped by its connection to the <i>Hod</i> (see <i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, part 13, section 206, s.v. <i>Aval</i>, and in the <i>Or Penimi</i>). 
The reason why [Rav Hamnuna] does not say in the case of the letter <i>ayin</i>, “the letter <i>ayin</i> entered,” as he says with regard to all the other letters, and instead he includes it together with the <i>peh</i>, is because <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> are two halves of the body, and therefore both of them actually came forward as one. Nevertheless, the <i>Zohar</i> explains the reason for each of them separately, one after the other.

Paragraph 28

<b>28. “<i>Samekh</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>samekh</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the worlds! It is good for You to create the world with me, for through me there is support [<i>semikha</i>] for the fallen, as it is stated: “The Lord supports all those who fall”</b> (Psalms 145:14)<b>. He said to her: For this reason you need to be in your place, and do not budge from it,</b> for <b>if you leave your place,</b> in the word <i>somekh</i> [supports], <b>what will become of those fallen, since they rely on your support? She immediately departed from before Him.</b>
Explanation: The letter <i>samekh<b></b></i> is <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is <i>Bina</i> of the body. As is known, the names of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, which became [the light of giving] in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, change into <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>. Now, the <i>Bina</i> is divided into two aspects, the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>]. The first three in [<i>Bina</i>] become [the <i>partzuf</i>] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which enclothe from the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and above. [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are still considered [of the aspect of the] head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, even though they are positioned at the body [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>], for [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are [light of giving], as it is stated: “Because He desires kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>]” (end of Micah [7:18]).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> only draw the light of giving. As a result, these facets of <i>Bina</i> are not impaired by being outside the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, a context in which they lose access to the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> Since [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] do not receive light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> even when they are in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the emergence from the head does not diminish [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] at all, and they are still considered [of the aspect of the] head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are also called <i>samekh</i> because those first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> were established as [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>], and the six <i>sefirot</i> <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Da'at</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, spread in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] until the chest. However, the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are from the incorporation of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> in <i>Bina</i> and are not <i>Bina</i> itself, are divided from the <i>Bina</i> and become the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which enclothe the four <i>sefirot</i> <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>]. This [enclothing] is from the chest of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] and below. [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] require the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, in order to give to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. Since [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, like <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>,] emerged from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to the aspect of the body, and they lack [access to the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] are therefore impaired by this emergence, and become six extremities without a head. [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] are also called a closed <i>mem</i>, because they take up only four <i>sefirot</i> <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which they enclothe there, as stated (see <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, section 2, s.v. <i>Vehu</i>).
Now, the division of <i>Bina</i> into <i>samekh</i> and [closed] <i>mem</i> was performed in <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This division is a result of the second constriction.</i> in which [<i>Bina</i>] emerged to outside of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and spread into the <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] until the bottom third of <i>Tiferet</i> in [the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>]. [These aspects of <i>Bina</i>] give all the brains to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>.
However, not all phases are the same. When the lower [beings] improve their conduct and elevate feminine waters to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, and <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> [elevate feminine waters] to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, then <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> become one <i>partzuf</i> and ascend to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. [This completed <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Bina</i>] then bestows complete brains of the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>, in the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings. The <i>samekh</i> [numerical value of 60], which is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, becomes one with the <i>mem</i> [numerical value of 40], which is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and thus together they add up to the number 100. But when the lower [beings] corrupt their actions once again, the brains depart from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> and return to the state of six extremities and a point.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In this disjointed state, the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, the <i>Nukba</i>, is reduced to only a "point," lacking a full <i>partzuf</i> structure.</i> <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> also divide from one another, and <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> become <i>samekh</i> again, which is only the six <i>sefirot</i> <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Da'at</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, each of which is incorporated from ten, and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> become a closed <i>mem</i> once more, which is only <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, as stated.
When <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> are in this state of immaturity of six extremities and a point, there is a fear that the <i>kelippot</i> may attach [themselves]. [This attachment would cause <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] to fall from <i>Atzilut</i> to <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a disintegrated form of existence in which the various structures of being are unable to perpetuate the flow of supernal light into the lower levels.</i> For this reason <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> bestow upon [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] from the [brains of the] aspect of their <i>samekh</i>, as these lights, although they are only the light of giving (<i>ḥassadim</i>), are still considered pure air and an aspect of a head.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">These lights of the head, although they are only the lights of giving flowing from <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, still protect <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> from the <i>kelippot</i>.</i> Therefore the <i>kelippa</i> has no purchase on <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> even during the period of immaturity, since these lights of <i>samekh</i> protect them. Therefore, these lights are called <i>samekh</i>, as they support [<i>somekhim</i>] the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> from falling from <i>Atzilut</i> while they are in [the state of] immaturity, in the aspect of six extremities without a head, as explained.
This is the meaning of [Rav Hamnuna's] statement: <b>“<i>Samekh</i> entered</b> etc. <b>for through me there is support for the fallen, as it is stated: ‘The Lord supports all those who fall.’”</b> This is as we said, that [<i>samekh</i>] considered herself better qualified than all the previous letters, since the lights of <i>samekh</i> can illuminate to the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> even during their immaturity, as they are only the light of giving, and there is no purchase at all for the <i>kelippot</i> in these lights of giving, because the external forces flee from the lights of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>. Consequently, [<i>samekh</i>] considered her attribute the best suited for the world to be created with her, for she can protect the inhabitants of the world even when their actions are corrupted, as stated, and then there would be no grasp for the <i>kelippot</i> either.
[Rav Hamnuna] continues: <b>“He said to her: For this reason, you need to be in your place, and do not move from it.”</b> In other words, since your place is to support the fallen, to protect them at the time of the corruption of the inhabitants of the world, for this reason you must be solely in this place without budging from it. If the world were created with you, and your attribute would have constant sufficient dominion, the result would be that those fallen ones, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, would remain forever in immaturity, and the lower [beings] would not awaken to elevate the feminine waters, and all the expanded brains that are necessary for bringing the completion of rectification would not be revealed. Rather, you must remain only in your place, the place of rectification, for the times that the lower [beings] are unfit. However, when they will merit it, they will be able to draw the expanded brains from the entire level, in the mystical meaning of one hundred blessings.
[Rav Hamnuna] says: <b>“If you leave your place, what will become of those fallen,”</b> as they will always remain fallen, requiring your constant support. This is the meaning of: <b>“Since they rely on your support,”</b> i.e., they [would] rely on you alone, and the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> [would] have no wholeness to stand on their own. Therefore, you are unfit for the world to be created with your attribute.

Paragraph 29

<b>29. “<i>Nun</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>nun</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, as with me it is stated: “Awesome</b> [<i>nora</i>] <b>in praise”</b> (Exodus 15:11)<b>.</b> Likewise, it is written with regard to <b>the praise of the righteous: “Praise</b> [<i>na’ava</i>] <b>is lovely”</b> (Psalms 147:1). <b>He said her: <i>Nun</i>, return to your place, for because of you</b> the letter <b><i>samekh</i> returned to her place, and rely on her</b> support<b>.</b> That is, the <i>nun</i> is inscribed in the word <i>nefila</i> [falling], and the <i>samekh</i>, which is the mystical meaning of “the Lord supports all those who fall” (Psalms 145:14), returned to her place on their account, to support them. <b>She immediately returned to her place and departed from before Him.</b>
Explanation: Having seen that the letter <i>samekh</i> was rejected because she is used only in immaturity, i.e., solely for support, as stated, the <i>nun</i> thought to herself that she is certainly worthy of the creation of the world, since she possesses all the qualities of the <i>samekh</i>, and in addition she also serves [in the phase of] the brains of maturity. For this reason, [<i>nun</i>] does not have the deficiency on account of which the <i>samekh</i> was rejected. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“As with me it is stated: ‘Awesome</b> [<i>nora</i>] <b>in praise.’”</b> The <i>Gevura</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called <i>nun</i>, because [this <i>Gevura</i>] was entirely tempered with the attribute of mercy of the <i>Bina</i>, which is called “fifty [<i>nun</i>] gates of <i>Bina</i>.” On account of this <i>Gevura</i>, the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called “awesome in praise,” since <i>Imma Ila'ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to one aspect of the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> (<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>).</i> is called “praise,” and because this <i>Gevura</i> [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is drawn from <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is called “awesome in praise.” This <i>nun</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> serves in <i>Yesod</i> of &gt;&gt;<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>&gt;&gt; in the phase of maturity, during the pairing [between <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] and its <i>Nukba</i>, at which point the <i>Nukba</i> is called “praise” as well, like <i>Imma Ila'ah</i>, on account [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. Thus, the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is united as one in both the upper praise and the lower praise.
[Rav Hamnuna] thus says: <b>“<i>Nun</i> entered</b> etc. <b>as with me it is stated: ‘Awesome</b> [<i>nora</i>] <b>in praise.’”</b> Because of this [fact] that I am in the aspect of <i>Gevura</i> and the left line of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, I draw [the light of giving] that emerge from the letter <i>samekh</i>, which is the upper praise. The result is that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called “awesome in praise” on my account, as stated. Therefore, I have all the qualities of the <i>samekh</i>, since the [the light of giving] that is drawn by her are the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>] and they repel the external forces from [having] any purchase, exactly like the quality of the <i>samekh</i>. In addition, I possess another quality: <b>“The praise of the righteous: ‘Praise</b> [<i>na’ava</i>] <b>is lovely, ’”</b> for I serve in the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in [the phase of] maturity. This is as stated with regard to the letter <b><i></i></b><i>tzadi<b></b></i>, where it is said that [<i>tzadi</i>] was a letter <i>nun</i> with the letter <i>yod</i> atop her; see there thoroughly. This <i>nun</i> is considered the praise of the righteous, since as explained there, even during the time of maturity, when the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> ascend to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, this <i>nun</i> still serves in the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in the form of back-to-back.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">"Back-to-back" refers to a lower state and level of brains in the vessel.</i> However, [the <i>nun</i>] draws pure air from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which are the mystical meaning of the aforementioned <i>samekh</i>. Then the <i>nun</i> is called “praise of the righteous,” since the <i>yod</i>, which represents “the righteous is the foundation [<i>Yesod</i>] of the world” (Proverbs 10:25), rides atop her. [The <i>nun</i>] is then called “praise is lovely,” as she draws the brains of maturity to <i>Malkhut</i>. Thus, all the beauty of <i>Malkhut</i> is received from the <i>nun</i> in <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. This is why the <i>nun</i> claimed that she is worthy for the world to be created with her, since through her illumination the brains of maturity were also added, which provide <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> independent existence and durability, and not only through the aspect of support, like the <i>samekh</i>.
<b>“He said her: <i>Nun</i>, return to your place, for because of you, <i>samekh</i> returned to her place.”</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: It is not as you consider your attribute [to be fitting for] the complete rectification, that there would be no more purchase for the <i>kelippot</i>. Rather, your attribute also requires support from the <i>samekh</i>, since you are still in a state of back-to-back, and the lights of the <i>samekh</i> are exposed outwards to guard you from the external forces. Thus, the letter <i>samekh</i> returned to her place on your account as well, to support you, and this is not yet the complete rectification, and therefore the world will not be created with you. This is the meaning of <b>“and rely on her,”</b> i.e., your attribute is also only support [and not complete independence].

Paragraph 30

<b>30. “<i>Mem</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>mem</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, as with me You are called <i>Melekh</b></i> [King; <i>mem-lamed-kaf</i>]<b>. He said to her: That is certainly the case, but I will not create the world with you, because the world requires a king. Return to your place, you and the <i>lamed</i> and the <i>kaf</i>, as it is unbecoming for the world to stand without a king.</b>
Explanation: The <i>mem</i> is <i>Ḥesed</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which receives from its corresponding aspect, from <i>Ḥesed</i> of <i>Bina</i>, which is the mystical meaning of: “The Lord commands His kindness [<i>ḥasdo</i>] by day” (Psalms 42:9), i.e., a day that goes with all the days. At the time of the attainment of brains in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, the <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] become <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>. Thus, the <i>Ḥesed</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ascends and becomes <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and then the light of the face of the living King is revealed from the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.
This was the claim of the <i>mem</i> for why the world should be created with her, because <b>“with me You are called <i>Melekh</i>.”</b> When the light of the King’s face is revealed in the world, there will certainly be no more grasp for the external forces, and the completion of the rectification in the world will be assured.
<b>“I will not create the world with you, because the world requires a king.”</b> In other words, it is impossible to reveal this light in the world because the world needs this great light to be enclothed only in the three letters <i>mem-lamed-kaf</i> [<i>melekh</i>]. He thus says: <b>“Return to your place, you and the <i>lamed</i> and the <i>kaf</i>, as it is unbecoming for the world to stand without a king.”</b> That is, return to your place and join with the letters <i>lamed</i> and <i>kaf</i>, and then it will be possible for this great light to be revealed in the world. This is because <b>“it is unbecoming for the world to stand without a king,”</b> i.e., the world cannot stand and exist without enclothing in the order of the three letters <i>mem-lamed-kaf</i> [<i>melekh</i>].
The meaning of this is that the <i>mem</i> of <i>melekh</i> [king] is the great <i>Ḥesed</i>, in the mystical meaning of: “The Lord commands His kindness [<i>ḥasdo</i>] by day,” which is a day that goes with all the days, the mystical meaning of an open <i>mem</i>, with a wide aperture.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is in contrast to a <i>mem setuma</i>, a closed <i>mem</i>. The open <i>mem</i> has an opening at the bottom, meant to reflect a "doorway" through which <i>shefa</i> can flow.</i> The <i>lamed</i> of <i>melekh</i> is the mystical meaning of a tower that flies in the air [see <i>Ḥagiga</i> 15b], which is <i>Bina</i> that becomes <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and expands to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. The final <i>kaf</i> of <i>melekh</i> is the mystical meaning of the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, since there is no <i>melekh</i> without <i>Malkhut</i>. Furthermore, the full maturity of those lofty brains is revealed only through the <i>Malkhut</i> and with her permission.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the role of <i>Malkhut</i> as the ultimate receiver for the brains, the lights of all the <i>sefirot</i>/<i>partzufim</i> that precede it.</i>
In this state, the <i>Malkhut</i> is regarded as illuminating toward the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in three places: a) [<i>Malkhut</i>] becomes a throne [for <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], in the mystical meaning of “the King sitting on a throne [<i>kise</i>], high and exalted” (see Isaiah 6:1). This attribute is the mystical meaning of: “He engulfed His secret place in darkness” (Psalms 18:12), and <i>kise</i> is an expression of <i>kisui</i> [covering] and concealment. This is why [the <i>Malkhut</i>] is called “a bent <i>kaf</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous paragraph, <i>Malkhut</i> corresponds to the letter <i>kaf</i>, which has two forms, a bent form and a long form.</i> b) [<i>Malkhut</i>] becomes the garment [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. This is because these great brains appear [and illuminate] only upon Israel, and therefore the <i>Malkhut</i> becomes a garment of darkness. At the time when the kingship [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is revealed, this clothing of darkness is removed and is cast upon the nations that worship stars and constellations, and the light of the face of [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] spreads and is revealed upon Israel. With regard to that time, our Rabbis said: “The Holy One, Blessed be He, will arrange a dance of the righteous, and each and every one of them will point to God with his finger, and say: Behold, this is our God, etc.” (see <i>Ta’anit</i> 31a). This removing of the clothing of darkness is the mystical meaning of the plain and long final <i>kaf</i>. c) The <i>Malkhut</i> becomes a crown upon His head, in the mystical meaning of: “Emerge, daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart” (Song of Songs 3:11). This is the mystical meaning of the <i>kaf</i> as <i>Keter</i> [crown]. The three letters <i>mem-lamed-kaf</i> [<i>melekh</i>] have thus been explained; understand this well.

Paragraph 31

<b>31. “At that time etc.”</b><br><b>At that time, the letter <i>kaf</i> descended from before Him, from upon His throne of glory. She trembled and said to Him: “Master of the world, it is good for You to create the world with me, for I am your <i>kavod</i></b> [glory]<b>.” When the letter <i>kaf</i> descended from upon His throne of glory, two hundred thousand worlds shook and the throne shook, and all the worlds shook on the verge of falling. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: <i>Kaf</i>, <i>kaf</i>, what are you doing here? I will not create the world with you; return to your place as there is <i>kelaya</i></b> [destruction] <b>in you, and with you “devastating destruction”</b> (Daniel 9:27) <b>was heard. Return to your throne and stay there. At that time, she departed from His presence and returned to her place.</b>
Explanation: <b>“At that time,”</b> while the <i>mem</i> was negotiating with the Holy One, blessed be He, for the world to be created with her, with aspect of the revelation of the light of the face of the King in the world, as stated above, this caused the descent of the <i>kaf</i> from the throne of glory, which is the world of <i>Beria</i>. <b>“She trembled and said</b> etc. <b>for I am your <i>kavod</i></b> [glory]<b>.”</b> Then <b>“two hundred thousand worlds shook,”</b> which are drawn from <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> of <i>Beria</i>, which [includes] <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, of <i>Beria</i>, <b>“and the throne shook, and all the worlds”</b> from there and below, <b>“shook on the verge of falling.”</b>
The meaning of this is that these requests of the letters before the Holy One, blessed be He – that the world should be created with them – are like the ascent of feminine waters to receive masculine waters<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See feminine waters for an explanation of this term.</i> from the Holy One, blessed be He, at a height corresponding to the measure of the letter. [The purpose of these requests is so] that the guidance that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> give to the world, as the sources of <i>shefa</i> [for the world], should be at the height of masculine waters that is imparted upon that letter. Similarly, the reply of the Holy One, blessed be He, to each of the twenty-two letters of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> is the aspect of the descent of masculine waters and the emergence of a height of light for its time, according to the measure of the feminine waters that each letter raised. When the height of [each particular column of] light began to reveal its guidance in the world, the reply of the Holy One, blessed be He, to that letter was heard. [The particular letter's] inability to guide the world, on account of the purchase of the <i>kelippa</i> on [the particular letter's] attribute was revealed, in the mystical meaning of: “God made one thing corresponding to the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the letters discussed in the <i>Zohar</i>, in which there is a <i>kelippa</i> version of the attribute that each letter possesses, like a dark version of the force the letter symbolizes.</i> At that [rejection], each letter departed and went to her place. This is the mystical meaning of the [concept of the] playing of the Holy One, blessed be He, with each of the twenty-two letters, by giving each of them room to display their guidance in accordance with His will, until they clarify of their own accord, from their own desire, which of them is worthy to be used to guide the world. This is the meaning of the statement above: <b>“And two thousand years before the creation of the world the Holy One, blessed be He, was observing and playing with</b> the letters<b>.”</b>
With this, one can understand that when the <i>mem</i> began to reveal her great light in the world, this caused the <i>kaf</i> to descend from the throne of glory. There are two aspects to the mystical meaning of the throne [<i>kise</i>]: a) It conceals the King, in the mystical meaning of: “He engulfed His secret place in darkness” (Psalms 18:12), and this is why it is called <i>kise</i>, an aspect of <i>kisui</i> [covering]. b) It reveals the glory of <i>Malkhut</i> in the levels, in the mystical meaning of: “And upon the throne was a likeness, like the appearance of a man” (Ezekiel 1:26). This is [achieved] by combining the three letters <i>mem-lamed-kaf</i> [<i>melekh</i>], as then that <i>Malkhut</i> that became the throne of the <i>Melekh</i> [King] and covered Him, in the mystical meaning of: “He engulfed His secret place in darkness,” ascends and becomes a straight <i>kaf</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">When the letter <i>kaf</i> appears at the end of a word, instead of the bent form, it is an elongated straight shape that extends downward into the space below.</i> This is the mystical meaning of a garment for the "king himself, " as the "king himself, " <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, is revealed through [this <i>Malkhut</i>], as stated. [The <i>Malkhut</i>] also became a crown upon the King’s head, as stated.
However, when the <i>mem</i> began to reveal the light of the face of the King in the levels [of existence] without the covering [provided by] the straight <i>kaf</i>, the <i>kaf</i> descended from the throne as well, i.e., she stopped her activity of covering the king. [Like the <i>mem,</i> ] she also said: <b>“It is good for You to create the world with me, for I am your <i>kavod</i> [glory].”</b> In other words, the dynamic of revealing the king’s glory should rule her, without any covering, following along with the desire of the <i>mem</i>. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] says <b>“at that time,”</b> rather than “the <i>kaf</i> ascended and said before Him...” as it does for all the other letters. It is because [the <i>kaf</i>] did not awake of her own accord, but rather through the controlling force of the <i>mem</i>, for the control of the <i>mem</i> at that time also brought the <i>kaf</i> down from the throne of glory in the world of <i>Beria</i>, as explained.
[Rav Hamnuna] then says: <b>“She trembled and said</b> […] <b>it is good</b> etc.<b>”</b> When [the <i>kaf</i>] descended from the throne, she and <b>“two hundred thousand worlds,”</b> which are the levels that are drawn from <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> in <i>Beria</i>, shook, and likewise <b>“all the worlds shook on the verge of falling.”</b> The meaning is that the whole link between upper and lower [levels], from the top of the [entire structure of] levels to the bottom, is through the <i>Malkhut</i> of the upper [level] becoming a <i>Keter</i> for the [level] below. The mystical meaning of the <i>kaf</i> is the mystical meaning of the enclothing of <i>Malkhut</i> of the upper [level] in the [level] below. There are three aspects to the throne: a) [The aspect of] "six steps of the throne, " which [refers to a structure of] six extremities of the lower level [of the throne], called <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>; b) [The aspect of] "four legs of the throne, " which are the brains of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>, of the lower level; c) [The aspect of] the <i>Malkhut</i> of the higher [level] that descends from the higher [level] to the lower one and is enclothed within [the lower level], since through this <i>Malkhut</i> all the lights from the higher [level] come and illuminate the lower one.
Therefore, at the time of the descent of the <i>kaf</i> from the throne of glory, the connection of <i>Atzilut</i> with the throne of glory, which is the world of <i>Beria</i>, was severed. This is because the <i>kaf</i> is the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> that is enclothed in <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>, of <i>Beria</i>, and [the <i>kaf</i>] transmits all the lights to the world of <i>Beria</i>, called the "throne of glory." Since the <i>kaf</i> descended from there [during this discussion with the <i>mem</i>], the connection with <i>Atzilut</i> was lost and the <i>kaf</i> was shaken, since her power to transmit to <i>Beria</i> was paused. <b>“Two hundred thousand worlds,”</b> which are <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> that include <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>, of <i>Beria</i>, shook. Similarly, all the levels <b>“shook on the verge of falling,”</b> for they lost all of their vitality and <i>shefa</i> from the world of <i>Atzilut</i>.
In a similar manner, one can explain the relationship of the Holy One, blessed be He, which is <i>Bina</i>, with the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. The <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Bina</i> which is enclothed in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, is the <i>kaf</i>. Thus, this <i>kaf</i> is the throne of the Holy One, blessed be He, which resides over <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as the Holy One, blessed be He, is <i>Bina</i>, which is the [level] above <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> becomes a throne for <i>Bina</i>. Upon the descent of [the <i>kaf</i>], the connection of <i>Bina</i> with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is severed, because the <i>kaf</i> is the mystical meaning of this <i>Malkhut</i> of the <i>Bina</i> becoming enclothed in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and transmitting all the lights to [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. Consequently, [the <i>kaf</i>] herself shook, i.e., her ability to transmit to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ceased. Additionally, <b>“two hundred thousand worlds shook,”</b> which are the brains of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, and also called <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>, which are the four legs of the throne, as stated, because all the <i>shefa</i> [flowing to them] ceased. Likewise, <b>“all the worlds shook on the verge of falling,”</b> which are the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, which include all the worlds below <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, for they lost all the <i>shefa</i> of <i>Bina</i>. Since they were emptied from the lights of <i>Atzilut</i>, they shook on the verge of falling into the <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation, and being destroyed.
[Rav Hamnuna] continues: <b>“The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her</b> etc. <b>‘devastating destruction’ was heard. Return to your chair.”</b> This is as stated above, that on account of the descent of the <i>kaf</i> from the throne of glory, the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> shook, and all the levels shook on the verge of falling and being destroyed. That is, <b>“devastating destruction was heard,”</b> which means complete destruction without any further revival. Therefore, you must return to the aspect of the throne, as stated.
He concludes: <b>“At that time, she departed from His presence,”</b> reemphasizing <b>“at that time,”</b> to indicate that her return to her place in the throne came together with the reply of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the <i>mem</i> that <b>“it is unbecoming for the world to stand without a king.”</b> In other words, the shakings that were exposed with the <i>kaf</i> during her descent from the throne of glory, when all the worlds shook on the verge of falling, and the reply of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the <i>mem</i> that <b>“it is unbecoming for the world to stand without a king,”</b> occurred simultaneously. Understand this.

Paragraph 32

<b>32. “<i>Yod</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>yod</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, as I am the beginning of the holy name, and</b> [thus] <b>it is fitting for You to create the world with me. He said to her: It is enough for you that you are engraved in Me and you are inscribed in Me, and all My desire is in you. Depart; it is unfitting for you to be uprooted from My name.</b>
Explanation: Since <i>yod</i> is the first letter of the name <i>Havaya</i>, which means [the <i>yod</i> is] the start of the revelation and the highest aspect of this holy light, she argued that the world should be created with her attribute and then the completion of the rectification would be assured.
To this, <b>“He said to her: It is enough for you that you are engraved in Me and you are inscribed in Me</b> etc.<b>”</b> As you know by now, the questions and answers of the letters represent the playing of the Holy One, blessed be He, with the letters. The question is the aspect of feminine waters while the answer is the masculine waters of the supernal light.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">"Masculine waters" represents the divine flow from above, usually as a response to the feminine waters from below.</i> One can thereby understand that the phrase <b>“it is enough for you”</b> is the mystical meaning of the establishment of a boundary, in the mystical meaning of His statement to her: <b>“It is enough for you, "</b> and do not expand further, as was said previously with regard to the holy name of <i>Shaddai</i>. Once the <i>yod</i> began to expand in this great and holy light, the Holy One, blessed be He, stopped her and did not let her expand until the letter <i>tav</i>, but only until the mystical meaning of the letter <i>shin</i> (as stated above, section 24, second paragraph), as He told her: “It is enough for you<b>;</b> expand no further.” This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Depart; it is unfitting for you to be uprooted from My name,”</b> for if you expand any further, you will no longer be able to be fixed in the name <i>Havaya</i>.
The meaning of this is as the Sages said: I am not read as I am written, as I am written as <i>Havaya</i> but read as <i>Adonai</i> (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 50a). This is because the name <i>Havaya</i> never changes, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “I, <i>Havaya</i>, do not change” (Malachi 3:6). But since, during the times of the world, there are corruptions and rectifications, [it can be seen that] there are changes. Therefore, before the completion of the rectification He is called <i>Adonai</i>, as a change is possible in this name, but [He is] not [called] by the name <i>Havaya</i>, in which there is no change, God forbid. However, after the completion of the rectification, [<i>Havaya</i>] will be read as it is written, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And the name of the city from that day shall be: <i>Havaya</i> is there.” (end of Ezekiel; 48:35). This is the meaning of His statement to her: <b>“Depart; it is unfitting for you to be uprooted from My name,”</b> for if some corruption were to occur in you, you would be uprooted from My name, since there are no corruptions or rectifications in My name of <i>Havaya</i>, as explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, since the <i>yod</i> is part of the unchanging name of <i>Havaya</i>, it cannot be used to create a world filled with corruption and growth, the essence of change and flux.</i> Consequently, you are unfit for the world to be created with you.
The comment: <b>“It is enough for you that you are engraved in Me and you are inscribed in Me, and all My desire is in you,”</b> indicates three levels in the <i>yod</i> of the name <i>Havaya</i>: “Engraved” in <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; “inscribed” in <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>; and <b>“all My desire is in you”</b> in <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which is called the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>.

Paragraph 33

<b>33. “<i>Tet</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>tet</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, as with me You are called good</b> [<i>tov</i>] <b>and upright. He said to her: I will not create the world with you, for your good is sealed within you, and concealed within you. This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You”</b> (Psalms 31:20)<b>. Since</b> the good <b>is concealed within you, it has no share in this world that I wish to create, but only in the next world. Furthermore, because your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the Sanctuary will sink. This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “Her gates sank into the ground”</b> (Lamentations 2:9)<b>. In addition, <i>ḥet</i> is across from you, and when you join together you will be <i>ḥet</i>-<i>tet</i>,</b> which means sin<b>. This is why those letters were not inscribed in the holy tribes. She immediately departed from His presence.</b>
Explanation: <i>Tet</i> is the inner aspect of the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [As discussed previously, ] <i>tzadi</i> is the ninth of the letters of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See section 26 above for the complete discussion of the role of the <i>tzadi</i>. The main point here is that all vessels and structures of the different levels have an inner and outer aspect. While the <i>tzadi</i> represents the outer aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, the <i>tet</i> represents the inner aspect.</i> and [representing <i>Yesod</i>, that] fuses with the <i>Nukba</i> in the mystical meaning of <i>tzaddik</i> [righteous]. By contrast, <i>tet</i> is the ninth letter of <i>Bina</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and [the <i>tet</i>] is the inner aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called <i>tov</i> [good], in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Say of the righteous that it is good” (Isaiah 3:10). And as the soul of <i>Yesod</i>, in which there is no grasp for the <i>kelippot</i>, the <i>tet</i> claimed that the world should be created with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tet</i> represents the inner aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, so is referred to here as the soul of <i>Yesod</i>. This means the <i>tet</i> is the inner lifeforce of this <i>Yesod</i>. As a result of its internal placement, it is out of reach of the external forces of the <i>kelippot</i>.</i>
[Rav Hamnuna] then said: <b>“For your good is sealed within you, and concealed within you</b> etc.” This is the mystical meaning of the Sages’ statement (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 12a): By means of the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam could watch and look from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One, blessed be He, looked at the generation of the flood and the generation of the dispersion, and saw that their ways were corrupt, He arose and concealed it etc. for the righteous people in the future, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good” (Genesis 1:4), and “good” is referring to none other than the righteous, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous that it is good.” The meaning [of this passage] is as follows: When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that the wicked would corrupt their ways and would grant a purchase for the <i>kelippot</i> upon this light, He concealed it in the supernal <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother). From this <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> this light is drawn in its concealment into the inner aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is the <i>tet</i>. In the mystical meaning of that rectification, the Holy One, blessed be He, replied to the <i>tet</i>: <b>“For your good is sealed within you, and concealed within you</b> etc. <b>Since</b> the good <b>is concealed within you, it has no share in this world that I wish to create, but only in the World to Come.”</b> In other words, since I have to hide you from the wicked, and you are fit only for the righteous who are worthy of receiving from the World to Come, you have no part in the rectification of this world, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, since there is purchase for the external forces in you.
[Rav Hamnuna] continues: <b>“Furthermore, because your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the Sanctuary will sink.”</b> Since this light shines only in the inner aspect of <i>Yesod</i> [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] in concealment, the <i>Nukba</i> will therefore be unable to receive from this light at her gates, but only through its concealment in the inner aspect [of the <i>Nukba</i>]. As a result, the gates of <i>Nukba</i> sink into the inner aspect of her <i>Yesod</i>, and the [gates] are thereby preserved from the touch of the external forces. [Through this, the <i>Nukba</i>] will be assured that the external forces will not control her gates. At the time of the destruction [of the Temple], the enemies did not control the gates of the Sanctuary, but rather [the gates] sank into the earth, as the Sages expounded (<i>Sota</i> 9a; see Rashi there). Since you require such protection, you are unworthy for the world to be created with you.
[Rav Hamnuna] continues: <b>“In addition, <i>ḥet</i> is across from you, and when you join together you will be <i>ḥet</i>-<i>tet</i>,”</b> since <i>ḥet</i> is <i>Hod</i>, which is the <i>Malkhut</i> that is incorporated in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and that is the mystical meaning of the left channel in <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. There are two channels in <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>: 1) For producing souls, which is the right one; 2) For discharging waste to the external forces, which is the left one, called <i>ḥet</i>. The concept is that [the left channel] is an aspect of the <i>kof</i> that is incorporated in <i>Yesod</i> (as stated above, in section 24, fourth paragraph), from where the very small luminescence emerges to the external forces. It is through this that the external forces acquire the strength to resemble the man of holiness, like a monkey with respect to a person, in the mystical meaning of: “God made one thing corresponding to the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14). These two channels are close to one another, and there is only [a barrier as thick] as the husk of garlic between them. For this reason, the left channel has the strength to prevail over the right channel, and then it becomes <i>ḥet</i>-<i>tet</i>. This the mystical meaning of the fact that the numerical value of <i>ḥet</i>-<i>tet</i> is <i>tov</i> (good; <i>tet-vav-bet</i>; 17), which is “one thing corresponding to the other.”
When the right, which is <i>tet</i>, prevails, then it is <i>tov</i> in numerical value, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Say of the righteous that it is good” (Isaiah 3:10). But if, God forbid, the left channel, which is <i>ḥet</i>, prevails over the <i>tet</i>, then it is <i>ḥet-tet</i> (sin) in numerical value.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“In addition, <i>ḥet</i> is across from you.”</b> That is, the left channel, which is <i>ḥet</i>, has the strength to prevail over you, and then <b>“when you join together you will be <i>ḥet</i>-<i>tet</i>,”</b> i.e., the <i>kelippot</i> will be able to extract the <i>shefa</i> of holiness for themselves, as there is control over all the sins from there. [Rav Hamnuna] adds: <b>“This is why those letters were not inscribed in the holy tribes.”</b> This is the reason why there are no letters <i>ḥet</i> or <i>tet</i> in the names of the tribes, <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the twelve sons of Jacob. None of their names contain either of these two letters.</i> to indicate that they are lofty and separated from this aspect of the <i>ḥet</i>, which is the root of the force of corresponding [evil]. This is the mystical meaning [of the teaching] that Jacob’s bed was whole and no waste emerged from it to the external forces, as was the case for Abraham and Isaac, in accordance with the statement of the Sages (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 56a).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham and Isaac each had a child that contained aspects of the corresponding forces of evil within them, reflecting the incomplete inner state of Abraham and Isaac. In contrast, all of Jacob's sons were above these forces.</i>

Paragraph 34

<b>34. “<i>Zayin</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>zayin</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, for through me Your children will observe Shabbat, as it is stated: “Remember</b> [<i>zakhor</i>] <b>the Sabbath day, to keep it holy”</b> (Exodus 20:8). <b>He said to her: I will not create the world with you, because war is within you,</b> that is, <b>a sharpened sword and a spear with which war is fought</b>, and these are called <i>klei zayin</i> [weapons]<b>.</b> And you are <b>like</b> the letter <b><i>nun</i></b>, with which the world was not created because she contains <i>nefila</i> [falling, as stated in section 29, above]<b>.” She immediately departed from His presence.</b>
Explanation: The mystical meaning of <i>zayin</i> is that it is [in the form of] a <i>yod</i> over a <i>vav</i>, which indicates the brains of maturity of the <i>Nukba</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “A woman of valor is the crown of her husband” (Proverbs 12:4). [In the state of maturity, the <i>Nukba</i>] is incorporated in the male level, which is <i>vav</i>, and then [the <i>Nukba</i>] becomes a crown upon his head. This is the mystical meaning of the <i>yod</i> over the <i>vav</i>, and her husband being crowned with her. And this is the mystical meaning of: <b>“Remember</b> [<i>zakhor</i>] <b>the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”</b> By elevating the day of Shabbat, which is the <i>Nukba</i>, to the state of a crown atop the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> – at which stage [the <i>Nukba</i>] is incorporated in the mystical meaning of <i>zakhor</i> – the <i>Nukba</i> is called holy. The <i>zayin</i> is claiming: Since this light is great and holy, in the mystical meaning of the [Shabbat] rest, and there is cessation of all the <i>kelippot</i> in that state, I am worthy for the world to be created with my attribute.
To this, <b>“He said to her: I will not create</b> etc.<b>”</b> That is, the <i>zayin</i> is the <i>Netzaḥ</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as <i>zayin</i>-<i>ḥet</i>-<i>tet</i> are <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. When the <i>Nukba</i> is incorporated in <i>Zayin</i>, which is <i>Netzaḥ</i>, she attains the strength to ascend with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, where she becomes a crown for his head and her husband [which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is crowned in the mystical meaning of Shabbat, as stated.
However, since this entire rectification is achieved only through incorporation [of the <i>Nukba</i>] in the male and an elevation to [the place of] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), and not in the place [of the <i>Nukba</i>] below, where she is always positioned with the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, the rectification [of the <i>Nukba</i>] is therefore not completed in the [current period of] six thousand years. During the weekdays, when she returns to her place, her incorporation in the <i>zayin</i> is regarded as <i>keli zayin</i> [weapons], to such extent that all wars with the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> are considered as [coming] from her. This is in the mystical meaning of the weekdays that prepare for Shabbat, and the mystical meaning of: “The one who wins the war will be given the King’s daughter.” On the weekdays, each [person] must triumph in the battle with the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and external forces, and then he merits <b>“the King’s daughter,”</b> which is <b>“the Shabbat.”</b> Thus, the illumination of the Sabbath during the six thousand years is still not enough for the complete cessation of the <i>kelippot</i>, for this is why the weekdays return to surround [the <i>Nukba</i>] until the completion of the rectification in the future, when it will be a day that is all Shabbat and rest for everlasting life.
This is the meaning of His statement: <b>“I will not create the world with you, because war is within you, a sharpened sword and a spear with which war is fought.”</b> This is as explained, that your illumination is still not complete, since you are incomplete in your place below, and they merit you only through wars with the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. [The term] <b>“war”</b> refers to the wars of the lower [created beings] with the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. The <b>“sharpened sword”</b> refers to the attribute of <i>Malkhut</i> during its incorporation in <i>Netzaḥ</i> on the weekdays, when [the <i>Malkhut</i>] is a sharpened sword opposing the <i>kelippot</i> that wish to grasp hold of her. And <b>“a spear, with which war is fought”</b> refers to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> himself, who is called “a spear,” for [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is depicted as a letter <i>vav</i>, which is like a spear, [ready] to pierce the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> with the attribute [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. He says: “You are <b>like</b> the letter <b><i>nun</i>,”</b> because the restraints (<i>gevurot</i>) of the male are from the aspect of <i>Bina</i>, which is <i>nun</i>, as stated.

Paragraph 35

<b>35. “<i>Vav</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>vav</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, for I am a letter from Your name</b> <i>Havaya</i><b>. He said to her: <i>Vav</i> – you and <i>heh</i>, it is enough for you that you are letters from My name</b> <i>Havaya</i><b>, that you are in the secret of My name and engraved and carved in My name. I will not create the world with you.</b>
Explanation: Although the <i>yod</i> had already submitted this request and been rejected, the <i>vav</i> thought that the <i>yod</i> had been turned down because her level was too high. The <i>vav</i> claimed that the world should be created with her attribute, at the level of <i>vav-heh</i> in the name, which is the brains of the <i>Imma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the brains of the <i>Imma</i> aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother).</i>
<b>“He said to her: <i>Vav</i> – you and <i>heh</i>, it is enough for you that you are letters from My name etc.”</b> He replied with the same response that He had given to the <i>yod</i> (see there), as He limited [the <i>vav</i>] as well, with the mystical meaning of the statement: “Enough; expand only to the aspect of the <i>shin</i> so that the <i>kelippot</i> do not grasp hold of you. For this reason, you are unfit for the world to be created with you, as you too require protection from the <i>kelippot</i>.”

Paragraph 36

<b>36. “<i>Dalet</i> and <i>gimmel</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letters <b><i>dalet</i> and <i>gimmel</i> entered</b> [and] <b>also said the same. He also said to them: It is enough for you to be with one another, since paupers will not cease from the earth and they must be treated</b> [<i>li-gmol</i>] <b>with kindness. The <i>dalet</i> is poor</b> because she is called <i>dalet</i>, from the term <i>dalut</i> [poverty]<b>. The <i>gimmel</i> performs</b> [<i>gomelet</i>] <b>kindness</b> with the <i>dalet</i><b>. Therefore, you must not separate from one another and it is enough for you to nourish one another.</b>
Explanation: The case of the <i>dalet</i> has already been clarified, in section 24 above, s.v. <i>Ve-zeh</i> (see there), where it was explained that although the <i>dalet</i> receives <i>shefa</i> from the <i>gimmel</i>, and the corner on the roof [of the <i>dalet</i>] protrudes with [the bestowal of the light of giving, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> still has the strength to grasp hold of [the <i>dalet</i>], to separate her [from the <i>gimmel</i>], and to forge the letter <i>resh</i> with her, so that again she becomes poor [<i>resh</i>] and wretched. He thus said to them: <b>“It is enough for you to be with one another,”</b> i.e., you require extra protection so that you can <b>“be with one another,”</b> and the <i>gimmel</i> will bestow upon the <i>dalet</i>, <b>“since paupers will not cease from the earth.”</b> The opposite [side]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This term refers to the forces of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which have been described previously as corresponding to the side of good, in a structural parallelism.</i> has the strength to separate you and revert the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called “world,” into the aspect of being poor [<i>resh</i>] and wretched. <b>“They must be treated with kindness,”</b> for then [the <i>dalet</i> and <i>gimmel</i>] require an awakening from below, to give charity to the wretched, in order to restore the <i>dalet</i> so that it receives from the <i>gimmel</i> once again. Consequently, <b>“it is enough for you to nourish one another,”</b> as it is enough for you if you can keep yourselves in [a state of] pairing, nourishing each other, so that the <i>kelippot</i> will not be able to control you. Therefore, I will not create the world with you.

Paragraph 37

<b>37. “<i>Bet</i> entered etc.”</b><br>The letter <b><i>bet</i> entered</b> [and] <b>said before Him: Master of the world! It is good for You to create the world with me, for with me they bless You above and below</b>, as <i>bet</i> stands for <i>berakha</i>, blessing<b>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: I will certainly create the world with you, and you will be the start,</b> [in order] <b>to create the world</b> with you<b>.</b>
Explanation: The letter <i>bet</i> is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, meaning <i>Ḥesed</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, in the mystical meaning of a point in its palace, since the light of giving is a palace for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This [combination of lights] is blessing, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And pour you out a blessing etc.” (Malachi 3:10). This light does not diminish at all as it passes and descends through the levels [of creation]. Just as it is [in its fullness] at the highest of the levels, receiving from <i>Ein Sof</i>, blessed be He, so it remains in all its greatness and praise worthiness in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, and similarly until the end of [the world of] <i>Asiya</i>. It does not attain any more opacity as a result of all the partitions through which it passes. This is the meaning of the claim of the letter <i>bet</i>: <b>“It is good for You to create the world with me, for with me they bless You above and below.”</b> This means to say, the light of my blessing is equivalent above and below, without any difference whatsoever, and no partition or opacity can damage my illuminations in any way. Therefore, my attribute is suitable for the creation of the world, as there will be no purchase for the <i>kelippot</i> in me, because the <i>kelippot</i> can only attach in a context where there is some deficiency. Since there are no deficiencies in me, there will be no purchase [for them] in me.
<b>“The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: I will certainly create the world with you, and you will be the start,</b> [in order] <b>to create the world</b> with you<b>.”</b> He concurred with [the <i>bet</i>] that her attribute was suitable for the creation of the world, and this is the mystical meaning of the verse: “For I said, the world is built [<i>yibaneh</i>] through kindness (<i>Ḥesed</i>)” (Psalms 89:3). The word <i>yibaneh</i> denotes building [<i>binyan</i>] and understanding [<i>havana</i>], and He established [the <i>bet</i>] as a sufficient differentiator, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that the attribute of the <i>bet</i> was seen by God as sufficient for differentiating between those who follow the path of holiness and those who stray.</i> to distinguish between those who cleave to holiness and those who stray from the Holy One, blessed be He, to cleave to another god, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And try Me now with this, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall be more than sufficiency” (Malachi 3:10). But when [people] turn toward another god, they are devoid of blessing, for another god is infertile and does not bear fruit. This is the meaning of the prophet’s conclusion there: “You will return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him” (Malachi 3:18). Accordingly, “the world is built through kindness (<i>Ḥesed</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As the first part of the paragraph explains, the word "built" is the key word here, since the Hebrew form of the word has nuances of "building" and "understanding" within it. The <i>bet</i> reflects God's ability to differentiate (understanding) between those who follow the path of holiness, leading to their continuity (the building), and those who stray.</i>
He thus says: <b>“You will be the start [<i>sheruta</i>],</b> [in order] <b>to create the world</b> with you<b>.”</b> <i>Sheruta</i> means start, and He thereby indicates that He did not establish the light of blessing for [an immediate] perfection of the world, but as a good and sufficient start to bring the world to a state of perfection. The reason is that this light of giving is of the aspect of six extremities without a head. [This light] is still not enough to generate new souls to be fruitful and multiply, as there is no producing of offspring for any <i>partzuf</i> before it attains the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called head. Therefore, [the <i>partzuf</i>] still lacks perfection. As for His decision to create the world with the established <i>bet</i> and blessing (<i>berakha</i>), this [method creates] the main aspect of each <i>partzuf</i>, meaning that [this main aspect] will not be absent from any <i>partzuf</i> of holiness. [However, ] the completion of the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of the <i>partzuf</i>] that is required for the brains of producing offspring is not the main aspect of the <i>partzuf</i> but rather is considered merely an addition. [This aspect of the head and brains] is dependent on the good deeds of the lower [beings]. By contrast, the aspect of the six extremities will never be absent.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The main idea in this paragraph is to explain how the light of the <i>bet</i> is only a "start" in the process of Creation, not a finished, perfected product. This light (the light of giving) can only give rise to a <i>partzuf</i> structure of six extremities, the "main aspect" of the <i>partzuf</i>. This structure provides the "start" of the process of existence, but this process can only transition to completion with the involvement of the lower beings and their actions toward holiness. These actions allow for the addition of the first three <i>sefirot</i> necessary to complete the <i>partzuf</i> structure, allowing the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to flow in the <i>partzuf</i> as well, and bringing existence forward toward perfection.</i>

Paragraph 38

<b>38. “The letter <i>alef</i> arose etc.”</b><br><b>The letter <i>alef</i> arose but did not enter. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: <i>Alef</i>, <i>alef</i>, why are you not entering My presence like all the other letters? She said to Him: Master of the world! I observed that all the letters emerged from Your presence in vain; what would I do there? Furthermore, You have already given the letter <i>bet</i> this great gift, and it is unbecoming for the supreme King to transfer a gift that He has given to His servant and give it to another. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: <i>Alef</i>, <i>alef</i>, although the world was created with the letter <i>bet</i>, you will be the head of all the letters – there is no unification in Me other than through you. With you will all schemes will begin and all the works of the inhabitants of the world; and the entire unification is only through the letter <i>alef</i>.</b>
Explanation: As you already know, all these questions from the letters are their raising of feminine waters, while the answers are the mystical meaning of the masculine waters, as stated earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is explained in section 31 above. The concepts of feminine waters and masculine waters refers to the "awakening from below" and "awakening from above, " respectively.</i> Now, this great wholeness found in the letter <i>aleph</i> could never be the result of an awakening from below, but only through an awakening from above. This is as written in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Vayikra</i>, 81) on the verse “fallen, the virgin of Israel will rise no longer” (Amos 5:2), that “she will not rise by herself, but the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise her”; see there. Therefore, both at the start of the emanation of the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], i.e., while they are still in the mystical meaning of "playing in the sanctuary" of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother, which is the focus of the <i>Zohar</i> in that passage), and also at the completion of the rectification, the letter <i>alef</i> will not awaken by raising feminine waters from below upwards, in the manner of the emergence of the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] during the six thousand years. Rather, everything will be only in the mystical meaning of an awakening from above. This is the mystical meaning of <b>“she will not rise by herself, but the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise her.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since this awakening is from above, in the mystical meaning of the masculine waters, it is described as "the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise her, " as opposed to the <i>aleph</i> initiating in the form of feminine waters.</i> He thus says here: <b>“The letter <i>alef</i> arose but did not enter. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: <i>Alef</i>, <i>alef</i>, why are you not entering.”</b> This shows that the <i>alef</i> was not awakened at all to raise feminine waters like the other letters, until <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, said to her,”</b> which is the mystical meaning of <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise her”</b>;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that the statement indicating that the Holy One initiated and spoke first alludes to the dynamic of masculine waters in which the Holy One initiates and "raises" the <i>aleph</i>.</i> see the <i>Zohar</i> there, thoroughly. He says <b>“<i>alef</i>, <i>alef</i>”</b> twice, in reference to those two aforementioned occasions, the first when the letters were in the mystical meaning of playing, while the second alludes to the completion of the rectification, since then too <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise her”</b> Himself.
[The <i>Zohar</i> continues: <b>“I observed that all the letters emerged from Your presence in vain.”</b> The reason why the <i>alef</i> did not dare raise the masculine waters on her own was that she saw all the letters leaving in vain, as it turned out that on all the levels there is “one thing corresponding to the other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous sections, this refers to the structural parallelism between the sides of good and evil, in which each force in the side of good has a corresponding aspect in the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>.</i> For this reason, she thought that she too was no better than them, and that she also had an opposite. This is why she said: <b>“What would I do there?”</b> For I have observed that I am no better than them.
[Rav Hamnuna] next says: <b>“Furthermore, You have already given the letter <i>bet</i> this great gift, and it is unbecoming for the supreme King to transfer</b> etc.<b>”</b> The second reason why I did not dare raise the masculine waters is because I observed that You have already established the main structure of each <i>partzuf</i> with the attribute of the letter <i>bet</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “The world is built through giving” (Psalms 89:3), as stated. Therefore, I had no doubt that any change would be impossible, as it is not the manner of the King to transfer a gift that He has given to one servant and to give it to another servant.
[Rav Hamnuna] continues: <b>“The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: <i>Alef</i>, <i>alef</i>, although the world was created with the letter <i>bet</i>, you will be the head of all the letters.”</b> The meaning is as follows: It is true that the world was already created with the letter <i>bet</i>, and it is also true that I will not transfer her gift to another. However, only the aspect of six extremities without a head was created with her attribute, and therefore the letters are still lacking a head, since they are unfit to be fruitful and multiplying without it. Therefore, <b>“you will be”</b> used for drawing forth the head to <b>“all the letters,”</b> that is, the brains of the first three, which are the brains of face-to-face<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the highest state of maturity in which the brains, the lights of the levels, are in their highest state, allowing the flow of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to reach the lower vessels and beings.</i> and producing offspring.
[Rav Hamnuna] then says: <b>“The there is no unification in Me other than through you. With you will all schemes will begin and all the works of the inhabitants of the world.”</b> Meaning, My unification is revealed in the world only through your attribute. In addition, the whole matter of reward, punishment, and repentance, through which the completion of the rectification will be revealed, will be only <b>“through you.”</b> I established the <i>bet</i> only as the essence of the <i>partzuf</i>, so that [these lower brains] will not be at all a function of the deeds of the lower [beings], such that even if they corrupt their works, no change in these brains would thereby result, as stated. By contrast, the brains within you are entirely a function of the deeds of the lower [beings]: If they corrupt their works, the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] in you will depart; and if they repent, they will draw the brains of the first three once again.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“With you will all schemes will begin and all the works of the inhabitants of the world.”</b> “Schemes” means “if they corrupt their works,” in the mystical meaning of the verse: “God made man straight, but they have sought out many schemes” (Ecclesiastes 7:29), since then the brains of the first three will depart. <b>“And all the works of the inhabitants of the world”</b> refers to raising feminine waters by means of good deeds, for then the brains of the first three will be drawn once more. <b>“And the entire unification is only through the letter <i>alef</i>”</b> alludes to the great unification of the completion of the rectification, which will also be <b>“through the letter <i>alef</i>.”</b>

Paragraph 39

<b>39. “And the Holy One, blessed be He, fashioned etc.”</b><br><b>And the Holy One, blessed be He, fashioned higher, large letters,</b> which allude to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Bina</i>, <b>and lower, small letters</b>, alluding to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i><b>. For this reason it is written <i>bet bet</i>,</b> that is, <b><i>Bereshit bara</i></b> (“In the beginning [God] created,” [Genesis 1:1]), and likewise <b><i>alef alef</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Elohim et</i> (“God (created the heavens etc.),” [Genesis 1:1]), as the first <i>alef</i> and <i>bet</i> are <b>letters from above,</b> from <i>Bina</i>, <b>and</b> the second <i>alef</i> and <i>bet</i> are <b>letters from below,</b> from <i>Malkhut</i><b>. And they are all united, from the higher world,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, <b>and from the lower world</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, so that they will bestow to one another<b>.</b>
Explanation: The <b>“large letters”</b> are from the aspect of the <i>Bina</i>, while the <b>“lower, small letters”</b> are in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. Now, when the higher [level] wants to give to the lower [level], it must enclothe itself in the lower one. This is the mystical meaning of the two letters <i>bet</i> of <i>Bereshit bara</i>, and the two letters <i>alef</i> of <i>Elohim et</i>: The first <i>bet</i> belongs to the higher [level], <i>Bina</i>, while the second <i>bet</i> belongs to the lower [level], <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, in which the first <i>bet</i> is enclothed. Similarly, the first <i>alef</i> is from <i>Bina</i>, which enclothed itself in the second <i>alef</i>, [the <i>aleph</i>] of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, in order to give to [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>]. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And they are all united, from the higher world, and from the lower world.”</b> In other words, the two letters <i>bet</i> are one matter, and likewise the two letters <i>alef</i> are one matter, only that the first [of each of the letters] are from the higher world, <i>Bina</i>, whereas the second [of each of the letters] are from the lower world, <i>Malkhut</i>. [Each pair of letters] are one because they are enclothed in one another, in the manner of a higher [level] that wishes to give to a lower [level]. The <i>bet</i> of the higher world enclothed herself in the <i>bet</i> of the lower world, and similarly the <i>alef</i> of the higher world enclothed herself in the <i>alef</i> of the lower world.

Paragraph 40

<b>40. “<i>Bereshit</i>, Rabbi Yudai etc.”</b><br><b><i>Bereshit</i></b> (“In the Beginning,” Genesis 1:1) – <b>Rabbi Yudai said: What is</b> [the meaning of] <b><i>Bereshit</i>?</b> It means <b>in <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is <i>Ḥokhma</i> upon which the world</b>, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>stands, to enter into the supernal, hidden secrets</b>, i.e., into the light of <i>Bina</i><b>. Here are engraved the six great, higher extremities,</b> which are the six extremities of <i>Bina</i>, <b>from which everything emerges,</b> and <b>from which six origins and streams are formed,</b> which are the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>to bring them into the great sea</b>, <i>Malkhut</i><b>. This is <i>bara</i>-<i>shit</i></b> [“created six”], which is alluded to in the letters of <i>Bereshit</i>, <b>as</b> the six extremities <b>were created from here. Who created them? The one who is not mentioned; that hidden one who is unknown</b>, <i>Arikh Anpin</i><b>.</b>
Explanation: There are two [types of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> in <i>Atzilut</i>: a) The primordial <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and which is called the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>; b) The <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, which is the <i>Bina</i> that ascends to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where [that <i>Bina</i>] becomes <i>Ḥokhma</i> in order to give to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The ascent of <i>Bina</i> to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> allows <i>Bina</i> to serve as a channel for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to reach <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. This process is discussed extensively in the commentary of the <i>Sulam</i> in previous sections (see section 16 and onward, for example).</i> Thus, [Rav Yudai] states: “<b>What is <i>Bereshit</i>? In <i>Ḥokhma</i>.”</b> <i>Reishit</i> [beginning] is the name of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, not the primordial <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, but rather the <b>“<i>Ḥokhma</i> on which the world stands,”</b> i.e., the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths on which the world, which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, stands, from which [the world] receives and through which [the world] is sustained. This is not the case for the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> itself – <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> cannot receive anything from it and the world was not created through it. Therefore, <i>Bereshit bara</i> (“In the beginning [God] created,” [Genesis 1:1]) refers to the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, which is <i>Bina</i> that returns to become <i>Ḥokhma</i> by means of her ascent to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.
[Rav Yudai] then says: <b>“To enter the supernal, hidden secrets.”</b> When the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, which are called "the world, " receive from the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of thirty-two paths, they ascend to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, and this <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are called “the supernal, sealed secrets.” He thus states: <b>“This is <i>Ḥokhma</i> upon which the world stands, to enter the high and sealed secrets.” “Stands”</b> means the attainment of brains.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">When <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> attain the brains of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the world "stands, " stable upon this sustaining divine light of vitality.</i> He says, <b>“this <i>Ḥokhma</i>"</b> is the <i>Ḥokhma</i> <b>on which the world,”</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, <b>“stands,”</b> as <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> are sustained through the brains that they receive from [this <i>Ḥokhma</i>]. [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] thereby ascend to <b>“the high and sealed secrets,”</b> which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, and enclothe them, i.e., [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] become like <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, since a lower [level] that ascends to a higher [level] becomes like [that higher level].
[Rav Yudai] continues: “<b>Here are engraved the six great, higher extremities,</b> etc. <b>this is <i>bara</i>-<i>shit</i>,”</b> since <i>Bereshit</i> has the same letters as <i>bara</i>-<i>shit</i>, referring to <i>shit sitrin</i>, the six extremities. He is saying that the <b>“great, higher”</b> six extremities were engraved with this <i>Ḥokhma</i> and all [things] emanate and emerge from them, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “<b>In wisdom</b> [<i>Ḥokhma</i>] <b>You have made them all</b>” (Psalms 104:24). For the <i>Ḥokhma</i> referred to here means the <i>Bina</i> that was ejected from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, in the mystical meaning of “the father took out the mother on account of the children,” and the father himself is established as a kind of male and female. This means that <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and likewise the <i>Abba</i> (father) of <i>Atzilut</i>, were themselves established as a kind of male and female as a result of the ascent of the <i>Malkhut</i> to the place of <i>Bina</i>. This caused the <i>Bina</i> itself to eject from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and from the <i>Abba</i>, and become of the aspect of the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, without a head. While [the <i>Bina</i>] is positioned in the body of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, it cannot not receive from the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and becomes of the aspect of six extremities that lack the first three (see above, in the <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, section 2, third paragraph). Thus, the <i>Bina</i> was carved and became <b>“six extremities”</b> without a head. This is the meaning of his statement here: <b>“Here the six great, higher extremities are engraved, from which everything emerges,”</b> since through the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, which is <i>Bina</i>, six extremities without the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] were carved, due to the departure [of <i>Bina</i>] from the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Subsequently, by means of the feminine waters from the lower [beings], [<i>Bina</i>] returns to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and receives the first three of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and [<i>Bina</i>] transmits to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, who transmit the <i>shefa</i> to all the worlds [below]. Thus, all the worlds emerge from these <b>“six extremities”</b> that were carved in <i>Bina</i>. The reason why [Rav Yudai] calls them <b>“the six great, higher extremities”</b> is because they are from <i>Bina</i>, in the manner of the letters of <i>Bina</i>, which are called “great letters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the preceding sections, entitled "the Letters of Rav Hamnuna Sabba, " the letters corresponding to <i>Bina</i> are called "great letters."</i>
He then says: <b>“From which six origins and streams are formed, to bring them into the great sea.”</b> The engraving of <b>“six extremities”</b> while the <i>Bina</i> is outside of the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, is called <b>“six origins,”</b> as they are only the origins of the brains of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Subsequently, upon the return of [<i>Bina</i>] to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, they become the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called <b>“streams”</b> for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. They then become <b>“six streams,”</b> in the mystical meaning of the verse: “He will drink from the stream on the way; thus will his head be raised” (Psalms 110:7), and then the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> transmits them to <b>“the great sea,”</b> meaning to the <i>Nukba</i> [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>&gt;&gt;]. [Rav Yudai] thus says: <b>From which,”</b> i.e., from the six extremities, the six great, higher extremities of <i>Bina</i>, <b>“six origins,”</b> which are the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> of immaturity, <b>“and streams,”</b> i.e., the brains of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>“are formed, to bring them,”</b> that is, to transmit, <b>“into the great sea,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>. The reason why the six extremities of immaturity of <i>Bina</i> are called “origins of minds” is because the <i>Bina</i> emerged to become the six extremities of immaturity only in order to be a source for transmitting brains to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. Had <i>Bina</i> not emerged, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] would not have been fit for any brains, as stated.
He adds: <b>“This is <i>bara</i>-<i>shit</i>, as they were created from here.” “Created”</b> refers to six extremities without a head, since the word “created” means sealing, as explained below. Accordingly, two matters are alluded to here by the word <i>Bereshit</i>: a) <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as <i>reishit</i> [beginning] denotes <i>Ḥokhma</i>; b) <i>Bara</i>-<i>shit</i>, which teaches that <b>“six extremities”</b> without a head were created from <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the origins of brains for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> which are called world, and they are the seven days of creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The six <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> embodied by <i>Nukba</i> correspond to the seven days of creation.</i>
He concludes: <b>“Who created them? The one who is not mentioned; that hidden one who is unknown.”</b> Since the word <i>bara</i> is in <i>Bereshit</i> itself, who created [<i>bara</i>] this?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The language of <i>bereshit bara</i> (in the beginning [he] created) implies the presence of a hidden subject performing the act of creation. Rav Yudai is answering the implicit question of "who engaged in this act of creation?"</i> To this, [Rav Yudai] states that it is <b>“that hidden one who is unknown,”</b> the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, since [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] removed <i>Bina</i> from his head and made [<i>Bina</i>] into six extremities, as he created these <b>“six great, higher extremities”</b> that are alluded to in <i>Bereshit</i>.

Paragraph 41

<b>41. “Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yosei were walking along the way. When they reached a certain field, Rabbi Ḥiyya said to Rabbi Yosei: When you say <i>Bara</i>-<i>shit</i>,</b> which is hinted to in [the word] <i>Bereshit</i>, <b>this</b> [implication] <b>is certainly the case, since the six higher days,</b> which are only the six extremities of <i>Bina</i>, <b>give to the Torah,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and not more. The others</b>, the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, <b>are concealed.</b>
Explanation: The Torah refers to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called <i>Orayta</i> [“the Torah”]. The six higher days refers to the six extremities of <i>Bina</i>, which are above <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [Rabbi Ḥiyya] says that it is for this reason that <b><i>Bara</i>-<i>shit</i></b> is implied in the word <i>Bereshit</i>, since [the word] <i>Bereshit</i> is indicative of the <i>Bina</i> that returned to be <i>Ḥokhma</i> in order to give to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Since <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> does not receive the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from [<i>Bina</i>], but only the six extremities of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the letters of <i>Bara</i>-<i>shit</i> are alluded to in this <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Bereshit</i>, to indicate that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> receives from [<i>Bina</i>] only the six extremities of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is the meaning of [Rabbi Ḥiyya's] statement: But <b>“the others are concealed,”</b> because the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the <i>Ḥokhma</i> remain concealed from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] does not attain them.
The reason is as follows: It is known that the second constriction was established in <i>Atik</i>, that is, it raised the lower <i>heh</i> to the apertures of the eyes, in order to emanate the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> (as stated above, section 13, third paragraph). Therefore, the <i>Keter</i> was divided into two halves, with the <i>gulgalta</i>, eyes, and apertures of the eyes remaining in <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atik</i>, while the lower half of the <i>Keter</i>, which consists of the ears, nose, and mouth, was established as the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. In this state, the lower <i>heh</i> operates in the apertures of the eyes of <i>Atik</i>, and <i>yod</i>-<i>heh</i>-<i>vav</i> in the ears, nose, and mouth, which are <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> to the aperture of the eyes (<i>Bina</i>) is described as the last <i>heh</i> of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of God. This leaves the other three letters operating in the emanated <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, without a lower <i>heh</i>.</i> This is because the bottom <i>heh</i> of <i>Havaya</i> is missing in <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and therefore there are only the first nine <i>sefirot</i> in <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, without <i>Malkhut</i>, and only the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> completes <i>Arikh Anpin</i> into ten <i>sefirot</i>, as is known. The <i>Malkhut</i> is concealed in the apertures of the eyes of <i>Atik</i>, and all the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> are imprinted from them. All [these] <i>partzufim</i> were divided into two halves: <i>Gulgalta</i>, eyes and the apertures of the eyes by themselves, and the ears, nose, and mouth by themselves. For [example], the <i>Bina</i> is divided into two <i>partzufim</i>, with the <i>gulgalta</i>, eyes and apertures of the eyes in [<i>Bina</i>] established as <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and the ears, nose, and mouth in [<i>Bina</i>] as <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.
Thus, the lower <i>heh</i> [of the level of <i>Bina</i>] is in the apertures of the eyes of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and <i>yod</i>-<i>heh</i>-<i>vav</i>, without the lower <i>heh</i>, are in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. The [<i>yod-heh-vav</i>] lack the <i>Malkhut</i> because their <i>Malkhut</i> remained in the apertures of the eyes of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), in the manner stated above with regard to <i>Atik</i> and <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This pattern reflects the "imprinting" from the levels above. These lower <i>partzufim</i> have the same structure as <i>Atik</i> and <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, with a corresponding ascendant <i>Malkhut</i> to the apertures of the eyes.</i> Similarly, in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, the <i>gulgalta</i> and eyes were established as the large <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, and the ears, nose, and mouth as the small <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. The <i>Malkhut</i> remained in the apertures of the eyes of the large <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, and the small <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> have only the first nine [<i>sefirot</i>], without <i>Malkhut</i>. Only the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> completes [their <i>sefirot</i> by serving] as their <i>Malkhut</i>, in the manner stated above regarding <i>Atik</i> and <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. Thus, just as the <i>Keter</i> was divided into two halves – the first three and the lower seven<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This count refers to the higher level as being the "first three, " a term used to denote the head, the brains of the particular level or <i>partzuf</i>. This is in contrast to the lower seven, a reference to the aspect of the six extremities without a head, the lower aspect of a <i>partzuf</i>. This count should not be confused with the count described previously of the lower nine <i>sefirot</i> after the ascent of the lower <i>heh</i>.</i> – so too was <i>Bina</i> divided, and also <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>: The lower <i>heh</i> remained in the first three of each, while in the lower seven there are only <i>yod</i>-<i>heh</i>-<i>vav</i>, without the lower <i>heh</i>, and only the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> completes the [total count of the <i>sefirot</i>] instead of <i>Malkhut</i>.
Therefore, the upper half of each [of these] levels remains of the aspect of "unknown." This is like the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Atik</i>, in which the lower <i>heh</i> does not return and descend from the apertures of the eyes even in the phase of maturity. Although in the phase of maturity the [<i>partzufim</i>] bring back to themselves the vessels of ears, nose, and mouth that they lacked, they still do not draw forth the first three of the lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Normally, a return of these lower vessels to a level should allow the higher lights to return as well.</i> This is on account of the lower <i>heh</i> that is concealed in them, upon which the first constriction occurred, so as not to receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The first constriction prevents the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from entering the vessel of <i>Malkhut</i>.</i> Consequently, the first three [of the level] always remain in the light of giving, in the mystical meaning of pure air.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This term refers to the environment in which the <i>Malkhut</i> is present. In this concept, the <i>Malkhut</i> is described as a <i>yod</i>, and it enters into the environment of the light (<i>or</i>) of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. The presence of <i>Malkhut</i> causes that light to flee, as a result of the first constriction, leaving only the light of giving. This is described as the <i>yod</i> being added to the word <i>or</i> (light), converting it to <i>avir</i>, air, which is the light of giving.</i> Instead, only the lower half of each level draws forth the first three of lights in the phase of maturity, in the mystical meaning of the <i>yod</i> emerging from their air, and this [lower aspect] returns to be the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and the first three.
As a result, it is considered that the <i>partzufim</i> of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] that are drawn in [each of] the five <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> are regarded as only the six extremities of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and remain lacking in the first three of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is because the first three of each <i>partzuf</i> do not receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>, but rather [only] the six extremities of each <i>partzuf</i> [receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>]. For this reason, there is only the [level of six extremities of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the brains [of these levels].
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] thus says: <b>“The six higher days give to the Torah and not more.”</b> The meaning is as stated, that the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> only receives from the supernal brains of the six days, which are the brains of six extremities. But <b>“the others are concealed”</b> – the first three of the brains are hidden, since they are hidden even in the <i>partzufim</i> that are higher than [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], as only the aspect of the six extremities of the higher <i>partzufim</i> have brains.

Paragraph 42

<b>42. “However, we saw etc.”</b><br><b>However, we saw with regard to the secrets of <i>Bereshit</i> that he said as follows: That hidden, holy one engraved [<i>galifei</i>] a carving in the intestines,</b> which is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i>, <b>of one hidden one,</b> the mystical meaning of the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atik</i>, <b>that is dotted with the embedded point</b>, the mystical meaning of the point of the <i>Malkhut</i> of the first constriction, which ascended to <i>Bina</i> and ejected the ears, nose, and mouth of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> out of his head<b>. That carving</b>, which was engraved in <i>Bina</i>, <b>was engraved and concealed in</b> [<i>Bina</i>]<b>, like one who hides everything behind a single key, and the whole of that one key is hidden in a single palace. And although everything is hidden in that palace, the essence of everything is in that key,</b> because <b>it is that key which closes and opens.</b>
Explanation: <b><i>Galifei</i></b> refers to the engraving [that led to] the lack of ears, nose, and mouth of the vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the previously mentioned ejection of the vessels called "ear, " "nose" and "mouth" through the ascent of <i>Malkhut</i> in the second constriction.</i> The <b>“holy, hidden one”</b> is <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, who is called “the holy sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>”; <b>“of one hidden one</b>” <b>–</b> the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atik</i>; <b>“in his intestines, of one hidden one”</b> – meaning in the interior of <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atik</i>. <b>“Dotted”</b> is referring to the establishment of the partition for the mystical meaning of a fusion through collision. <b>“With the imbedded point”</b> means with a dot that is embedded in a circle. This is the <i>Malkhut</i> of the first constriction, which is called the middle point, on which the first constriction was performed. This is in contrast to the partition that is established with the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, which is the case for the six extremities of all the <i>partzufim</i>, as stated just earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the previous section the author of the <i>Sulam</i> described how from <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and below, there is no full <i>Malkhut</i>, but only the nine <i>sefirot</i> preceding <i>Malkhut</i>. The coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, the <i>sefira</i> at the bottom of the six extremities, plays the role of <i>Malkhut</i> to an extent.</i> This partition of the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> is called “the point of the settlement,” rather than “the middle point.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Malkhut</i> is often referred to as a "point." Here, the author is indicating the distinction in terminology between these two kinds of "points."</i>
The meaning is that <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is engraved and becomes lacking in its first three [<i>sefirot</i>] as a result of the internal makeup of [the level] above. [This level above is[ <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atik</i>, which is established with the lower <i>heh</i> in the apertures of its eyes, as stated above.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As described in previous sections, the lower <i>heh</i> refers to <i>Malkhut</i> ascending in the second constriction. The position of <i>Malkhut</i> within <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atik</i> is mirrored by the levels below.</i>
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] then states: <b>“That carving was engraved and concealed in her, like one who hides everything behind a single key.”</b> This <b>“key”</b> refers to the aspect of <i>Malkhut</i> that is the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, which is established in every [level of] six extremities of the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, as stated in the previous section. As explained there, in the <i>partzufim</i> of the six extremities the <i>yod</i> emerges from their <i>avir</i> [air] and they become <i>or</i> [light]. This means that the partition descends from the apertures of the eyes [of those <i>partzufim</i> of the six extremities] to the mouth, and this returns the ears, nose, and mouth back to the level. Subsequently, once these [aspects of the six extremities] have the ears, nose, and mouth of the vessels, they also acquire the first three of lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The lights of <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i> <i>neshama</i> <i>ḥaya</i> and <i>yeḥida</i> always enter the vessels from lowest to highest. Thus, when the ears, nose and mouth are ejected from the level, the higher lights of <i>neshama</i> <i>ḥaya</i> and <i>yeḥida</i> are lost from the level. Upon the return of these vessels, the "first three" of the lights, meaning the three highest lights of <i>neshama</i> <i>ḥaya</i> and <i>yeḥida</i>, are able to return to the level.</i> Accordingly, the partition in the apertures of the eyes is called a “key,” because [the partition] closes the <i>partzuf</i> from the illumination of the first three while [the partition] is in the apertures of the eyes, before reopening [the <i>partzuf</i>] to the lights of the first three when [the partition] descends back to its place, to the mouth. For this reason, it is also called “the opening of the eyes” (as stated in section 7, and in the <i>Sulam</i> there, second paragraph).
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] thus says: <b>“And concealed in her, like one who hides everything behind a single key.”</b> In other words, although <i>Atik</i> itself was engraved with the lower <i>heh</i>, as stated above, nevertheless, that carving which was engraved in <i>Arikh Anpin</i> as a result of [its mirroring] of <i>Atik</i> is dissimilar to the carving of <i>Atik</i> itself, since <i>Arikh Anpin</i> was carved with a “key,” the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, for [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] lacked the <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated. It follows that only the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> operates in the apertures of the eyes of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, not the lower <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that since <i>Arikh Anpin</i> lacks a true bottom <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, and only has the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Yesod</i> (the coronet) at the bottom of its structure, when this <i>Malkhut</i> ascends to the aperture of the eyes of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, its impact on the <i>partzuf</i> is different from the impact of the lower <i>heh</i> (a full <i>Malkhut</i>) on the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Atik</i>.</i> Therefore, the air of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is known, because it is established with that key, whereas the air of <i>Atik</i> is unknown, since the <i>Malkhut</i> of the middle point is within [<i>Atik</i>], and it does not draw the first three [lights] through [<i>Atik</i>], as stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The "air" of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is "known, " meaning the lights of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> can be accessible to the levels below, unlike the lights of <i>Atik</i>.</i> [As an aside, ] you should not find problematic the statement here that <i>Arikh Anpin</i> possesses <i>gulgalta</i> and eyes, even though we said above that [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] has only ears, nose, and mouth, which are the lower half of the <i>Keter</i>. The reason is that with respect to <i>Atik</i>, <i>Arikh Anpin</i> has only ears, nose, and mouth, but with respect to itself, <i>Arikh Anpin</i> [possesses] the <i>gulgalta</i> and eyes and lacks ears, nose, and mouth, as explained (in my book, <i>Introduction to the Wisdom of the Kabbalah</i>, page 25, s.v., <i>Ve-al zeh</i>).
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] next states: <b>“And the whole of that one key is hidden in a single palace.”</b> <i>Arikh Anpin</i> emanated <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> and also engraved <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> without the first three of lights and [without] the ears, nose, and mouth of the vessels. [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] are the <b>“palace”</b> in which all the lights of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] were hidden – the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of the light] of <i>neshama</i>, the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of the light] of <i>ḥaya</i>, as well as the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of the light] of <i>yeḥida</i>. When [Rabbi Ḥiyya] states <b>“the whole</b> [of that one key] <b>is hidden,”</b> he means that <i>Arikh Anpin</i> also drew the lower <i>heh</i> of <i>Atik</i> into this palace, as well as the aspect of [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] itself, the “key.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, within <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> lies the force of blockage, resulting from the lower <i>heh</i> of <i>Atik</i>, as well as the capacity to "unlock" that, derived from the version of the lower <i>heh</i> in <i>Arikh Anpin</i> (the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>), called a "key."</i>
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] continues: <b>“And although everything is hidden in that palace, the essence of everything is in that key.”</b> The “palace” is <i>Bina</i>, which is a palace for <i>Ḥokhma</i>. In [<i>Bina</i>] are [a set of] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and six extremities. The lower <i>heh</i> rules over [this aspect of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>], while the <b>“key,”</b> the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, rules over [the aspect of] the six extremities [of <i>Bina</i>]. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And although everything is hidden in that palace,”</b> i.e., even the lower <i>heh</i> from <i>Atik</i>, nevertheless, <b>“the essence of everything is in that key,”</b> in the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that the influence of the lower <i>heh</i> in <i>Atik</i> only impacts the six extremities component of this <i>Bina</i>.</i> The reason [the essence is only in the six extremities] is that it is only in the six extremities of <i>Bina</i>, called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, that the concealment is discerned, [the concealment] meaning [there is a level of] six extremities without a head of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. This [concealment] is not the case for the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), in which, while the lower <i>heh</i> is in the apertures of the eyes, the [aspect of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] is not lacking at all. This is because the [the light of giving] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are considered like the <i>Ḥokhma</i> and the first three [for the level of <i>Bina</i>] (as stated above, in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, section 2, s.v. <i>Ve-hu</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The presence of <i>Malkhut</i> in the <i>partzuf</i> aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (the aspect of the "first three" of <i>Bina</i>) does not cause a concealment of the light in that aspect. This is because the light of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> is the light of giving, a light that is unaffected by the presence of <i>Malkhut</i> (the lower <i>heh</i>). In contrast, the aspect of the six extremities of <i>Bina</i> (<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>) draws the illumination of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. As a result, the presence of <i>Malkhut</i> causes a concealment, since the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> flees before a vessel of <i>Malkhut</i> as a result of the first constriction.</i>
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] concludes: <b>“It is that key which closes and opens.”</b> The closing and opening are performed by means of the lower <i>heh</i> in the apertures of the eyes, for when [<i>Malkhut</i>] ascends to the apertures of the eyes, it closes off the brains of the first three, since [as a result of the ascension of <i>Malkhut</i>] the <i>partzuf</i> is left lacking the ears, nose, and mouth of the vessels, as well as the first three of the lights. When [<i>Malkhut</i>] descends from the apertures of the eyes back to the mouth, it opens [the conduit] for the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] so that they will illuminate in the <i>partzuf</i>. [The descent of <i>Malkhut</i>] returns the ears, nose, and mouth of the vessels and the first three of the lights back to the <i>partzuf</i>. This illustrates that it is only the lower <i>heh</i> itself that closes and opens. Nevertheless, since the opening of the brains is not in the first three, but only in the lower seven, where the lower <i>heh</i> does not rule, but rather the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, which is called the <b>“key,”</b> and the first three of each level – where the lower <i>heh</i> rules – always remain in the state of air that is unknown (as stated), the closing and opening are therefore attributed to the “key,” not to the lower <i>heh</i>.

Paragraph 43

<b>43. “In that palace, there are etc.”</b><br><b>In that palace, there are many hidden treasures, stacked atop each other. In that palace, there are gates – fifty of them – that are designed to seal off</b>, i.e., they are fashioned so as to block the lights<b>. They were carved in four directions, and were forty-nine</b> gates<b>, since one gate has no side</b> and <b>it is unknown whether it is above or below. For this reason that gate remains sealed.</b>
Explanation: There are many kinds of [<i>sefirot</i>] of the “first three” – the first three of [the level of light of] <i>neshama</i>, the first three of <i>ḥaya</i>, and the first three of <i>yeḥida</i>. Each of these three kinds of “first three” contains innumerable details. This is the meaning of: <b>“Many hidden treasures in that palace, stacked atop each other.”</b> When the lower <i>heh</i> resides in the apertures of the eyes, all these levels are concealed and unknown.
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] then states [that there are] <b>“gates – fifty of them – that are designed to seal off.”</b> These “gates” are receptacles for lights, which can be in one of two states: a) When they are still <b>“sealed off,”</b> i.e., the gates are closed and sealed and do not receive anything; b) When the gates are opened and receive lights from the [level] above. He thus says: <b>“Gates – fifty of them – that are designed to seal off,”</b> as when the palace gates are in the closed state, they number fifty. However, when it comes to opening the gates, they are only forty-nine, as will be explained below. The concept of the number fifty is because the ten <i>sefirot</i> are essentially only five <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, but <i>Tiferet</i> incorporates six extremities so [together] they are ten. Consequently, when each of the five <i>sefirot</i> incorporates ten [<i>sefirot</i>], they are fifty.
<b>“They were carved in four directions, and they became forty-nine.”</b> As explained above, the closing and opening are not carried out in [the context of] the [full] lower <i>heh</i>, but only in the “key,” which is the coronet [of <i>Yesod</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous section, the environment of the full lower <i>heh</i> does not undergo an opening from the sealing presence of the full <i>Malkhut</i>. Only in the six extremities, in which the <i>Malkhut</i> is that of the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Yesod</i> (the coronet) does the unsealing take place.</i> Thus, the aspect of "carving, " [meaning] the carvings [of vessels] suitable for receiving [the lights], was not formed in all five <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, but only in the four <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, not in <i>Malkhut</i>, and four times ten is forty. However, <i>Malkhut</i> also incorporates ten <i>sefirot</i>, which are <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, and thus [<i>Malkhut</i>] can also receive from the “key” to its first nine [<i>sefirot</i>], i.e., until the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> [of <i>Malkhut</i>]. Therefore, forty-nine <i>sefirot</i> are carved out: Forty from the four <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, each of which is comprised of ten, and the first nine <i>sefirot</i> from the <i>Malkhut</i> that incorporates ten. The result is that only the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is missing.
<b>“One gate has no side; it is unknown whether it is above or below. For this reason, that gate remains sealed.”</b> This is the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the fiftieth gate, the lower <i>heh</i> itself that descends from the eyes to the mouth at the time of maturity, as stated above. It was explained earlier that although the lower <i>heh</i> descends from the apertures of the eyes of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> to the mouth, and the [vessels of] ears, nose, and mouth [of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] (together with <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> that enclothe [those vessels]) combine with the level of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> into a single <i>partzuf</i> (as then the first three of the light are drawn into them) – nevertheless, the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> do not receive anything from the lights of the first three and they remain in a state of pure air alone, and it is as though the lower <i>heh</i> did not descend at all from the apertures of their eyes. It therefore follows that with respect to the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, it is not discernible whether the lower <i>heh</i> is still positioned at the apertures of their eyes above, since they remain only [containing] the light of giving as before, or whether the lower <i>heh</i> descended from the apertures of the eyes to the place of the mouth. [This latter option is implied since] the vessels of ears, nose and mouth of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] ascended [back to their place] along with <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and they transmit the brains of the first three of lights to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. [This illustrates that] it is necessarily the case that the lower <i>heh</i> descended to the mouth. [Thus it is] the case that if we were to look from the perspective of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, it would seem to us that the lower <i>heh</i> is [still] above, in the apertures of the eyes, whereas if we were to look from the perspective of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, we would see it below, in the mouth.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“One gate has no side,”</b> i.e., the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the essence of the lower <i>heh</i>; <b>“it is unknown whether it is above or below,”</b> since with respect to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, [the <i>heh</i>] is above, whereas in relation to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> it is below. <b>“For this reason, that gate remains sealed.”</b> The consequence is that this <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is not opened at all, and it remains as sealed as during the phase of immaturity, that is, before the descent [of the <i>heh</i>] to the mouth. The opening of the gates transpires only in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, where the lower <i>heh</i> is lacking and the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> operates in its stead. However, in the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, where the lower <i>heh</i> [itself] does operate, they remain sealed from the first three, as before.
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] thus states: <b>“For this reason, that gate remains sealed.”</b> You must comprehend that although the fiftieth gate is the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated, that is the case only with respect to the vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Recall that there is an inverse relationship between the vessels and the lights. Since <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is the lowest vessel, it inversely corresponds to the highest of the lights (the brains). In this case, since the lower <i>heh</i> blocks the higher lights of the brains off at a certain point, it is described as the corresponding light to the lowest vessel (as the author explains).</i> However, with respect to the lights, it is considered the first three of the brains, as on account [of the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>], <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> remained in [the state of] the light of giving without the first three [of the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>], and the same applies to all of the higher levels (as stated in section 41 above, third paragraph). Thus, the sealing of the fiftieth gate causes the lack of the first three of the brains in all the levels, such that they contain only [the level] of the brains of the six extremities. You can thereby understand the statement of the Sages (<i>Nedarim</i> 38a) that all fifty gates of <i>Bina</i> were granted to Moses, apart from one. This is the mystical meaning of the lack of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the brains, as stated. These first three of the brains will illuminate in the levels only at the completion of the rectification.

Paragraph 44

<b>44. “Within those gates etc.”</b><br><b>Within those gates there is one lock, and one narrow place through which to insert that key. It is inscribed</b> and recognizable <b>only by the inscription of the key,</b> [meaning] that <b>it</b>, that narrow space, <b>is known through that key alone. And it is written with regard to this secret: <i>Bereshit bara Elohim</i></b> (“In the beginning [God] created,” [Genesis 1:1])<b>. <i>Bereshit</i> is the key in which everything is hidden, and it is that which closes and opens. Six gates are incorporated in that key, which closes and opens. When it closes those gates and incorporates them within itself, then it is certainly written: <i>Bereshit</i>, a revealed word within a sealed word, and in all places <i>Bara</i> is a sealed word,</b> which indicates that the key <b>closes and does not open.</b>
Explanation: The lower <i>heh</i> in the apertures of the eyes is called a “lock,” since it locks the lights of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] so that they cannot illuminate in the <i>partzuf</i>, as long as [the lower <i>heh</i>] is positioned above, in the apertures of the eyes. He states: <b>“Within those gates, there is one lock, and within that lock there is one narrow place,”</b> i.e., the <i>Yesod</i> in the lower <i>heh</i>, which is the forty-ninth gate of the vessels, as the lower <i>heh</i> itself is <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, the fiftieth gate, whereas <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is the forty-ninth gate, <b>“through which to insert that key.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This was explained more extensively in the previous two sections.</i> The “key” enters the <i>Yesod</i> of the lower <i>heh</i>, and it is the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of the brains<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Note the distinction of the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> and the <i>Yesod</i> of the brains. The latter is the key which unlocks the former.</i> that brings down the lower <i>heh</i> from the apertures of the eyes to the mouth, and the <i>partzuf</i> is opened to the lights of the first three. This is why the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> is called a “key.”
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] then states: <b>“It is inscribed only by the inscription of the key; it is known through that key alone.”</b> The “key” is the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of the brains, and it enters its corresponding aspect in the lower <i>heh</i>, which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated. The “lock,” which is the lower <i>heh</i>, is inscribed to hide and lock the first three <b>“only by the inscription of the key,”</b> which rules over the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> (<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>). However, [the key does not enter the lower <i>heh</i>] itself, the lower <i>heh</i> that rules over the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which are always regarded as a complete first three [<i>sefirot</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the fact that the lower <i>heh</i>, the <i>Malkhut</i>, does not repel the lights of the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> in its ascent to <i>Bina</i> in the second constriction. This is because the lights of the first three of <i>Bina</i> are the light of giving, not the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> Likewise, the “lock” is inscribed to open only by [the key of] <i>Yesod</i> of the brains.
The result is that <b>“it is known through that key alone.”</b> This “knowledge” means the drawing forth of brains, and he is saying that the brains were drawn forth only in the aspect of the “key,” i.e., in the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>. It is here that the “key” operates, the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>. However, in the place of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which are the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, where the “key” does not operate, but only the lower <i>heh</i> itself, they remain in a state of "unknown." This fully clarifies how despite the fact that with respect to the lower <i>heh</i> itself, <b>“it is unknown whether it is above or below,”</b> as stated above [section 43], nevertheless it is still enough to be known for the sake of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, since through [the "key"] there is an opening of the brains of the first three. In <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, there are only <i>yod</i>-<i>heh</i>-<i>vav</i> without <i>Malkhut</i>, and the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> serves as a partition instead of the <i>Malkhut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This was also explained in the preceding two sections. The <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> stands in for <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the lower <i>heh</i> that ascended to <i>Bina</i>.</i> The brains which bring down the lower <i>heh</i> from the apertures of the eyes to the mouth, also serve only in the partition of the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, because [there is no need for these brains in the partition of the lower <i>heh</i>], as there was no closing and deficiency of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] at all in the lower <i>heh</i> that would need to be opened. This [lack of deficiency in the first three is] because [the lower <i>heh</i>] operates in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), who always [possess] the [aspect of the] first three, as stated.
Since the entire concealment and closing occurred only in the aspect of the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, which operates in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the result is that only the coronet of <i>Yesod</i> of the brains is the “key” to bring down the lower <i>heh</i> from the eyes to the mouth, i.e., only in the delicate vessels, which are fashioned with the force of the partition of the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, like [those brains]. This is why he concludes that <b>“it is known through that key alone,”</b> meaning, the brains reach only the vessels of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> that emerge from the aspect of the “key,” [which is] the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>. [The brains do not reach] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which are from the aspect of the lower <i>heh</i>, <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, the essence of the lock.
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] continues: <b>“<i>Bereshit</i> is the key</b> etc.” That is, the word <i>Bereshit</i>, which is <i>Ḥokhma</i>, incorporates within itself only the aforementioned “key,” which is merely the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, the forty-ninth gate of the [the aspect of] vessels. It does not incorporate the fiftieth gate of the vessels, which is <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. He thus states: <b>“<i>Bereshit</i> is the key in which everything is hidden,”</b> i.e., everything is blocked with [the key] in the phase of immaturity. <b>“And it is that which closes and opens,”</b> as it closes all the brains in the phase of immaturity, while the lower <i>heh</i> is in the eyes, and opens [the brains] in the phase of maturity, to bring down the lower <i>heh</i> from the apertures of the eyes to the mouth. The ramification of this is that this is why the opening of <i>Ḥokhma</i> (which is alluded to in the word <i>Bereshit</i>) is only for the six extremities of the levels, which are of the aspect of the vessels <b>“of that key”</b> (as stated in section 41, above, third paragraph; see there). However, the brains of <i>Bereshit</i> do not illuminate for the first three of the <i>partzufim</i>, since their vessels are not from the aspect of the “key” but rather from the aspect of the lower <i>heh</i>, as stated.
Accordingly, [Rabbi Ḥiyya] states: <b>“Six gates are incorporated by that key, which closes and opens,”</b> as the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the brains are lacking from it, and it opens only the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of the brains, such that each of the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] only contains six extremities, and they are seven <i>partzufim</i> of six extremities. Thus, the “key,” i.e., the seventh <i>sefira</i>, the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>, contains within it only six gates. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Six gates are incorporated in that key, which closes and opens,”</b> indicating that it draws only [the aspect of] six extremities of brains.
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] then states: <b>“<i>Bereshit</i>, a revealed word within a sealed word, and in all places <i>Bara</i> is a sealed word.”</b> In other words, <i>Bereshit</i> represents <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is <b>“a revealed word,”</b> but when it states <i>Bereshit bara</i>, this means that the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is hidden and sealed. He says [that] <b>“<i>Bereshit</i></b> [is] <b>a revealed word within a sealed word”</b> because it is followed by the word <b><i>bara</i>, “and in all places <i>Bara</i> is a sealed word.”</b> Thus, <i>Bereshit bara</i> means that the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is sealed. The implication of <b>“closes and does not open,”</b> is that the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is closed and not yet opened.

Paragraph 45

<b>45. “Rabbi Yosei said etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Yosei said: That is certainly the case. And I heard from the Holy Luminary</b>, Rabbi Shimon, <b>that he said this, that <i>bara</i> (created) is a sealed word,</b> which shows that the key <b>closes and does not open. While</b> the key <b>closes with the word <i>bara</i>, there was no world and it did not exist, and emptiness covered everything. When that emptiness ruled, there was no world and it did not exist.</b>

Paragraph 46

<b>46. “When did that key etc.”</b><br><b>When did that key open the gates, and was made ready for use and to birth offspring?</b> It was <b>upon the arrival of Abraham,</b> who is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <b>as it is stated: “These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created [<i>behibare’am</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:4)<b>, and we learned:</b> Do not read <i>behibare’am</i>, but <b><i>be-Avraham</i></b> [“with Abraham”]<b>.</b> Then, <b>everything that was hidden in the word <i>bara</i>,</b> as stated, <b>the letters</b>, which are the vessels, <b>returned</b> and opened <b>to listen. The pillar that births offspring emerged, the organ</b> [<i>evar</i>] <b>of the holy foundation upon which the world stands</b>, as <i>bara</i> has the same letters as <i>evar</i><b>.</b>
Explanation: [Rabbi Yosei] asks: <b>“When did that key open the gates, and was made ready for use and to birth offspring?”</b> There are three aspects to this question: 1) <b>“Open the gates” –</b> referring to the descent of the lower <i>heh</i> from the apertures of the eyes to the mouth, at which point the forty-nine gates of the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> were opened, as stated above. 2) <b>“And was made ready for use” –</b> this refers to the enclothing of the [light of the brains of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the light of giving, since before the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is enclothed in the light of giving, the ears, nose, and mouth cannot receive the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, even though they have already combined with the <i>gulgalta</i> and eyes into a single level (as stated in section 16, above).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Once the <i>heh</i> descends, the lower vessels of ears, nose and mouth return to their original level, rejoining the <i>gulgalta</i> and eyes.</i> Without the enclothing of the light of giving, <b><i>Mi</i></b> cannot illuminate in <b><i>eleh</i></b>, and <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>] remains sealed in the name; see there.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As is explained in section 16, the first two vessels of <i>gulgalta</i> and eyes are symbolized by the letters <i>mem-yod</i>, spelling <i>Mi</i>, and the lower three vessels are symbolized by <i>aleph-lamed-heh</i>, spelling <i>eleh</i>. The lights of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the brains, cannot illuminate the lower vessels without the enclothing of the light of giving.</i> Thus, [in such a state, ] the brains are not yet fit for use in the lower level. 3) <b>“And to birth offspring”</b> – meaning the birthing of souls, because after the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> receives these brains in their complete state it pairs with the <i>Nukba</i> and births the souls of the righteous.
[Rabbi Yosei] answers: <b>“Upon the arrival of Abraham,</b> etc. <b>everything that was hidden in the word <i>bara</i>, the letters returned to listen.”</b> Abraham is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥesed</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> of maturity, when the <i>Ḥesed</i> becomes <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Shemot</i>, 249). Before Abraham arrived, everything was sealed in the word <b><i>bara</i></b>, and emptiness ruled over the world, [the "world" referring to] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. At that stage, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> did not have either [the light of giving] or <i>Ḥokhma</i>. But <b>“upon the arrival of Abraham,”</b> who is the light of <i>Ḥesed</i> that is bestowed upon <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, the gates opened with the <i>shefa</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. The lower <i>heh</i> descended from the eyes to the mouth, and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> joined with <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> into a single level, and the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the lights, which are the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, were drawn to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These lights refer to the brains attained by <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> in this phase.</i> Since <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> already had the light of giving from the aspect of <b>Abraham</b>, the lights of <i>Ḥokhma</i> were enclothed in the light of giving, and then <b>the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>] <b>joined with <i>mem-yod</i></b> [<i>Mi</i>] <b>and the name <i>Elohim</i> was complete</b>, and the brains were enclothed in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Upon the arrival of Abraham,</b> etc. <b>the letters returned to listen.”</b> The brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> were drawn into the light of giving and were enclothed in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. <b>“The pillar that births offspring emerged” –</b> since then the lower <i>heh</i> descended from the apertures of the eyes of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to the mouth [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], and [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] too attained [the aspects of] <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Nukba</i>, which [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] had lacked. They are called, with respect to [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], “new <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>,” with <i>Yesod</i> of [the phase of] maturity called <b>“the organ of the holy foundation upon which the world stands.”</b> It is through this organ that [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] transmits to the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called “the lower world,” and [through this <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] gives birth to the souls of the righteous. This is [what occurs] in general terms. However, the detailed [description of the] order of the drawing forth of the brains will be explained afterward.

Paragraph 47

<b>47. “When this <i>evar</i> etc.”</b><br><b>When this <i>evar</i></b> [organ] <b>was inscribed with the word <i>bara</i>, then the supernal Hidden One inscribed another inscription in His name and for His honor. This is <i>Mi</i>, and He created <i>eleh</i>. Also, the holy, blessed name, which is <i>Ma</i>, was inscribed and brought out <i>evar</i> from <i>bara</i>. It is inscribed in <i>eleh</i> on one side and in <i>evar</i> on the other side. The hidden holy one, <i>eleh</i>, exists,</b> and <b><i>evar</i> exists. When one is completed, the other is</b> [also] <b>completed. He engraved</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> for this <i>evar</i> and engraved</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i> for this <i>eleh</i>.</b>
Explanation: [Rabbi Yosei] now explains in detail the concept of the brains of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which he had earlier depicted in general terms. He states that <b>“when this <i>evar</i> was inscribed in the word <i>bara</i>, [then] the supernal Hidden One inscribed another inscription,”</b> which is <b><i>Mi</i></b>. The meaning is that <b><i>evar</i></b> is the <i>Yesod</i> and coronet<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <i>evar</i> is commonly used to refer to the male reproductive organ, an organ which corresponds to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Yesod</i>. The coronet here refers to the spiritual area of <i>Yesod</i> corresponding to the glans component of the male reproductive organ.</i> [of <i>Yesod</i>] while <b><i>bara</i></b> indicates the blocking of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] due to the force of the ascent of the lower <i>heh</i> to the aperture of the eyes, as stated above. [Rabbi Yosei] says that this coronet of the <b>“<i>evar</i> was inscribed”</b> with the lower <i>heh</i> that is in the aperture of the eyes. This is as Rabbi Ḥiyya said above [section 44], <b>that this “lock,”</b> which is the lower <i>heh</i>, <b>is inscribed by the inscription of the “key,”</b> which is the coronet of <i>Yesod</i>; see there. This <b>supernal hidden one,</b> which is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, which are inscribed with the lower <i>heh</i>, now made <b>“another inscription”</b> in this <b>“lock”</b> of theirs, i.e., the inscription of <b>the “key,”</b> which is the coronet of this <b><i>evar</i></b>. It is then called <b>“<i>Mi</i>, which is ready for a question,”</b> that is, fit to receive feminine waters and to bring down the lower <i>heh</i> from the eyes, and to raise up the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>], which are the ears, nose, and mouth, with which the first three of lights are drawn. This is not the case before the lower <i>heh</i> is inscribed in the inscription of <b><i>evar</i></b> – there was no possibility of drawing forth the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], since the lower <i>heh</i> itself is the mystical meaning of the fiftieth gate, which is not opened [to allow] the first three, as stated. Therefore, before there is an inscribing in this <b>key of <i>evar</i>,</b> [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are not called <i>Mi</i>, as it is not ready for a question.
[Rabbi Yosei] thus states: <b>“When this <i>evar</i> was inscribed in the word <i>bara</i>”</b> – when the lower <i>heh</i> in the word <b><i>bara</i></b> received the inscription of <b><i>evar</i></b>, which is <b>the “key,” “then the supernal Hidden One inscribed another inscription in His name and for His honor; this is <i>Mi</i>.”</b> Then <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother) inscribed <b>the “key,”</b> in the lower <i>heh</i> that is in the aperture of their eyes, so that it should be fit to be called <b>“<i>Mi</i>, who is ready for a question,”</b> and to draw forth the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], as stated. The brains are drawn only <b>by the inscription of this key.</b> 
This is the meaning of the statement” <b>“And He created <i>eleh</i>.”</b> That is, after the lock in the word <b><i>bara</i></b> was inscribed with <b>the inscription of the key</b>, which is the <b><i>evar</i></b>, and was fashioned in the mystical meaning of <b><i>Mi</i></b>, as stated, then <b>“<i>Mi</i> has created [<i>bara</i>] these.”</b> Meaning, the lower <i>heh</i> descended from the aperture of the eyes to the mouth, and [this] raised the ears, nose, and mouth, which are the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>], to the head, and the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] were drawn, as stated. When [the <i>Zohar</i>] states that <b>“He created <i>eleh</i>,”</b> it is a language of sealing because these do not yet possess the light of giving, which means that these letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> that ascended are still <b>sealed in the name</b> (as stated in section 14 above, sixth paragraph), and they cannot reveal themselves without the [enclothing of] the garment of the light of giving.
[Rabbi Yosei] continues: <b>“Also, the holy, blessed name, which is <i>Ma</i>, was inscribed and it brought out <i>evar</i> from <i>bara</i>.”</b> The <i>Malkhut</i> [which is the lower <i>heh</i>] that descended from the eyes to the mouth is called <b><i>Ma</i></b>, for the lower world is called <b><i>Ma</i></b> (as stated in section 8, above; see there). This partition that was previously in the aperture of the eyes now descends to the mouth and a fusion through collision transpired upon [this partition] and brought forth a height of the [light of giving], which is the light of blessing (as stated in section 14, seventh paragraph). This [process] extracted the sealed aspect of the word <b><i>bara</i></b> and formed it into <b><i>evar</i></b>, which is the <i>Yesod</i> that bestows [the light of giving] (<i>ḥassadim</i>). He therefore states that <b>“also, the holy, blessed name, which is <i>Ma</i>, was inscribed and it brought out <i>ever</i> from <i>bara</i>.”</b> The light of giving was still lacking for the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b>, in which they could be enclothed, and consequently <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> were still <b>sealed in the name</b>. Through the light of blessing of <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> the sealed aspect of <b><i>bara</i></b> was opened and it became an <b><i>evar</i></b> [organ] that transmits.
[Rabbi Yosei] continues: <b>“It is inscribed in <i>eleh</i> on one side and in <i>evar</i> on the other side.”</b> That is, two aspects can now be discerned in [these letters], one opposite the other. For <b><i>eleh</i></b>, which are the ears, nose, and mouth, with the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which still lack the light of giving, are on one side, and <b><i>evar</i></b>, which is the <i>Yesod</i> that received the height of the light of giving from the <b><i>Ma</i></b>, stands opposite it on the other side, without <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is the meaning of his statement: <b>“The hidden holy one, <i>eleh</i>, exists,</b> and <b><i>evar</i> exists.”</b> The <b><i>eleh</i></b> that attained the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is called <b>“holy,”</b> exists in a sealed state in the <i>partzuf</i> on this side, while opposite it stands <b><i>evar</i></b>, with a height of the [light of giving] in the <i>partzuf</i>. He thus says: <b>“When one is completed, the other is completed,”</b> since both of them emerged as a result of the descent of the lower <i>heh</i> from the aperture of the eyes to the mouth. The <b><i>evar</i></b> emerged through the power of the <b><i>Ma</i></b> in the mouth, and similarly the <b><i>eleh</i></b>, which are the ears, nose, and mouth, rose upwards through the power of the arrival of the <i>Malkhut</i> to below them, to the mouth. As a result, <b>“when one is completed, the other is completed,”</b> since they arrive simultaneously.
<b>“He engraved</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> for this <i>evar</i>, and engraved</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i> for this <i>eleh</i>.”</b> <i>Heh</i> refers to the partition that brings forth only the height of the [light of giving] without <i>Ḥokhma</i> – since [the <i>heh</i>] is an embodiment of <i>Malkhut</i> that is unfit to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>, but only the light of giving – while <i>yod</i> refers to the partition of the male, which is fit to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is the meaning of: <b>“He engraved <i>heh</i> for this <i>evar</i>,”</b> i.e., with the partition <b><i>Ma</i></b> that draws forth only the light of giving, without <i>Ḥokhma</i>; <b>“and engraved <i>yod</i> for this <i>eleh</i>,”</b> that is, with the partition of the male, which draws forth <i>Ḥokhma</i>, but not the [light of giving].

Paragraph 48

<b>48. “When the letters awakened to complete etc.”</b><br>[Rabbi Yosei] elaborates: <b>When the letters</b>, <i>alef-bet-resh</i> [<i>evar</i>] and <i>heh</i>, and the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [<i>eleh</i>] and <i>yod</i>, <b>awakened to be completed on this side and the other side, then</b> the letter <b>final <i>mem</i> emerged. One took</b> the final <i>mem</i> <b>to this side,</b> i.e., to the side of the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh-yod</i>, <b>and</b> the other <b>one took</b> the final <i>mem</i> <b>to that side,</b> to the side of the letters <i>alef-bet-resh-heh</i>, <b>and the holy name was completed and</b> the combination <b>formed <i>Elohim</i></b> [<i>alef- lamed-heh-yod-</i>final <i>mem</i>]<b>, and the name Abraham</b> [<i>alef-bet-resh-heh-</i>final <i>mem</i>] <b>was also</b> completed<b>.</b> This is the meaning of the earlier statement: <b>“When one is completed, the other is completed.” Some say that the Holy One, blessed be He, took</b> the letters <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> [<i>Mi</i>] <b>and inserted them in</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>], <b>and</b> the combination <b>formed <i>Elohim</i>, and the Holy One, blessed be He, took</b> the letters <b><i>mem-heh</i></b> [<i>Ma</i>] <b>and inserted them in</b> the letters <b><i>alef-bet-resh</i></b> [<i>evar</i>], <b>and</b> the combination <b>formed Abraham. The word <i>Mi</i> alludes to the fifty gates of <i>Bina</i></b> [Understanding]<b>, and</b> the word <b><i>Mi</i> contains</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i>,</b> which is <b>the first letter of the holy name. The word <i>Ma</i> alludes to the number of the holy name,</b> since <i>Havaya</i>, when it is “filled” and has the letters <i>alef</i> [i.e., each of its letters is spelled out, with each <i>heh</i> ending with an <i>alef</i>, and the <i>vav</i> has an <i>alef</i> in the middle], has the numerical value of 45 [<i>ma</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem</i> has the numerical value of 40, and <i>heh</i> is equal to 5.</i> <b>And</b> the word <i>Ma</i> <b>contains the second letter of the holy name <i>Havaya</i></b>, which is the letter <i>heh</i><b>. This is as it is stated: “Happy is the people that is in such a state;</b> [happy is the people] whose God is <i>Havaya</i>” (Psalms 144:15), and it is stated: <b>“He hangs the earth over nothing</b> [<i>beli ma</i>]<b>”</b> (Job 26:7), which alludes to the numerical value of <i>Havaya</i>, when it is “filled” and has the letters <i>alef</i>, i.e., 45<b>. Two worlds then exist; the World-to-Come with <i>yod</i>, and this world with <i>heh</i> (that is, He created the World-to-Come with <i>Mi</i>, and this world with <i>Ma</i>, and this alludes to above and below). Then He made offspring, and the name emerged complete, which was not the case previously. This is the meaning of the verse: “These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created [<i>behibare’am</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:4), which has the letters of BeAbraham [<i>bet-alef-bet-resh-heh-</i>final <i>mem</i>, meaning "with Abraham"]<b>. All</b> the offspring <b>were hanging</b> in an imperfect state <b>until the name of Abraham was created. When this name of Abraham was completed, the holy name was completed. This is the meaning of the verse: “On the day that <i>Havaya</i>, God, made earth and heaven”</b> (Genesis 2:4). [The phrase] “on the day He made” means on the day they were completed, through the name Abraham, and at this stage the name <i>Havaya</i> appears, as this name of <i>Havaya</i> had not previously been mentioned in the Torah.
Explanation: These two heights, the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in <b><i>eleh</i></b>, and the light of giving in <b><i>Ma</i></b>, were awakened to complete each other, that is, to be enclothed in one another. Once the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is enclothed in the light of giving, <b>“he then brought out</b> the letter <b>final <i>mem</i>,”</b> i.e., the <i>Malkhut</i> that receives from these two levels together.
[Rabbi Yosei] continues: <b>“One was taken to this side, and one to that side; the holy name was completed and formed <i>Elohim</i>, and the name Abraham was also</b> completed<b>.”</b> The meaning is as was explained before, <b>“He engraved</b> the letter <b><i>yod</i> for this <i>eleh</i>,”</b> and therefore there are now four letters – <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh-yod</i></b> – and likewise <b>“He engraved</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i> for this <i>evar</i>,”</b> such that there are now four letters there – <b><i>alef-bet-resh-heh</i></b>. The result is as follows: First, the letters completed one another, i.e., the two levels, [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> and the light of giving, were enclothed in one another, and this brought out the <b>final <i>mem</i></b>, which is the <i>Malkhut</i> that receives from them all, as stated. Subsequently, <b>one</b> [name] <b>took</b> that final <i>mem</i> <b>to its side, and</b> the other <b>one took</b> the final <i>mem</i> <b>to its side</b>. <b>“One took</b> the final <i>mem</i> <b>to its side,”</b> as the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh-yod</i> took the <b>final <i>mem</i></b>, [and] <b>the holy name was completed and</b> the combination <b>formed <i>Elohim</i>.</b> Similarly, the letters <b><i>alef-bet-resh-heh</i></b> took the <b>final <i>mem</i> and the name Abraham was also</b> completed.
<b>“Some say that the Holy One, blessed be He, took</b> the letters <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> [<i>Mi</i>].” From here until the words “alludes to above and below,” in parenthesis, is not part of the <i>Zohar</i>. 
<b>“When this name of Abraham was completed, the holy name was completed...</b>” since these [two names] are two heights, [one] of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> and [one of] the light of giving which need each other, as stated. Therefore, <b>the holy name</b> was not completed before <b>the name of Abraham</b> was completed.

Paragraph 49

<b>49. “Rabbi Ḥiyya prostrated etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Ḥiyya prostrated himself on the ground, kissed the dust, and wept, declaring: “Dust, dust! How stubborn you are! How impudent! For everything that the eye covets will wither in you; all the pillars of light in the world, you will consume and grind. How impudent you are – the holy luminary that was illuminating the world, the great ruler, the one appointed</b> over the world<b>, whose merit sustains the world, is withering in you: Rabbi Shimon, the light of the luminary, the light of the worlds, you wither in the dust, and</b> [yet] <b>you exist and lead the world.” He was silent for a moment and</b> [then] <b>said: “Dust, dust, do not be proud, for the pillars of the world will not be handed over to you, since Rabbi Shimon is not withering in you.”</b>
We must thoroughly understand the meaning of this prostration on the part of Rabbi Ḥiyya. The meaning is that you will find in the section dealing with Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yosei [section 41] that their main focus as they were walking along the way together was <b>on that sealed gate,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the preceding sections for a more extensive discussion of this fiftieth gate.</i> [This <i>Malkhut</i>] receives nothing from all those higher brains [that manifest] in the six thousand years before the completion of the rectification, as is comprehensively explained in the section of Rabbi Ḥiyya. Rabbi Yosei replied to him in the name of Rabbi Shimon that <b>“this is certainly the case”</b> that this gate remains sealed, and the wholeness [that is achieved with these higher brains] is only in the “key,” as stated. This is what distressed them so greatly, until Rabbi Ḥiyya arrived at a great awakening and <b>“prostrated himself on the ground, kissed the dust, and wept, declaring: “Dust, dust! How stubborn you are</b> etc.<b>”</b>
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] then says: <b>“For everything that the eye covets will wither in you.”</b> On account of the sin of the first man, all the souls, which encompass all the souls in the world, were detached from him and were taken captive to the <i>kelippot</i>. Through his repentance, Adam the first [man] rectified only his own individual [soul], and even that not completely. After him, the souls are distilled each generation through repentance and good deeds until the completion of the rectification. Thus, all those lofty souls of [the level of] <i>yeḥida</i> and [of the level of] the first three of <i>ḥaya</i> depend upon [the process of] distilling and fusion through collision, upon the [sealed level of] <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the sealed gate that has neither distillation nor fusion, as stated. Accordingly, all those souls wither in the dust, which is the <i>kelippot</i>, and this is the mystical meaning of the verse: “The tears of the oppressed, who have no comforter” (Ecclesiastes 4:1). The <i>kelippa</i> of the dust rules over them with impudence and stubbornness, as she is confident in her strength, that there is no one who can save them from her hand. This is why Rabbi Ḥiyya wept, and said to the dust, which is the <i>kelippot</i>: <b>“How stubborn you are! How impudent! For everything that the eye covets will wither in you.”</b> All those highest of souls, which are <b>coveted by the eyes,</b> rot in you, without hope of deliverance from your hand.
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] proceeds: <b>“All the pillars of light in the world, you will consume and grind.”</b> That is, all the righteous of the world, who illuminate the world, are also deficient from [reaching] their completeness on account of the captivity of these lofty souls, since all the souls are incorporated in one another.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Souls are not physical "things." One of the properties of souls is that they are all part of each other, like different facets of one totality. Thus, these righteous individuals are impacted by the limitations of the progress of souls during this phase of the 6000 years.</i> Thus, these [righteous ones] are also consumed and ground through the strength of the impudence of this dust.
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] continues: <b>“The holy luminary</b> etc. <b>Rabbi Shimon is not withering in you”</b> He initially wanted to say that Rabbi Shimon is also withering in this dust, because he heard from Rabbi Yosei that he too agrees that this gate is sealed and may not be revealed. But he subsequently wondered and said, “<b>Rabbi Shimon, the light of the luminary,</b> etc. <b>and you exist and lead the world.”</b> In other words, since he sustains and leads all the worlds, how is it possible for him not to be whole in his full completeness?” After that, <b>“he was silent for a moment,”</b> i.e., he thought the matter over and stated decisively that <b>“Rabbi Shimon is not withering in you,”</b> since he is certainly in a state of complete wholeness, only that he could not comprehend how that could be.

Paragraph 50

<b>50. “Rabbi Ḥiyya arose etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Ḥiyya arose and was walking and crying, and Rabbi Yosei with him. He fasted forty days from that day,</b> [in order] <b>to see Rabbi Shimon. He was informed: “You are unworthy of seeing him.” He wept and fasted forty more days. He was shown in a vision Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Elazar, his son, engaged in this matter that Rabbi Yosei said in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> (section 45, above)<b>, and several thousands were listening to his words.</b>
Explanation: In his distress for the beauty that withers in the dust, as described above, he yearned to see Rabbi Shimon’s level, because he had already decided that Rabbi Shimon is not withering in the dust. <b>“In this matter that Rabbi Yosei said,”</b> i.e., the above statement that Rabbi Yosei said to Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Shimon, which led to this whole awakening.

Paragraph 51

<b>51. “In the meantime, he saw several etc.”</b><br><b>In the meantime, he saw several large and lofty wings, and Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Elazar his son climbed onto them, ascending to the academy of the firmament. All those wings were waiting for them. He saw that</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Elazar <b>returned and were renewed in their brightness and illuminated more than the light of the brightness of the sun.</b>
Explanation: <b>“The academy of the firmament”</b> means the seminary of <b>Metatron</b>, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> that the higher academy is the academy of the Holy One, blessed be He, while the academy of the firmament is the seminary of Metatron (see <i>Zohar Ḥadash</i>, <i>Yitro</i>, 36a; in <i>Zohar Ḥadash</i> with the commentary of the <i>Sulam</i>, it is <i>Yitro</i>, 255).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“All those wings were waiting for them.”</b> “Wings” are the angels that help the souls, in raising them from one level to the next. Just as the soul requires the assistance of the wings for the ascension, [the soul] likewise needs their assistance to return to its place. This is the meaning of the statement here, that the <b>“wings were waiting for them,”</b> to bring them back.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He saw that they returned and were renewed in their brightness</b> etc.<b>”</b> He saw them returning from the academy of the firmament to their place, i.e., to Rabbi Shimon’s academy, and they were renewed in the brightness of the light of their faces, and they illuminated more than the light of the sun.

Paragraph 52

<b>52. “Rabbi Shimon opened etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “Let Rabbi Ḥiyya enter and see how much the Holy One, blessed be He, will renew the faces of the righteous in the next world. Happy is he who comes here without shame, and happy is he who stands in that world like a pillar that is strong in everything.”</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>saw himself entering, and Rabbi Elazar arose,</b> as did <b>the rest of the pillars of the world who were sitting there:</b> They arose before Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>and</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>was ashamed</b> and entered<b>. He lowered himself and sat at Rabbi Shimon’s feet.</b>
Explanation: Rabbi Shimon hinted to him: <b>“Happy is he who comes here without shame.”</b> He also saw <b>Rabbi Elazar and the rest of the pillars of the world, that they were without shame</b>. However, he himself was in a state of shame, because of [the issue of] that beauty that withers in the dust, and which he did not have the strength to overcome, as stated.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This issue is discussed in section 53. It is a theme of these sections of the <i>Zohar</i>.</i> He thus states: “He was ashamed and lowered himself etc.”

Paragraph 53

<b>53. “A voice sounded out etc.”</b><br><b>A voice sounded out and declared: “Lower your eyes, do not raise your head, and do not stare.” He lowered his eyes and saw a light that was shining from afar. The voice returned as before and proclaimed: “Hidden and sealed lofty ones, the open-eyed, who roam through the entire world, look and see. Sleeping lower ones, whose light of the eyes is sealed in the sockets</b> of your eyes<b>, awaken.”</b>
<b>“The voice returned as before.”</b> That is, after he had obeyed by lowering his eyes and not raising his head, he merited to hear this declaration, through which he obtained all that he had sought, as explained below.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Hidden and sealed lofty ones, the open-eyed, who roam through the entire world, look and see. Sleeping lower ones, whose light of the eyes is sealed in your sockets, awaken.”</b> The declaration awakened those souls that had obeyed the words of Rabbi Shimon, both those who were there and those who were not there. There were two groups, as explained below.
That which [the <i>Zohar</i>] stated: <b>“Hidden [and sealed] lofty ones... look and see. Sleeping lower ones,</b> etc. <b>awaken.”</b> The declaration went out to all the souls of the righteous and divided them into two groups: One group is the holy lofty ones, who are “hidden and sealed,” and who merited the opening of their eyes, and to roam the entire world. To them, [the declaration] called upon them to look and to see, i.e., to draw forth the supernal lights. This is [meant to be done] together with the second group, which is all those camps that go and are roaming after the Holy One, blessed be He, and from His Presence, and they depart from His Presence,. They are called <b>“sleeping lower ones, whose light of the eyes is sealed in your sockets,”</b> as they are asleep and the light of their eyes is sealed in the sockets of their eyes. He called upon these ones to awaken.

Paragraph 54

<b>54. “Which of you etc.”</b><br><b>Which of you has transformed darkness into light, and the bitter tastes sweet to him, even before he comes here</b>, i.e., while he is still alive in this world. <b>Who among you awaits the light each day, which shines when the King visits the doe,</b> at which point the glory of the King <b>is magnified and He is called the King over all the kings of the world. One who does not await this each day</b> while he is still <b>in that world,</b> i.e., in this world, <b>has no portion here.</b>
Explanation: The declaration underscores for each group the main desired quality for each of them: Regarding the quality of the first class, he says: <b>“Which of you has transformed darkness into light, and the bitter tastes sweet to him?”</b> These are the souls of <i>Atzilut</i>. In <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, “God made one thing corresponding to the other” [Ecclesiastes 7:14] – darkness opposite light, and bitter opposite sweet. Consequently, in the Torah of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, there [are categories of] kosher and disqualified, ritually impure and pure, forbidden and permitted, holy and secular. That is not the case in the Torah of <i>Atzilut</i>; there, the entire Torah is the names of the Holy One, blessed be He, and there is nothing secular there, God forbid. There, [the words] Laban the Aramean are considered a holy name, as is Pharaoh. All the names, that are <i>kelippot</i> and impurity in <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> are only holy, sublime, names [in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>]. Thus, these souls that have merited the light of <i>Atzilut</i> transform every darkness to light and every bitter into sweet.
With regard to the quality of the second group, he says: <b>“Who among you awaits the light each day, which shines when the King visits the doe,</b> etc. <b>One who does not await this each day in that world has no portion here.”</b> This is referring to those who seek after the Divine Presence that sits alone, and who always await for the Holy One, blessed be He, to raise the Divine Presence from the dust. But others, apart from them, have <b>“no portion here.”</b>

Paragraph 55

<b>55. “In the meantime, he saw several etc.”</b><br><b>In the meantime, he saw many of the colleagues around all the upright pillars, and he saw that they were being raised to the academy of the firmament. Some were ascending while others were descending. Above them all, he saw the winged one</b>, who is Metatron, <b>approaching.</b>
Explanation: While the announcer was calling, [Rabbi Ḥiyya] saw several of the souls of the righteous that belonged to those two aforementioned groups, around <b>“all the upright pillars.”</b> These were the souls of the righteous who were already in <b>Rabbi Shimon’s academy</b>. He saw them ascending to the academy of the firmament. <b>“Some were ascending while others were descending,”</b> as the first group ascended and the second group descended. This is the meaning of the statement: “<b>“Some were ascending while others were descending,”</b> as this is how they help one another, in accordance with the call of the announcer, who said to the first group, <b>“look and see,”</b> while to the second group he said: <b>“Awaken.”</b> 
[Rabbi Ḥiyya] saw that through the awakening of all these souls, that is, through the strength of both groups together, Metatron descended from this academy to Rabbi Shimon’s academy and swore the oath cited below. Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“Above them all he saw the winged one approaching, and he swore an oath”</b> [section 56, below], since <b>“above them all”</b> has the same meaning as “through the strength of them all.” The <b>“winged one”</b> is Metatron.

Paragraph 56

<b>56. “And he swore an oath etc.”</b><br><b>And he</b>, the angel Metatron, <b>swore an oath, that he had heard behind the partition that the King recalls every day and remembers the doe lying in the dust. At that hour, He kicks 390 firmaments, and all are startled and frightened of Him. And</b> the King <b>sheds tears over this</b>, that the Divine Presence is in the dust<b>. And the tears, boiling like fire, fall into the great sea. By the power of those tears, that one appointee over the sea</b>, who is called Rahab, <b>stands and is sustained, and sanctifies the name of the holy King. He accepts upon himself to swallow all the waters of <i>Bereshit</i> and gather them within himself when all the nations will assemble against the holy nation and the waters will dry up and they will pass through dry land.</b>
Explanation: He swore an oath that the King recalls and remembers every day <b>“the doe lying in the dust,”</b> which is the holy Divine Presence. This is not referring to the entirety of the holy Divine Presence, as [Metatron] would not need to swear an oath over that, as that is clear to all. Rather, the reference is to <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which Rabbi Ḥiyya thought was captive among the <i>kelippot</i> and had been completely abandoned, and thus <b>“he wept, declaring: “Dust, dust</b> etc. <b>for everything that the eye covets will wither in you</b> etc.” [section 49]. For this reason, she is called <b>“a doe lying in the dust.”</b> Here this great secret was revealed to Rabbi Ḥiyya through Metatron, who came to the academy of Rabbi Shimon, that <b>“the King visits every day and remembers the doe lying in the dust,”</b> but in the manner that Metatron proceeds to explain to us.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“At that hour, He kicks 390 firmaments,</b> etc.” The fusion through collision of the supernal light on the partition is considered like the supernal light <b>kicking</b> the partition, that is, the supernal light kicks and wishes to permeate below the boundary of the partition. But the partition blocks it and rebuffs the supernal light. This rebuffing is the mystical meaning of the returning light that ascends from the partition, from below to above, and enclothes the supernal light. This matter has already been thoroughly clarified (in the <i>Introduction to the Wisdom of the Kabbalah</i>, p. 4, section 14; see there in detail).
The concept of the <b>“390 firmaments”</b> is that the partition is called a dividing firmament, and it incorporates four levels, which are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, which are the four letters of <i>Havaya</i> [<i>heh-vav-yod-heh</i>]. Since the <i>Malkhut</i> was tempered by <i>Bina</i>, the partition has [aspects of] <i>Bina</i>, as stated, and the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Bina</i> is alluded to as hundreds, as is known. Thus, those four levels in the partition, of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> add up to four hundred. However, it was explained above that there is no fusion through collision on the [level of] <i>Malkhut</i> of the bottom <i>heh</i>, since [that level] is the mystical meaning of the sealed gate. Consequently, the one hundred of the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the bottom <i>heh</i>, is considered to lack the ten of the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> there, and it contains only the first nine, which add up to ninety. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The four levels making up the partition, as explained at the beginning of this section, are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>. The partition always rests upon the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, but when <i>Malkhut</i> ascends to <i>Bina</i> in the second constriction, the partition is there as well. The four aspects of the partition are now described as counted as "hundreds, " as that is a characteristic of the level of <i>Bina</i>. This should equal a count of four hundred, since there are four aspects. However, the bottom level of the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, the tenth level of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, cannot enter the "kicking" of the fusion through collision, as it is "sealed away. " Recall that each <i>sefira</i> is made up of all ten <i>sefirot</i>, so <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> refers to the tenth aspect (<i>Malkhut</i>) of the fourth aspect (<i>Malkhut</i>).</i> This is the allusion, that the partition which is called “firmament”, upon which the supernal light engages in a fusion through collision, which is a “kick,” there are not four hundred there, but rather 390, with ten missing, <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. Therefore, the firmament is called “390 firmaments.” This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“He kicks 390 firmaments”</b> every day, at the time of the fusion through collision with the Divine Presence. This is to the exclusion of <b>“the doe lying in the dust,”</b> who is not involved in that fusion through collision, as she is the mystical meaning of the ten who are lacking from the four hundred.
<b>“And all are startled and frightened of Him.”</b> The mystical meaning of the impact of the partition upon the supernal light lies in the mystical meaning of "startling and fright, "<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is a phrase commonly used in Torah literature to describe two types of fear with which one must receive the divine presence.</i> that is, the fear that [the level] might receive more than its capacity.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And</b> the King <b>sheds tears over this.”</b> The brains of the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i> are called eyes, since the five <i>sefirot</i> of the head are called <i>gulgalta</i>, eyes, and ears, nose, and mouth. Just as those drops that the eyes emit are called “tears,” so too these drops that the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i> emits are called “tears.” The meaning of this emission of tears is, as explained just earlier (third paragraph), with regard to the mystical meaning of the fusion through collision. The supernal light that is drawn to the lower [level] and hits the partition, kicks and strikes [the partition], that is, it wants to continue to below the boundary in the partition. However, the partition immediately prevails over [the supernal light] and rebuffs it, as [the partition] does not let [the supernal light] cross its border; see there.
However, in the meantime, that is, before the partition rebuffed [the supernal light], very small drops from the supernal light were necessarily drawn below the boundary of the partition, as for all the speed of the partition, it did not manage to rebuff them from itself upward. You should know that these drops cannot be incorporated in the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that emerged in the lower level, <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The supernal light of the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i> flows "downward" and then impacts the partition. A few "droplets" of this light manage to make it across to the level below. The rest of the column of supernal light is first enclothed in the returning light, which then allows it to become the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i> for the level below. The droplets that preceded it to the level below, however, cannot join this enclothed column, because they are not similarly enclothed in the returning light.</i> since they are without the enclothing of returning light, and they are emitted and exit the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. These [emissions] are called “tears.”
This is the mystical meaning of the [phenomenon that] when a corporeal person is filled with compassion and love for his friend, he sheds tears from his eyes, as this is drawn from the aforementioned root of the spiritual tears. Anything spiritual that occurs in the higher [realms] impacts and creates a branch in the corporeal creatures, as is known. The fact that the supernal light kicks and strikes upon the partition, to breach its boundary, that is because the supernal light is constantly drawn from <i>Ein Sof</i>, blessed be He, which is above the world of constriction, where no boundary can be discerned, God forbid.
Since the supernal light yearns and longs to spread, in the manner that the Sages said: “The Holy One, blessed be He, yearned to dwell in the lower realms,” and likewise that the [dwelling of the] Divine Presence in the lower realms is a need of the Most High, [the supernal light] therefore kicks and strikes on the boundary of the partition, [trying] to be drawn below its boundary. The partition rebuffs [the supernal light] as returning light, and at the same time, tears are emitted, as stated. Thus, these tears are expressed due to compassion and love for the lower realm. Therefore, in the corporeal branch as well, tears are always emitted when a person is moved by love and compassion for his friend. However, spiritual tears do not disappear like corporeal ones, as explained below.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And the tears, boiling like fire, fall into the great sea.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “For love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave; its flashes are flashes of fire, a flame of the Lord” (Song of Songs 8:6). As explained, these tears are the result of the compassion and love of the supernal light toward the lower realm. Just as you find in the corporeal branch, [that] when a person is filled with love and compassion for his friend, the tears are boiling, in accordance with the measure of his feelings for him, the same applies to these tears – they are as scorching as fire, in the mystical meaning of “its flashes are flashes of fire, a flame of the Lord.” This is the meaning of <b>“tears, boiling like fire, fall into the great sea.”</b> The attribute of <i>Malkhut</i> from the frame of reference of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called “the great sea,” since great waters are drawn from it, “mighty breakers of the sea” [Psalms 93:4].
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“By the power of those tears, that one appointee over the sea stands and is sustained.”</b> This is referring to that ministering angel of the sea who was killed at the time of the creation of the world. This is as the Sages said (<i>Bava Batra</i> 74b) on the verse: “And by His understanding He smites Rahab” [Job 26:12], that when he was instructed: “Let the waters be gathered together to one place” (Genesis 1:9), he did not want to swallow the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>. It [thus] states that he <b>“stands and is sustained”</b> on those tears that fall into <b>“the great sea,”</b> as he is revived through them.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And he sanctifies the name of the holy King, and he accepts upon himself to swallow all the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>.”</b> At the time of the creation of the world, no rectification reached <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, since the Emanator rectified the worlds of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> with the mystical meaning of the feminine waters of <i>Bina</i>, not the feminine waters of <i>Malkhut</i>. This was enough only for the first nine [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Malkhut</i>, but not for <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated above.
This is the mystical meaning of the Sages’ comment on the verse: “You are My people” (Isaiah 51:16) – “you are My people in partnership; I started the worlds, and you finish them.” The entire rectification of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is solely the responsibility of the lower [beings]. Accordingly, when it was said to the ministering angel of the sea: “Let the waters be gathered together to one place,” he refused and did not want to swallow all the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>, because the <i>kelippot</i> would have overcome him due to the lack of rectification of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. For this reason he was killed. However, these aforementioned tears are the ones that purify and rectify the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is why they vitalize the ministering angel of the sea, so that he can stand and <b>sanctify the name of the holy King</b>, that is, to observe his Master’s command and <b>“swallow all the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>.”</b> Then all the <i>kelippot</i> in the world, and all the evil powers, will be nullified and they will all be gathered to one place, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Atzilut</i>. The world of <i>Atzilut</i> will expand, equal to the legs of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, [reaching] until this world. This will be the completion of the rectification because <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> will return to being <i>Atzilut</i>. This is the meaning of: <b>“By the power of those tears, that one appointee over the sea</b>, who is called Rahab, <b>stands and is sustained, and sanctifies the name of the holy King, and he accepts upon himself to swallow all the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“When all the nations will assemble against the holy nation.”</b> This will occur in the future, at the [time of the] completion of the rectification, when all the nations of the world will gather together to destroy Israel, God forbid. It will then be revealed that the ministering angel of the sea will swallow all <b>“the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>.”</b> The waters will dry up and the children of Israel will pass through [on] dry land [see Exodus 14:29]. This is the mystical meaning of [the verse]: as it is written, “As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt, I will show him marvelous things” (Micah 7:15). However, that [in the past] was only the beginning, as that happened only in the Red Sea and only for a limited time. At [the time of] the completion of the rectification, by contrast, death will be swallowed up forever [see Isaiah 25:8].
Metatron thereby thoroughly clarified the oath he had taken, when he swore, <b>“that the King recalls every day and remembers the doe lying in the dust.”</b> Although the fusion through collision that He performs with His Divine Presence every day is only of the <b>“390 firmaments,”</b> that is, only in the first nine [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Malkhut</i>, and the [the final <i>sefira</i> of] <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> remains <b>“lying in the dust,”</b> such that it seems to us that the King does not remember it at all, that is not the case. Rather, He recalls it with each and every fusion through collision, since at each fusion tears are emitted, from the force of the kicking against the 390 firmaments. [These tears] do not perish, but rather they fall into <b>“the great sea,”</b> which is the mystical meaning of the aforementioned <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which gradually receives its rectification through those tears. [As explained, ] the ministering angel of the sea is revived by that measure [of tears], until the tears accumulate in sufficient amount to purify the entire <i>Malkhut</i>. This will occur when all the nations in the world will gather together simultaneously against Israel. At that time, the ministering angel of the sea will be revived and will swallow all <b>“the waters of <i>Bereshit</i>,”</b> since the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> will receive its rectification in its entirety. Thus, the King recalls <b>“the doe”</b> every day until she receives her rectification in its entirety. Here, all [the answers to] Rabbi Ḥiyya’s questions revealed to him, as he saw that nothing withers in the dust, God forbid. On the contrary, a fusion through collision is performed upon [the doe] each and every day, as Metatron swore to him.

Paragraph 57

<b>57. “In the meantime, he heard a voice etc.”</b><br><b>At that time, he heard a voice saying, “Make space; make space, as the King Messiah is coming to the academy of Rabbi Shimon.” For all the righteous there are heads of academies, and those academies are known there. All these colleagues in each academy ascend from the academy here to the academy in the firmament, and the Messiah comes to all those academies and seals Torah from the mouths of the sages. At that time, the Messiah came</b> to Rabbi Shimon’s academy <b>crowned with high crowns from the heads of the academies.</b>
Explanation: Through this great revelation of the oath of Metatron, which is the revelation of the end, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, the <i>ketz</i>, literally the end, is the time of completion of the process of rectification, and the beginning of the phase of the time of the Messiah and the World to Come, the time of immortality when death is vanquished.</i> all those righteous who were at Rabbi Shimon’s academy ascended very high. [This ascent was] all the more so with regard to those two classes of righteous ones, as they caused the arrival of Metatron and his oath, through which they attained the most wondrous qualities, and they were all crowned and reached the level of <b>“heads of academies.”</b> In every academy there are members of the academy and above them there are heads of the academy. The difference between them is like the difference between the six extremities of a level and the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of a level.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“At that time, he heard a voice saying, make space; make space, as the King Messiah is coming.”</b> When Metatron revealed the mystical meaning of the end, a voice sounded and declared: “Make space; make space, as the King Messiah is coming,” because the concept of the end is connected to the King Messiah. [The <i>Zohar</i>] gives a reason why all the righteous in Rabbi Shimon’s academy merited this – <b>“for all the righteous there are heads of academies.”</b> In order to merit welcoming the Messiah, one requires an equating of form with [the level of Messiah], and the mystical meaning of the King Messiah is the mystical meaning of the light of <i>yeḥida</i>, as is known. Therefore, had all the colleagues not merited to attain the status of <b>“heads of academies,”</b> [which is the light of <i>yeḥida</i>, ] they would not have merited welcoming the Messiah. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“For all the righteous there are heads of academies.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“As those academies are known there... ascend from the academy here to the academy in the firmament.”</b> This is telling us not to think that <b>“the heads of academies”</b> is [the level of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of lower levels. In response to such a claim, [the <i>Zohar</i>] says: “<b>Those academies there</b> were at very high levels, very sublime, to the extent that all the colleagues in those academies merited to ascend from there <b>“to the academy in the firmament,”</b> and now all those colleagues merited the status of heads of these academies. Thus, [the <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“As those academies are known there”</b> – they are known to have attained extremely high, lofty levels, until <b>“all these colleagues in each academy ascend from the academy here to the academy in the firmament,”</b> that is, all the colleagues from there merited to ascend from there <b>“to the academy in the firmament.”</b> What is more, <b>“the Messiah comes to all those academies and seals Torah from the mouths of the sages.”</b> This means to say that the quality of the colleagues of those academies is so lofty that the Messiah came to all those academies to be crowned with the innovations of Torah of the colleagues of the academy. And now all these colleagues of the academies merited the status of <b>“heads of academies,”</b> for those academies.
This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] concludes: <b>“At that time, the Messiah came crowned with high crowns from the heads of the academies.”</b> [Meaning, ] now, however, after all those colleagues of the academies merited the status of <b>“heads of academies,”</b> the Messiah is found to be <b>“crowned”</b> with the Torah of the <b>“heads of academies.”</b> He is thus crowned with the loftiest <b>“crowns from the heads of the academies.”</b>

Paragraph 58

<b>58. “At that time, all the colleagues arose etc.”</b><br><b>At that time, all the colleagues arose, and Rabbi Shimon arose, and his light was ascending to the height of the firmament.</b> The Messiah <b>said to him: Rabbi, happy are you,</b> as <b>your Torah ascends in 370 lights, and each and every light spreads into 613 flavors, rising and immersing in the rivers of the pure persimmon. And the Holy One, blessed be He, is sealing the Torah from your academy and from the academy of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and out of the academy of Ahijah the Shilonite.</b>
Explanation: When the Messiah was revealed to them and came <b>to the academy of Rabbi Shimon</b>, all the colleagues arose, and Rabbi Shimon arose to that same level until <b>“his light was ascending to the height of the firmament.”</b> This indicates that Rabbi Shimon attained that light of the ten firmaments which are lacking due to the sealed gate of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And his light was ascending to the height of the firmament,”</b> which is the mystical meaning of the light of <i>yeḥida</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Your Torah ascends in 370 lights, and each and every light spreads into 613 flavors etc. of the pure persimmon.”</b> In other words, his Torah ascends to the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, in which each <i>sefira</i> reaches [a value] of one hundred thousand, and the four <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> are four hundred thousand within [<i>Atik Yomin</i>]. The [values of] units are in <i>Nukba</i>, the [values of] tens are in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, the [values of] hundreds are in <i>Imma</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a <i>partzuf</i> that corresponds to the level of <i>Bina</i>.</i> the [values of] thousands are in <i>Abba</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a <i>partzuf</i> that corresponds to the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> the [values of] tens of thousands are in <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and the hundreds of thousands in <i>Atik</i>.
However, according to this he should have said: Your Torah ascends in four hundred lights, and each light rises to one thousand flavors, which makes four hundred thousand. Instead, he only alluded to [the fact] that with respect to the lights that are from the <i>Imma</i>, the full four hundred is not used, but only 370, which is the mystical meaning of the verse: “He was the most honorable of the thirty, but did not attain to the first three” (see II Samuel 2:23). Even though <b>“his light was ascending to the height of the firmament,”</b> as stated above, [Rabbi Shimon] still did not attain the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the upper one hundred of the <i>yod</i>. Thus, he had only <b>370 lights</b>, without the thirty upper ones. The same applies to the thousands, which are the lights of <i>Abba</i>: [Rabbi Shimon] does not use the actual first three of each thousand, but only the six extremities of them each, which are six hundred. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, six hundred of each thousand. Instead of the full first three <i>sefirot</i> of these levels, only the aspect of "thirteen" is attained, which is a level of <i>Ḥokhma</i> described previously as the thirty-two paths of <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</i> And instead of first three of each one thousand he uses thirteen, which are the aspect of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths (as stated above in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, section 2, s. v. <i>Ve’im zeh</i>; see there), as the mystical meaning of thirteen is <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, which is called <b>“the pure persimmon.”</b>
This is why he told him: <b>“Your Torah ascends in 370 lights, and each and every light spreads into 613 flavors, rising and immersing in the rivers of the pure persimmon.”</b> For the four hundred of <i>Imma</i> lack the thirty of the upper <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and [<i>Imma</i>] contains only 370. [Similarly], the upper four hundred are missing from each one thousand, those which are from the primordial <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and the thirteen <b>rivers of the pure persimmon</b> operate in their stead. [Thus, ] in each one thousand there are only <b>613</b>, because this is how they ascend, all the sealed, supernal secrets from the academy of Rabbi Shimon.
<b>“And the Holy One, blessed be He, is sealing the Torah from your academy</b> etc.” [The <i>Zohar</i>] says above that the Messiah <b>“seals Torah from the mouths of the sages”</b> (section 57), as he is magnified and crowned by the Torah innovations of all the righteous. There is a well-known statement of the Sages (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 99a) that “all the prophets prophesied only about the Messianic era, but with regard to the World-to-Come: ‘No eye has seen it, God, aside from You, (Who will do for those who await Him, ’ Isaiah 64:3).” Then all the levels that belong to the days of Messiah will be rectified, and all the secrets of Torah will be in the form of “no eye has seen it etc.” It will then be considered that <b>the Holy One, blessed be He, seals the Torah</b>. Since the Torah of those three heads of souls is from after the days of the Messiah, that is, an expression of “no eye has seen it...” the Messiah therefore said to him that <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, is sealing the Torah from your academy and from the academy of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and out of the academy of Ahijah the Shilonite.”</b> These three were rewarded with the Torah secrets of “no eye has seen it, God, aside from You,” and <b>the Holy One, blessed be He,</b> Himself <b>is sealing the Torah</b> from their mouths.

Paragraph 59

<b>59. “And I came etc.”</b><br><b>And I came to seal the Torah from your academy only because the winged one will come here, as I know that he will enter no other academy, but your academy. At that hour, Rabbi Shimon told him about that oath that the winged one had taken. The Messiah shuddered and raised his voice, and the firmaments shuddered, and the Great Sea shuddered, the leviathan shuddered, and the world was about to overturn. At that moment, he saw Rabbi Ḥiyya at Rabbi Shimon’s feet. He said: “Who admitted here a man dressed in a garment of that world</b>,” that is, in a body of this world<b>? Rabbi Shimon said: “It is Rabbi Ḥiyya, a light from the lamp of Torah.” He replied: “He and his sons will be gathered in,”</b> that is, they will pass away from this world, <b>“and they will become part of your academy.” Rabbi Shimon said: “Let time be given to him.” They gave him time.</b>
Explanation: The Messiah said to him that he had come <b>“to seal”</b> only because <b>“the winged one,”</b> came to his academy, [the one] who wants to know what he told him. With regard to his comment: <b>“As I know that he will enter no other academy,”</b> that serves to exclude <b>the academies of Hezekiah, king of Judah and Ahijah the Shilonite</b> (section 58).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The Messiah shuddered and raised his voice</b> etc.” On account of the revelation of the end, which Metatron revealed – that at the time there will be terrible troubles for Israel, the firmaments will shake, and so will the Great Sea, and the world will overturn, in the mystical meaning of “(the world will) lie in ruins for one (thousand years”; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 97a) – he therefore raised his voice, as he wanted to temper all these shocks.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Who admitted here a man dressed in a garment of that world?”</b> The Messiah was surprised by Rabbi Ḥiyya, who was dressed in the corporeal body of this world – <b>“in a garment of that world.”</b> Since he merited to be here and merited the revelation of Metatron and his oath, he has thus already rectified all the evil aspects [within himself] (as stated in section 56 above, second to last paragraph; see there), and has likewise merited receiving the Messiah. Accordingly, he has completed all his work in this world and has nothing more to do in this world. Consequently, he should depart and enter the academy of Rabbi Shimon in the Garden of Eden. Why, then, should he remain in this world for no reason?
[The <i>Zohar</i>] concludes: <b>“Rabbi Shimon said, let time be given to him.”</b> In other words, Rabbi Shimon proved to him that (Rabbi Ḥiyya) should be given fresh time, since he still needs to live in this world and engage in new rectifications. Subsequently, <b>“they gave him time,”</b> that is, the Messiah and Rabbi Shimon informed him of what he still has to do in this world.

Paragraph 60

<b>60. “And he departed from there shocked etc.”</b><br><b>And</b> the Messiah <b>departed from there</b> in a <b>shocked</b> state<b>, with tears flowing from his eyes. Rabbi Ḥiyya was shaken and wept. He said: “Happy is the portion of the righteous in that world, and happy is</b> [Rabbi Shimon] <b>Bar Yoḥai that he merited this. With regard to him it is stated: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that I may fill their treasuries”</b> (Proverbs 8:21).
Explanation: The Messiah left Rabbi Shimon’s academy <b>“with tears flowing down his eyes,”</b> out of his great longing for the complete redemption. For this reason, <b>“Rabbi Ḥiyya was shaken”</b> as well.

Paragraph 61

<b>61. “In the beginning. Rabbi Shimon etc.”</b><br><b>“In the beginning.” Rabbi Shimon began</b> his discourse with the following exposition<b>: “I placed My words in your mouth”</b> (Isaiah 51:16). <b>How much must a person toil in the Torah day and night, because the Holy One, blessed be He, listens to the voices of those who are engaged in the Torah. With each word that is renewed in the Torah, by means of that person who labors in the Torah, He fashions one firmament.</b>
Explanation: The Holy One, blessed be He, gave His power of speech into the mouths of the righteous, as He declares: <b>You are with Me, to partner with Me. Just I fashioned the heaven and earth with My speech, as it is stated: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made”</b> (Psalms 33:6)<b>, the same applies to you.</b> So too, the righteous will create heaven by the power of their speech. With that, Rabbi Shimon began his discourse on the verse: <b>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”</b> (Genesis 1:1). <b>“Created”</b> is a sealed word, a language of <b>closing rather than opening</b>, as stated above<b>.</b> It must be understood why He fashioned them in a sealed state. He says that He did so in order to place the completion of the rectification of heaven and earth in the speech of the righteous, thereby rendering them partners with Him in the creation of heaven and earth. This is why [Rabbi Shimon] cites the verse: <b>“I placed My words in your mouth.”</b>
It can be explained that here there are two aspects of the renewal of heaven and earth, which He placed in the mouths of the righteous:
1. To rectify the sin of Adam the first [man], for the Emanator fashioned the rectification of heaven and earth in a lofty form before the sin of Adam the first [man]. The verses of the act of creation explain that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> ascended to <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and Adam the first [man] ascended and enclothed [himself with] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. Adam the first [man] had [the levels of] <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i> and <i>neshama</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is called <b>“supernal brightness,”</b> to the extent that Adam’s heel darkened the sphere of the sun (see <i>Bava Batra</i> 58a). After the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, he descended to this corporeal world (see <i>Ḥagiga</i> 12a) and now his <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i> and <i>neshama</i> come to him from the three worlds of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation. The heaven and earth of <i>Atzilut</i> were reduced on [Adam's] account to [a level of] six extremities and a point, from the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and below.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This represents a reduction from a fully formed set of <i>partzufim</i> to the reduced structure of six extremities (the <i>sefirot</i> in the level of <i>Tiferet</i>) and a point (the reduced form of the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>). It also indicates a descent to the area below the "navel" of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, a much lower region than before.</i> The [responsibility of this] rectification lies upon the righteous, to rectify all the impairments caused by the sin, and once again to renew the heaven and earth of <i>Atzilut</i>, which are <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, and to elevate them to <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, as they were before the sin. The righteous themselves will be given back the supernal brightness of Adam the first [man], which is [the aspects of] <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i> and <i>neshama</i> from the world of <i>Atzilut</i>.
2. Even Adam the first [man], before the sin, did not have all the perfection that the Emanator wished to grant him. Therefore, once the righteous rectify the sin of the Tree of Knowledge and attain the completion of <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i> and <i>neshama</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> that Adam the first [man] had before the sin, a new task will be imposed upon them – to draw forth all the supernal minds that have never yet been in the world at all, which is the mystical meaning of: “No eye has seen it, God, aside from You” (Isaiah 64:3).
These worlds, which no eye has seen, and which the righteous will complete, are called <b>“new heavens and a new earth”</b> (Isaiah 65:17), for they are truly new, as they have never yet completely existed. This is not the case for the heavens and earth, which the righteous will renew and return to the state they were in at the act of creation, before the sin of Adam the first [man]. They are not considered a truly <b>new</b> heaven and earth, since they already existed once in the world, for the Emanator already rectified them Himself before the sin. Rather, they are <b>renewed</b>, as after they were impaired and nullified, they were renewed once again.
Consequently, these righteous are still not yet considered partners with the Holy One, blessed be He. Thus, the verse: <b>“I placed My words in your mouth,”</b> which Rabbi Shimon cites, refers to the supernal minds which Adam the first [man] also lacked, since they were truly innovated by the righteous and had not yet emerged from the Emanator. Accordingly, the righteous are considered actual partners [with the Emanator] with respect to [these worlds].
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The Holy One, blessed be He, listens to the voices of those who are engaged in the Torah. With each word that is renewed in the Torah etc.” </b><i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called a “voice,” and its <i>Nukba</i> is called “speech.” When a righteous person engages in [the study of] the Torah, he raises feminine waters to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> through the voice and speech of his Torah [study], as the voice ascends to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and the speech ascends to the <i>Nukba</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“The Holy One, blessed be He, listens to the voice of those who are engaged in the Torah,”</b> that the voice of Torah ascends as feminine waters to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He.” “With each word that is renewed in the Torah etc. He fashions one firmament.” “Word”</b> means speech. Each and every word that is renewed <b>in the Torah</b> of the one engaged in Torah [study] ascends as feminine waters to the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called by the name “word” and “speech.” Through this, <b>one firmament</b> is fashioned. A firmament is the mystical meaning of the partition upon which is performed the pairing of the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Divine Presence. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Kabbalistic language, these two aspects are described as male and female and engage in a union called the "unification of the Holy One and His Divine Presence. "</i> This is achieved by means of the feminine waters that the righteous raise through their engagement in the Torah.
As for the concept of innovation that is said [to be associated] with the “<b>word of the Torah</b>,” rather than saying an innovation in the <b>voice of the Torah</b>, this is because the <i>Nukba</i> requires a new construction of its <i>Yesod</i> for each pairing. This is because after each pairing, [the <i>Nukba</i>] returns to a virgin state. By means of the feminine waters of the righteous, the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> in [the <i>Nukba</i>] is continuously renewed, that is, the receptacle for the lights of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> [are continuously renewed to receive those lights]. Therefore, [Rabbi Shimon specifically] says: <b>“With each word that is renewed in the Torah</b>, as the <b>word</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, is actually renewed through the word of Torah of the righteous, for after every pairing its receptacle disappears once again, as explained.

Paragraph 62

<b>62. “We learned, at that time etc.”</b><br><b>We learned: At that time, when a new word of Torah is innovated from a person’s mouth, that word ascends and meets the Holy One, blessed be He. The Holy One, blessed be He takes that word, kisses it, and crowns it with seventy carved and engraved crowns. The innovated word of wisdom ascends and sits on the head of the righteous one who is eternal life. From there, it flies and sails through seventy thousand worlds, ascending to the</b> <i><b>Atik Yomin</b></i>, which is the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Keter</i><b>. All the words of the</b> <i><b>Atik Yomin</b></i> <b>are words of wisdom of the loftiest, concealed secrets.</b>
Explanation: <b>“That word ascends etc.”</b> This means to say, at the time when a person raises feminine waters through his word of Torah, that supernal <b>word</b>, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>“ascends and meets the Holy One, blessed be He,”</b> to pair with Him. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the previous section, this refers to the pairing of the Holy One and the Divine Presence into a unification.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The Holy One, blessed be He takes that word, kisses it, and crowns it etc.”</b> Two aspects apply to each fusion of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, and these are called “the fusion of kisses” and “the fusion of foundations.” As explained (above, in the section called “the mother lends,” 16), the name is not completed until He creates <b>“light for its light, and they were enclothed in one another”</b>; see there. The explanation of this is that apart from the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, a second [fusion through collision] is required [to generate a height of [the light of giving], so that the [column of the] height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> will be enclothed in the height of [the light of giving]. Accordingly, each incorporates two fusions: 1) For the [generation of the] height of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This fusion is called “fusion of kisses,” as it [transpires] in the mouth of the head, that is, for the level of the head and the first three [<i>sefirot</i> associated with the head]. 2) For the [generation of the] height of [the light of giving]. This fusion is called “fusion of foundations,” that is, for the height of [the light of giving]. This is the meaning of the statement that <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He takes that word,”</b> that is, the <i>Nukba</i>, <b>“kisses it,”</b> that is, a fusion of kisses for the [generation of] the height of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], <b>“and crowns it,”</b> meaning a fusion of foundations, for the [generation of the] height of [the light of giving]. Then the [light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> is enclothed in [the &lt;&lt;light of="" giving],="" and="" the="" &lt;i=""&gt;Nukba is crowned with complete brains.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“With seventy carved and engraved crowns.”</b> The complete brains of the <i>Nukba</i> are called <b>“seventy crowns.”</b> The <i>Nukba</i> is the seventh day, <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Generally speaking, the <i>Nukba</i> is the seventh of the lower <i>sefirot</i> (counting from the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Ḥesed</i>) and corresponds to the seventh day of Creation.</i> and when [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is in the mystical meaning of tens, [the <i>Nukba</i>] becomes <b>seventy</b>. The aspect of the brains is called <b>“crowns,”</b> and they are therefore called <b>“seventy crowns.”</b> [Rabbi Shimon] says that they are <b>“carved and engraved,”</b> that is, through the feminine waters of the righteous become a receptacle for these <b>seventy crowns</b>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The innovated word of wisdom ascends and sits on the head of the righteous one who lives for eternity.”</b> As explained above, there are two aspects to the renewal of heaven and earth which are <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>: 1) To restore the crown to its former state before the sin of Adam the first [man]. You should know that concerning this renewal, the <i>Nukba</i> is called <b>“word of Torah,”</b> and this is what Rabbi Shimon has explained thus far. 2) The renewal of heaven and earth with respect to the supernal brains, which even Adam the first [man] did not attain. In this regard, the <i>Nukba</i> is called <b>“word of wisdom.”</b> He now proceeds to clarify [this second] innovation.
[Rabbi Shimon] says: <b>“The innovated word of wisdom ascends and sits on the head of the righteous one who lives for eternity.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the Sages’ statement that “the righteous sit with their crowns upon their heads” (<i>Berakhot</i> 17a). By means of the feminine waters of the righteous, who are already perfected with the supernal brightness of Adam the first [man], such as Rabbi Shimon and his colleagues, the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ascends to become a crown for the head of the righteous, and that [righteous] is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> with respect to its <i>Yesod</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> corresponds to the righteous in this world.</i> which is the mystical meaning of the one who is eternal life. The meaning of this is as follows: The light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called “the light of <i>ḥaya</i>.” Since <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> can draw the light of <i>ḥaya</i> only by means of the <i>Nukba</i> (as stated in section 5 above, s. v. <i>U-netziv</i>; see there), it is considered that [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is alive only when it is in [its state of] pairing with the <i>Nukba</i> which is called <b>“world.”</b> In that state, [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is therefore called <b>“the righteous one who is eternal life.”</b> It is also considered [in that state] that the <i>Nukba</i> is a crown over the head [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], that is, the brains which are called “crown” are from the <i>Nukba</i>, and [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] could not access [these brains] without [the <i>Nukba</i>]. This is also the mystical meaning of: “He did not move from His fondness of her until calling her 'my mother'” (Midrash Song of Songs, end of chapter 3), since the consequence is considered the offspring of its cause. Since the <i>Nukba</i> was the cause of the [presence of the] light of <i>ḥaya</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, in that respect the <i>Nukba</i> becomes his mother.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“From there, it flies and sails through seventy thousand worlds.”</b> After [the <i>Nukba</i>] pairs with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in the mystical meaning of “a crown on the head of the righteous,” [the <i>Nukba</i>] flies and ascends further up, that is, to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. There, the seven <i>sefirot</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> are rectified in the mystical meaning of “seventy thousand worlds,” for the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> are [counted] in the mystical meaning of ten thousand, as stated. From there [the <i>Nukba</i>] ascends further, until the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, as [Rabbi Shimon] states: <b>“Ascending to the</b> <i><b>Atik Yomin</b></i><b>,”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally "the Ancient of Days, " this term generally refers to the <i>partzuf</i> of the level of <i>Keter</i>, often in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, above the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>.</i> for [the <i>Nukba</i>] ascends from <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. [Rabbi Shimon] calculates the ascents of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> one after the other, up to <i><b>Atik Yomin</b></i>, [all of] which is performed through the power of the feminine waters of the perfectly righteous. The fusion of the crown on the head of the righteous is achieved by [the <i>Nukba</i>] ascending to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and from there [the <i>Nukba</i> ascends to <i>Arikh Anpin</i> in the mystical meaning of “seventy thousand worlds,” and from there to the <i>Atik</i>, which is the ultimate goal.
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“All the words of the</b> <i><b>Atik Yomin</b></i> <b>are words of wisdom of the loftiest, concealed secrets.”</b> Here [Rabbi Shimon] clarifies the quality of the brains that are bestowed upon the <i>Nukba</i> through its ascent to the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. He says that all the words of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, that is, all the levels that are received from the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, are <b>“words of wisdom of the loftiest, concealed secrets,”</b> that is, they are the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. For <b>“words of wisdom [<i>Ḥokhma</i>]”</b> refers to the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <b>“the loftiest, concealed secrets”</b> are the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. These are revealed only by ascending to the place of the <i><b>Atik Yomin</b></i> and not below it.

Paragraph 63

<b>63. “And that sealed word etc.”</b><br><b>And that sealed word that was innovated here,</b> in this world, <b>when it ascends it connects to those words of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, ascending and descending with them, and enters eighteen concealed worlds, which “no eye has seen it, God, aside from You.” They emerge from there and wander, and they come full and whole, and present themselves before the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. At that time, the <i>Atik Yomin</i> smells that word, and it is more pleasing to him than anything. He</b> then <b>takes that word and crowns it with 370, 000 crowns, and that word</b> of a new innovation in the Torah <b>wanders, ascending and descending, and one firmament is fashioned from it.</b>
Explanation: At the time of the ascent of the <i>Nukba</i> to the <b><i>Atik Yomin</i></b>, [the <i>Nukba</i>] is incorporated in the [fusion through collision] that is there. [The <i>Nukba</i>] raises returning light and draws direct light from the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. <b>“Ascending”</b> means that [the <i>Nukba</i>] raises returning light from below upwards. <b>“Descending”</b> means that [the <i>Nukba</i>] draws the direct light from above to below, at which point [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives the aforementioned wisdom of the loftiest, concealed secrets. When he says <b>“with them,”</b> this indicates that [the <i>Nukba</i>] is incorporated with the returning light and the direct light that are in the <i>Atik</i> itself.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And enters eighteen concealed worlds, which ‘no eye has seen it, God, aside from You. ’”</b> This [fusion through collision] that is performed in the <i>Atik</i> also takes place upon the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Atik</i> that is there, and it is also <b>“the righteous one who lives for eternity,”</b> like <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> at its ascent to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, as stated above. The difference is that regarding <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Atik</i>, “no eye has seen it, God, aside from You.” The [fusion through collision] of <i>Yesod</i> is performed on the partition in the mystical meaning of collision. [This collision] raises the returning light in order to enclothe the direct light, as is known. Now below, in the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), the partition is considered like wings that cover the supernal light when [the supernal light] is rebuffed backwards. This indicates that [the wings, an aspect of the partition, ] contain the force of judgment, as this is the mystical meaning of how every returning light is called “light of judgment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The partition restricts the flow of the direct light downward, preventing it from entering the receiving vessel. This is associated with the concept of judgment, which represents the idea of boundaries and restrictions.</i>
[However, ] this is not the case for the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Atik</i>, regarding which it is stated: “Your Teacher shall not hide Himself any more etc.” (Isaiah 30:10). Although the partition raises returning light from below upwards, the aspect of wings is not present. [This <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i>] is therefore called <b>“eighteen concealed worlds, which ‘no eye has seen it, God, aside from You. ’”</b> In other words, [at that level, there are no longer wings there that cover [it] from a foreign eye, since there are no judgments there, but <b>“no eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b> Understand this well. For the level that is from below upwards is called “concealed,” yet it is in the form of <b>“no eye has seen it etc.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that although there is a partition giving rise to returning light, in this environment that returning light does not operate with the aspect of judgment. This is because the area of <i>Atik Yomin</i> and above is beyond any current conception (no eye has seen it), and so cannot be "judged" or restricted based on the lower levels.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“They emerge from there and wander, and they come full and whole.”</b> [The phrase] <b>“they emerge from there”</b> means [they emerge] from the mystical meaning of the [fusion through collision] upon the partition, which is called <b>“eighteen concealed worlds, which ‘no eye has etc. ’”</b> The term <b>“wander”</b> means that [the partition] raises the returning light from below upwards. <b>“They come”</b> means that the direct light is drawn down from above to below, and then they are <b>“full and whole,”</b> filled with direct light, <b>from the wisdom of the loftiest, concealed secrets</b>. They are “whole” with respect to the returning light, as it contains no judgments but is entirely complete mercy, equal to the direct light. They then <b>“present themselves before the <i>Atik Yomin</i>,”</b> as they are ready to enclothe the <i>Atik Yomin</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“At that time, the <i>Atik Yomin</i> smells that word, and it is more pleasing to him than anything.” “Smells”</b> is the mystical meaning of contentment of the spirit, since this great and lofty [fusion through collision] brings exceedingly sublime contentment of the spirit to the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. This is because every single one of the worlds and all of their merit are then incorporated in the <i>Nukba</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And it is more pleasing to him than anything [<i>mi-kula</i>],”</b> because that contentment comes to [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] “from all [<i>mi-kula</i>],” from all of the worlds at once, since this is the utter perfection, and the height upon which the worlds were created.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He takes that word and crowns it with 370, 000 crowns.”</b> That is, [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] then bestows upon [the <i>Nukba</i>] the sublime brains of <i>Atik</i> himself, which are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, each of which amounts to one hundred thousand, since the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atik</i> are one hundred thousand each, as stated. However, the difference is because of the upper thirty of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as there it is the mystical meaning of: “He was the most honorable of the thirty, but did not attain to the first three” (see II Samuel 2:23). In other words, even though [the <i>Nukba</i>] also receives and is honored by the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Atik</i>, which are the upper thirty thousand [of <i>Atik Yomin</i>], as stated earlier, nevertheless, the <i>Nukba</i> cannot actually ascend and enclothe these thirty thousand themselves. The reason is that if [the <i>Nukba</i>] were to enclothe those thirty thousand as well, the <i>Nukba</i> would be nullified within him, like a candle before a torch. Therefore, [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives from the <i>Atik</i> only 370, 000 crowns, that is, four hundred thousand minus thirty thousand, for that stated reason.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“that word wanders, ascending and descending, and one firmament is fashioned from it.” “Wanders”</b> means that it flies upwards; <b>“wanders, ascending”</b> means that it raises returning light from below upwards. <b>“And descending” –</b> with the returning light that it raises, it descends with direct light from above to below. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The ascent of returning light as vessels for the direct light allows the descent of the direct light from above to below the partition, to the lower levels.</i> <b>“And one firmament is fashioned from it”</b> – by means of the enclothing of the direct light by the returning light, one firmament is fashioned there. For after the [fusion through collision] is performed upon that partition, which was established in <i>Malkhut</i> in order to raise the returning light that reached the <i>Nukba</i> through good deeds [of the created beings] and feminine waters (which the [created beings] raised in order to bestow contentment upon their Maker, as stated) – [the partition] becomes a firmament through which the righteous attain that height of fusion that was performed upon [that partition]. <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the spiritual attainment of the righteous through this process. They attain the spiritual height corresponding to the structure of brains that they evoke in the supernal structures described here.</i> The idea is that when the level descends to the righteous through the firmament, [the level] is enclothed in a garment that is drawn from that <b>firmament</b>, which is an aspect of the returning light that inverts from the firmament to below, <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the returning light which originates below and ascends upward, enclothing the direct light.</i> together with the direct light from the firmament and above. Thus, [this height] is available for the attainment of the righteous who are enclothed in one another.
The meaning of this is as follows: Those righteous who have merited that wholeness, to raise feminine waters for that lofty fusion, no longer have any aspect of receiving for their own needs. The feminine waters that they raised was [purely] in order to bestow, not to receive. Consequently, with their good deeds and the [resulting] feminine waters, the [righteous] rectify the partition of the <i>Nukba</i>, rendering her fit for this great fusion. The fitness [for the fusion] itself is the mystical meaning of the returning light that ascends from the partition of the <i>Nukba</i> upward, since anything that ascends from below upwards is the mystical meaning of bestowing, and the rebuffing of receiving for oneself. Then the fusion through collision with the supernal light is performed, and the supernal light is enclothed in a garment of ascending returning light.
Now, the light that descends from above to below, and which is enclothed in returning light, comes to be received by the lower one, that is, for that righteous person who raised the feminine waters, because when anything comes from above to below, this means that it comes to be received. Since the supernal light passes to the lower [level] through the firmament, [the supernal light] takes with it the aspect of the clothing of the returning light from the firmament, and the lower [righteous person] receives the supernal light within this garment. This means that even after the height comes to be received by the lower one, [that person] only benefits from the supernal light that descends to him according to the measure of bestowal of contentment upon his Maker, that is, according to the measure of the clothing of the returning light, which enclothes the supernal light. This is considered “receiving in order to bestow.” [The righteous person] does not receive anything if it does not include a bestowal upon his Maker. Therefore, the receiving [of the supernal light] is enclothed within the bestowal [upon his Maker], direct light in returning light. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] emphasizes that <b>“that word wanders, ascending and descending, and one firmament is fashioned from it.”</b> In other words, [the word] is received by the lower [beings] only through the firmament, that is, [the supernal light] with its enclothing garment, as stated.

Paragraph 64

<b>64. “And likewise, each and every word etc.”</b><br><b>And likewise, each and every word of wisdom are fashioned into firmaments, established in full existence before the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, who calls them “new heavens,”</b> that is, <b>renewed heavens,</b> which are <b>sealed secrets of the supernal wisdom. And all the rest of the innovated words of Torah,</b> which are not from the supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <b>stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, and ascend and become the lands of the living, and descend and are crowned into one land. Everything is renewed and becomes a new land by</b> the strength of <b>that word which was innovated in the Torah.</b>
Explanation: The righteous proceed in this manner, continuously raising feminine waters and drawing those sublime levels from the <i>Atik Yomin</i> by means of these firmaments that were fashioned through the supernal [fusion through collision]. The mystical meaning of the <b>“new heavens”</b> is made from those firmaments, which are renewed at the level of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, as stated. Therefore, those high attainments are called <b>“sealed secrets of the supernal wisdom,”</b> because they come enclothed in the garment that is drawn from the firmaments.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“All the rest of the</b> [innovated] <b>words of Torah etc. into one land. Everything is renewed and becomes a new land.”</b> In each level, there are [the aspects of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>. Thus far, the discussion was only in reference to <b>“the secrets of wisdom [<i>Ḥokhma</i>],”</b> not of <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> [which is <i>Tiferet</i>], or <i>Malkhut</i> in each level. [Rabbi Shimon] thus says: <b>“And become the lands of the living,”</b> meaning that [these words] all become <i>Bina</i>, which is called “the land of the living.” They descend <b>“and are crowned into one land,”</b> that is, to <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called simply “land.” <b>“Everything is renewed and becomes a new land,”</b> because the <i>Malkhut</i> was crowned and received all the levels of the lands of the living, which are <i>Bina</i>, and by means of this [receiving], the <i>Malkhut</i> ascended to become <i>Bina</i>.
[<i>Malkhut</i>] is now called <b>“a new land,”</b> since what was previously <i>Malkhut</i> is now <i>Bina</i>. This is the mystical meaning of: “The <i>Ban</i> (or <i>bet-nun</i>) will in the future be <i>Sag</i> (or <i>samekh-gimmel</i>), and the <i>Mah</i> (or <i>mem-heh</i>) will be <i>Ab</i> (or <i>ayin-bet</i>).” The heavens are <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and now at the level of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, they are in [the state of] <b>“the secrets of the supernal wisdom [<i>Ḥokhma</i>].”</b> Thus, the <i>Mah</i>, which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, becomes <i>Ab</i>, that is, <i>Ḥokhma</i>; and “land,” which is <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, becomes <i>Sag</i>, that is, <i>Bina</i>. It follows that the mystical meaning of <b>“new heavens and a new earth”</b> is <i>Mah</i> and <i>Ban</i> that were nullified and have become <i>Ab</i> <i>Sag</i>.

Paragraph 65

<b>65. “And with regard to this, it is written etc.”</b><br><b>And with regard to this, it is stated: “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I make, shall remain before Me etc.”</b> (Isaiah 66:22)<b>. It is not written “I made,” but “make,”</b> in the present tense, because <b>He is always making</b> new heavens and earth <b>from those innovations and secrets of the Torah. With regard to this it is stated: “I placed My words in your mouth and have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant heavens and lay the foundations of earth”</b> (Isaiah 51:16). <b>It does not say “the heavens,” but “heavens</b>,” without the definitive article, since it is not referring to the actual heavens, but to renewed heavens, fashioned out of words of Torah<b>.</b>
Explanation: <b>“It is not written ‘I made, ’ but ‘make’ etc.”</b> This teaches that one should not err in interpreting the phrase <b>“new heavens and new earth”</b> as referring to an establishment that is performed and innovated once only, as that is not the case. Rather, they involve a continuous process. The righteous, who have already been perfected in the supernal brightness, are constantly fashioning new heavens and earth. This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“They go from strength to strength”</b> (Psalms 84:8; end of <i>Berakhot</i>, 64a). [Rabbi Shimon] cites a proof for this, that it is stated: <b>“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I make,”</b> and <b>it is not written “I made,” but “make.”</b> This illustrates that these heavens and earth are perpetually renewed through the Torah innovations of the completely righteous. [Rabbi Shimon] likewise brings a proof from the phrase <b>“that I may plant heavens,”</b> since if this was referring to a one-time act, it should have stated “that I may plant the heavens,” with the definitive article. The fact that it states “heavens” implies that it is an ongoing activity.

Paragraph 66

<b>66. “Rabbi Elazar said, what is etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> [the meaning of] <b>“and have covered you in the shadow of My hand”</b> (Isaiah 51:16)<b>? He replied: When the Torah was given to Moses, many multitudes of supernal angels came to burn him with the flames of their mouths, but the Holy One, blessed be He, covered him. Now, when the Torah innovation ascends, is crowned, and stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, He covers that word and covers that person, so that he will not be known to them, but to the Holy One, blessed be He, and they will not envy him, until that that word is fashioned into new heavens and new earth. This is the meaning of the verse: “And have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant heavens and lay the foundations of earth.” From here</b> [we learn] <b>that everything which is covered from the eye counts toward the supernal purpose. This is the meaning of the verse: “And have covered you in the shadow of My hand.” Why was he covered and hidden from the eye? For the supernal purpose. This is the meaning of the verse: “That I may plant heavens and lay the foundations of earth,” as we learned</b>, that is, so that new heavens and earth would sprout from it<b>.</b>
Explanation: <b>“And have covered you in the shadow of My hand etc.”</b> This is referring to the aforementioned garment, which is drawn from the firmament and which enclothes and covers the height of the brains (as stated above, s. v. <i>Hahi mila</i>; see there). This clothing is the aspect of <b>“shadow”</b> that covers the brains and hides them from foreign eyes, and they are known solely to the Holy One, blessed be He. [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain the reason for this [covering], that it is in order to conceal those great levels from the ministering angels, so that they will not envy [the righteous person]. This envy of the angels is because they are pure of substance, and thus when they look at a righteous person, they find a kind of inferiority in him, and envy him for the high level he has attained. Subsequently, the prosecuting forces grasp hold of that inferiority that the angels discovered in him. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a spiritual phenomenon in which, when a person's flaws are brought to the attention of higher spiritual reality, this attracts negative judgments called "prosecuting forces. "</i>
Consequently, when the level is enclothed in that garment of the firmament, this garment measures the level [to be received by the righteous person], so that [the righteous person] will not receive too much of [of the brains of the level], only that which is for the benefit of the Supernal One, may He be blessed. [The righteous person] is thereby protected from the envy of the angels, for then the righteous can be guarded from impairing the level, exactly like the angels.
[Rabbi Shimon] thus states: <b>“Every word that is covered from the eye ascends for the supernal benefit.”</b> [Rabbi Shimon] is alluding to the way that the eye sees and the heart lusts, and thus [a person] cannot guard his thoughts so that they will remain clean and provide only contentment to his Creator, but rather [a person] also receives benefit for himself. However, that which is <b>“covered from the eye,”</b> that is, which is enclothed in the garment of the firmament, will assuredly not receive more than that which ascends for the benefit of the Supernal One, may He be blessed. This is the meaning of his statement: <b>“Why was it covered and hidden from the eye? For the supernal benefit,”</b> as explained.

Paragraph 67

<b>67. “And to say to Zion, you are My people”</b><br><b>“And to say to Zion: You are My people”</b> (Isaiah 51:16)<b>. “And to say,”</b> that is, <b>to those gates and words that are marked one above the other</b>, that is, to the Torah innovations<b>: “You are My people.” Do not read: “You are My people [<i>ami</i>],”</b> with a <i>pataḥ</i> vowel under the letter <i>ayin</i>, <b>but rather: “You are with Me [<i>imi</i>],”</b> with a <i>ḥirik</i> under the <i>ayin</i>, meaning <b>“to be a partner with Me.” Just as I made heaven and earth with My speech, as it is stated: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made”</b> (Psalms 33:6)<b>, so too you</b>, with your words of wisdom, have made new heavens and earth<b>. Happy are those who toil in the Torah.</b>
Explanation: The aspect of receiving is called <b>“gates,”</b> as gates are open to receive, while the aspect of giving through the feminine waters is called <b>“words,”</b> as stated above. [Rabbi Shimon] adds that they <b>“are marked one above the other,”</b> meaning that they are enclothed in one another, which thereby marks them.

Paragraph 68

<b>68. “And if you say that a word etc.”</b><br><b>“And if you say that a word of innovation from any person,</b> even <b>if he does not know</b> what he is saying, <b>has this effect,</b> [then] <b>come and see: One who is not proficient in the secrets of Torah, and innovated words whose truth he does not properly know, that innovation ascends and there emerges to that word a duplicitous man who speaks lies, from the female of the great deep. He leaps five hundred parasangs to receive that word, and he takes it and walks with the word to his female, and fashions a false firmament within her, which is called “emptiness”</b> [<i>tohu</i>]<b>.</b>
Explanation: As you are already aware, the mystical meaning of the feminine waters that the righteous raise in order to bring contentment to their Maker, that is, <b>“for the supernal benefit”</b> (section 66, above), is called <b>words of Torah</b> that were innovated. They are innovated by the supernal [fusion through collision], and the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> receive new brains through them, until they thereby merit the mystical meaning of <b>“plant heavens and lay the foundations of earth</b> etc.” They thus become partners with the Holy One, blessed be He, since heaven and earth are renewed through their words, as stated.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: However, <b>“one who is not proficient in the secrets of Torah,”</b> that is, he is not versed in the ways of God, to know how to guard himself from impairing the higher levels. Now, he says to himself that his aim is <b>for the supernal purpose</b>, but he is fooling himself, for he does not realize that it is his responsibility to know for certain that his intention is not, God forbid, for his own needs. His punishment is grave indeed, for he gives power to the <i>kelippot</i> <b>to kill people</b>, as the author proceeds to explain. This is the meaning of: <b>“And innovated words whose truth he does not properly know.”</b> That is, he raises feminine waters for the supernal fusion, and yet he does not fully understand that this is indeed the case. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, this person does not fully understand the consequences of his actions above, in the fusions taking place.</i> It thus turns out that this <b>“duplicitous man who speaks lies”</b> minimizes and abuses <b>that word</b>, as [Rabbi Shimon] further elaborates.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“A duplicitous man who speaks lies, from the female of the great deep.”</b> There are male and female in the <i>kelippot</i> as well. The male is called <b>“false,”</b> and the female is called <b>“lies.”</b> The explanation of this is that the male <i>kelippa</i> is not as evil as the female. Left to himself, [the male <i>kelippa</i>] would not trick people into lying in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. On the contrary, it would appear that he speaks well, or so it seems. However, he has an evil eye, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Do not eat bread of he who has an evil eye…eat and drink, he says to you; but his heart is not with you” (Proverbs 23:6-7). Whoever is ensnared by him will bear the name of God in vain, for he is separated from the Lord and cannot receive any <i>shefa</i>. This is the mystical meaning of the Sages’ statement: “Whoever is arrogant, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: He and I cannot reside in a single abode” (see <i>Sota</i> 5a). Since his intention is towards his own needs, to brag and boast and the like, he is ensnared in the domain of that evil-eyed one. The result is that the feminine waters which [such a person] raises do not draw forth any <i>shefa</i> from above, and he employs the name of God in vain. For this reason, the male <i>kelippa</i> is called <b>false</b>, since the Holy One, blessed be He, cannot become attached to that man, to reside together with him in one abode.
The female of the <i>kelippa</i> is called <b>lies</b>, for after that man has become ensnared in the net of the male, who is called <b>false</b>, that male [<i>kelippa</i>] has the power to mate with his female. She is an evil and bitter <i>kelippa</i>, which forges the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and utters lies with it. She subsequently descends and incites, and then ascends and accuses, and takes [the person's] soul from him.
[The male <i>kelippa</i>] is therefore called <b>“a duplicitous man,”</b> since at first “eat and drink, he says to you,” that is, so that [the person] will raise the feminine waters to the Holy One, blessed be He, and draw forth <i>shefa</i> for the needs of the Most High, and [the male <i>kelippa</i>] seems to [the person] as though he is from the side of holiness. Subsequently, through the power of his <b>falsehood</b>, [the male <i>kelippa</i>] mates with the <b>“female of the great deep,”</b> and with her <b>lies</b> he takes [the person's] soul and kills him. This is the meaning of: <b>“A duplicitous man who speaks lies, from the female of the great deep,”</b> since he duplicitously transforms into <b>speaking lies</b> only through the strength of the <b>female of the great deep</b> with whom he associates, not from himself.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He leaps five hundred parasangs to receive that word.”</b> Explanation: The [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of impurity only have six extremities and a point at their root, that is, they are only an opposite [set of the aspects of] six extremities and a point of the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of holiness, and they have no place or strength to attach to <i>Bina</i>. However, by means of <b>“that word,”</b> that is, the feminine waters that the [being from] below raises, he gives the male of impurity the strength to leap over the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> that are [normally] drawn into [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of holiness. [These lower seven] are essentially only five <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, and <i>Hod</i>. They are called “five hundred parasangs” because the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i> are counted in the unit of hundreds, as is known. He thus says: <b>“He leaps five hundred parasangs to receive that word,”</b> because immediately upon the ascent of the feminine waters, [the male <i>kelippa</i>] attained the power to leap into a place that is not his, that is, the five lower <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, and <i>Hod</i>, which are called five hundred parasangs. “To receive that word” is referring to the feminine waters that are raised by the man who did not properly know if his intention was to provide contentment to his Maker.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And walks with the word to his female, and fashions a false firmament within her, which is called ‘emptiness’</b> [<i>tohu</i>]<b>.”</b> In other words, he mates with his female <b>“of the great deep,”</b> over these feminine waters, and draws lights of holiness to him, to his portion and to his construction, similar to the new heavens of holiness that are fashioned by the feminine waters of holiness, as stated. These heavens that he drew forth through his mating are called <b>“a false firmament,”</b> with regard to the male, while with respect to the association with the female of the great deep it is called a firmament <b>of emptiness</b>. <b>“Emptiness”</b> is the name of the male, and the name of the female is “deep.” This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And fashions a false firmament,”</b> with the strength of his own self, <b>“which is called emptiness,”</b> by the strength of his association with the <b>deep</b>, the female.

Paragraph 69

<b>69. “And he flies in that firmament etc.”</b><br><b>“And he flies in that</b> false <b>firmament, that duplicitous man, six thousand parasangs in one go. Once this false firmament stands still, a woman of harlotry immediately emerges and holds that false firmament and participates in it. From there she goes forth and kills several thousands and myriads, since while she is in that firmament she has the permission and ability to fly and to traverse the entire world in an instant.</b>
Explanation: These brains that were drawn out to [the person] in that <b>false firmament</b> are from the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> that corresponds to the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of holiness, whose units are the thousands. This is the meaning of <b>“he flies in that firmament,”</b> that he soars and is gripped by it, for <b>“six thousand parasangs in one go”</b> – in the six <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. These are called <b>six thousand parasangs,</b> as they are from <i>Ḥokhma</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Once this false firmament stands still, a woman of harlotry immediately emerges and holds that false firmament and participates in it.”</b> In other words, after the completion of the new heavens of the male <i>kelippa</i>, which are called only by the name <b>“false,”</b> the <b>“female of the great deep”</b> then reveals her power. Her power attacks the firmament, in order to lie in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and she proceeds to fly in the firmament, which is then called <b>“the firmament of emptiness,”</b> as stated above (in the previous section).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“From there she goes forth and kills... since while she is in that firmament, she has the permission and ability to fly and to traverse the entire world in an instant.”</b> While she participates in that firmament, she grows stronger and larger than the level of the male. The male grows only to the six extremities of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which are six thousand parasangs, as stated above, while the female grows by means of [the male] through ten complete <i>sefirot</i>, which is a whole world. This is the meaning of <b>“she has the permission and ability to fly and to traverse the entire world,</b> that is, a whole world in ten <i>sefirot</i>. <b>“In an instant”</b> is the mystical meaning of the teaching: “How long is His anger? A moment” (<i>Berakhot</i> 7a). She therefore has the power to kill thousands and myriads, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “For she has cast down many slain” (Proverbs 7:26). Rabbi Shimon has thus explained to us that “God made one thing corresponding to the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14) – just as the new heavens and earth for holiness are constantly being built by the feminine waters of the righteous, so too the heavens and earth for the <i>kelippot</i> are continuously being constructed through the feminine waters of those who do not know how to serve properly the Holy One, blessed be He.

Paragraph 70

<b>70. “And with regard to this, it is written etc.”</b><br><b>“And with regard to this, it is stated: “Woe to them who draw iniquity with false cords”</b> (Isaiah 5:18)<b>. “Iniquity” is the male. “And sin as it were with a cart rope”</b> (Isaiah 5:18)<b>. What is “sin”? This is the female,</b> that is, the aforementioned woman of harlotry, <b>who is called “sin.” It</b>, the sinner, <b>drags that which is called “iniquity</b>,” that is, the male, <b>with these false cords, and subsequently, “sin as it were with a cart rope.”</b> He pulls <b>on that female who is called “sin,” as she grows stronger there, to fly and kill people. Therefore, “for she has cast down many slain”</b> (Proverbs 7:26)<b>. Who has cast down? She, that “sin,” who kills people. Who caused this? A student who has not attained the ability to issue rulings, and</b> [yet] <b>he issues</b> [them]<b>. May the Merciful One save us!</b>
Explanation: As we wrote above, the male is not as evil as the female, because he imagines himself to be holy, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Eat and drink, he says to you; but his heart is not with you” (Proverbs 23:7). He is therefore called <b>“false.”</b> However, for this very reason he is highly capable of catching people in his net. Once they have fallen into his net, he comes and mates with the female, at which point there is <b>“sin as it were with a cart rope,”</b> for she drags him into the great deep. This is how the verse <b>“woe to them who draw iniquity with false cords”</b> should be interpreted. The <b>“false”</b> one only ties a person with cords and traps him, and then casts him down before his female. At this stage, <b>“sin as it were with a cart rope”</b> – the <b>“sin”</b> casts him into the great deep and kills him. This is the meaning of: <b>“that ‘sin, ’ who kills people.”</b>

Paragraph 71

<b>71. “Rabbi Shimon said etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon said to the colleagues: “Please, do not let a word of Torah emerge from your mouths that you do not know or have not heard from a tree that is suitably large, so that you will not cause that sin of needlessly killing masses of people.” They all declared: “May the Merciful One save us; may the Merciful One save us!”</b>
Explanation: <b>“A word of Torah etc.”</b> In other words, if you know it of your own accord, that is all well and good, but if not, you must listen how to serve God <b>“from a tree that is suitably large,”</b> that is, from a great person who can be relied upon, <b>“so that you will not cause”</b> etc.

Paragraph 72

<b>72. “Come and see, with the Torah etc.”</b><br><b>Come and see: The Holy One, blessed be He, created the world with the Torah. [The Sages] established this, as it is stated: “Then I was by Him as a nursling; and I was daily all delight”</b> (Proverbs 8:30)<b>.</b> This is referring to the Torah, which the Holy One, blessed be He, played with for two thousand years before the world was created (as stated in section 22, above). <b>He looked at her once, twice, three, and four times, and then He spoke to them. Ultimately, he performed a deed upon her, in order to teach people not to come to err through her, as it says: “Then He saw it, and declared it; He established it, and also searched it out. And to man He said”</b> (Job 28:27-28)<b>.</b> “He saw it” is the first time; “declared it” is the second; “He established it” is the third; “and also searched it out” is the fourth time. Then He spoke to them, as it is stated: “And to man He said.”

Paragraph 73

<b>73. “And corresponding to these four times etc.”</b><br><b>And corresponding to these four times, as it is stated: “Then He saw it”; “and told it”; He established it”; “and also inquired after it,” the Holy One, blessed be He, created what He created. Before He performed His action, He first brought forth four words, as it is stated: <i>Bereshit bara Elohim et</i></b> [“In the beginning God created”]<b>, which are four, and</b> it is <b>subsequently</b> written<b>: <i>HaShamayim</i> [“the heavens”]. These correspond to the four times that the Holy One, blessed be He, looked in the Torah before He brought out His action for His labor.</b>
Explanation: <b>“And corresponding to these four times etc.”</b> Those four times are the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>: <b>“Then He saw it”</b> is <i>Ḥokhma</i>; <b>“and declared it”</b> is <i>Bina</i>; <b>“He established it”</b> is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; “and also inquired after it” is <i>Malkhut</i>. After those four enclothings, <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, created what He created.”</b> This is also alluded to by the first four words of the Torah: <b><i>Bereshit</i></b> is <i>Ḥokhma</i>; <b><i>bara</i></b> is <i>Bina</i>; <b><i>Elohim</i></b> is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>; <b><i>et</i></b> is <i>Malkhut</i>. After those four enclothings, the heavens were created.

Paragraph 74

<b>74. “Rabbi Elazar was etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar was going to see Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Shimon, son of Lakunya, his father-in-law, and Rabbi Abba was accompanying him. A certain man was driving their donkeys behind them</b>, that is, he was leading their donkeys<b>. Rabbi Abba said: “Let us open the doors of Torah, as now is the time and the hour to rectify ourselves in our ways.”</b> “Driving” [<i>ta’in</i>] means “poking,” just as <i>medukarim</i> (“wounded, Jeremiah 37:10) is translated into Aramaic as <i>meta’anin</i>. By extension, the term refers to donkey drivers, as they would poke the donkeys with a needle to speed them up.

Paragraph 75

<b>75. “Rabbi Elazar began etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar began</b> his discourse <b>and said</b> the following exposition<b>: “You shall keep My Sabbaths”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)<b>. Come and see: The Holy One, blessed be He, created the world in six days. On each and every day, He revealed His action and inserted His power on that day. When did He reveal His action and insert His power? On the fourth day, since those first three days were all hidden and not revealed. Once the fourth day arrived, He brought out the action and strength of all of them.</b>
Explanation: <b>“On that day”</b> – that is, the day of <b>Shabbat.</b> The six weekdays, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, reveal the completion of their works and their power on the day of Shabbat, which is <i>Malkhut</i>.
<b>“When did He reveal His action and insert His power? On the fourth day etc.”</b> [Rabbi Elazar] previously stated that “on each and every day, He revealed His action and inserted His power on <b>the day of Shabbat”,</b> yet here he says that this occurred only <b>“on the fourth day.”</b> This requires explanation. The idea is that <i>Malkhut</i> is called “fourth” and “seventh” – <b>fourth to the patriarchs</b>, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, and <b>seventh to the children</b>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. Rabbi Shimon accordingly said (section 4, above) that <b>“the flowers,”</b> which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>“appeared on the earth” on the third day; “the time of singing has come,” this is the fourth day,</b> when the <i>Malkhut</i> was diminished and ascended for a second gestation; see there. Thus, the <i>Malkhut</i> was emanated from <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> on the third day and was established on the fourth day by means of <i>Netzaḥ</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is the fourth day. Consequently, in this respect she is called <b>“fourth to the patriarchs.”</b> [Rabbi Shimon] subsequently states there: <b>“In our land – this is the day of Shabbat, which is like the land of the living.”</b> Thus, the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called <b>“land,”</b> is an expression of the <b>day of Shabbat</b>, which is <b>“seventh to the children.”</b> It is this matter, of the fourth and seventh, which is clarified here.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Since those first three days were all hidden and not revealed etc.”</b> As long as a level lacks <i>Malkhut</i>, [the level] is considered hidden and unknown. When [the level] attains <i>Malkhut</i>, [the level] attains its wholeness. This is the mystical meaning of the six days of work and Shabbat. [One could think] that the six days of work should be considered more important than the day of Shabbat, since <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, which are the six days of work, are more important than the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the day of Shabbat. However, the [correct] explanation is that each week is a separate level, which lacks <i>Malkhut</i> during the days of work. Therefore, the level is hidden and contains no holiness, since with the absence of <i>Malkhut</i> the first three lights are absent, as stated earlier. It is only upon the revelation of <i>Malkhut</i> in that level, that is, upon the arrival of the day of Shabbat, that the holiness is revealed in the entire level, that is, in the six days of work as well, and the holiness permeates the whole of that week. The same applies to the six days of creation: When <b>the first three days,</b> which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, were emanated before the revelation of <i>Malkhut</i>, they were <b>hidden,</b> without the revelation of the holiness within them. When the <i>Malkhut</i> was emanated, which occurred on the fourth day, the holiness of all four days was then revealed. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Once the fourth day arrived, He brought out the action and strength of all of them,”</b> that is, the holiness was revealed through the work and power of all four days, since <i>Malkhut</i> completes the level.

Paragraph 76

<b>76. “For fire, and water etc.”</b><br><b>For fire, and water, and wind,</b> which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, and the mystical meaning of the first three days<b>, even though they are three supernal foundations,</b> that is, the three <i>sefirot</i> <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>they were all suspended, and the complete work was not revealed until the earth</b>, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>revealed them. Then the work of each and every one of them became known.</b>

Paragraph 77

<b>77. “And if you say, etc.”</b><br><b>And if you say: But it is the third day, as it is stated: “Let the earth put forth grass”</b> (Genesis 1:11) <b>and it is stated: “And the earth brought forth</b> (grass<b>,”</b> Genesis 1:12)<b>.</b> This shows that the revelation of the work of the earth, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, was on the third day. He answers: <b>Rather, even though this is written on the third day,</b> which is the mystical meaning of <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>it was</b> [actually] <b>the fourth day</b>, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i><b>. It was included in the third day so that they</b>, <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>are one, without separation. Subsequently, the fourth day revealed its work, of bringing out the craftsman for the labor of each and every one of them,</b> of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>because the fourth day is the fourth leg of the supernal throne,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, whose four legs are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i><b>.</b>
Explanation: Since <i>Malkhut</i> reveals the holiness of the three days, [<i>Malkhut</i>] ascended and was incorporated in the third day, in order to reveal the unification upon them, that is, as <b>“they are one, without separation.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Subsequently, the fourth day etc.”</b> On the fourth day, the <i>Malkhut</i> served as the completion of only the first three days, and afterwards three more days emerged, which are <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Subsequently, the fourth day revealed its work, of bringing out the craftsman for the labor of each and every one of them.”</b> Once the holiness had been revealed over the first three days, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, called the patriarchs, who are the main aspect of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, then <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, who is the craftsman, went out for his <b>“labor,”</b> and the children – who are called <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, the last three of the six days of creation – were emanated. This is <b>“because the fourth day is the fourth leg of the supernal throne,”</b> as <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is considered a throne for <i>Bina</i>. Just as a throne is not ready until its fourth leg is finished, so too the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is not completed until the <i>Malkhut</i> is revealed in it on the fourth day. He thus could not emanate the three days, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, until after [<i>Malkhut</i>’s] completion [of the first three days].

Paragraph 78

<b>78. “And all the actions of all of them, etc.”</b><br><b>And all the actions of all of them, whether the first three days,</b> which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>or the last three days, </b><i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, <b>were dependent on the day of Shabbat</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i> of the level of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and the whole completion [of that level]<b>. This is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is stated: “And on the seventh day God finished His work”</b> (Genesis 2:2)<b>. This is Shabbat, and this is the fourth leg of the throne.</b> This means to say that Shabbat and the fourth day are both the aspect of <i>Malkhut</i>. [The difference is that] the fourth day is the <i>Malkhut</i> that is incorporated in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, in the <i>Tiferet</i> [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] from the chest and above, whereas the day of Shabbat is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i> in a [state of] fusion with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, face-to-face.
Explanation: <b>“And all the actions of all of them etc.”</b> That is, even though the first three days were completed through the fourth day, they were still not entirely completed through [the fourth day], as they <b>“were dependent on the day of Shabbat.”</b> Thus, on the day of Shabbat they were completed, <b>“whether the first three days,”</b> <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>“or the last three days,”</b> <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. This is the meaning of the verse: <b>“And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made,”</b> that is, all six days, including the first three days.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“This is Shabbat, and this is the fourth leg of the throne.”</b> In other words, the seventh day is <b>Shabbat,</b> that is, seventh of the children. It is also <b>“the fourth leg of the throne,”</b> meaning that it also completes the patriarchs, and Shabbat is their fourth. The reason why the three days <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> were not fully completed on the fourth day, but require the day of Shabbat to complete them, is that there was a diminution in <i>Malkhut</i> on the fourth day, which is called “the diminution of the moon.” As a result, [the <i>Malkhut</i>] returned for a second gestation and its completeness was revealed on the day of Shabbat. Consequently, the day of Shabbat completed the first three days as well.

Paragraph 79

<b>79. “And if you say, if, etc.”</b><br><b>And if you say: If so,</b> that Shabbat is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the verse<b>: “You shall keep My Sabbaths”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)<b>,</b> which are <b>two?</b> He answers: <b>the Shabbat of Shabbat eve,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>and the Shabbat of the actual Shabbat day</b>, which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which illuminates the Shabbat that is <i>Malkhut</i>. <b>They cannot be separated</b>, as they are united face-to-face and are called “two Sabbaths<b>.”</b>
Explanation: His question is as follows: According to the initial explanation, that the two <i>Malkhut</i>s, the fourth [day] and seventh [day], are each whole in themselves, the verse <b>“My Sabbaths”</b> is properly understood, as there are <b>two</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>s]<b>,</b> the fourth and seventh. However, once you have said that [the first three days] are not [fully] completed through the fourth [day], but only after [the fourth] is incorporated in the seventh, then [that implies] they are [really] only one Shabbat. Why, then, does the verse state <b>“My Sabbaths,” two</b>, [which implies two separate Sabbaths]<b>?</b> He answers that it is referring to the aspects of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> that illuminate the holiness of the Shabbat. The day of Shabbat is the male, while the eve of Shabbat is the female. These are the two Sabbaths included in “My Sabbaths,” as they are actually <b>one, without separation.</b> Accordingly, the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is also called “Shabbat.” Understand this.

Paragraph 80

<b>80. “That donkey driver, etc.”</b><br><b>That donkey driver who was driving</b> the donkeys <b>behind them said: “But what is</b> the meaning of: <b>‘And fear My sanctuary?’”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)<b>? [Rabbi Elazar] replied: “This is the sanctity of the Shabbat.” [The driver] responded: “And what is the sanctity of the Shabbat?” He said to [the driver]: “This is holiness that extends from above</b>, from the father and mother<b>.” [The driver] retorted: “If so, you have rendered the Shabbat as not holy in itself; rather, the holiness rests upon it from above</b>, from the father and mother<b>.” Rabbi Abba said: “That is indeed the case</b>, as it is stated: <b>‘And call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of the Lord honorable’</b> (Isaiah 58:13)<b>. The Shabbat is mentioned separately, and ‘the holy of the Lord’ separately.” [The driver] said to [Rabbi Abba]: “If so, who is ‘the holy of the Lord’?” He replied: “It is the holiness that descends from above,</b> from the father and mother, <b>and resides over it</b>, the Shabbat<b>.” [The driver] retorted: “If the holiness that descends from above is called ‘honorable, ’ it appears that the Shabbat itself is not honorable, and</b> [yet] <b>it is stated: “And you shall honor it”</b> (Isaiah 58:13), which indicates that the Shabbat itself is honorable<b>. Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Abba: “Leave that man, as there is a word of wisdom in him, which we do not know.” They said to him: “You say.”</b>
Explanation: [The driver] asked [Rabbi Elazar]: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“and fear My sanctuary?”</b> Since you maintain that the mystical meaning of Shabbat is the aspect of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, why does the verse call them <b>“My sanctuary,”</b> when only the father and mother are called holy?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The terms “father” and “mother” can refer to different aspects of the higher levels. In this context, the reference is to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>.</i>
He replied: <b>“The Shabbat is mentioned separately, and ‘the holy of the Lord’ separately.”</b> [Rabbi Elazar] proved to [the driver] from here that Shabbat itself is the aspect of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, <b>“as it is not holy”</b> in its own right, but because <b>“holiness from above”</b> is extended to it, that is, from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which are called <b>“holy.”</b> The aspect of extension from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] is called <b>“the holy of the Lord,”</b> regarding which it states <b>“and the holy of the Lord honorable.”</b>

Paragraph 81

<b>81. “He began and said, etc.”</b><br><b>He began</b> his discourse <b>and said: “My Sabbaths</b> [<i>et Shabbetotai</i>]<b>”</b> (Leviticus 19:30). <b><i>Et</i> comes to include the Shabbat boundary, which is two thousand cubits in each direction. For this reason</b> the verse <b>added</b> the word <b><i>et</i>,</b> <i>alef</i>-<i>tav</i><b>. <i>Shabbetotai</i>,</b> in the plural, <b>is the higher Shabbat and the lower Shabbat, which are two, incorporated together and sealed together.</b>
Explanation: <b>“<i>Et</i> comes to include etc.”</b> Although it is stated: “Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29), by means of the word <b><i>et</i></b> the Torah added two thousand cubits in each direction, from beyond one’s place. <b><i>Et</i></b> is the mystical meaning of the <i>Malkhut</i> from whose fusion the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> emerged, which shine on Shabbat in addition to the illumination of the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. The <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are the mystical meaning of two thousand. thus states <b>“for this reason, it added <i>et</i>,”</b> as <b><i>et</i></b> thereby comes to include.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“<i>Shabbetotai</i> is the higher Shabbat and the lower Shabbat.”</b> The higher Shabbat is <i>Tevuna</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the female component of the lower aspect of <i>Bina</i> called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.</i> while the lower Sabbath is <i>Malkhut</i>, the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are called <b><i>Mi</i></b> and <b><i>Ma</i></b> (see section 8, above), or <b>“the higher world”</b> and <b>“the lower world”;</b> see there. They are <b>“incorporated together”</b> because on Shabbat [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend and enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma.</i> Thus, <i>Tevuna</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> are <b>incorporated</b> in each other <b>together</b> because the lower [entity] that ascends to the higher [entity] becomes like [the higher entity]. They are <b>“sealed together”</b> because despite this [incorporation], the <i>Malkhut</i> still does not become actual <i>Tevuna</i> without any distinction between them. This is because these brains of <i>Tevuna</i> are received by <i>Malkhut</i> only above, in the place of <i>Tevuna</i>, whereas in the actual place of <i>Malkhut</i>, below, [<i>Malkhut</i>] does not have these brains. In that sense, the <i>Malkhut</i> is still considered sealed [off from the brains]. He adds that <i>Tevuna</i> also suffers from the sealed state of <i>Malkhut</i>, for since their brains are <b>incorporated together</b>, they are therefore also <b>sealed together</b>. It follows that although <i>Tevuna</i> by itself is not sealed at all – as now on Shabbat [<i>Tevuna</i>] is a unified <i>partzuf</i> with <i>Imma Ila’ah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Imma Ila’ah</i> is the female aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>.</i> – nevertheless, since the brains [of <i>Tevuna</i>] illuminate in one incorporation with the brains of the <i>Malkhut</i>, the sealing of <i>Malkhut</i> is therefore also detectable in the brains of <i>Tevuna</i>.

Paragraph 82

<b>82. “Another Shabbat was left, etc.”</b><br><b>Another Shabbat was left, which was not mentioned, and she was ashamed. She said before Him: “Master of the Universe, since the day You made me, I have been called Shabbat, and there is no day without a night.” He said to her: “My daughter, you are Shabbat and I called you Shabbat. However, I am hereby crowning you with the highest crown.” He issued a declaration, saying: “Fear My sanctuary.” This is the Shabbat of Shabbat eve, which is fear and in which fear resides. Who is she?</b> He answers: <b>That which the Holy One, blessed be He, incorporated together and said, “I am the Lord</b>,” as “I” is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the mystical meaning of Shabbat eve, [and] “the Lord” is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and in the words <b>“I am the Lord”</b> they were incorporated together<b>. And I heard from my father that he said this and inferred</b> that the word <b><i>et</i> comes to include the Shabbat boundary. <i>Shabbetotai</i>,</b> in the plural, <b>is the circle and square within it, which are two</b>, that is, two Shabbatot<b>. Corresponding to these two, there are two sanctities that we should mention: One is, “And</b> [the heaven and the earth] <b>were finished</b> [<i>Ve-yekhulu</i>]<b>”</b> (Genesis 2:1), <b>and</b> [the other] <b>one is Kiddush.</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Kiddush” refers to the recitation of certain verses from the Torah on the Sabbath in order to sanctify the day.</i> [The passage of] <b>“And they were finished” consists of thirty-five words, and in the Kiddush that we sanctify there are thirty-five words. Together, these all amount to the seventy names, with which the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Assembly of Israel are crowned.</b>

Paragraph 83

<b>83. “And because this circle and square, etc.”</b><br><b>And because this circle and square are “My Sabbaths” they are both incorporated in “keep</b> [<i>shamor</i>]<b>,” as it is stated: “Keep</b> My Sabbaths<b>”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)<b>. However, the higher Shabbat is not incorporated in “keep” but in “remember</b> [<i>zakhor</i>]<b>,” since the supernal king,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, <b>was completed in “remember.” For this reason, the <i>Bina</i> is called a “king who has peace,” as his peace is “remember.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for “peace” is the word “<i>shalom</i>,” which shares its linguistic and conceptual root with the word <i>hushlam</i> in the previous line, meaning “completed.” In fact, “peace,” while colloquially used as a translation for <i>shalom</i>, is actually less accurate a translation than alternative words like “harmony,” “wholeness,” and “completeness.” In this context, since <i>Bina</i> was completed through “<i>zakhor</i>,” it is called the “king who has completeness.”</i> <b>Therefore, there is no dispute above.</b>
Explanation: <b>“Another Shabbat was left, etc.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called “the middle point.” [This aspect of <i>Malkhut</i>] does not receive brains even during the day of Shabbat, as [this aspect] itself is the mystical meaning of the <i>manula</i> (lock), and all the brains come only in the mystical meaning of the <i>miftaḥa</i> (key), which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> (as stated in section 42, above). Since [the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>] did not receive brains, it was in a state of shame.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Another Shabbat was left, which was not mentioned.”</b> This is the middle point that was not mentioned, which did not receive brains <b>and was ashamed. “She said before Him etc.” –</b> she claimed: <b>“Since the day You made me,”</b> that is, at the beginning of my emanation in the world of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, <b>“I have been called Shabbat.”</b> All the brains were bestowed through me, as there was no other <i>Malkhut</i> in [the level of] <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, but merely the middle point, and it was diminished only during the second constriction, in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>.
She further contended: <b>“And there is no day without a night.”</b> This is a most wondrous mystical insight, as she argued that even on the first day it is stated: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5), [indicating] that the unity is revealed over day and night together. If so, why wasn’t night mentioned on the Shabbat of creation, as “night” is not written on the seventh day of the act of creation. <b>“He said to her...”</b> that is, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to her: <b>“You are Shabbat”</b> for the future, in the seventh millennium, on the day that is all Shabbat, <b>“and I called you Shabbat,”</b> that is, from the day I made you in the world of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, as stated.
<b>“However, I am hereby crowning you etc.”</b> In other words, the Holy One, blessed be He, raised her up, so that she would serve in the first three of the <i>partzufim</i> (as stated in section 41, above). She was established as <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, in the mystical meaning of “unknown air; see there. <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> are called “the holy of holies,” and thus she too is in the mystical meaning of the supernal holiness.
<b>“He issued a declaration, saying: ‘Fear My sanctuary. ’”</b> Through the establishing [of <i>Malkhut</i>] in the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, [this <i>Malkhut</i>] is in the mystical meaning of a sanctuary, which is the mystical meaning of: “Fear My sanctuaries.” Thus, the <i>Malkhut</i> has now earned a supernal crown, more than it had in the world of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>. [In the world of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, the <i>Malkhut</i> was serving at the place of the bottom end of the <i>sefirot</i>, in [the usual] place [of <i>Malkhut</i>], whereas now [<i>Malkhut</i>] has risen to serve in the place of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>, in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, who are called “holy of holies.” He accordingly states: <b>“I am hereby crowning you with the highest crown.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“This is the Shabbat of Shabbat eve, which is fear etc.”</b> The <i>Malkhut</i> is called <b>“fear,”</b> as the constriction was performed upon <i>Malkhut</i>, so that it should not receive according to its measure. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the first constriction</i> [<i>Malkhut</i>] does not use the direct light [that flows] from above downward for itself, but only the returning light, because [<i>Malkhut</i>] is established with a partition, with startling and fright, so that the light will not pass from the partition downward (as stated in section 56, above, s. v. <i>Ve-kulhu</i>; see there). <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“Startling and fright” is a phrase often employed in Torah texts to imply great intensity or precision, as a result of spiritual awe or fear.</i> Now, upon the ascent [of <i>Malkhut</i>] to the supernal holiness of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], a supernal <b>“fear resides”</b> in [<i>Malkhut</i>], since the supernal <i>Havaya</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> then resides in [<i>Malkhut</i>]. This is the mystical meaning the Shabbat eve that was now established, in accordance with her claim, <b>“there is no day without a night,”</b> and <b>“this is the Shabbat of Shabbat eve.”</b> The attribute of night is also incorporated in the day of Shabbat. He then asks: <b>“What is he”;</b> what is the fear that resides in it? <b>“That which the Holy One, blessed be He, incorporated together and said, ‘I am the Lord’,”</b> since the supernal <i>Havaya</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> is incorporated in [<i>Malkhut</i>], and [the Torah] stated, “I am the Lord.” In order to clarify this, he cites a teaching that he heard from his father.
The explanation of these things is that the image of the circle conveys that the light shines there equally in all places, and there is no aspect of judgment there at all, on account of which any change should occur in the measure of illumination. <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of judgment refers to limitations and boundaries. The imagery of a circle is intended to convey the concept of light that is uniform, shining equally everywhere with no limitations or differences in its illumination.</i> The image of the square conveys that there is an aspect of judgment there, because of which it is possible to differentiate between right and left, or east and west. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The presence of boundaries resulting from these judgments means there are differences in the quality of the light “here” versus “there.” The very presence of these kinds of distinctions and differences in the light give rise to relativity and areas, left and right, east and west, and other spatial comparisons.</i> This is why the head is regarded as in the shape of a circle, relative to the body, which is a square. For in the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which is the head, there are no judgments, whereas there are judgments in the body, as generally there is right and left in the body, front and back. <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This concept refers to the conceptual head and body of the <i>partzufim</i>, as well as the physical head and body of a human being. The head is a circular shape, and is a unit, while the body is far more linear and dispersed, with multiple regions and aspects.</i>
Now, you already know the mystical meaning of Shabbat, that [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend and enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma,</i> forming] the aspect of <b>“the higher Shabbat and the lower Shabbat are incorporated together,”</b> as stated above. The higher Shabbat, which is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, is considered the aspect of <b>“circle,”</b> while the lower Shabbat, which is [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, the aspect of the body, is considered the aspect of <b>“square.”</b> Accordingly, on Shabbat the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of the square ascend and are incorporated in the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which are the aspect of circle. He thus states: <b>“<i>Shabbetotai</i> is the circle and square within it, which are two.”</b> This is why the verse states <b>“My Sabbaths</b> [<i>Shabbetotai</i>],” in order to include two Shabbatot: The higher Shabbat, which is a <b>“circle,”</b> and the <b>“square”</b> inside it, which is the lower Shabbat that ascended and was incorporated within it.
Now, the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> are called <b>“seventy names,”</b> or “seventy crowns,” as <i>ayin</i> [70] alludes to <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Since these brains are revealed only through the ascent of the lower Shabbat to the higher one, the brains are thus divided between the pair of them: Half of them to the higher Shabbat and half of them to the lower Shabbat. Consequently, “[the passage of] <b>‘and they were finished’ consists of thirty-five words,”</b> which are half of the brains in the higher Shabbat, while Kiddush itself contains thirty-five words, alluding to the half of the brains that are in the lower Shabbat. These are the brains that <b>“the Assembly of Israel,”</b> which is the <i>Malkhut</i> that is called Shabbat, is <b>“crowned.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And because this circle and square etc.”</b> In other words, since the circle and the square are together incorporated in <b>“My Sabbaths,”</b> it follows that the <i>brains</i> of the circle are also in the aspect of <b>“keep,”</b> like the square, <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“Keep” (<i>shamor</i>) refers to the laws of the Sabbath that restrict a person from certain activities during the Sabbath. These are limitations (judgments) and they are associated with the word <i>shamor</i> and the concept of the square. In contrast, the word <i>zakhor</i> (remember) refers to the positive commandments of the Sabbath, the actions in which a person should actively engage in order to celebrate the Sabbath. These are associated with the circle.</i> even though “keep” indicates <i>judgment</i> and a boundary from which one should keep his distance. In the higher Shabbat, which is a circle, there is no <i>judgment (as stated below). Nevertheless, due to</i> its mingling together with the Shabbat of a square, the aspect of <b>“keep”</b> also applies to the circle.
<b>“However, the higher Shabbat is not incorporated in ‘keep. ’”</b> The higher Shabbat itself is incorporated in <b>“remember”</b> rather than <b>“keep,”</b> since the supernal king was completed in “remember,” and contains no expression of judgment at all, that it should be suitable to say <b>“keep”</b> about him, as “keep” applies only to the <i>Nukba</i>. Nevertheless, with respect to the incorporation of the higher Shabbat in the lower Shabbat, <b>“keep”</b> applies to both of them together, although not to the higher Shabbat by itself.
<b>“As his peace is ‘remember. ’ Therefore, there is no dispute above. ’”</b> The supernal king is the mystical meaning of the <i>Bina</i> that was completed with [the letter] <i>yod</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the male garments (as stated in section 17 above; see there). This indicates that there is no aspect of <b>dispute</b> there at all, that is, it is without any judgments, for this is why [this Shabbat] is called “a circle” (as explained above). However, the lower Shabbat, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ma</i>, was completed with [the letter] <i>heh</i>, and therefore there is [the aspect of] dispute in [this lower Shabbat], that is, right and left. <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of “dispute” here is the synonymous with the previous concepts of judgments and differences. When all is uniform, there are no differences, hence no “disputes.” Relative differences give rise to dispute between different areas.</i> For this reason, it is called a “square.”

Paragraph 84

<b>84. “For there are two ‘peaces, ’ etc.”</b><br><b>For there are two “peaces” below. One is Jacob,</b> which is <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>and</b> [the other] <b>one is Joseph</b>, which is <i>Yesod</i><b>. This is why</b> “peace” <b>is written twice: “Peace, peace, to he who is far off and to he who is near”</b> (Isaiah 57:19)<b>. “To he who is far” is Jacob; “and to he who is near” is Joseph. “To he who is far,” as it is stated: “From afar the Lord appeared to me”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2)<b>, and likewise: “And his sister stood afar off”</b> (Exodus 2:4)<b>. “To he who is near</b> [<i>ve-lakarov</i>]<b>,” as it is stated: “New ones, who came up recently</b> [<i>mi-karov</i>]<b>”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:17)<b>.</b>
Explanation: <b>“For there are two ‘peaces’ below, etc.”</b> “Below” means in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which contain the aspect of <b>Jacob,</b> which is <i>Tiferet</i>, and also the aspect of <b>Joseph,</b> which is <i>Yesod</i>. This alludes to the two aspects of fusion that are in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, since <b>“peace”</b> is the mystical meaning of a [fusion through collision]. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>shalom</i>, often simply translated as “peace,” comes from the root <i>shalem</i>, which means “wholeness.” A more accurate translation for <i>shalom</i> is “harmony,” expressing the harmonious relationships between different parts, forming a whole. This concept underlies the idea here that <i>shalom</i> is the mystical meaning of fusion between male and female (<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>).</i> There is the aspect of higher fusion, to drawing forth the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and there is a lower fusion, for drawing forth [the light of giving]. The higher one is the mystical meaning of <b>Jacob</b> and the lower one is the mystical meaning of <b>Joseph</b>. 
As explained earlier (section 14, fourth paragraph), the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] cannot receive the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> without [the light of giving], and therefore the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> is considered to be far from them, since they can receive [the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] only by enclothing it in [the light of giving]. This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“From afar the Lord appeared to me,”</b> since the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is far from him and he needs to enclothe [it] in order to receive it.
Therefore, Jacob’s aspect of <b>peace</b> is called <b>“far,”</b> while the lower fusion, which is the <b>peace</b> of Joseph, is called <b>“near,”</b> for it is received without clothing [of the light of giving]. Moreover, because of the height of [the light of giving in the aspect of Joseph], it can receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> as well (as stated in section 14). This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“Peace, peace, to he who is far off and to he who is near,”</b> [referring to] two “peaces,” of <b>Jacob and Joseph,</b> which always operate in the fusion of maturity of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. There is a dispute in these <b>“two peaces”</b> that are in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which are considered the mystical meaning of a <b>square,</b> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] end in [the letter] <i>heh</i>, which is the mystical meaning of female. This is not the case for the supernal king, the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i>; [this structure] ends in [the letter] <i>yod</i>, the mystical meaning of male, and there is no dispute in [this structure]. Even the dynamic of <b>far and near</b> does not apply in <i>Bina</i> itself, as [<i>Bina</i>] is of the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], and the first three can receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> <b>“in the near,”</b> that is, they do not need to enclothe [the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] in [the light of giving] at all, and they receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> without [the light of giving]. This is alluded to above, that <b>“the supernal king”</b> is the “king who has peace” (section 83), and [the supernal king] does not contain <b>two “peaces,”</b> the way [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [do].

Paragraph 85

<b>85. “‘From afar, ’ this is the uppermost point etc.”</b><br><b>“From afar”</b> (Jeremiah 31:2)<b>, this is the uppermost point that stands in His sanctuary. With regard to this, it is written “you shall keep”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)<b>,</b> that is, <b>it is included in “keep.” “And you shall fear My sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 19:30) <b>is the point that is positioned in the middle, which should be feared most of all, as its punishment is death, and this is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14)<b>. Who is he “who profanes it”? It is one who enters the space of the circle and the square, the place where that point resides, and impairs it – he “shall surely be put to death.” And with regard to this, it is stated: “you shall fear.” Now, that point is called “I”</b> (Leviticus 19:30)<b>, upon which there resides that uppermost sealed one who was not revealed, which is <i>Havaya</i>, and</b> “I” and <i>Havaya</i> <b>are all one.</b> <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba alighted</b> from their donkeys <b>and kissed him, saying: “But what is all that wisdom that is under your hand; and</b> [yet] <b>you are driving our donkeys behind us!” They said to him: “Who are you?” He replied: “Do not ask who I am; rather, I and you shall walk along and engage in Torah, and each shall say words of wisdom to light the path.”</b>
Explanation: <b>“From afar,” this is the uppermost point etc.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the <i>miftaḥa</i> (key), from which the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths is bestowed (as stated in section 42, above; see there). It is the mystical meaning of the [letter] <i>bet</i> of <i>Bereshit</i>, which is called <b>“a point in His sanctuary,”</b> as from there [flows] the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> for [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend and enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>. [It is] then that the two Shabbatot, the higher Shabbat and the lower Shabbat, are incorporated together, and with regard to them it is stated: <b>“From afar the Lord appeared to me,”</b> as the <b>[</b><i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> can receive [the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] only with the enclothing of [the light of giving] (as stated below).
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“‘From afar, ’ this is the uppermost point that stands in His sanctuary.”</b> The <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, which are termed <b>“a point in His sanctuary,”</b> are called [“from afar”] because they are afar with respect to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and must be enclothed in [the light of giving] of the lower world that is the mystical meaning of <b><i>Ma</i></b> that ends at the <i>Nukba</i> (as stated in section 16, above, s. v. <i>Begin</i>). <b>“With regard to this, it is written ‘you shall keep, ’ it is included in ‘keep. ’”</b> Since [these higher <i>sefirot</i>] require the lower fusion of <b><i>Ma</i></b> that ends at the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called <b>“keep [<i>shamor</i>],”</b> it follows that the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is also included in <b>“keep,”</b> and therefore <b>“You shall keep My Sabbaths”</b> is written in reference to [the inclusion of both the higher and lower Shabbatot]. [Thus, ] the higher Shabbat that is incorporated in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> is included in the attribute of “keep.” [However, they are not both] in “remember,” since they necessarily end in the <i>Nukba</i>, in order to receive the height of [the light of giving], as explained. Only <b>the supernal king</b>, <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> by themselves, which receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> from “He who is near,” that is, without the enclothing of [the light of giving], are considered to end in “remember” and are called <b>“remember”</b> rather than <b>“keep.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The language of “end” refers to demarcations between the higher and lower structural reasons under discussion in this section. The “endpoint” of the higher region is <i>zakhor</i>, “remember,”, while the lower region ends at the point of the <i>Nukba</i>, the endpoint of the region of <i>shamor</i>, “keep.”.</i>
<b>“‘And you shall fear My sanctuary’ is the point that is positioned in the middle.”</b> This is the aspect of the essence of <i>manula</i> (lock), which was established in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, in the mystical meaning of “unknown air,” which is the mystical meaning of the middle point. This [point] operates only in <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, not in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, and therefore there is no grasp [of this higher level] in the [level of] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, who are the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> [of <i>Atzilut</i>]. All the <i>Ḥokhma</i> that is bestowed in the world of <i>Atzilut</i> is only from the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, as there the <i>miftaḥa</i> (key) operates, which is called <b>“a point in His sanctuary”</b> (as stated below). Since the <i>manula</i> (lock) was established in the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, it is called “My sanctuary” (as stated in section 41, above, 3rd paragraph), and consequently fear rests upon [the <i>manula</i> (lock)] (see there). This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“‘And you shall fear My sanctuary’ is the point that is positioned in the middle.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Who is he ‘who profanes it’ etc.”</b> As you already know, the <b>circle</b> is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), and the <b>square</b> is [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and are incorporated <b>within the circle</b>. The <i>Malkhut</i> of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] is the mystical meaning of the point within them. This <i>Malkhut</i> has two aspects, namely the <b><i>manula</i></b> and <b><i>miftaḥa</i></b>. The <i>miftaḥa</i> (key) is called <b>“a point in His sanctuary,”</b> and is only the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of [that] <i>Malkhut</i>, and it operates solely in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. <i>Manula</i> (lock) is the [aspect of] <i>Malkhut</i> in <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the actual <b>middle point</b>, and it operates solely in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] (as stated below). This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“It is one who enters the space of the circle and the square,”</b> that is, to the aspect of <i>Malkhut</i> of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], which is a <b>“space,”</b> as its air is unknown, <b>“to the place where that point resides,”</b> that is, to the place of the <b>“middle”</b> point, <b>“and impairs it,”</b> meaning that he wants to draw light into that <b>“space.”</b> He <b>“shall surely be put to death,”</b> as it is forbidden to draw any light into [that space]. <b>“And with regard to this, it is written ‘you shall fear, ’”</b> that is, the verse <b>“And you shall fear My sanctuary,”</b> which refers to <b>the middle point</b>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Now, that point etc.”</b> The point itself is called <b>“I,”</b> <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are <b><i>Havaya</i> that “resides” over</b> this <b>point</b>. This is why they are <b>“the uppermost sealed one that was not revealed,”</b> as they cannot be grasped by thought at all, and this is <b>“I, <i>Havaya</i>.” “And they are all one,”</b> that is, they are considered one, for this is why the point is also called <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, that is, <b>“And you shall fear My sanctuary,”</b> as the point itself is regarded as holy, like the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma,</i> since they are one.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba alighted and kissed him.”</b> In order to continue explaining this section, I have to elucidate further this incident of the man who was driving the donkeys. Know that this <b>path on which Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba were walking</b> should not be understood literally. Rather, it is the mystical meaning of “the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, that shines more and more until the perfect day” (Proverbs 4:18). When it says that [Rabbi Elazar] was going to see <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Shimon, son of Lakunya, his father-in-law</b> [section 74], this contains an allusion to the measure of their level at that time. For <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> has his own <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which are the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>. He also has his wife’s <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, who are <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. First, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> attains the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> of his <i>Nukba</i> [female], who are <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, called the brains of <i>neshama</i>. Then [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] rises to a higher level and attains his own <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, who are the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, called the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. Now, the righteous who traverse the levels are a chariot for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Since that <b>path on which Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba were walking</b> was in the brains of <i>neshama</i>, the allusion is provided that Rabbi Elazar went to see his <b>father-in-law</b>, that is, the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> of his <i>Nukba</i> [female], who is the brains of <i>neshama</i>.
The concept here is that one <b>who was driving their donkeys behind them</b> is the mystical meaning of the assistance to the souls of the righteous, which is sent to them from above in order to raise them from one level to the next. Were it not for this assistance, which the Holy One, blessed be He, sends to the righteous, they would be unable to emerge from their level and ascend higher. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, sends to each and every righteous person a lofty soul from above, to each of them according to his worth and level, which assists him on his path. Now, at the outset the righteous person does not recognize that soul at all, and it seems to him that it is a very lowly soul that is accompanying him on his path. This is called “the gestation of the soul of the righteous,” that is, the soul from above has not yet completed its assistance, and therefore its identity is completely indiscernible. However, once [this soul] has completed its assistance and brought the righteous person to the desired level, he recognizes [this soul] and perceives its loftiness, and this is called “the revelation of the soul of the righteous.”
Now, this soul, which came to assist Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba, was the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna Saba. It is a very noble soul, immeasurably lofty, and it is the aspect of the light of <i>yeḥida</i>. However, at first [this soul] came to them in the form of gestation, and they only perceived the [soul] characterized as a donkey driver, meaning, an owner of donkeys. [This person’s] profession is to transport passengers on his donkeys from place to place, while he himself walks on foot before his donkeys, leading them. This is why he is called the “donkey [<i>ḥamrei</i>] driver,” as he leads the donkeys [<i>ḥamorim</i>]. The Sages state that “most donkey drivers [<i>ḥamorin</i>] are wicked” [<i>Kiddushin</i> 82a], and this [profession] represents the lowliest form.
This is the meaning of Rabbi Abba’s statement: <b>“Let us open the doors of Torah, as now is the time and the hour to rectify ourselves in our ways”</b> [section 74], that is, to open the channels of the soul by opening the gates to the secrets of Torah, in order to be rectified on the path of the Holy One, blessed be He, on which they were walking. Rabbi Elazar interpreted the verse <b>“You shall keep My Sabbaths”</b> relative to the level in which he was positioned, that is, from [the perspective of] the brains of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is the mystical meaning of <b>“to see his father-in-law,”</b> as stated. [Rabbi Elazar] accordingly explained that the Shabbat itself is considered the aspect of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that are not of the aspect of holy, but which draw from the holy, that is, from the brains of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> draw forth on the day of Shabbat. Regarding these brains, they expounded the verse “And you shall fear My sanctuary,” as [referring to] the <i>Ḥokhma</i> that comes from the low brains of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> (as stated in section 7, above, s. v. <i>Ve-zeh amaro</i>) for [these brains] are still poised for a question, and therefore there is an aspect of <b>fear</b> in that holiness. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See section 7 above for the full explanation of the concept of this level standing poised for a question.</i>
Here, that one <b>who was driving their donkeys behind them</b> assisted them, and revealed the mystical meaning of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> within them. He explained <b>“You shall keep My Sabbaths”</b> as referring to the higher Shabbat and the lower Shabbat that come together by means of the ascent of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> to the place of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, [where] the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> themselves become holy, in the mystical meaning of <b>a square within a circle</b>. With regard to them it was not stated <b>“fear,”</b> but only <b>“keep,”</b> since the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> rebuff all the external forces, and all judgments are removed on the day of Shabbat, and in this respect, there is no <b>fear</b> there. As for the verse “<b>And you shall fear My sanctuary,”</b> he interpreted it to them as referring to <b>the middle point</b>, which operates in the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, that is, the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, where [the intellect] has no grasp at all, and there, there is <b>fear</b>.
With that [explanation], the soul [of the donkey driver] completed its task, because it had brought them to the attainment of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, and then they merited the revelation of the soul of the righteous person, as they now recognized the value of that soul [of the donkey driver]. Therefore, <b>“Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba alighted and kissed him,”</b> since the attainment of a level is expressed as the act of kissing. However, in truth, the task of that soul had not yet been completed, because it still had to assist them in attaining the light of <i>yeḥida</i>, as stated here. Nevertheless, since the attainment of [the brains of] <i>ḥaya</i> alone is a whole level in and of itself, it is therefore considered that the soul was revealed to them in that measure [of <i>ḥaya</i>]. This is the mystical meaning of why they now thought that [the donkey driver] was the <b>son of Rav Hamnuna Saba</b>, rather than Rav Hamnuna Saba himself. This is because Rav Hamnuna Saba [represents] the aspect of <i>yeḥida</i>, whereas his son is the aspect of <i>ḥaya</i>. Consequently, because they now attained only <i>ḥaya</i>, they therefore erred with regard to him, thinking that he was Rav Hamnuna Saba’s son. However, further along, after he informed them of the mystical meaning of the verse concerning Benayahu, son of Yehoyada, which is the revelation of the level of <i>yeḥida</i>, he was then revealed them in totality and they saw that he was <b>Rav Hamnuna Saba</b> himself.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>He said to them, “do not ask who I am,”</b> as they themselves sensed that they had not yet recognized him completely (as stated just above), for the assisting task of that soul had not yet been completed. They therefore entreated him to reveal his name. However, he replied that they should not ask about his name because they were in need of further revelations of secrets of the Torah. In other words, the path was not yet fully rectified. This is the meaning of his statement to them: <b>“Rather, I and you shall walk along and engage in Torah,”</b> for you still need me to assist you in engaging in Torah. <b>“And each shall say words of wisdom to light the path,”</b> for we still need to illuminate the way because we have not yet reached our destination.

Paragraph 86

<b>86. “They said to him, who etc.”</b><br><b>They said to him: “Who let you come here, to be a donkey driver?” He replied: “</b>The <b><i>yod</i> waged war against two letters, <i>kaf</i> and <i>samekh</i>, to come and connect with me.</b> The <b><i>kaf</i> did not wish to depart from her place and connect</b> with me<b>, because she cannot be for a moment other than within it</b>, the throne [<i>kise</i>] (as stated in section 31, above)<b>.</b> The <b><i>samekh</i> did not wish to leave her place because she must support [<i>lismokh</i>] those who are fallen</b> (as stated in section 28, above)<b>, for they cannot be without the <i>samekh</i>.</b>

Paragraph 87

<b>87. “The <i>yod</i> came to etc.”</b><br>The <b><i>yod</i> came to me by herself; kissed me, embraced me, wept with me, and said to me: “My son, what shall I do for you? But I am hereby departing, and I will be filled with several good things and concealed, supernal and precious letters,</b> and <b>then I will come to you and I will assist you. And I will give you the inheritance of two letters, which are loftier than the ones that have departed, and they are <i>yod</i>-<i>shin</i>, supernal <i>yod</i> and supernal <i>shin</i>, which will be for you treasures filled with everything. For this reason, my son, go and drive donkeys.” This is why I am walking in this manner.</b>
Explanation: As you already know, the mystical meaning of “driving donkeys” is the mystical meaning of the gestation of the soul of the righteous, who comes to assist one who is walking in the paths of God, to emerge from his level and arrive at a more important level, like those donkey drivers who assist people go from place to place on their donkeys. Now, at that [same] time, the righteous also falls from his previous level and reaches a state of gestation of a new level, like the soul aspect that comes to assist him. This state of gestation means a loss of brains. This is what they wanted to know from him: “How did the Holy One, blessed be He, arrange things so that you would come to us through gestation, for through this, we have experienced a loss of brains? This is the meaning of the question: <b>“Who let you come here, to be a donkey driver?”</b> [section 86].
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He replied, the <i>yod</i> waged war against two letters, <i>kaf</i> and <i>samekh</i>, to come and connect with me.” <i>Yod</i></b> is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as is known. The level of the brains of <i>neshama</i> is called <b><i>kes</i></b> [“throne”], as in <i>kese ha-kavod</i> [“Throne of Glory”]. This is because the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> come enclothed and covered in [the brains of <i>neshama</i>], and are not revealed. When the time came to attain the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, which is <b><i>yod</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, the level with which I have come to reward you, in truth the <i>Ḥokhma</i> did want to connect to me the brains of <b><i>kes</i></b> as well. These are the brains of <i>neshama</i> that were previously in you, and <b>“<i>yod</i> waged war”</b> against them. However, <b>“the <i>kaf</i> did not wish to depart from her place and connect, because she cannot be for a moment other than within it.”</b> The explanation [of this] is that the <i>Malkhut</i> of the upper [level], which is enclothed in the lower [level], is the mystical meaning of <b><i>kaf</i></b> (as stated in section 31 above, s. v. <i>U-lefikhakh</i>, see there). As explained there, when the <i>kaf</i> wished to descend from the throne, <b>“the throne shook, and all the worlds shook on the verge of falling.”</b> [This was] because all the connections of the levels with one another, from the top of <i>Atzilut</i> to the bottom of <i>Asiya</i>, occur through the higher <i>Malkhut</i> that is enclothed in the lower [<i>Malkhut</i>]. Therefore, [the <i>kaf</i>] cannot descend from her place, that is, from the level of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is the height of <i>neshama</i>, even <b>“for a moment,”</b> as a break cannot be formed in the levels.
[The <i>Zohar</i> continues:] <b>“The <i>samekh</i> did not wish to leave her place because she must support [<i>lismokh</i>] those who are fallen, for they cannot be without the <i>samekh</i>.”</b> The mystical meaning of the <b><i>samekh</i></b> is the essence of the brains that the <i>neshama</i> receives from <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which are bestowed upon [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in their phase of immaturity. [Those brains of the <i>samekh</i>] support [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of immaturity] so that they will not fall out from <i>Atzilut</i> (as stated in section 28, above, s. v. <i>De’it</i>; see there). [The <i>samekh</i>] must therefore remain permanently in her place, unchanged. The explanation of this is that the levels are fixed, and only the souls undergo changes when they transition from one level to another. Consequently, the brains of <i>neshama</i> did not wish to bond with the <b><i>yod</i></b>, which is the level of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and connect to the soul of <b>Rav Hamnuna Saba</b>, upon its descent to assist Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba. [This is] because these [brains] required a new [process] of construction and drawing forth of brains, following the usual order, beginning with gestation... until the height of <i>ḥaya</i>.
This is the meaning of the statement [here], in section 87: <b>“The <i>yod</i> came to me by herself etc.”</b> In other words, she came to me without the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), which is called <b><i>samekh</i></b> (as stated just above). As is known, the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i> cannot be enclothed without a height of [the light of giving], which is drawn from the <b><i>samekh</i></b>, as stated. He thus states that since the <b><i>yod</i></b> came to me <b>by herself</b>, without the height of [the light of giving], she therefore <b>“kissed me, embraced me, wept with me, and said to me, my son, what shall I do for you?”</b> That is, [the <i>yod</i>] <b>kissed</b> him and <b>embraced</b> him, because she wanted to be enclothed without [the light of giving], and she therefore wept with him and declared: <b>“My son, what shall I do for you,</b> as I have no scheme for enclothing in you.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“But I am hereby departing, and I will be filled with several good things and concealed, etc.”</b> In other words, “I must therefore now depart, and you will enter into the mystical meaning of gestation, in order that you will be built by yourself with all the aspects of gestation, infancy and brains anew. Then I will return to you with whole brains, filled with everything.” Know that for the reason stated here, this applies to any new level, for whenever a person needs to receive a new level, he must undergo the departure of the previous brains and begin acquiring anew the aspect of <i>nefesh</i> that is called gestation, followed by infancy, which is the mystical meaning of the light of <i>ruaḥ</i>, as though he had never acquired any level before. This is why she said: <b>“For this reason, my son, go and drive donkeys,”</b> as it is impossible to extend anything from the previous level, and therefore you must start the gestation anew. This is called <b>“driving donkeys.”</b>
[The <i>yod</i>] thus refers to <b>“the inheritance of two letters...”</b> which is the mystical meaning of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, called “the <b>inheritance</b> of the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.” They are likewise called <b><i>yod</i>-<i>shin</i></b> [<i>yesh</i>], as <b><i>yod</i></b> is <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <b><i>shin</i></b> is <i>Bina</i>, and these [brains] are certainly more important that those brains of <i>neshama</i> that departed. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance [<i>yesh</i>], and that I may fill their treasuries” (Proverbs 8:21), and it is the meaning of the statement <b>“which will be for you treasures filled with everything,”</b> that is, in the measure of the verse “and that I may fill their treasuries.”

Paragraph 88

<b>88. “Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba rejoiced etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba rejoiced and wept, saying, “Go, ride</b> the donkey<b>, and we will drive it behind you.”</b> That is, he should ride and they would lead the donkey. <b>He said to them: “Didn’t I tell you that it is the King’s order, until that donkey driver arrives?”</b> This is an allusion to the Messiah, regarding whom it is stated: “Lowly, and riding upon a donkey” (Zechariah 9:9). <b>They replied: “But you have not told us your name; where is your dwelling place?” He responded: “My dwelling place is good and of great value [<i>aiyla</i>] to me. It is one tower floating in the air, great and distinguished. Those who dwell in that tower are the Holy One, blessed be He, and one poor man. This is my dwelling place, but I was exiled from there, and I drive donkeys.” Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Elazar looked at him, and his words were delightful to them, as they were as sweet as manna and as honey. They said to him: “If you tell us your father’s name, we will kiss the dust of your feet.” He replied: “But why? It is not my way to pride myself in the Torah in that manner.”</b> The term <i>aiyla</i> has a similar meaning to its use in the phrase “when they divided it according to the value [<i>be’iluya</i>],” (<i>Kiddushin</i> 42b).
Explanation: Now that they recognized his great merit, they could not bear his gestation on their behalf, and they therefore told him that now they had already attained the brains, it was enough for him and he could leave the [state of] gestation. If they still had something to complete, [they surmised, ] they could enter a state of gestation themselves, so why should he suffer on their behalf? This is the meaning of their statement: <b>“Go, ride, and we will drive it behind you.”</b>
<b>“Didn’t I tell you... until that donkey driver arrives?”</b> This refers back to his earlier comment to them, that they should not ask for his name because they needed further revelations of secrets of the Torah. Here he further alluded to them that his intent [in that comment] was to the aspect of <i>yeḥida</i> that they lacked, which is the mystical meaning of the welcoming of King Messiah (as stated in section 85, above, second to last paragraph). This is the allusion of <b>“until that donkey driver arrives,”</b> for the King Messiah is the mystical meaning of “lowly, and riding upon a donkey” (Zechariah 9:9). This is the meaning of <b>“that it is the King’s order, until that donkey driver arrives,”</b> because the King’s commandment is imposed upon him, to assist them until they merit the light of <i>yeḥida</i>.
They replied: <b>“But you have not told us your name etc.”</b> Since you have not informed us of your name, meaning that we have not yet attained from you what we need to attain, as stated, you can therefore at least inform us of <b>“your dwelling place,”</b> that is, your level, as we will thereby know what we lack which we have to attain from you. <b>“He responded, my dwelling place is good and of great value to me.”</b> That is, the place of my level is good and sublime compared to the level at which I am currently standing, since it is now beyond even my own attainment.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“One tower etc.”</b> This tower is the mystical meaning of the palace of the Messiah, and this is the meaning of the statement that <b>“those who dwell in it are the Holy One, blessed be He, and one poor man.”</b> The Messiah is the mystical meaning of “lowly, and riding upon a donkey.” [The donkey driver] calls it <b>“great and distinguished”</b> because a tower floating in the air, without further description, is <i>Bina</i>. Here, however, since it is referring to of the palace of the Messiah [and not <i>Bina</i>], therefore he depicts it as <b>“one tower floating in the air, great and distinguished.”</b> [The driver] continues: <b>“This is my dwelling place, but I was exiled from there, and I drive donkeys.”</b> My place of residence is in the tower, but it is currently beyond me, as he stated earlier, that it is <b>“good and of great value to me”</b> because <b>“I was exiled from there, and I drive donkeys.”</b>

Paragraph 89

<b>89. “But my father’s etc.”</b><br><b>“But my father’s dwelling place was in the great sea. He was a certain fish that circled the great sea from one end to the other. He was great and honorable, and so ancient of days that he would swallow all the other fish in the sea, and subsequently bring them out alive and well, filled with all the goodness of the world. With his power, he would swim the</b> entire <b>sea in a single moment. He took me out like an arrow in the hands of a mighty man, and he hid me in that place I mentioned to you,</b> that is, the tower floating in the air, <b>and he returned to his place and hid in that sea.”</b>
Explanation: The hidden fusion is called <b>“a certain fish,”</b> which is an allusion to the fiftieth gate. “The great sea” is <i>Malkhut</i>. Now, all the fusions from [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] of <i>Atzilut</i> downward do not include the whole of <b>“the great sea,”</b> that is, all the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, but only the first nine [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Malkhut</i>, while the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> is not included in the fusion (as stated in section 43, above, fourth paragraph) because it remains in the mystical meaning of “the path that no bird of prey knows” (Job 28:7). However, in the <i>Atik Yomin</i> there is a fusion upon that <i>Malkhut</i> as well, which will be revealed only at the completion of the rectification.
And Rav Hamnuna Saba emerged from that hidden fusion in the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which is why he calls it <b>“my father.”</b> He states: <b>“My father’s dwelling place was in the great sea,”</b> meaning that [his father] engaged in a fusion with the <i>Malkhut</i> that is called “the great sea.” And should you say that all the <i>partzufim</i> engage in a fusion upon the <i>Malkhut</i>, [so what makes his father unique, ] to this he says: “<b>He was a certain fish that circled the great sea from one end to the other.”</b> That is, he is the aspect of a fusion upon the fiftieth gate, [because] he engages in a fusion with <b>the great sea</b> in all its aspects, from <i>Keter</i> to <i>Malkhut</i>, which is <b>“from one end to the other,”</b> including even the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. This is the meaning of: <b>“He was great and honorable, and so ancient of days,”</b> for he is called the <i>Atik Yomin</i> [“Ancient of Days”], and this great fusion does not [transpire] in reality from [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] and below.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“That he would swallow all the other fish in the sea.”</b> For this great fusion swallows within it all the fusions and souls in all the worlds, for they are all incorporated and nullified within it, like a candle before a torch. Relative to this incorporation, they are all called fish.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And subsequently bring them out alive and well, filled with all the goodness of the world.”</b> In other words, after the great rectifications that follow that fusion, he once again gives birth to all the lights and souls he had swallowed during the fusion, and they live and exist forever, since they have already been filled <b>“with all the goodness of the world,”</b> as he swallowed them by means of his great fusion.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“he would swim etc.”</b> All the fusions from the <i>Atik Yomin</i> and below happen through the enclothing of the <i>sefirot</i> in one another, as these enclothings are considered as pauses along the process of the fusion, until the drop comes to the <i>Yesod</i> of male and female. This is not the case for the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> – it is without any enclothing, and therefore the fusion is regarded as occurring <b>“in a single moment.”</b>
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“He would sail the sea in a single moment,”</b> without any enclothing. This was performed <b>“with his power,”</b> as it was achieved through the many [aspects of] restraint incorporated in this fusion. He thus states: <b>“He took me out like an arrow in the hands of a mighty man”</b> – he gave birth to me like an arrow in the hands of a mighty man. However, there is no comparison between these powers and the powers that operate in the fusions below <i>Atik Yomin</i>. Rather, they are the mystical meaning of: “No eye has seen it, God, aside from You” (Isaiah 64:3), as stated below. Nevertheless, it is certainly the case that there is no birth without power, because a seed that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 15a). This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“He took me out like an arrow in the hands of a mighty man.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And he hid me in that place I mentioned to you,”</b> that is, in the <b>tower floating in the air, great and distinguished, where the Holy One, blessed be He, and one poor man dwell</b>, as stated above [section 92]. <b>“And he returned to his place and hid in that sea,”</b> that is, after he had given birth to me and hidden me <b>in the great and distinguished tower,</b> he returned to his fusion and hid in his place, as before.

Paragraph 90

<b>90. “Rabbi Elazar examined etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar examined his words</b> [and] <b>said to him: “You are the son of the holy lamp; you are the son of Rav Hamnuna Saba the elder; you are the son of the lamp of the Torah, and you are driving our donkeys?” They wept together and kissed him, and departed. They returned and said to him: “Perhaps it will be acceptable to our lord to inform us of his name?”</b>
Explanation: They had not yet fully grasped his words, and their attainment was only of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. This is why they thought that he was <b>“the son of Rav Hamnuna Saba,”</b> since Rav Hamnuna Saba himself is of the aspect of the brains of <i>yeḥida</i>. <b>“To inform us of his name”</b> means to receive his level, because attaining his name means attaining his level, as stated.

Paragraph 91

<b>91. “He began and said: etc.”</b><br><b>He began</b> his discourse <b>and said: “And Benaya the son of Yehoyada”</b> (II Samuel 23:20)<b>. This verse has been interpreted, and it is a fine</b> [explanation]<b>. However, this verse</b> [in fact] <b>comes to present the highest secrets of the Torah.</b> The name <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada comes to allude to the secret of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>. It</b> alludes to <b>a concealed matter, and the name is the cause. “The son of a valiant man” is the righteous one who lives for eternity. “Who had done mighty deeds”</b> means that he is <b>the master of all the deeds and all the supernal hosts, as they all emerge from him. He is</b> called <b>the Lord of hosts, as he is a sign in all His hosts; he is marked and greater than all.</b>
Explanation: The verse is here presenting and revealing supernal secrets of the Torah. <b>“Benayahu Ben Yehoyada comes to allude to the secret of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>,”</b> since the holy name Yehoyada, [Yehoyada; “God knows”] means a knowledge that refers <b>to the secret of the <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>. <b>“It is a concealed matter,”</b> a very hidden, sublime secret, <b>“and the name” Yehoyada</b> “is the cause” of its concealed status.
The meaning is as follows: The <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is called “the head that is unknown,” and the <i>Atik Yomin</i> is the surrounding aspect of the five <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>: <i>Arikh Anpin</i>; <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>; and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] is called the head that is unknown and does not make itself known. “Unknown” means that there is no fusion there, even in its own place. “Does not make itself known” means that there is no drawing forth of brains to the levels from it and below. <i>Arikh Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is also hidden from the lower [levels], and therefore it is called <b>“the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>.”</b> However, it is not considered “unknown,” like “the unknown head,” since it has a fusion in its own place. Rather, it only “does not make itself known,” since there is no drawing forth of brains from it and below. All the brains made known in the worlds [below] during the six thousand years are only from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which are called <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, or thirty-two [mentions of] <i>Elohim</i> in the act of creation.
This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “From where does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding, seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living…God understands its way and He knows its place” (Job 28:20-23). It has been explained (in <i>Adderet Ha’azinu</i>, 72) [that] <b>“God understands its way”</b> [means] <b>its actual way, but “and He knows its place”</b> [means] <b>its actual place and all the more so its way, and all the more so that <i>Ḥokhma</i> which is sealed in it, in the holy <i>Atik</i>;</b> see there. The intent [of these statements] is that “understands its way” is only the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, which is the mystical meaning of the thirty-two [mentions of] <i>Elohim</i> in the act of creation. This is why it states “God [<b><i>Elohim</i></b>] understands its way.” The verse expresses <i>Ḥokhma</i> through a term of <i>Bina</i>, as it states <b>“understands [<i>hevin</i>] its way,”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>hevin</i>, understand, is from the same root as <i>bina</i>, understanding.</i> because this <i>Ḥokhma</i>, in of itself, is only <i>Bina</i>, but it becomes <i>Ḥokhma</i> through the ascent [of <i>Bina</i>] to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, as [<i>Bina</i>] receives from the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i> and bestows to below. Accordingly, this <i>Ḥokhma</i> is revealed only through the path of <i>Bina</i> when [<i>Bina</i>] ascends to the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. The verse should thus be understood as follows: <b><i>Elohim</i></b>, which is <i>Bina</i>, understands its path to the <i>shefa</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is why it states <b>“its actual way,”</b> that is, [this <i>Bina</i>] is merely considered a path to the <i>shefa</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, but it itself is <i>Bina</i>, not <i>Ḥokhma</i>.
The mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“And He knows its place”</b> is that it is referring to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. The name “He” represents that which is hidden and concealed from the lower levels, which is <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, who is called <b>“the holy Ancient One.”</b> He says about [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] that he <b>“knows”</b> the <b>“place”</b> of the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths, since [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] is the actual <i>Ḥokhma</i> that bestows upon the <i>Bina</i>. This is why the <i>Zohar</i> says <b>“its actual place, and all the more so its way,”</b> for since [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] is the place [from where] this <i>Ḥokhma</i> is bestowed, [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] certainly knows the way of <i>Ḥokhma</i> when it is enclothed in <i>Bina</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] further states: <b>“And all the more so that <i>Ḥokhma</i> which is sealed in it, in the holy Ancient One.”</b> In other words, all the more so [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] knows its own sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>. However, this is also in the mystical meaning of <b>“and He knows its place,”</b> because this fusion is revealed only in [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>], in its actual place and nothing is bestowed from it and below at all. Thus, the brains of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> are classified as “knows” in its own place, but it is classified as “does not make itself known” from itself and below. Only the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which are the brains of the thirty-two paths of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, are regarded as “makes itself known,” in the mystical meaning of “God understands its way.” However, the upper head, above <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, which is the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, is regarded as “unknown and does not make itself known,” for there is no fusion even in its own place, and there is no spreading of brains from it to the lower [levels].
Now, all this applies only to the souls and the worlds in general. However, with regard to the souls in particular, there are lofty souls that merited to be feminine waters for the great fusion of that head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> after their demise, and to receive the level of <i>yeḥida</i> there in the upper world, [the level] which comes from that fusion. These are the souls of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, Rav Hamnuna Saba, and others. Those lofty souls are revealed to the righteous in this world, and the righteous also merit to see the light of <i>yeḥida</i> that illuminates in those lofty souls.
This is the meaning of his statement that <b>“Benayahu Ben Yehoyada comes to allude to the secret of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>.”</b> This soul, called <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b>, comes from the inner [aspect] of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the aforementioned <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. The illumination of that soul <b>“is a concealed matter, and the name is the cause,”</b> that is, the name <b>Yehoyada</b> causes the illumination of that soul to be concealed, for it means that <b><i>Yeho</i></b> [God] <b><i>yada</i></b> [knew], but it was not made known to others, and thus [this <i>Ḥokhma</i>] remained hidden in its own place. Now, [the <i>Zohar</i>] first clarifies the quality of the fusion and the loftiness of the height of the great light that emerges from that fusion of the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. This is explained through the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“The son of a living man, who had done many deeds, the God gatherer.”</b> He will subsequently clarify the meaning of the “concealed matter” with regard to the illumination of that soul, and this is explained by means of the phrase: “He smote the two altar-hearths of Moab,” until the end of the verse.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The son of a living man etc.”</b> The meaning is as follows: You know that this fusion is the aspect of the fusion of the completion of the rectification and its mystical meaning is the fusion that incorporates all the fusions and levels that emerged one after the other during the six thousand years. All these lights gather in this [fusion] simultaneously. In the same manner, the feminine waters that ascend for that fusion incorporate within themselves all of the sufferings and the punishments that have been disclosed during the six thousand years, one after the other. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The main point in this and the preceding sentence is the contrast between the linear incremental development of the lights and the suffering in the six thousand years with the simultaneous existence of all these lights and all the suffering on the level of this supernal fusion. The lower level, that of the six thousand years, can be thought of as the linear flow of time. This supernal fusion, in contrast, can be thought of as above that linear flow, containing all of it simultaneously.</i> Therefore, there is no end to the height of the level that emerges from this fusion, and it ends the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> forever. The <i>Yesod</i> that bestows the masculine waters [from above to below] which incorporate all of the lights that emerged during the six thousand years, is called <b>“a living man, who had done many deeds,”</b> while the <i>Malkhut</i> that incorporates within itself all the feminine waters and the suffering that unfolded over the six thousand years is called <b>“the God gatherer.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“‘The son of a living man’ is the righteous one who lives in all worlds. ”</b> This name always refers to the <i>Yesod</i>, which bestows upon the <i>Nukba</i>. [This <i>Yesod</i>] has no receptacle for its own needs, and it is therefore considered to be living only in the world, that is, in <i>Nukba</i>, when it bestows upon her. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is sexual imagery, built upon the same themes in the previous paragraphs. The <i>Yesod</i> corresponds to the male sexual organ and bestows the lights of the masculine waters. The <i>Nukba</i> corresponds to the female receiver, providing a receptacle that will actualize the bestowal of the <i>Yesod</i>.</i> This is why [the <i>Yesod</i>] is called “the righteous one who lives in all worlds.” However, in this fusion, [the <i>Yesod</i>] is mentioned by the name <b>“one who had done many deeds,”</b> which means that he is <b>the master of all the deeds and all the supernal hosts.</b> For [this <i>Yesod</i>] now includes in its masculine waters all of the good deeds and all the higher levels that were revealed one after another during the six thousand years. Now they are all gathered within [the <i>Yesod</i>] simultaneously, and they are renewed in the supernal light, and emerge from [the <i>Yesod</i>] to the <i>Nukba</i> all at once. This is why [the <i>Yesod</i>] is called <b>“one who had done many deeds.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“As they all emerge from him”</b> at one time, to the <i>Nukba</i>. <b>“He is the Lord of hosts, as he is a sign in all His hosts; he is marked and greater than all.”</b> In other words, the holy name <b>the Lord of hosts</b> has now been revealed in [this <i>Yesod</i>] in its lofty perfection, as [the <i>Yesod</i>] is now <b>a sign</b> in all His hosts, in that it is marked with all the works and hosts. And it is <b>“greater than all”</b> – it is magnified, and transcends all of these in its illumination.

Paragraph 92

<b>92. “Who had done mighty deeds, etc.”</b><br><b>“Who had done many deeds, the God gatherer”</b> (II Samuel 23:20)<b>. This great and precious tree, the greatest of all, from which place did it emerge; from which level did it come? The verse rejoins: “the God gatherer,” which is a lofty and concealed level, that “no eye has seen it,</b> [God, aside from You]<b>”</b> (Isaiah 64:3)<b>. It is a level that contains everything, and which collects within itself from the supernal light, and from which everything emerges.</b>
Explanation: Here, the <i>Nukba</i> is called by the name “the God gatherer,” for the reason that it <b>“had done many deeds, the God gatherer,”</b> that is, the <i>Nukba</i> gathers within itself all of the lights from the <i>Yesod</i> simultaneously and is therefore called <b>“who had done many deeds.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] further explains that the height that emerges [from] upon this [fusion through collision] is called <b>“the great and precious tree”;</b> [this height] emerges from the <i>Yesod</i> and comes to the <i>Nukba</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] says that in order to show us the quality of that lofty height, from where it emerges and arrives, the verse uses the name <b>“the God gatherer,”</b> [meaning] that the supernal light gathers them in <i>Yesod</i> and bestows [these lights] upon the <i>Nukba</i>, and they are both called <b>“the God gatherer”</b> together.
This is <b>“a lofty and concealed level, that ‘no eye has seen’ etc.”</b> In other words, this level that emerges from that fusion is called <b>“no eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] further states that the entire rectification is at that <b>level</b>, at the time of the final perfection. It is therefore considered <b>“a level that contains everything,”</b> because it <b>“collects within itself from the supernal light,”</b> all the goodness and the lofty lights from all six thousand years, all at once, and renews them with the supernal light. Consequently, it is this <b>“from which everything emerges,”</b> because the result is that all the desired perfection now emerges and is revealed.

Paragraph 93

<b>93. “This is the holy, concealed palace, etc.”</b><br><b>This is the holy, concealed palace in which all of the levels are gathered and concealed. And all of the worlds are located in the body of that palace, and all the holy hosts are nourished from it and are perpetuated in their existence.</b>
Explanation: This is referring to the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> itself. [The <i>Zohar</i>] says that it is a holy, concealed palace, in which all of the levels are gathered and concealed. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thereby clarifies how this great fusion of the completion of the rectification was formed and made possible, such that it would incorporate within itself all the levels and heights that emerged one after the other during the six thousand years, and to renew [this fusion] and bring it out simultaneously, as stated. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The level of <i>Atik Yomin</i> is at the top, and in some senses above, the level of <i>Atzilut</i> (as is explained below). It can be thought of as also being somewhat part of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>. In this sense, it can be thought of as above the linear cause-effect flow of spiritual time and space, in which reality unfolds stage after stage. Thus, this level contains all the lower levels within it simultaneously, as opposed to only one after the other, the way they are below.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that this head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> <b>“is the holy, concealed palace in which all of the levels are gathered and concealed,”</b> that is, throughout the period of the existence of the world, when the levels are in a state of ascent and descent. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the processes of rectification of existence, the various levels undergo ascents and descents to allow the higher brains to reach the lower levels.</i> After a level is revealed, it once again departs, on account of the sins of the lower [beings]. Now, upon the departure of the level, it is not lost, God forbid, but ascends to the head of the [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] and becomes concealed there. In this manner, [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] steadily gathers within itself each level and height that is revealed in the worlds. [These levels] come there one after another, and gather and disappear within [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] until the time of the completion of the rectification, at which point [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] renews them and brings them out simultaneously.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And</b> [all of the worlds are located] <b>in the body of that palace etc.”</b> For this <b>holy, concealed palace,</b> which is called the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, is in the state of “unknown and does not make itself known,” throughout the entire duration of the six thousand years, as stated. Therefore, although it increasingly gathers within itself all the lights that are revealed in the worlds, no aspect of them is revealed until the completion of the rectification. Thus, after the concealment of each and every level, on account of the flaws in the lower beings – since [each level] has ascended to the head of the <i>Atik</i> and was hidden there – <b>all of the levels are gathered and concealed</b> in [that head]. However, the <b>body</b> of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, that is, from the mouth of its head and below, is enclothed in the five <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, through which it illuminates to all the worlds. There is no illumination, small or great, which does not come from the body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And all of the worlds are located in the body of that palace, and all the holy hosts.”</b> The body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> is enclothed in all the <i>partzufim</i> that are in <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, and thus all the worlds enclothe it and exist upon it, as their entire existence and illumination come from it. <b>“All the holy hosts are nourished from it and thereby exist.”</b> This [includes] the lights that come to sustain the worlds, which are called “nourishments,” and it [includes] the lights that come for the brains of maturity. They are all drawn forth from the <b>body</b> of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. It is with respect to the <i>shefa</i> for sustaining the worlds that [the <i>Zohar</i>] says that they <b>“are nourished from it,”</b> while it is with regard to the brains of maturity that [the <i>Zohar</i>] says <b>“and thereby exist,”</b> because [it is] the brains that establish each <i>partzuf</i> in accordance with the measure of height that is attributed to it.

Paragraph 94

<b>94. “He smote, etc.”</b><br><b>“He smote the two altar-hearths of Moab.” Two temples existed and were nourished on its account, the First Temple and the Second Temple. Since it departed, the flow that had been drawn forth from above was withheld,</b> and it is considered <b>as though he struck them and ruined them and destroyed them.</b>
Explanation: After the illumination of the body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> departed, the <i>shefa</i> that was drawn forth from it from above ceased, and therefore <b>two temples</b> were destroyed, and it was <b>“as though he struck them and ruined and destroyed them.”</b> This is a very deep concept. It implies that due to the revealing of the height of the great fusion of the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, the illumination of the body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> departed from all the worlds. Consequently, the temples were destroyed, and all the lights that had illuminated for Israel were darkened, as stated here. These are astounding ideas.
The meaning is as follows: All the rectifications apply only to the fourth level, which is called <i>Malkhut</i> and [also called] <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, or <i>Ban</i> (<i>bet-nun</i>) <i>partzuf</i>. The breaking of the vessels<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The “breaking of the vessels” is a complex process that gives rise to the potential and capacity for rectification in the lower worlds. It takes place in the level of <i>Sag</i> of <i>Nekudim</i>.</i> occurred on account [of the fourth level], as well as the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. All the work of the righteous during the six thousand years serves to return and rectify [the fourth level] back to its status before the breaking of the vessels and before the sin of Adam the first man. After [this rectification], the aforementioned great fusion of the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> will be revealed, which will uproot the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> forever, in the mystical meaning of: “He will eliminate death forever etc.” (Isaiah 25:8). Since the <i>Ban</i> will have then already been rectified forever and will no longer require any rectifications, the <i>Ban</i> will return to be <i>Sag</i> (<i>samekh-gimmel</i>), and this will complete the entire rectification.
However, in the meantime, that is, after the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> but before the return of the <i>Ban</i> to being <i>Sag</i>, there is the concept of the departure of the illumination of the body of the <i>Atik</i>, a departure that caused the two temple to be destroyed, that is, the two embodiments of the brains that illuminated in the two temples: The brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which illuminated in the First Temple, and the brains of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which illuminated in the Second Temple. All the illuminations of Israel were destroyed and departed, as stated here, and all those destructions are the final rectifications that restore the <i>Ban</i> to being <i>Sag</i>, which is all that is desired.
Then the two temples will be rebuilt at the hands of Heaven, through the aspect of the partition of the second level, which is <i>Bina</i>, that is, by means of the partition of <i>Sag</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [which is positioned] before the second constriction, and which is considered clean of any constriction. However, it will only be through the hands of Heaven, in the mystical meaning of: “Because He delights in mercy” (Micah 7:18). Then the two temples will exist forever, and the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun (Isaiah 30:26). [This means the light of the moon will be the light of] the higher <i>Bina</i>, which is currently the light of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called the sun. “And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days” (Isaiah 30:26), that is, like the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, from which the light is drawn to [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> including <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] that emanated the seven days of creation. <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, the sun, will once again be <i>Ab</i> (<i>ayin-bet</i>), which contains the light of the body of the <i>Atik</i>.
The reason for the departure of the body of the [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] before these rectifications is that there are no more than two <i>Nukba</i>s in the ten <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Bina</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, called <i>Sag</i> and <i>Ban</i>. After the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, in which the aspect of <i>Ban</i> was nullified, the partition of <i>Sag</i> was nullified together with it. This occurred because of the rectification that took place in the body of the <i>Atik</i>, to partner <i>Bina</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> with each other, in the mystical meaning of the association of the attribute of judgment with the attribute of mercy (as stated in section 4, above, s. v. <i>Adam</i>; see there). Through the force of this partnership, He emanated the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. All the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> emerged and were perpetuated only through this <i>Malkhut</i> that is partnered with and tempered by the attribute of mercy, <i>Bina</i>. Consequently, since the partition of <i>Ban</i> becomes nullified [at the great fusion of <i>Atik Yomin</i>], the partition of the second level (<i>Bina</i>), which is the partition of <i>Sag</i>, has been nullified together with it, since they are bound together as one. And as the aspect of <i>Nukba</i> and the partition were nullified, the fusion with the supernal light ceased. Therefore, the entire illumination of the body of the <i>Atik</i>, [an illumination] which was through the partition that is associated with the attribute of mercy, departed completely. As a consequence, all the lights from it and downward, which are drawn from the body of the <i>Atik</i>, were destroyed.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“He smote the two altar-hearths of Moab. Two temples existed</b> [and were nourished] <b>on its account, etc. Since it departed, the flow that had been drawn forth from above was withheld.”</b> This is as was explained: Since the <i>Ban</i> was nullified on account of the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, the <i>Sag</i> was nullified together with it, that is, also the partition of the second level itself. As the partition is [then] unfit for a fusion, the supernal light ceased. This is [the meaning of the clause] <b>“the flow [<i>negido</i>] that had been drawn forth from above was withheld.”</b> <i>Negido</i> means the flow and spreading forth of the supernal light from above to below. It ceased on account of the nullification of the partition, as explained. Thus, due to the great fusion that occurred in the head of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, the bestowal of light from the body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> ceased and was nullified. The fusion of the head nullified the partition of <i>Ban</i>, and since until that point the partition of <i>Ban</i> had been joined with the partition of <i>Sag</i> in the body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> as one, the partition of <i>Sag</i> was therefore nullified as well. And as there is [then] no partition for the fusion through collision, there is no room for the supernal light to bestow there, as is known.

Paragraph 95

<b>95. “The holy throne fell, etc.”</b><br><b>The holy throne</b>, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>fell, as it is stated: “I was among the exiles”</b> (Ezekiel 1:1)<b>,</b> that is, <b>that level which is called “I,”</b> <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>is among the exiles. Why? “By the river Chebar”</b> (Ezekiel 1:1)<b>,</b> meaning <b>by</b> the <b>river that extends and emerges</b> since past times [<i>kevar</i>], and now <b>its waters and springs have gone, and it no longer flows as before. This is as it is stated: “And the river shall be drained dry”</b> (Isaiah 19:5). <b>“Drained” in the First Temple and “dry” in the Second Temple. And for this reason it is stated: “He smote the two altar-hearths of Moab”</b> (II Samuel 23:20)<b>. Moab</b> means <b>that they are from the Father [<i>me-av</i>] in heaven. They were destroyed and are gone on its account, and all the lights that had illuminated for Israel have all darkened.</b>
Explanation: The <b>throne</b> indicates the tempering of the <i>Malkhut</i> in <i>Bina</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the Throne of Mercy, through which all the brains are bestowed in the [spiritual phase of] six thousand years to all the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“The holy throne fell,”</b> since due to the nullification of the partition of <i>Ban</i>, the partition of <i>Sag</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the <b>throne</b>, was also nullified and fell. <b>“As it is stated: ‘I was among the exiles, ’ that level which is called ‘I, ’ is among the exiles”</b> – “I” is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i> of the upper [level] which becomes <i>Keter</i> for the lower [level]. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Each level of existence has a <i>Keter</i> at the top and a <i>Malkhut</i> at the bottom. The <i>Malkhut</i> of a relative upper level is the <i>Keter</i> of the level below.</i> This is because the letters <i>alef-nun-yod</i> [<i>ani</i>, “I”] are the same letters as <i>ein</i> [absence], which is the name of the <i>Keter</i>.
It is known that the <i>Malkhut</i> of an upper [level] is the entire connection between the <i>partzufim</i>. Each upper [level] performs the [fusion through collision] on its <i>Malkhut</i>, which draws forth returning light that enclothes the direct light of the upper [level]. Subsequently, the <i>Malkhut</i> of the upper [level] descends in the mystical meaning of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the returning light, within which is the height of direct light, and [this structure] is enclothed in the lower [level]. This illustrates that now <b>“that level which is called ‘I’ is among the exiles,”</b> since the [fusion through collision] with the supernal light has been nullified from [that level as a result of the partition being nullified] and the supernal light has ceased from all the <i>partzufim</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Why? ‘By the river Chebar” – by</b> the <b>river that extends and emerges; its waters and springs are gone.”</b> While [the level] is established with a partition, it is called “a river that extends and emerges,” that is, the supernal light is drawn by means of [the level] to the lower [level below], like the waters of a river that are drawn and flow unceasingly.
But now that the partition has been nullified, the river aspect [of the level] is called <b>“the river Chebar,”</b> for in the past [<i>kevar</i>] it was a river, but not currently, since now <b>“its waters and springs have gone.”</b> “Its waters” is the supernal light that was drawn forth from it; “its springs” means the partition, which was considered a spring while it was established in [the level]. [The level considered a spring] because the <i>shefa</i> was connected to it and ceaselessly flowed from it. Now all that has stopped <b>“and it no longer flows as before,”</b> as the supernal light is no longer drawn from it like previously, <b>“This is as it is stated: ‘And the river shall be drained dry’; ‘drained’ in the First Temple and ‘dry’ in the Second Temple.</b> The <i>Imma</i> is called <b>“the First Temple,”</b> while <i>Tevuna</i> is called <b>“the Second Temple.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Imma</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are the female aspects of the two main components of the larger <i>Bina</i> structure, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.</i> It says <b>“drained”</b> with regard to the First Temple because the fusion stopped in it, as the spring, which is the partition, was drained. And since there is no [fusion through collision] in the supernal <i>Imma</i>, <i>Tevuna</i> was therefore entirely dried out. This is why it says “dry” with respect to <i>Tevuna</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Moab, that they are from the Father [<i>me-av</i>] in heaven etc.”</b> For the root of the brains of the two temples is from the <i>Abba</i>, who is the Father in heaven, <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the male component of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>.</i> that is, the one who illuminates for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called heaven, whose lights elevated [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> to [the level of] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> in the Second Temple, and to [the level of] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i> in the First Temple. They have now been destroyed and darkened <b>“on its account,”</b> that is, due to the cessation of the <i>shefa</i> of the body of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, <b>“and all the lights that had illuminated for Israel have all darkened.”</b> In other words, not only have the great brains of the two temples darkened, but all the lights that shone for Israel, that is, even the lights of the six extremities and the lights of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, have been destroyed.

Paragraph 96

<b>96. “Furthermore, ‘he also went down, etc.”</b><br><b>Furthermore, “he also went down and slew a lion”</b> (II Samuel 23:20)<b>. In the early times, when this river extended its waters below, Israel were in a state of wholeness because they would sacrifice sacrifices and offerings to atone for their souls. Then an image of a lion would descend from above and they would see it on the altar crouching over its prey, eating the offerings like a mighty man. All of the dogs</b>, that is, the accusers, <b>would hide from it and would not come out</b> to accuse<b>.</b>
Explanation: The Sages said regarding the fire from above, which would hover over the altar in the Temple, that it would crouch like a <b>lion</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 21b), as it would burn the offerings that the children of Israel offered upon it. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“In the early times, when this river drew its waters below, Israel were in a state of wholeness.”</b> Before the illumination of the [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] was nullified, and when the supernal lights were drawn to Israel like a river whose waters extend from above to below ceaselessly, Israel were then in their full state of wholeness.
<b>“Because they would sacrifice sacrifices and offerings to atone for their souls.”</b> With the offerings that they would sacrifice, they would raise feminine waters for the supernal fusion on the partition, and masculine waters, which are the brains, would be drawn out. They thereby drew closer in great unification to their Father in heaven, and all the <i>kelippot</i> fled and distanced themselves from them. This is the mystical meaning of <b>“to atone for their souls,”</b> as the distancing of the <i>kelippot</i> from the souls is considered <b>atonement</b> [<i>le-khapara</i>]. This is like a garment that is stained and dirty with marks – by means of washing, we remove and cleanse [<i>mekhaprim</i>] all the stains from the garment.
This is why they are called “offerings [<i>korbanot</i>],” since they draw Israel near [<i>makrivin</i>] their Father in heaven. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The root of "<i>korbanot</i>" is "<i>karav</i>, " which literally means "come close. " While <i>korbanot</i> is commonly translated as "ritual sacrifices, " the word in Hebrew actually means something more like "an act that brings one closer to the receiver of the <i>korban</i> (offering). "</i> Since [the people of Israel] were in a state of wholeness and were raising feminine waters solely to bring satisfaction to their Maker, those feminine waters would ascend to <i>Bina</i>, where there is the light of giving and bestowal in the mystical meaning of a lion, which is a name for <i>Ḥesed</i>. [Through this process of raising feminine waters, ] the lion of <i>Bina</i> is considered to have received the good deeds and feminine waters that the children of Israel raised. The [people of Israel] saw how their feminine waters were [like] prey for this supernal <i>Bina</i>, and the light of giving of <i>Bina</i> was drawn forth in direct light over the feminine waters, and the direct light would hover over the prey, that is, the feminine waters, and consume it.
The meaning of the lion’s eating of the offering is that the essence of an offering is the feminine waters that ascend to strengthen the partition and to raise returning light, as stated. Since the amount of direct light is determined by the measure of the returning light that ascends from the partition, the direct light is considered to be nourished by the feminine waters, and [the direct light] increases and is sustained by [the feminine waters]. This is similar to an animal that is sustained and grows by the food it eats. Likewise, the whole vitality of a corporeal animal depends on the food it consumes, and upon the cessation [of this food, the animal] will die. In the same manner, the supernal light depends on the returning light that ascends from the partition. Upon the cessation of the returning light, [the direct light] is nullified from [manifesting in] the lower [level].
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“An image of a lion would descend from above.”</b> That is, the light of <i>Bina</i>, which is drawn from above to below in the mystical meaning of direct light, is in the <b>image of a lion</b>, that is, the form of bestowal, like the nature of <i>Bina</i>. <b>“They would see it on the altar crouching over its prey” –</b> they saw the direct light enclothing and crouching within the returning light that ascends from the offering, which is its prey and nourishment, as stated.
<b>“Eating the offerings like a mighty man.”</b> It eats and grows from the offerings, like a mighty man. Since Israel was in a state of wholeness, the amount of bestowal, which is the raising of feminine waters and returning light, had great power from below upward. This is because the height of the returning light is determined by the size of the impact of the [direct light against the] partition, [measured by the amount] of startling and fright, [such that the partition accordingly] rebuffs the supernal light from below upward. And like the measure of the height of the ascent of returning light, so is the height of direct light that is drawn into [the returning light]. Therefore, if the height of returning light ascends with great power, it is considered that the <b>lion</b> is <b>“eating the offerings like a mighty man,”</b> in an upright form, with power, for it is through this power that [the lion's] height increases (all of this is described in my book, <i>Introduction to the Wisdom of the Kabbalah</i>, p. 4, section 14).
Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“All the dogs would hide from it and would not come out.”</b> The <i>kelippa</i> [deriving from] receiving for oneself is called “a dog,” as the <i>Zohar</i> states on the verse: “The horseleech has two daughters: ‘Give, give’ [<i>hav</i>; <i>hav</i>]” (Proverbs 30:15), [which means] they howl like dogs, saying “give [<i>hav</i>] us the wealth of this world, and give [<i>hav</i>] us the wealth of the World to Come.” This is the strongest <i>kelippa</i>, and its grip is strongest opposite the light of <i>yeḥida</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Deliver my soul from the sword; my only one [<i>yeḥidati</i>] from the power of the dog” (Psalms 22:21). It is the corresponding opposite of the lion, <b>which eats</b> the aforementioned <b>offerings</b>.
Just as the lion, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥesed</i>, is entirely [a state of] bestowal and no receiving at all – as the Sages said regarding the attribute of a pious individual [<i>ḥasid</i>], that “what is mine is yours and what is yours is yours” (<i>Avot</i> 5:10) – the <i>kelippa</i> of the dog is all receiving and no bestowal at all. This is as stated about the righteous ones among the nations of the world, that all the kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>] they perform, they do for themselves (see <i>Baba Batra</i> 10b), since they are connected to the <i>kelippa</i> of the dog.
This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states that when [the people of] Israel were in a state of wholeness and they merited the expression of a <b>lion that eats its offerings</b>, <b>“all the dogs would hide from it and would not come out,”</b> since [Israel] raised feminine waters with great power. They thereby gave power to the partition in <i>Malkhut</i> to rebuff the supernal light from it and above, with great power. As a result, the amount of returning light in the height was very high, in the mystical meaning of <b>“eating the offerings like a mighty man.”</b> Consequently, even those harsh <i>kelippot</i>, which are the dogs, all fled and hid, fearing that lion’s might, and they would not emerge from their hiding place.

Paragraph 97

<b>97. “When the sins caused, etc.”</b><br><b>When the sins caused</b> [their downfall]<b>, he descended into the levels below and killed that lion. Since he did not want to give him his prey as before, it is regarded as though he had killed him.</b> Therefore, <b>he certainly slew the lion. “Into the pit”</b> (II Samuel 23:20) means <b>in</b> [front of] <b>the eyes of the Other Side, the evil one. Upon seeing this, that Other Side grew stronger and sent a dog to eat the offerings</b> from upon the altar instead of the lion<b>. And that lion, what is its name? Its name is Uriel, as its face is the face of a lion</b> [<i>aryeh</i>]<b>. And what is the name of that dog? Its name is Baladan,</b> as Baladan has the same letters as <i>Bal-adam</i> [“not human”] as the letter <i>mem</i> can be exchanged for a <i>nun</i>, <b>since he is not classified as a man but a dog and the face of a dog.</b>
Explanation: Since the aspects of partitions were nullified from <i>Ban</i> and <i>Sag</i>, Israel below could no longer raise feminine waters either, which is the nourishment of the lion (as explained in the previous passage). The fusion ceased and the supernal light, which is the aspect of the <b>lion</b>, departed. It is <b>“as though”</b> that <b>lion</b> were <b>killed</b>, for [this supernal light, which is the lion, ] ascended to its root above and disappeared from the lower [levels].
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“‘Into the pit, ’ in the eyes of the Other Side, the evil one.”</b> For the root of receiving for oneself is in the eyes, in the mystical meaning of “the eye sees and the heart covets” (Rashi, end of <i>Parashat Shelaḥ</i>). This aspect of receiving is called a <b>“pit”</b> because it is [an expression of]: "The pit was empty, there was no water in it” (Genesis 37:24), as the supernal light is not drawn there, in the mystical meaning of: “He and I cannot dwell in the same abode” (see <i>Sota</i> 5a).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He slew the lion into the pit, in the eyes of the Other Side.”</b> For the slaying of the lion was in front of the evil eyes of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is called a “pit,” referring to broken pits that cannot hold water [Jeremiah 2:13]. They have now come out of their hiding places and been revealed with great dominion. <b>“And sent a dog to eat the offerings,”</b> because the opposite of the lion <b>that eats the offerings</b> is the dog that is constantly howling <i>hav hav</i> [“give, give”], as stated. 
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The name of that lion is Uriel, as its face is the face of a lion.”</b> The mystical meaning of the name <i>El</i> is <i>Ḥesed</i>, which is the mystical meaning of [the] right [side]. That lion, which is the light of <i>Ḥesed</i>, [the light of giving, ] as stated, is called Uri-El, that is, the <b>light</b> [<i>or</i>] that is drawn from the name <i>El</i>. His face is to the right, which is the mystical meaning of bestowal, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And all four had the face of a lion on the right side” (Ezekiel 1:10).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The name of that dog is Baladan, since he is not classified as a man but a dog.”</b> The <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called “a man [<i>adam</i>]” when it has brains from <i>Bina</i>, which is the mystical meaning of <b><i>adam</i></b> [<i>alef</i>-<i>dalet</i>-<i>mem</i>], which has a numerical value of forty-five [<i>Ma</i>]. The mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i> is bestowal, as stated. This is why the Sages said: “You are called <b><i>adam</i></b> but the nations of the world are not called <i>adam</i>” (<i>Yevamot</i> 61a), because all the kindness that they perform, they do for themselves (see <i>Baba Batra</i> 10b). This is why he is called <b>Baladan,</b> which is an anagram of <b><i>Bal-adam</i>,</b> as a <i>mem</i> can be exchanged for a <i>nun</i>.

Paragraph 98

<b>98. “On the day of the snow, on the day, etc.”</b><br><b>“On the day of the snow”</b> (II Samuel 23:20). That is, <b>on the day when the sins caused</b> [their downfall]<b>, when the judgment was issued above, from the supernal courthouse. It is therefore written: “She is not afraid of the snow for her household”</b> (Proverbs 31:21)<b>,</b> as <b>this is the supernal judgment, which is termed “snow.” Why</b> is she not afraid<b>? “For her entire household is clothed in scarlet”</b> (Proverbs 31:21)<b>, and</b> therefore <b>she could tolerate a strong fire. Until here is the secret of the verse.</b>
Explanation: The judgments that correspond to the male are called <b>“snow,”</b> and therefore they are considered to be drawn from the supernal courthouse. These judgments are very harsh at first, but slight in the end, as they are mitigated only at the conclusion, which is the <i>Nukba</i>. With respect to those judgments, the <i>Nukba</i> said: “Stay me with dainties [<i>ashishot</i>]” (Song of Songs 2:5), alluding to two <i>ishot</i> [“fires”], the upper fire, which is <i>Bina</i>, and her own fire.
Subsequently, once [the <i>Nukba</i>] has those two fires, she mitigates the cold judgments of the <b>snow</b>, since her fire alleviates their chill. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“‘She is not afraid of the snow for her household, ’ this is the supernal judgment,”</b> referring to the harsh judgments of the masculine, which is called the supernal judgment. <b>“Why? ‘For her entire household is clothed in scarlet [<i>shanim</i>]’” –</b> two [<i>shenayim</i>], which is the mystical meaning of those two fires. Since her household is clothed in two fires, <b>“she is not afraid of the snow for her household.”</b> On the contrary, the snow is tempered in her fires.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that <b>“she could tolerate a strong fire,”</b> as this snow helps her bear her fires. This is informing us that now that the partitions and fusions of <i>Ban</i> and <i>Sag</i> have been nullified, and those two fires have [likewise] been nullified, the judgments of snow have regained their strength. <b>“Until here is the secret of the verse. What is written after it...</b> [from the start of the next section].” This is alluding to the fact that what has been presented thus far was revealed immediately after the fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, but what appears in the next verse is a consequence and comes afterwards.

Paragraph 99

<b>99. “What is written after it, etc.”</b><br><b>What is written after it? “And he slew an Egyptian, a man of appearance”</b> (II Samuel 23:21)<b>. Here the secret of the verse comes to inform</b> [us] <b>that each time Israel sinned He departed and withheld all the goodness from them and all the lights that had illuminated for them. “He slew an Egyptian” is light,</b> that is, <b>that light which was illuminating for Israel. And who is “he”?</b> He is <b>Moses, as it is written</b> about him<b>: “And they said, ‘an Egyptian delivered us etc. ’”</b> (Exodus 2:19), as <b>he was born there,</b> in Egypt, <b>and raised there, and there he ascended to the supernal light.</b>
Explanation: The verse is not referring to an actual <b>man</b>, but to <b>light</b>, since He nullified and concealed the light, and this is considered as though He killed it. This is why it states: <b>“That light which was illuminating for Israel, and who is he? Moses.”</b> In other words, He nullified the great light of the illumination of <b>Moses</b> to Israel. He calls him <b>“an Egyptian”</b> because he was born and raised in Egypt, as it is stated: “Moses grew up and he went out to his brothers etc.” (Exodus 2:11). There he merited the supernal light, [and] the redemption of Israel from Egypt.

Paragraph 100

<b>100. “A man of appearance, this is as it says etc.”</b><br><b>“A man of appearance”</b> (II Samuel 23:21)<b>, this is as it says: “Through appearances, not riddles”</b> (Numbers 12:8)<b>. “A man,” as it says: “The man of God”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:1)<b>, the husband, as it were, of that appearance of the glory of God,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i><b>, as he merited to guide this level on earth in all that he wished, which no other man has merited.</b>
Explanation: The difference between Moses and all the other prophets is that Moses was a chariot for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. He would construct and bestow from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>, whereas all the other prophets were a chariot for the <i>Nukba</i> and received their <i>shefa</i> from the <i>Nukba</i>. This is why it states: <b>“The man of God, the husband, as it were, of that appearance,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>, called <b>“the glory of God.”</b> Why is he considered the husband of the Divine Presence? It is because <b>“he merited to guide this level,”</b> as [Moses] was a chariot for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and he would construct, bestow [upon] and guide this level, which is the <i>Nukba</i>. <b>“Which no other man has merited,”</b> as all the other prophets were a chariot for the <i>Nukba</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i> bestowed upon them. They are therefore located below her, and are guided by her, and thus no other person in the world merited the attribute of Moses.

Paragraph 101

<b>101. “And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand etc.”</b><br><b>“And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand”</b> (II Samuel 23:21)<b>. This is the staff of God, which was entrusted in his hand, as it says: “With the staff of God in my hand”</b> (Exodus 17:9)<b>. This is the staff that was created at twilight on the eve of Shabbat, and a holy carving is engraved upon it, the holy name. With that</b> staff<b>, he sinned with the rock, as it says: “And struck the rock with his staff twice”</b> (Numbers 20:11)<b>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: “Moses, I did not give you My staff for this; by your life, it will no longer be in your hand from now onwards.”</b>
Explanation: Twilight is the mystical meaning of the great tempering of <i>Malkhut</i> in <i>Bina</i>, until it cannot be discerned whether it is <i>Malkhut</i> or <i>Bina</i>. On Shabbat, <i>Malkhut</i> rises to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and becomes <i>Bina</i>. <b>“At twilight on the eve of Shabbat”</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] is not yet actual <i>Bina</i>, but is not discerned as <i>Malkhut</i> either. This is the mystical meaning of the ten items that were created at twilight, as at that time their origin is undiscernible as to whether it is from <i>Bina</i> or <i>Malkhut</i>, since [at that twilight phase] the <i>Nukba</i> itself cannot be discerned.
This is the mystical meaning of the staff that was created at twilight, and for this reason <b>“a holy carving is engraved upon it,”</b> an engraving of <b>“the holy name,”</b> which represents the aspect of <i>Bina</i>, from which the holiness is drawn. The <b>“holy carving”</b> represents <i>Malkhut</i>, which is only an engraving for receiving <b>“the holy name.”</b> These two carvings were incorporated in the staff as a single, indistinguishable aspect, as stated, since [the staff] was created <b>“at twilight on the eve of Shabbat.”</b> Therefore, it had the power to draw forth all the lights and all the miracles and wonders for Israel, who are the mystical meaning of the drawing forth of the lights of <i>Bina</i> into <i>Malkhut</i>. Through [the staff], Moses merited the supernal <i>Bina</i> and the aspect of man of God, in the mystical meaning of “Moses the bride.” It is called <b>“the staff of <i>Elohim</i>”</b> in reference to <i>Bina</i>, and it is termed “a spear” in the mystical meaning of the <i>vav</i> of <i>Havaya</i>, which fuses with the lower <i>heh</i>.
Now, the <i>Malkhut</i> [alone] is called <b><i>tzor</i></b> [“boulder”], while [the <i>Malkhut</i> merged within] the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i> is called <b><i>sela</i></b> [“rock”]. The inner fusion of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, when they ascend to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> uses the garments of the <i>Imma</i> (as stated in section 17, above), that fusion through collision is called “speech.” The external fusion of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, that is, in their own place, is called fusion through collision [<i>haka’ah</i>]. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> have ascended to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, their fusion, called an “inner fusion,” is described as an interaction of speech. In contrast, the fusion of lower state of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, called an “external fusion,” is a fusion through collision.</i> This is the mystical meaning of the statement to Moses in <i>Parashat Beshallaḥ</i> (Exodus 17:6): <b>“And you shall strike [<i>ve’hikita</i>] the <i>tzor</i>,</b> and water shall come out of it...” since the <b><i>tzor</i></b> is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i>, in which striking [<i>haka’ah</i>] occurs. However, in <i>Parashat Ḥukkat</i> (Numbers 20:8) it states: <b>“And you shall speak to the <i>sela</i>...</b>” since the <i>sela</i> is when [<i>Malkhut</i>] is in the place of <i>Bina</i>, and thus, the fusion is called “speech.” This is the mystical meaning of the sin of Moses, as he used his staff <b>twice,</b> for in addition to striking the <i>tzor</i> with it, he also struck the <b><i>sela</i></b>, and that is the meaning of <b>“twice”</b> (Numbers 20:11). He thus <b>“sinned with the rock [<i>sela</i>],”</b> since striking does not apply to it, but only <b>speech</b> (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Tetze</i>, 76).
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“With that, he sinned with the rock.”</b> Since there was no distinguishable mark on the staff of God determining whether it belonged to <i>Malkhut</i> or <i>Bina</i>, as stated, [Moses] ended up using it for the <i>sela</i> as well. <b>“As it says, ‘and struck the rock with his staff twice, ’”</b> that is, <b>upon the <i>tzor</i> and the <i>sela</i>,</b> as stated. <b>“The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: “Moses, I did not give you My staff for this” –</b> I did not give you My staff for you to use it for the aspect of <i>sela</i> as well.

Paragraph 102

<b>102. “Immediately, ‘he went down to etc.”</b><br><b>Immediately, “he went down to him with a staff,”</b> that is, <b>with harsh judgment, “and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand,”</b> that is, <b>from that time,</b> the staff, which is the spear, <b>was withheld from him and he will not have it forever. “And slew him with his own spear”</b> (II Samuel 23:21) <b>– on account of that sin that he struck the rock with that staff, he died and did not enter the holy land, and this light was withheld from Israel.</b>
Explanation: In order to understand this, everything that was explained above (section 94, second to last paragraph) must be recalled. Due to the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, it was only necessary to nullify the <i>Ban</i> alone, not the <i>Sag</i> at all, and then the <i>Bon</i> would rise straightaway and become <i>Sag</i> for all eternity. However, since the <i>Sag</i> and the <i>Ban</i> were attached together, the <i>Sag</i> was nullified along with the <i>Ban</i>, and as a result the temples were destroyed in the meantime. For the same reason, the illumination of Moses to the children of Israel was nullified as well, for he greatly sinned with regard to the connection of the <i>Ban</i> with the <i>Sag</i>, by striking the rock, as stated.
Therefore, <b>“‘he went down to him with a staff, ’ with harsh judgment,”</b> as the nullification of the <i>Sag</i> was achieved through harsh judgment, since in fact he had no connection at all with the <i>Ban</i>, and the nullification of the <i>Ban</i> did not concern him whatsoever. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “It seemed as when men wield upwards axes in a thicket of trees, and now all its carved work together they strike down with hatchet and hammers” (Psalms 74:5-6). On account of the raising and mitigation of the <i>Malkhut</i> and her ascent to the <i>Bina</i>, it is now like one who wields axes upward in a thicket of trees, since the <i>Sag</i> has also been nullified by this ascent, “struck down with hatchet and hammers.”
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“‘And plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand’ – from that time it was withheld from him and he will not have it forever.”</b> The spear actually belonged to <i>Ban</i>, as stated. Consequently, this illumination was nullified forever, since the <i>Ban</i> itself was subsequently renewed and became <i>Sag</i> <b>for all eternity</b>, and therefore there is no longer any purpose in using the staff for striking. This is why it states: <b>“‘And slew him with his own spear,” on account of that sin that he struck the rock with that staff, he died.”</b> Had [Moses] been careful to use [the staff] only at the <b><i>tzor</i></b> and not at the <b><i>sela</i></b> [rock], the aspect of <i>Sag</i> would not have been nullified together with the <i>Ban</i> and he would not have <b>died</b> but would have immediately ascended to the aspect of <i>Sag</i>. Accordingly, he <b>“did not enter the holy land,”</b> because the Land of Israel is the mystical meaning of the ascent of the <i>Ban</i> to the <i>Sag</i>. This is why it is called “<b>the holy land,”</b> because the brains of <i>Bina</i>, which then illuminate in it, are called <b>“holiness.”</b> Before the completion of the rectification, when there are ascents and descents, there are therefore destructions and exiles. However, at the completion of the rectification, the <i>Ban</i> will remain in the <i>Sag</i> for all eternity, which is the mystical meaning of the Land of Israel, as explained, and there will never be any further exile.

Paragraph 103

<b>103. “He was most honorable of the thirty, etc.”</b><br><b>“He was most honorable of the thirty”</b> (see II Samuel 23:19, 23)<b>. These are the upper thirty years, from which he would take and extend below. From them he would take and draw near, “but did not come to the three”</b> (II Samuel 23:19)<b>.</b> Rather, <b>they would come to him and give him willingly, but he did not come to them.</b>
Explanation: The first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>, are called <b>“the thirty,”</b> that is, three <i>sefirot</i>, each of which is comprised of ten [<i>sefirot</i>], and which are the entirety of the brains that illuminate during the six thousand years. The soul of <b>Benayahu,</b> which comes from the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, collects all the fusions of the six thousand years, in the mystical meaning of <b>“who had done many deeds, the God gatherer,”</b> into a single height, which is Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, as stated. Thus, he receives and is honored by all those supernal thirty years.
This is the meaning of <b>“from which he would take and extend below.”</b> He would take from the brains of <b>thirty</b> years, which extend to his soul <b>below</b>, at the bottom of them all. <b>“From them he would take and draw near,”</b> since his whole height is only from what he took and gathered from their fusions, which came one after another, as explained previously. Despite [his acquiring of this height], <b>“‘but did not come to the three” – they would come to him and give him willingly, but he did not come to them.”</b> For although they gave him all of his sublime quality <b>willingly,</b> he still could not come to them afterward and receive more from them. The reason is as stated, that due to the nullification of the partition of <i>Ban</i>, the partition of <i>Sag</i> was nullified as well, and he was left without a partition. Therefore, he could not come to them to raise feminine waters and receive more [brains] from them.

Paragraph 104

<b>104. “Even though he was still not included, etc.”</b><br><b>Even though he was still not included in their number and calculation, it is nevertheless written: “And David set him over his guard”</b> (II Samuel 23:23), [meaning] <b>that he was never parted from the tablet of his heart,</b> for <b>they will never be separated. David set his heart upon him, but he did not set his heart upon David. This is because the praises, songs, and mercies that the moon performs toward the sun thereby pull toward her, so that his dwelling is with her. This is</b> [the meaning of]<b>: “And David set him over his guard.”</b>
Explanation: David is the aspect of <i>Malkhut</i>, the fourth leg of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. The meaning is that although [Benayahu] could not come to the supernal thirty years, which are the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], nevertheless “David set him over his guard,” meaning that [Benayahu] clung to [David] and <b>never</b> moved from the tablet of his heart. The reason is that aspect of wholeness within <i>Malkhut</i> was revealed through [David], since he is from the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which detaches all the <i>kelippot</i> from the name <i>Ban</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8, as stated in section 94, above, third paragraph; see there).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“David set his heart upon him,”</b> as stated above, <b>“that he was never parted from the tablet of his heart,”</b> since [David’s] wholeness was within him. However, <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> did not set his heart <b>upon David,</b> because David is the fourth leg of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. Accordingly, just as [Benayahu] cannot receive from the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], he could not receive <b>from David</b>, and therefore he did not set his heart upon him.
<b>“Praises, songs</b> etc.” By means of the feminine waters, which the <i>Malkhut</i> – called the <b>moon</b> – raises to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>], called the <b>sun</b>, through the praises, songs, and mercies, [the <i>Malkhut</i>] draws to itself the illumination of the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, which is the final wholeness [of <i>Malkhut</i>] (as stated), <b>“so that his dwelling is with her,”</b> that he will cleave to [the <i>Malkhut</i>] forever.

Paragraph 105

<b>105. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba fell down before him</b>, on their faces<b>. While doing so, they could not see him. They stood up and looked to all sides, but they did not see him. They sat and wept, and could not speak to one another. Afterwards, Rabbi Abba said: “This must be what we learned, that on whatever path way the righteous walk and there are words of Torah among them, the righteous from that world come</b> to reveal words of Torah <b>to them. This must be Rav Hamnuna Saba who came to us from that world, to reveal these matters to us, but before we were able to recognize him, he went away and disappeared from us. They arose and wished to drive the donkeys, but</b> the donkeys <b>would not go. They</b> again <b>wanted to drive them, but they</b> [still] <b>would not go. They grew afraid and left the donkeys, and to this day, they call that place “the place of the donkeys.”</b>
Explanation: They could not bear that great light that appeared to them upon the revelation of these secrets, and they bowed down before him. This is the meaning of <b>“Rabbi Elazar</b> [and Rabbi Abba] <b>fell down</b> etc.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“While doing so, they could not see him.”</b> After they merited to receive his great, sublime level from him, he immediately vanished from them, and they could no longer find and perceive him. Therefore, <b>“they sat and wept, and could not speak to one another.”</b> They were so upset that they sat down and wept until they could no longer converse with each other.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“This must be Rav Hamnuna Saba...</b>” for they now recognized his level, that he was <b>Rav Hamnuna Saba</b> himself, not merely the son of Rav Hamnuna Saba, as they had previously assumed (see section 90, above). <b>“They arose and wished to drive the donkeys</b>…<b>and left the donkeys” –</b> for the donkeys are the mystical meaning of the abilities that the soul of Rav Hamnuna Saba had given them, to be able to raise feminine waters in order to attain the levels of <i>ḥaya</i> and <i>yeḥida</i>, which they attained through him.
This is the mystical meaning of his placing them on the donkeys and walking before them to illuminate the path of the righteous for them (as stated in section 85, above, seventh paragraph). Now, after he completed his task and vanished from them, they wanted to climb up and ride his donkeys once again, that is, they wished to raise feminine waters afresh, in order to perceive him a second time. However, <b>“they wished to drive the donkeys, but they would not go,”</b> for now they were no longer able to receive from them the strength to raise feminine waters. They therefore became afraid and left the donkeys in that place where Rav Hamnuna Saba had disappeared from them. They labeled that place “the place of the donkeys,” that is, they named it after what occurred there, that they were no longer able to use them.

Paragraph 106

<b>106. “Rabbi Elazar began, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar began</b> his discourse <b>by saying: “How great is Your goodness You have in store for those who fear You etc.”</b> (Psalms 31:20)<b>. How</b> [great] <b>is the supernal, precious good that the Holy One, blessed be He, will perform for people, for those lofty righteous ones who fear sin, who engage in the Torah, when they come to that world. It does not write “Your goodness,” but “great is Your goodness.” What is this? This is: “They shall utter the fame of Your great goodness”</b> (Psalms 145:7)<b>, and this is the life of delight that extends from the next world to the one who lives forever. It is called “the fame of Your great goodness,” and it is certainly “the great goodness toward the house of Israel”</b> (Isaiah 63:7)<b>.</b>
Explanation: The word <i>rav</i> [“great”] invariably denotes greatness. Since the verse here emphasizes <b>“great is Your goodness,”</b> and not simply <b>“Your goodness,”</b> it is referring to <b>“the life of delight,”</b> that is, the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. The essence of the <i>partzuf</i>, and its lifeforce, is the brains of the [level of the] six extremities, which is received from the fusion of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother) in order to sustain the worlds. However, there are also additional levels of brains [beyond this basic level], which delight the living. These are the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and they are called <b>“great goodness”</b> and <b>“a life of delight.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“That extends from the next world to the one who lives forever.”</b> The brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, are drawn from <i>Bina</i>, which is called “the next world,” and the [first three] are enclothed in the precious garment of [the light of giving], which comes from the fusion of the <i>Yesodot</i>, called <b>“the one who lives forever.”</b> From there, the brains reach the righteous <b>“who fear sin.”</b>

Paragraph 107

<b>107. “Furthermore, “How great, etc.”</b><br><b>Furthermore,</b> we can interpret <b>“How</b> [<i>ma</i>] <b>great is Your goodness”</b> [as teaching] that <b>here the secret of the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is engraved, and all the secrets are incorporated here.</b> For the meaning of <b><i>ma</i> is as we learned</b> (in section 19, above)<b>. “Great” is a great and strong tree,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>since there is a smaller tree than him</b>, that is, the <i>Malkhut</i><b>. This</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> <b>is great and he brings him into the height of the firmaments.</b>
Explanation: In addition to [the previous] interpretation of the verse as referring to the attainment of the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], it can also be understood as recording the inner [aspects] of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and “all the secrets are incorporated” into this verse. <b>“The secret of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>”</b> means the fusion of the <i>Atik</i>; <b>“and all the secrets”</b> refers to the completion of the total rectification.
<b>“<i>Ma</i> is as we learned; ‘great’ is a great and strong tree.”</b> <i>Ma</i> is the lower world, as stated earlier (section 8). <b>“Great”</b> means <b>a great and strong tree,</b> that is, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> at the time of its enclothing of the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Ab</i>, at which time [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] is called <b>“a great tree,”</b> as a result of the [access to] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] is called <b>“strong”</b> with regard to itself. However, when <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is in its own place, it is termed merely <b>“a tree.”</b> This is the meaning of <b>“since there is a smaller tree than him,”</b> which is the <i>Malkhut</i>,” which is also called “a tree.” <b>“This is great” –</b> for when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] enclothes the level of <i>Ab</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] is called <b>“great.” “And he brings him into the height of the firmaments”</b> – the <i>Ab</i> brings the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to <b>“the height of the firmaments.”</b> The height of <i>Ab</i> reaches until the <i>Keter</i>, which is called <b>“the height of the firmaments,”</b> since the <i>Ab</i> enclothes over the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Keter</i>. Thus, <i>Ab</i> raises the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to <b>“the height of the firmaments.”</b>

Paragraph 108

<b>108. “‘Your goodness’ is the light, etc.”</b><br><b>“Your goodness” is the light that was created on the first day</b> of the act of creation. <b>“You have in store for those who fear You,”</b> that is, <b>for He concealed it on behalf of the righteous for that world. “Which You have created</b> [<i>pa’alta</i>]<b>” is the upper Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “The place You fashioned</b> [<i>pa’alta</i>] <b>for Your dwelling, Lord”</b> (Exodus 15:17). <b>This is</b> [the meaning of]: <b>“Which You have created for those taking refuge in You”</b> (Psalms 31:20).
Explanation: The light that was created on the first day is the light through which Adam the first [man] gazed from one end of the world to the other. This is the mystical meaning of the five times “light” is mentioned on the first day of the act of creation. <b>“On behalf of the righteous for that world,”</b> that is, in the World-to-Come, since that light was concealed in the foundations, which are the righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>] and justice [<i>tzedek</i>] of the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), called the World-to-Come. Those <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i> are called “those who fear You,” [named] after the power of concealment that is within them. This light is received by the righteous from them.
<b>“‘Which You have created</b> [<i>pa’alta</i>]’ <b>is the upper Garden of Eden,”</b> since it is previously written: “<b>You have in store,”</b> which means that the brains come in a precious garment of <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i>, in concealment, covered by those garments. And here it is written, <b>“which You have created,”</b> meaning an open act, without the aforementioned cover. [The <i>Zohar</i>] cites a proof from the verse: <b>“The place You fashioned</b> [<i>pa’alta</i>] <b>for Your dwelling, Lord,”</b> that is, a complete and open act.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] expounds that [the phrase] <b>“which You have created”</b> refers to the upper <b>Garden of Eden,</b> which is actuated and excluded from the category of those brains mentioned previously in the verse, which are in effect throughout the whole 6, 000 years. The verse should thus be read as follows: <b>“How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You,”</b> which are the brains of the entire 6, 000 years, for <b>“You have created”</b> all of these by means of the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>. <b>“For those taking refuge in You,”</b> since the upper Garden of Eden is actuated and emerges from these brains, [and the upper Garden of Eden is] where the completely righteous stay, those who take refuge in Him, that is, souls such as Benayahu Ben Yehoyada. These merit to receive from the fusion of the [<i>Atik Yomin</i>], which is gathered from all those brains of the 6, 000 years, as stated.
Know that the resting place of the souls is called <b>“the Garden of Eden.”</b> There is the earthly Garden of Eden, which is also called “the lower Garden of Eden,” and which is of the aspect of six extremities. There is the upper Garden of Eden, which is the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the Garden of Eden. All the souls stay only in the lower Garden of Eden. However, on New Moons and on Shabbatot they ascend to the upper Garden of Eden, after which they return to their place. But there are a select few whose place is in the upper Garden of Eden, regarding which Rabbi Shimon said: “I have seen the men of ascent, that they are few.”

Paragraph 109

<b>109. “In front of people”</b><br><b>“In front of people”</b> (Psalms 31:20). <b>This is the lower Garden of Eden, where all the righteous stand in a spirit enclothed in a precious garment, in the same way and form as they were in this world. This is</b> [the meaning of the phrase] <b>“in front of people,”</b> that is, <b>in the same form of people in this world. They stand there and fly in the air</b> from there <b>and ascend to the academy of the firmament in that Garden of Eden of above. They fly there and bathe in the dew of rivers of pure persimmon, and descend and stay below,</b> in the lower Garden of Eden.
Explanation: The main difference between the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>], both in the <i>partzufim</i> and the [individual] souls is that the [level of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] can receive the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> as it is, and they do not need the <i>Ḥokhma</i> to be enclothed for them in a garment of the light of giving. This is not the case for the <i>partzufim</i> of the six extremities, and likewise the souls that are born from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which are the essence of [the level of] six extremities – these [souls] can receive the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> only when it is enclothed in the light of giving.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“This is the lower Garden of Eden, where all the righteous stand in a spirit enclothed in a precious garment, in the same way and form as they were in this world.”</b> The spirits of all the righteous in the lower Garden of Eden are enclothed in a precious garment of the light of giving, like the souls of people in this world. By means of this <b>“precious garment,”</b> called <b>“air,”</b> they can ascend to the upper Garden of Eden and receive the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from there, and subsequently return to their place in the lower Garden of Eden.
<b>“They stand there”</b> means that their main, fixed place is in the lower Garden of Eden. <b>“And fly in the air and ascend to the academy of the firmament in that Garden of Eden of above.”</b> Through the strength of this <b>“air,”</b> which is the [enclothing garment of the] light of giving, they fly and ascend to the upper Garden of Eden to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>. <b>“They fly there and bathe in the dew of rivers of pure persimmon,”</b> since the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that they receive there, in the Garden of Eden, is called “<b>thirteen rivers of pure persimmon,”</b> for the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called <b>“oil,”</b> and the number <b>thirteen</b> alludes to the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the thirty-two paths (as stated above, in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, s. v., <i>Ve’im</i>).
They then <b>“descend and stay below,”</b> because they cannot remain there. Immediately after receiving the <i>Ḥokhma</i> within their <b>precious garment,</b> they descend from the upper Garden of Eden to their place, to the lower Garden of Eden. Since they need to receive the <i>Ḥokhma</i> within the garment [formed of the light of giving], like the souls of people in this world, the verse calls them as well, “in front of people.” [This is] because they have the same form as people in this world, since [the people of this world] also require the clothing of [the light of giving] like [these souls].

Paragraph 110

<b>110. “Sometimes, they appear etc.”</b><br><b>Sometimes,</b> these righteous ones <b>appear in front of people, to make miracles for them, like the upper angels, such as we saw now, the light of the supernal illumination. But we did not merit to observe and further know the secrets of the wisdom.</b>
Explanation: This is referring to the souls of the select few in the upper Garden of Eden. Their quality is so lofty that even the souls in the lower Garden of Eden who ascend to them on the New Moons and on Shabbatot cannot remain there, but promptly descend to their places. Nevertheless, they <b>“sometimes appear in front of people,”</b> descending from the upper Garden of Eden to this world and appear to people like upper angels that occasionally descend to this world. This is [the meaning of the phrase]: <b>“Such as we saw now, the light of the supernal illumination,”</b> that is, just as he now saw the light of the supernal illumination, that is, of Rav Hamnuna Saba, who descended to them from the loftiness of his level, from the upper Garden of Eden, and was revealed to them in this world.
The verse <b>“in front of people”</b> is thus expounded in two ways:
1. In reference to the souls in the lower Garden of Eden, that they have <b>“the form of people.”</b> He fashioned for them the lofty lights in the upper Garden of Eden so that they could receive from there by ascending on the New Moons and on Shabbatot, since then they merit to greet the souls in the upper Garden of Eden before descending once again back to their places.
2. “In front of people” literally, in this world, that is, these souls in the upper Garden of Eden sometimes descend to this world like the celestial angels and appear to the righteous.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“But we did not merit to observe and further know the secrets of the wisdom.”</b> The complaint is that he promptly disappeared from them, and from that time onward, they have not merited to attain any more <b>secrets of the Torah.</b>

Paragraph 111

<b>111. “Rabbi Abba opened etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Abba opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “And Manoah said to his wife: We shall surely die, because we have seen God”</b> (Judges 13:22). <b>Even though Manoah did not understand his actions,</b> as it is written, “For Manoah did not know that he was an angel of the Lord” (Judges 13:16), nevertheless, <b>he said: Since it is stated: “For man shall not see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and we have certainly seen, therefore “we will surely die.” Now, we saw and merited this light that was walking with us, and</b> yet <b>we still exist in the world. For the Holy One, blessed be He, sent it to us, to inform us the secrets of the wisdom that it revealed. Happy is our portion.</b>
Explanation: When the angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah, his comprehension [of the angel] was incomplete, for the angel did not wish to tell him his name, as it is stated: “Why do you ask for my name, seeing it is hidden?” (Judges 13:18). Despite this [incompleteness], he feared the verse: <b>“For man shall not see Me and live.”</b> But we merited the complete comprehension, since we knew his name, which is <b>Rav Hamnuna Saba,</b> and [yet] we are alive and exist in this world. From here you can understand that greeting the level of Rav Hamnuna Saba is an expression of: “Show me, I pray, Your glory” (Exodus 33:19), which Moses asked from the Lord, in response to which the Lord informed him: “You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.” It follows that their comprehension was greater than that of Moses, and with regard to this the Sages stated: “It is a prophet that did not arise like Moses [see Deuteronomy 34:10], but a Sage did arise [who was equal to him]” (end of <i>Yalkut Reuveini</i>), and similarly [their statement that] “a Sage is preferable to a prophet” (<i>Bava Batra</i> 12a).
They praised themselves in this regard: <b>“We saw and merited this light that was walking with us, and we still exist in the world,”</b> since we merited the light about which it is stated: <b>“For man shall not see Me and live,”</b> and we are alive in this world (see <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> 69, p. 115b).

Paragraph 112

<b>112. “They walked and reached a certain etc.”</b><br><b>They walked and reached a certain mountain, as the sun was setting. They began rattling the branches of a tree on the mountain against each other, and chanting a song. As they were walking, they heard a loud voice saying: “Holy sons of God, you who are scattered among the living in this world, you lamps of the members of the academy, gather to your places to delight with your Master in the Torah.” They became afraid and remained standing in their places, and</b> [then] <b>sat.</b>
Explanation: <b>“They walked and reached a certain mountain.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the mountain about which King David declared: “Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord, and who will stand in His holy place?” (Psalms 24:3). When they climbed the mountain the sun was setting, an allusion to the departure of their lights. The branches of the trees were rattling against each other, which is the mystical meaning of the conversing of the trees. They heard a song from them, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Then all the trees of the wood shall sing for joy” (Psalms 96:12).
<b>“They heard a loud voice etc.”</b> That is, they heard a loud voice instructing them to return to their places to delight with the Lord and His Torah, that is, that they should descend from the mountain. It called them <b>“holy sons of God”</b> due to their sublime level. However, it [also] alluded to them that the people of this world are unworthy of dwelling together with them. This is the meaning of the allusion to them, <b>“you who are scattered among the living in this world.”</b> In other words, the people of this world are unsuitable for them, since they would be unable to tolerate each other. 
Accordingly, <b>“they became afraid,”</b> and yet they did not descend from the mountain but arose, sat, and did not move from their places.

Paragraph 113

<b>113. “In the meantime a voice sounded out etc.”</b><br><b>Meanwhile, a voice sounded out as before, declaring: “Strong rocks, lofty hammers, behold the master of the colors, who is embroidered in images, standing on the platform</b> [<i>itztavna</i>]. <b>Come in and gather together.” At that moment they heard the sound of the branches of the trees, loud and strong, and they recited: “The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars”</b> (Psalms 29:5). <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba fell on their faces, and a great fear fell upon them. They rose in haste and left, and they heard nothing. They emerged from the mountain and left. <i>Itztavna</i></b> means platform, since the Aramaic translation of “on the platform” (II Kings 11:14) is “on the <i>astavna</i>.”
Explanation: It was explained above (section #105#, last paragraph) that the reason they were unable <b>“to drive the donkeys,”</b> meaning that they were unable to raise more feminine waters, was because Rav Hamnuna Saba had already finished his task of assisting them. Consequently, the power of his donkeys was nullified, and they could not use them anymore in order to raise feminine waters and merit a higher level. Rabbi Elazar therefore stated above: <b>“But we did not merit to observe and further know the secrets of the wisdom.”</b>
The relationship between the attainment of brains and the nullification of the ability to raising feminine waters requires explanation. The idea is that once they had attained the height of <i>yeḥida</i>, which is the revelation of the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada through Rav Hamnuna Saba, they experienced what has been explained with respect to the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada. Once the partition of <i>Ban</i> had been nullified from them, the partition of <i>Sag</i> was nullified together with it. Therefore, they were unable to raise more feminine waters, and <b>“left the donkeys”</b> (section #105#, last paragraph; see there). It was explained there that the whole cessation of the illumination from the body of the <i>Atik</i> was in order to grant them the strength to distill the partition of <i>Sag</i> for themselves anew. Then the <i>Ban</i> would return to be  <i>Sag</i>, at which point they would once again raise feminine waters, and would again go from strength to strength (Psalms 84:8); see there.
Now, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba as well, from when they left the donkeys and walked until here, all these exploits to that stage were enough for them to distill new strength for raising feminine waters once again and to restore the <i>Ban</i> back to being  <i>Sag</i>. It thus states: <b>“A voice sounded out as before, declaring: Strong rocks, lofty hammers,”</b> since they had endured all the great trials thus far and had mustered the strength to withstand them like strong rocks. They had also prevailed over all the obstacles, until they smashed them like a great hammer descending down from a great height.
They thereby caused: <b>“Behold the master of the colors, who is embroidered in images, standing on the platform.”</b> The <i>Bina</i> is called “master of the colors,” since she herself is without any color at all (but is totally mercy), and yet all the colors awaken and emerge from [<i>Bina</i>]. Through their endurance like a mighty rock against all those trials, the <i>Bina</i> was now embroidered with images afresh. This is why the <i>Bina</i> is called “<b>the master of the colors, embroidered in images,”</b> since [<i>Bina</i>] received the power to be established with a partition, upon which new levels and heights, called “images,” emerge, while she is <b>“standing on the platform”</b> [<i>itztavna</i>]; <i>itztavna</i> meaning a throne. Now the <i>Bina</i> has been established in the mystical meaning of the throne, as it was before. Therefore, <b>“come in and gather together,”</b> [for] it is time for you to enter your places in the holy [path], as you were earlier.
<b>“At that hour they heard the sound of the branches of the trees, loud and strong, and they recited: The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars.”</b> In other words, together with the voice informing them that the partition of the <i>Bina</i> and the throne had been established, they also heard a voice from the branches of the trees declaring: “<b>The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars.”</b> This was alluding to them that all the cedars that were obstructions on their way to the holy had already been broken. <b>“They emerged from the mountain”</b> because they had now mustered the strength to exit the mountain and make their way in the holy [path] as before.

Paragraph 114

<b>114. “When they arrived at the house of etc.”</b><br><b>When they arrived at the house of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Shimon, son of Lakunya, they saw Rabbi Shimon Bar Yoḥai there</b> and <b>they rejoiced</b> [and] <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> [also] <b>rejoiced. He said to them: “You must have passed through a path of miracles and lofty signs, for I have just been sleeping and I saw you and Benayahu Ben Yehoyada sending you two crowns by means of a certain old man, to crown you. Certainly, the Holy One, blessed be He, was on that path. Furthermore, I see that your faces have changed.” Rabbi Yosei said</b> [to them]: <b>“You spoke well, that a sage is preferable to a prophet.” Rabbi Elazar came and placed his head between the knees of his father, Rabbi Shimon, and related the incident to him.</b>
Explanation: This alludes to two matters: 1) That they had once again merited and attained the brains of <i>Sag</i>, which [are represented by] the aspect of the <b>father-in-law</b> of Rabbi Elazar (as stated in section #85#, above, 7th paragraph), who is called <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Shimon, son of Lakunya.</b> 2) That now the <i>Sag</i> had connected together with the <i>Ab</i> for them in an unending [fusion through collision]. The father of Rabbi Elazar, who is Rabbi Shimon, alludes to the brains of [the level of] <i>Ab</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“When they arrived at the house of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Shimon, son of Lakunya, they saw Rabbi Shimon Bar Yoḥai there,”</b> as now they had merited the lofty level in which their [aspect of] <i>Ban</i> had become actual <i>Sag</i> again, forever, and also in an unending fusion with the [level of] <i>Ab</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Sending you two crowns by means of a certain old man.”</b> He is alluding to them that <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> had sent to them, via Rav Hamnuna Saba, <b>two crowns:</b> 1) Brains of <i>yeḥida</i>, which is the aspect of <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> himself; 2) The new brains of <i>Ab</i> <i>Sag</i> that they have now attained, which are also drawn forth through the strength of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada.
In other words, he was alluding and saying to them, “This is the continuation of the trials and exploits you experienced, through which you merited the current level, which is itself also a direct extension from the great light of [Benayahu Ben Yehoyada's] soul. Thus, Benayahu Ben Yehoyada sent them <b>two crowns</b> by means of Rav Hamnuna Saba. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Certainly, the Holy One, blessed be He, was on that path,”</b> that is, all those setbacks that befell you are not flaws, Heaven forfend, but rather <b>the Holy One, blessed be He,</b> Himself led you to your lofty status.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Furthermore, I see that your faces have changed.”</b> In addition to your attainment, I see that your faces are strongly shining, on account of <b>the path</b> on which you walked. Had there been any flaws in it, Heaven forfend, you certainly would not have merited those bright faces I can see upon you.
<b>“Rabbi Yosei said: You spoke well, that a sage is preferable to a prophet.”</b> They thought that this is why all those exploits had happened to them, [that it was] because they grew conceited in their minds over our teacher Moses. They thought about themselves: “A sage is preferable to a prophet,” as they said, <b>“we saw and merited this light that was walking with us, and we still exist in the world”</b> (see section #111#, above).” Regarding this, Rabbi Yosei comforted them: <b>“You spoke well, that a sage is preferable to a prophet,”</b> that is, your statement was sincere.

Paragraph 115

<b>115. “Rabbi Shimon was afraid etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon was afraid and wept, saying: “O Lord, I have heard the report of You and am afraid”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2). <b>Habakkuk stated this verse when he saw his death and his revival by means of Elisha. Why is he called Habakkuk? Because it is stated: “At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace</b> [<i>ḥoveket</i>] <b>a son”</b> (II Kings 4:16), <b>for this</b> Habakkuk <b>was the son of the Shunammite. There were two embraces: One from his mother and one from Elisha, as it is written, “And he put his mouth upon his mouth</b> [and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the child warmed]” (II Kings 4:34).
Explanation: A question arises in this context: How is it possible that through his blessing the prophet Elisha extended to the Shunammite a seed that is not sustainable?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">How could Elisha make the "error" of giving the Shunammite woman a child that would shortly die?</i> The explanation is that the prophet Elisha was greater than all the prophets apart from Moses (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Beshallaḥ</i>, 2). He merited the aspect of souls from the supernal Garden of Eden, [souls in which the aspect of] <i>Ban</i> was already in a state of complete purity and wholeness, as it will be in the future. Therefore, when [Elisha] pulled the son to [the Shunammite], he was not careful to tie him to the male world, for he told her: <b>“You shall embrace a son,”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “son” is the same letters as the holy name <i>Ban</i> which represents the <i>Nukba</i></i> and he tied that embrace only to the side of <i>Nukba</i>. Since the <i>Nukba</i>, which is the <i>Ban</i>, is near the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> clung to him and he died.
Thus, the cause of the death was the result of the prophet’s lofty, exalted state, since his own <i>Ban</i> was already cleansed of any grip of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and death. This is why the prophet was surprised: “And the Lord hid it from me and did not tell me” (II Kings 4:27). In other words, he could not even contemplate that death could occur to [the child] as a result of [Elisha's] connection to the <i>Ban</i> alone. Consequently, [Elisha] had to return and revive him, and tie him to the higher world, in the mystical meaning of the resurrection of the dead, as will be explained here.
The mystical meaning of the embrace is that the essence of a child is the whiteness in it, <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This quote, from the Talmud (<i>Nidda</i> 31a) indicates that the man contributes "whiteness" to the fetus, while the woman contributes "redness. " As with all Kabbalah concepts, it alludes to the spiritual roots and not the physical fetus.</i> which is from the father (<i>Nidda</i> 31a), which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called “whiteness,” as is known, and this is the mystical meaning of: “In wisdom [<i>ḥokhma</i>] You have made them all” (Psalms 104:24). However, [<i>Ḥokhma</i>] requires the enclothing of the [light of giving], since there cannot be <i>Ḥokhma</i> without clothing of the [light of giving]. Therefore, the redness of the mother is required, which is the mystical meaning of the partition that extends the [light of giving] to enclothe the <i>Ḥokhma</i>. By means of the embrace of <i>Ḥokhma</i> by the [light of giving], the child is drawn and sustained. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“For this was the son of the Shunammite,”</b> that is, this embrace of <i>Ḥokhma</i> by the [light of giving], performed on the child, was all from his mother the Shunammite, that is, only from the side of <i>Ban</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say, the reference to the child as "the son of the Shunammite" is hinting to the underlying cause of the death of the child. The "Shunammite" is the femaleness, the <i>Nukba</i> and <i>Ban</i> without the anchor in the male aspect.</i>
It thus states: <b>“There were two embraces: One from his mother and one from Elisha.”</b> For when [Elisha] revived [the boy], [Elisha] drew down the whiteness and redness anew for him. Thus, Elisha made a second embrace for him, and as a result he had <b>two embraces, one from his mother and one from Elisha.</b>

Paragraph 116

<b>116. “I found in the book of King Solomon etc.”</b><br><b>I found in the book of King Solomon</b> that Elisha <b>engraved on</b> Habakkuk <b>the engraved name of seventy-two names, in words,</b> for each word consists of three letters (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Beshallaḥ</i>, 173, in the last diagram; see there). <b>The letters of the alphabet that his father had initially engraved upon him had flown from him when he died. Now when Elisha embraced him, he carved in him all those letters of the seventy-two names. These engraved letters of those seventy-two names are two hundred and sixteen letters,</b> that is, three letters for each name.
Explanation: The letters from which a fetus is constructed are <b>216</b>, and they are of the aspect of the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that is drawn from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. Thus, the child is considered to contain <b>216</b> letters, which is the numerical value of <b><i>re’iyah</i></b> [<i>reish-alef-yod-heh</i>, “vision”], meaning the light of the eyes, which is <i>Ḥokhma</i>. In the phase of maturity, when a garment of [the light of giving] is received from the higher world, from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] and 216 [letters] are enclothed in [the garments], the [fetus] is then called by the name <b>“seventy-two words,”</b> since each of their three letters join to form a single word, and they are [thus] <b>seventy-two words.</b>
When [the fetus] only has the [light of giving] for enclothing from the lower world, it is regarded as <b>216 letters.</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The "lower world" refers to the level of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> referenced above, in which the letters remain uncombined.</i> But when it attains the male [aspect of the level of] <i>Ab</i>, that is, the [light of giving] from the higher world, all [sets of] three letters join to form single words, and that is the mystical meaning of the name <b><i>Ab</i></b>. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The letters of <i>ayin bet</i>, forming the term <i>Ab</i>, are numerically valued as 70 and 2, respectively.</i> [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that Elisha <b>“engraved on him the engraved name of seventy-two names, in words.”</b> For when [Elisha] revived the son of the Shunammite, who was Habakkuk, Elisha engraved on him <b>seventy-two words</b> from <b>216 letters.</b> [This was in order to] extend to [the boy] the [light of giving] from the higher world, called the male aspect of <b><i>Ab</i></b>, which arranges the <b>216 letters</b> in rectified lines of three letters in each word. When the letters are enclothed in [the lights of giving in order to form them into words], this is the mystical meaning of the name <b><i>Ab</i></b>, which is the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in a completed state.
However, beforehand, while he had only the [light of giving] of the <i>Nukba</i>, they still lacked the [state of] combining into <b>seventy-two words.</b> That is, they contained no words, that is, no vessels for the enclothing of  <i>Ḥokhma</i>. They were called only by the name <b>216 letters,</b> because they still could be grasped by the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Consequently, the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> could not be enclothed there.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“Since the letters of the alphabet etc.”</b> These <b>216 letters</b> that Habakkuk had from the time of his birth, <b>flew</b> and departed <b>from him</b> at the time of death, and therefore [Elisha] had to draw forth a new [set of] 216 letters and seventy-two names for him. This is why it states that <b>“Elisha carved all those letters in</b> [Habakkuk’s] <b>spirit, to revive him with letters of the seventy-two names”</b> [section #117#, below], since he had to engrave 216 letters in him anew, in order to combine the 216 letters into seventy-two words by means of the higher [light of giving], through which they became <b>seventy-two names.</b>

Paragraph 117

<b>117. “Elisha carved all those letters etc.”</b><br><b>Elisha carved all those letters in</b> Habakkuk’s <b>spirit, to revive him with letters of the seventy-two names. He called him Habakkuk,</b> which is <b>a name that completes</b> and alludes to <b>all the sides,</b> for <b>it completes</b> and alludes to two <b>embraces, as stated, and it completes</b> and alludes to <b>the secret of the two hundred and sixteen letters of the holy name,</b> since Habakkuk has the numerical value of 216, from which the seventy-two names were formed, as stated above. <b>He revived and brought back his spirit with</b> seventy-two <b>names, and revived his entire body to its proper state with</b> 216 <b>letters, and therefore he is called Habakkuk.</b>
Explanation: [The name of] <b>Habakkuk</b> reflects the two <b>embraces</b> [<i>ḥibukim</i>], and hence [the expression] <b>“it completes the embraces.”</b> Furthermore, <b>Habakkuk</b> has the numerical value of <b>216,</b> and this is [why it states] <b>“completes the secret of the two hundred and sixteen letters.”</b> The meaning is that <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called <b>“the secret of the two hundred and sixteen letters.”</b> However, an embrace is required, that is, the enclothing [of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in] the [light of giving], as stated. Now, in the first embrace, which was from the side of <b>his mother</b>, the <i>Ḥokhma</i> could not yet be revealed in the <b>216 letters,</b> since the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> had a hold of the redness of <b>his mother.</b> But now that <b>Elisha</b> drew forth an embrace for him from the [light of giving] of the higher world, from the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), the letters combined into words, and the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> were permanently enclothed in the words, since there is no longer a purchase for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> in the [light of giving] of the higher world.
The name <b>Habakkuk</b> reflects two <b>embraces</b>, an embrace from <b>his mother,</b> and another embrace that he received, from <b>Elisha.</b> He is completed from all sides, both from <i>Ḥokhma</i> in its fullness, and from the [light of giving] in its fullness. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“It completes the embraces, as stated, and it completes the secret of the two hundred and sixteen letters of the holy name.”</b> The embraces are the [light of giving] of the [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] and <b>“the secret of the two hundred and sixteen,”</b> which is the <i>Ḥokhma</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He revived and brought back his spirit with</b> [seventy-two] <b>words, and revived his entire body to its proper state with</b> [216] <b>letters.”</b> The words that were formed from the <b>216 letters</b> were fashioned by the second embrace of <b>Elisha,</b> since [Habakkuk] was returned to life by means of this embrace. This [embrace] is the drawing forth of [the light of giving] from the higher world, where there is no purchase for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is death. Through the <b>“secret of the two hundred and sixteen letters,”</b> the <i>Ḥokhma</i> was sustained in [the boy], meaning the existence of his entire body in its proper state, since the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> complete the body into a state of wholeness.
The following question arises: Since the <b>216 letters</b> [the boy] had from his birth <b>flew from him</b> upon death, why, then, was he called <b>Habakkuk,</b> after <b>the two embraces</b> [<i>ḥibukin</i>]? After all, his mother’s embrace flew from him upon [his] death and he was left with only <b>Elisha’s</b> embrace. The answer is that in fact, <b>Elisha</b> did not draw forth anything new for him in his revival, apart from the embrace that he drew for him from the higher mother, <i>Sag</i>, in which lies the mystical meaning of the resurrection of the dead. However, the <b>216 letters,</b> as well as the embrace from <b>his mother,</b> from <i>Ban</i>, were merely revived. They are the same 216 letters and <i>Ban</i> from the time of his birth, since otherwise he would have been a whole new soul, and resurrection would not be applicable to him.
Thus, he now has literally <b>two embraces,</b> since the first embrace of <b>his mother</b> has also been revived. The mystical meaning is that the <i>Ban</i> ascended and enclothed the <i>Sag</i>, and since the <i>Ban</i> is in the place of the <i>Sag</i>, the [light of giving] are of the level the higher world [of <i>Sag</i>] and there is no purchase in them for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is death. Consequently, he is called <b>Habakkuk,</b> after the <b>two embraces</b> [<i>ḥibukim</i>].

Paragraph 118

<b>118. “He said, ‘O Lord, etc.”</b><br><b>He said: “O Lord, I have heard the report of You and am afraid”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2). This means: <b>I heard what had happened to me, that I tasted from that world,</b> that is, at the time of his death, before Elisha revived him, <b>and I became afraid. He began to request mercy for his soul, saying: “O Lord, may Your work” that You performed for me, “in the midst of the years” be “<i>ḥaiyaihu</i>”</b> and <i>ḥaiyaihu</i> is like <b>“his life”</b> [<i>ḥayav</i>]. <b>Whoever connects to those ancient years,</b> which are the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atik</i>, <b>life connects to him. “In the midst of the years make it known”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2), meaning to bestow life <b>upon that level where there is no life,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, for “make it known” means “bestow.”
Explanation: His fear is from the past, since he has already been completed from all sides and now fear does not apply to him, except for the fear he experienced in the past, when he departed from the world. This is the meaning of his statement: <b>“I heard what had happened to me, that I tasted from that world,”</b> that is, after his death, before <b>Elisha</b> revived him. From there he draws forth fear even now, to be a partition for him to raise feminine waters. This is the meaning of <b>“he began to request mercy for his soul,”</b> that is, through the strength of the fear from the past, he began to raise feminine waters, which is the mystical meaning of the request for mercy for himself.
This is also the mystical meaning of the partition of the future, in the mystical meaning of [the stage] after the <i>Ban</i> returns to being <i>Sag</i>. At that time, it will be the stage of “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8), and there will be no possible power for fear, [no need to fight to] keep himself in purity and guard from any grip [of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>]. Any aspect of fear will then be from the power of the past, since its imprints will remain in <i>Ban</i> even after it has become <i>Sag</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The level of <i>Ban</i> alone, as explained in the preceding sections, is open to the purchase of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Even after <i>Ban</i> ascends to <i>Sag</i>, the imprints of those vulnerabilities will still be accessible, as remnants of the past, even though they will not truly exist in the present of that stage.</i> This is a necessary matter, for there is no rectification of the partition without fear. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is the key to understanding these sections. The main concept is that although at the future period, when <i>Ban</i> has ascended to <i>Sag</i>, and death has been eliminated, there will still be a process of evolution and rectification. The choice to do evil, represented by the "fear" we currently experience in this phase, will be essentially rendered purely conceptual. Even in this theoretical form, we can still use these traces of fear from the past to allow us to continue to progress in rectifications, deepening our spiritual development.</i> Rabbi Shimon told them this exposition on Habakkuk in connection to this mystical meaning, to teach them that they will also receive fear from this path of miracles and the lofty signs through which they passed, like Habakkuk in accordance with his level, for he made use of this fear.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“May Your work that You performed for me in the midst of the years be his life.”</b> He had two types of <b>years</b>: <b>Years</b> before his death and <b>years</b> after his resurrection. In between, he was deceased in the world of truth. He states regarding the time when he was in that world, which was <b>in the midst of</b> these two aspects of <b>years, “may Your work that You performed for me in the midst of the years be his life.”</b> In other words, by my remembering the period of my death which was in <b>the midst of the years,</b> I connect to the life of the higher world, through which <b>Elisha</b> revived me (as stated just above). <b>“I heard what had happened to me, that I tasted from that world, and I became afraid.”</b>
Now, the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] are called <b>“ancient years,”</b> and this is because of the <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> which is enclothed in them. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">"Ancient" here does not mean ancient in material time, but rather, preceding in the devolved chain of existence. The point here is that the level beyond death, which is “ancient” in the chain (meaning higher), is accessible at the completion of the rectification, a level accessed by Habakkuk.</i> They are more <b>ancient</b> than the first constriction, like <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, and they do not illuminate during the 6, 000 years, but only at the completion of the rectification. The seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] illuminate in the 6, 000 years [only] with respect to the [process of] rectifying the second constriction, in the mystical meaning of the small [letter] <i>heh</i> of <i>hibare’am</i> [“when they were created”], as is known.
However, the death of <b>Habakkuk</b> completely purified him, like at the completion of the rectification, and therefore he merited to connect to those earlier years of [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] through the strength of the embrace and the resurrection of the dead which he merited by means of <b>Elisha.</b> This is the meaning of: <b>“Your work that You performed for me in the midst of the years,”</b> that is, the purity and fear that he merited <b>in the midst of the years</b>, the period of his death. <b>“Be his life,”</b> that by the strength of this fear he will merit to connect to those earlier years of [<i>Atik Yomin</i>], that life which is an eternal life. [the <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“Whoever connects to those earlier years, life connects to him,”</b> for life connects to him forever.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“In the midst of the years make it known, upon that level where there is no life at all.”</b> Through the purity that he merited on account of his death, the <i>Ban</i> received its complete rectification, since it ascended and became <i>Sag</i> upon his death, as stated. Then it was in that level where there is no life at all, which is <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, [a level] that lacks any [fusion through collision] prior to the completion of the rectification (as stated in section #43#, above, 5th paragraph). [Following this rectification of <i>Ban</i>], this level [of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>] now also receives its life [and undergoes fusions].

Paragraph 119

<b>119. “Rabbi Shimon wept, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon wept and said: “I, too, was afraid of the Holy One, blessed be He, from what I heard.” He placed his hands upon his head and declared: “Now, Rav Hamnuna Saba is the light of the Torah; you merited to see him face-to-face, and I did not merit</b> [to see] <b>him.” He fell upon his face and saw him uprooting mountains</b> and <b>lighting candles in the chamber of the King Messiah.</b> [Rav Hamnuna Saba] <b>said to him, “My rabbi, in that world you will be alongside the heads of the academies, before the Holy One, blessed be He.” From that day onwards he would call his son Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Abba, Peniel</b> [“face of God”], <b>as it is stated:</b> “[And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel], <b>for I have seen God face-to-face”</b> (Genesis 32:31).
Explanation: He praised himself that he too had made use of that same fear of the prophet Habakkuk, that is, <b>from what he heard</b>, from the time of the past, in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“I have heard the report of You and am afraid”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2, as stated just above, in the beginning of section #118#).
Now, in the chamber of the King Messiah, all the rectifications that must be revealed at the completion of the rectification, upon the arrival of King Messiah, are already prepared and ready. Not a single tiny detail is missing. Those souls that are in the chamber of the King Messiah are all those who have already merited the completion of the rectification, from the root of their own souls.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And saw him uprooting mountains</b> and <b>lighting candles in the chamber of the King Messiah.” Rav Hamnuna Saba</b> is the master of these rectifications in the chamber of the Messiah. He <b>uproots the mountains</b> of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, in the mystical meaning of the appearance [of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] to the righteous as a tall mountain (<i>Sukka</i> 52a), and he <b>lights candles</b>, that is, he establishes the new partition with respect to the <i>Sag</i> to allow the raising of feminine waters at the completion of the rectification. The mystical meaning of the feminine waters is called “lights of fire,” and that is the mystical meaning of: “The soul of man is the candle of the Lord” (Proverbs 20:27). This is because the light of the sun is indicative of the downward flow of the masculine waters, like the light of the sun descending to us from above to below. The light of fire is the mystical meaning of the returning light, which ascends from below to above, like a flame rising from a candle. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sunlight travels "downward, " toward us from above, while the flames of fire flicker upward. Sunlight represents the downward flow of light from the <i>Ein Sof</i> to us (the masculine waters), while flames represent our returning light and our feminine waters, our yearning from below to receive that which flows from above.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that these two rectifications, to remove the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and to raise and light the candles <b>in the chamber of the King Messiah,</b> are in the hands <b>of Rav Hamnuna Saba.</b> Those completely righteous ones who require these two rectifications merit them only through the revelation of the soul <b>of Rav Hamnuna Saba.</b> [Rav Hamnuna Saba] informed [Rabbi Shimon] that he and his disciples, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba, would also merit to serve in the chamber of the King Messiah after their deaths, and that they would be alongside him there, and be <b>heads of academies</b> there <b>before the Holy One, blessed be He.</b>

Paragraph 120

<b>120. “<i>Bereshit</i>. Rabbi Ḥiyya, etc.”</b><br><b><i>Bereshit</i>. Rabbi Ḥiyya opened</b> [his discourse by citing this verse]: <b>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it will have a good understanding; His praise endures forever”</b> (Psalms 111:10). <b>“The beginning of wisdom” –</b> the question is raised: <b>This verse should have stated: “The fear of the Lord is the end of wisdom,” since the fear of the Lord</b> is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>which is the end of wisdom</b> [<i>Ḥokhma</i>] The answer is: <b>Rather,</b> <i>Malkhut</i> <b>is the first to enter the level of the supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as it is stated: “Open for me the gates of righteousness</b> [<i>tzedek</i>]” (Psalms 118:19), which are the gates of <i>Malkhut</i>, called <i>tzedek</i>. <b>“This is the gate of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 118:20) <b>– certainly, if one does not enter through this gate, he will never enter to the supernal King, for He is lofty, hidden, and concealed, and He fashioned gates for Himself, one above the other.</b>
Explanation: The question being asked is: Since the <b>fear of the Lord</b> is the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is at the end of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, [the verse] should have stated: <b>“The fear of the Lord is the end of wisdom.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] then states: <b>“The supernal King</b> […] <b>is lofty, hidden, and concealed</b> etc.” This is not a metaphor but the point itself. It means that since He is a lofty, hidden, and concealed King, and no thought can grasp Him at all, He therefore fashioned many gates <b>one above the other,</b> by virtue of which [He] made the approach to Him possible. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “Open for me the gates of righteousness.” These are the gates that God has fashioned and [thereby] provided the option for the righteous to approach Him via those gates.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And at the end of all the gates, He made one gate with several locks</b> etc.” [section #121#, below]. This is the gate called <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the end point of all the supernal gates. This last gate is the first gate to the <b>supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i>.</b> In other words, it is only possible to merit the supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i> specifically after the attainment of this last gate, because this [gate] is the first gate for attaining the s<b>upernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>. With regard to this mystical meaning, it is stated: <b>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,”</b> since it is specifically “the fear of the Lord” [which is <i>Malkhut</i>] that is the last gate, which is the first [gate] to [reach] the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the Lord.

Paragraph 121

<b>121. “And at the end of all the gates, etc.”</b><br><b>And at the end of all the gates, He made one gate with several locks, with several openings, with several chambers, one above the other. He declared: “Anyone who wishes to enter My</b> [Presence], <b>this gate will be the first to Me. One who enters, will enter through this gate.” Here too, the first gate to the supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i> is the fear of the Lord,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>and this is</b> the one called <b>“first.”</b>
Explanation: It is necessary to understand thoroughly the meaning of <b>“locks,” “openings,”</b> and <b>“chambers.”</b> Know that these are three forms that come one after the other, with respect to a single substance. This is a very profound matter and I will make the effort to explain as best as I can, so that these words of the <i>Zohar</i> will be somewhat comprehensible. One should know that although it is clear that no thought can grasp Him in any manner at all, the truth is that [God’s] intent in [creating] Creation was to provide pleasure to His creatures. Now, no pleasure can be grasped by a created being if [that being] is necessarily separate from the Creator, Heaven forbid. Furthermore, the Sages have stated that the Holy One, blessed be He, yearned to dwell in the lower realms. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">TThe author of the <i>Sulam</i> is identifying a contradiction here. It is clear that God cannot be grasped in any manner whatsoever. Yet, God's intent in Creation was to provide pleasure to the created beings, a pleasure which cannot be experienced by beings that are isolated from their Creator. Additionally, the Sages of the Talmud stressed that God desires to dwell among the created beings, a further impossibility given God's opposite nature compared to the created beings. How can God's "desire" to connect with and dwell among His creatures be resolved?</i>
The common denominator for understanding those two contradicting concepts is that the world was created as the exact opposite of God, [opposite as] the two extremes [on a spectrum], with regard to every single point. This world was created out of the aspect of the will to receive, which is the form that is opposite to God, since He does not have even a shred of this will. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The beings of Creation, and all of Creation itself, are formed of a "will to receive, " meaning, a capacity to take and receive from something beyond themselves. This is the fundamental opposite of God who has no such dependence of receiving from anything or anyone outside of Himself.</i> This is the mystical meaning of: “A man is born a man as a wild donkey’s colt” (Job 11:12). From this perspective, all matters of the guidance of His Providence in this world are in absolute contradiction to [His] intent for the Creation, which is only to provide pleasure to His creatures, [pleasure] that is correlated with the will to receive within us, which is our taste and our standard of measurement. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The underlying concept here is that pleasure is experienced when there is relief from a lack. This pleasurable sensation manifests when a person receives something he lacks, something he wants. Accordingly, pleasure is correlated by the will to receive within us, because according to that fundamental element's variance, our pleasure varies as well (a person does not enjoy things he doesn't lack or want). This fundamental underlying wanting, the will to receive, is what gives our lives "taste and a standard of measurement, " meaning it is what allows us to appraise and evaluate different things and experiences in life.</i>
This is the mystical meaning of the <b>locks</b> on the gates. For in truth, all the many contradictions to His unity, which we experience in this world, although they initially separate us from God, when we make the effort to fulfill the Torah and mitzvot with love, with our souls and our might, as we are commanded (that is, in order to provide satisfaction to our Maker), then all those forces of separation do not affect us into diminishing any of the love of God with all our souls and might. [Then] each and every contradiction that we have overcome subsequently becomes a gate for the attainment of His wisdom. Every contradiction contains a special quality, which reveals a unique level in the attainment of Him. Those worthy individuals who have merited this, will transform darkness into light and bitter into sweet. All the powers of separation, including both the darkness of the intellect and the bitterness of the body, have for [such people] become gates for the attainment of lofty levels. The darkness thus turns into a great light, and the bitter becomes sweet.
[This conversion of darkness to light takes place such that] to the degree that all the workings of His Providence had previously been [experienced as] forces of separation for [such people], [these workings] have now all transformed for [such people] into forces of unification. They have thus tilted the entire world to the scale of merit, for each and every force now serves for them as <b>gates of righteousness,</b> through which they will enter to receive from God everything that He has thought with regard to them, to provide them with pleasure, in [His initial] intent for the Creation, and [hence the verse]: “This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it” (Psalms 118:20).
However, before meriting to transform the will to receive that is within us, through the Torah and commandments, into “receiving in order to give,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The process of growth and development for the created beings is to transition from beings who receive for our own interests to beings who receive in order to bestow. By achieving this transformation, in which our receiving of God's gifts is in order to give back to God, we become like the Creator, givers instead of receivers.</i> there are powerful locks on those gates to the Lord, since at that stage they have the opposite task, which is to drive us away from God. This is why these forces of separation are called <b>“locks,”</b> because they block the gates of approach and distance us from God. However, if we overcome them, such that they do not affect us by cooling His love from our hearts, the <b>locks</b> then become <b>openings,</b> the darkness becomes light, and the bitter becomes sweet, as stated. The reason is that for each and every lock we receive a special level of His Providence, and they become <b>openings,</b> levels of attainment of Him. These levels we receive from these <b>openings</b> subsequently become <b>chambers</b> of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>.
This is how the <b>locks, openings,</b> and <b>chambers</b> are three forms that affect our single substance, that is, the will to receive that is within us. Before we transform it into “receiving in order to give” satisfaction to our Maker, this substance transforms, in accordance with our taste, the light into darkness and the sweet into bitter, since all the workings of His Providence drive us from Him. At that time, <b>locks</b> are fashioned from the will to receive in us, but after our repentance, when we merit [the level of] “receiving in order to give,” all the <b>locks</b> become <b>openings,</b> and then the <b>openings</b> become <b>chambers,</b> as explained. This must be kept in mind for all that follows, for I will not restate these ideas.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Anyone who wishes to enter My</b> [Presence], <b>this gate will be the first to Me.”</b> The meaning of the gates has already been thoroughly explained; see above. <b>“The end of all the gates”</b> refers to the last aspect within them, the lowliest of all, which can be called <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that in order to merit the <b>supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>, this gate, the last of all of them, becomes the first gate to the chamber of the <b>supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>. For in truth, all the gates serve as <b>openings</b> and <b>chambers</b> to the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the Lord, but it is impossible to attain the <b>supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b> without attaining the last gate specifically, since it is the first [gate] for the s<b>upernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And this is</b> [the one called] <b>“first</b> [<i>reishit</i>],” which is referring to [the word] <b><i>Bereshit</i>,</b> with which the Torah begins. <b><i>Bereshit</i></b> represents the fear of God from the aspect of the last gate, which is the <b>first</b> [gate] for attaining the s<b>upernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>.

Paragraph 122

<b>122. “<i>Bet</i>, these two, etc.”</b><br>[The letter] <b><i>bet</i> from <i>Bereshit</i></b> indicates <b>that these two combine together</b> in <i>Malkhut</i>. <b>They are two points, one is concealed and hidden, and</b> [the other] <b>one is in a revealed state. Since there is no separation between them, they are called “first,”</b> that is, only <b>one and not two.</b> For <b>one who takes this</b> one, <b>takes that</b> one as well, <b>and all is one, for He and His name are one, as it is stated: “That they may know that it is You alone whose name is YHVH”</b> (Psalms 83:19).
Explanation: Those two points are the mystical meaning of the tempering of the attribute of judgment with the attribute of mercy, when <i>Malkhut</i> ascended and was tempered in <i>Bina</i>, which is the attribute of mercy, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “So they both walked” (Ruth 1:19), which is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> together (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Pineḥas</i>, 57, and in several other places). <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the second constriction.</i> Thus, the partition that was established upon <i>Malkhut</i> consists of both [<i>Malkhut</i> and <i>Bina</i>], and therefore there are <b>two points</b> combined as one there. [The <i>Zohar</i>] continues, that <b>“one is concealed and hidden, and</b> [the other] <b>one is in a revealed state,”</b> because the aspect of judgment in the point of <i>Malkhut</i> is <b>concealed and hidden,</b> and only the aspect of mercy from the point of <i>Bina</i> <b>is in a revealed state.</b> If not [for this concealment] the world would not be able to exist, as the Sages state: “Initially, the world was created with the attribute of judgment; He saw that the world could not exist, and partnered the attribute of mercy with it” (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i>, 1).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Since there is no separation between them, they are called ‘first, ’ one and not two. One who takes this, takes that.”</b> In other words, although the attribute of judgment is <b>concealed,</b> this does not mean that the [fusion through collision] is not performed upon it, for those two points have become literally one, and the point of the <i>Malkhut</i> also receives this fusion with the point of <i>Bina</i>, only secretly rather than <b>in a revealed state.</b> The name <i>reishit</i> [“first”], which is in a singular [as opposed to plural] form, indicates this, that they are both one.
<b>“And all is one, for He and His name are one.” “He”</b> refers to the <i>Bina</i>, while <b>“His name”</b> refers to the <i>Malkhut</i>. The text is saying that in the mystical meaning of <b>“He and His name are one”</b> both of them must necessarily be one, since when they are one the <i>Malkhut</i> also receives the supernal [fusion through collision] together with the <i>Bina</i>. In this [manner], the attribute of judgment is also ultimately tempered by itself at the completion of the rectification, when “on that day, the Lord shall be one and His name one” (Zechariah 14:9). 
On account of this attribute of judgment, which is incorporated in the <b><i>bet</i></b> of <i>Bereshit</i>, [the attribute of judgment, <i>Malkhut</i>, ] is called the “first” towards the <i>Ḥokhma</i>. The rectification [of the attribute of judgment] will be at the completion of the rectification, at which time the s<b>upernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b> will be revealed, and “the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord” (Isaiah 11:9), since it is the last gate, which is the first gate to the <i>Ḥokhma</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous two sections which explain this further.</i> This is why it cites the verse: <b>“That they may know</b> that it is You [alone] whose name is the Lord,” for then the knowledge will be revealed the throughout the earth.

Paragraph 123

<b>123. “Why is it called the fear, etc.”</b><br><b>Why is</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>called “the fear of the Lord”?</b> He answers: <b>Because</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>is the tree of good and evil. If a person merits, it is good; if he does not merit, it is evil. Therefore, fear resides in that place. It is the gateway to reach all the good that is in the world. “A good understanding”</b> (Psalms 111:10) <b>is those two gates,</b> that is, the two points, <b>which are as one. Rabbi Yosei said: “A good understanding” – this is the tree of life, which is a good understanding without any evil at all. Since no evil resides in it, it is a good understanding, without evil.</b>
Explanation: The purpose here is to explain why the last gate is called “<b>the fear of the Lord,”</b> regarding which it is stated: <b>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom”</b> (Psalms 111:10). [The reason] is that this is the mystical meaning of the tree of knowledge with which Adam the first [man] sinned. It is due to this point [of <i>Malkhut</i> that is the tree] that he was punished with death, and the great fear is not to impair [this point of <i>Malkhut</i>]. At the completion of the rectification, when this point will be entirely rectified in full completion, the verse: <b>“He will eliminate death forever”</b> (Isaiah 25:8) will be fulfilled. This is why it is called <b>“the fear of</b> [the Lord],” and this is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Therefore, fear resides in that place.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“it is the gateway to reach all the good that is in the world.”</b> The revelation of the s<b>upernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b> is all the good of the world, which is included in [God’s initial] intent for the Creation. Since <b>“the fear of the Lord”</b> is the first gate to the s<b>upernal <i>Ḥokhma</i></b>, it is thus the gate <b>to all the good that is in the world.</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“‘A good understanding’ is those two gates, which are as one,”</b> that is, the <b>two points</b> together, when they are incorporated in the <b><i>bet</i></b> of <i>Bereshit</i>. The reason why it does not state <b>two points,</b> but rather <b>two gates,</b> is that it is referring to after the rectification of the <i>Ban</i> [after the completion of the rectification]. At this stage these <b>two points</b> are called <b>two gates,</b> because then they are both good, without any evil at all, and therefore the verse <b>“a good understanding”</b> is possible. This is not the case before the completion of the rectification, for then they are called “the tree of knowledge of <b>good and evil,”</b> as stated.
<b>“Rabbi Yosei said</b> etc.” Rabbi Yosei does not disagree with Rabbi Ḥiyya; they merely expound the text in a different manner. Rabbi Ḥiyya explains the verse as referring to [the period after] the rectification of the <i>Ban</i>, when the two points become two gates, as stated, and they do not contain <b>evil,</b> but are <b>a good understanding without any evil at all.</b> Rabbi Yosei [by contrast] interprets the verse as referring to [the stage] before the completion of the rectification, when [the two points] are of the aspect of the tree of knowledge of <b>good and evil.</b> He thus states that <b>“a good understanding” is the tree of life,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> with the brains of the <i>Imma</i> (mother), called <b>“the tree of life”</b> because it is all good, without any evil at all, even before the completion of the rectification. That is not the case for the <b>two points,</b> which are of the aspect of <b>good and evil</b> before the completion of the rectification, and on account of which the <i>Malkhut</i> is called the tree of good and evil, as stated.

Paragraph 124

<b>124. “All those who practice it, these are etc.”</b><br><b>“All those who practice it</b> [<i>oseihem</i>]<b>”</b> (Psalms 111:10). <b>These are “the faithful mercies of David”</b> (Isaiah 55:3), <b>the preservers of the Torah. Those who preserve the Torah are as if they are the ones who fashion</b> [<i>osim</i>] <b>it. All those who engage in Torah do not practice</b> [it] <b>while they are engaged in it, but those who preserve</b> it <b>do practice</b> [it], <b>and through this strength the verse: “His praise endures forever”</b> is fulfilled, <b>and the throne stands properly established.</b>
Explanation: It was explained above that this gate of the fear of the Lord, which is the last gate, is the first gate to the supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Thus, [with respect to] <b>those who engage in Torah,</b> who have already rectified the last gate and for whom the two points have become two gates (which are “a good understanding” without evil), it is considered that <b>“those who engage in Torah do not practice</b> [it],” which is [referring to] the aspect of the <b>tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</b> However, those who have not yet merited the completion of the rectification, who are called <b>“preservers of the Torah,” do practice</b> [it], which is <b>good and evil,</b> since they have not yet rectified the sin of the tree of knowledge. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Practice of the Torah” means the application of Torah concepts in this world, the world in which good and evil are mixed together as a result of the tree of knowledge. “Practice” comes from the Hebrew word <i>asiya</i>, which is the same concept as the world of <i>Asiya</i>.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that <b>“those who preserve the Torah are as if they are the ones who fashion it.”</b> It was explained above at length how all these forces of separation are transformed and become gates, and each lock becomes an opening, and every opening a chamber of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Through these [openings] all the lofty levels that were incorporated in [God’s initial] intent for the Creation, which is to provide pleasure to His creatures, come forth and are revealed. See there [in greater detail].
Thus, all the wisdom and the whole Torah are fully revealed only by means of <b>those who preserve the Torah, who practice</b> [it], that is, in whom there is good and evil. This is why they are called <b>“preservers of the Torah,”</b> since it is revealed only through them. The verse calls them <b>“those who practice it</b> [<i>oseihem</i>]<b>,”</b> since it is as if they fashion [<i>osim</i>] the Torah. Were it not for their concealments, which turn into gates through their prevailing over them, the Torah would not be revealed. This is the meaning of <b>“those who preserve the Torah are as if they are the ones who fashion it,”</b> that is, they are considered <b>as if</b> they fashioned it since they reveal it.
That which [the <i>Zohar</i>] states “as if” is because the Torah preceded the world (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 54a), and it is certainly the case that the Holy One, blessed be He, fashioned it. However, since, without the good deeds of the “<b>preservers of the Torah,”</b> the Torah would not have been revealed, they are considered to have fashioned and made the Torah.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Through this strength the verse: ‘His praise endures forever’</b> [is fulfilled].” That is, <b>through the strength</b> of <b>those who preserve the Torah, “His praise,”</b> which is all of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and all of Torah, <b>“endures forever.” [</b>The expression] “forever” serves to include [the stage] after the completion of the rectification. Even then, [people] will require <b>“the fear of the Lord,”</b> and after the rectification of the tree of knowledge [people] will have nowhere from which to take <b>“the fear of the Lord”</b> other than from time past, which is from the <b>“preservers of the Torah”</b> (see section #118#, above). [The preservers of the Torah] thus establish the praise of the Lord forever and ever. [The <i>Zohar</i>] therefore states: <b>“And the throne stands properly established,”</b> since in this manner the <b>throne</b> will be <b>established properly,</b> for all eternity.

Paragraph 125

<b>125. “Rabbi Shimon was etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon was sitting and engaging in the Torah on the night when the bride,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>bonds with her husband. For we learned: All the colleagues, who are the members of the bridal chamber, are needed on that night, because on the day after</b> which is the day of Shavuot, [when] <b>the bride is meant to be with her husband under the wedding canopy,</b> [so the colleagues] <b>must be with her all that night and rejoice with her in her rectifications which she undergoes,</b> that is, <b>to engage in the Torah, from the Torah to the Prophets, and from the Prophets to the Writings, and in the expositions of the verses, and in the secrets of the wisdom. These are her rectifications and adornments. And she,</b> the bride, <b>and her maidens, come and stand on their heads, and she is rectified through them and rejoices in them all throughout that entire night. On the next day,</b> the day of Shavuot, <b>she comes to the wedding canopy only with them. And these</b> colleagues, who engage in the Torah all night long, <b>are called “members of the wedding canopy.” And once she comes to the wedding canopy, the Holy One, blessed be He, inquires about them, blesses them, and crowns them with the crowns of the bride. Happy is their portion.</b>
Explanation: There are two complementary meanings to this section: 1) The days of the exile are called <b>“night,”</b> since this is the time of the concealment of His face from the children of Israel. All the powers of separation rule over the servants of God, and yet, it is precisely at that time that the bride bonds with her husband. [This occurs] through the Torah and commandments of the righteous, who at that time are called <b>“the preservers of the Torah.”</b> All the lofty levels that are called “the secrets of the Torah” are revealed through them, since this is why they are called <b>“those who practice it</b> [<i>oseihem</i>]” (Psalms 111:10), because it is <b>as if</b> they fashion [<i>osim</i>] the Torah (see section #124#, above). Thus, the period of the exile is called <b>night,</b> “<b>when the bride bonds with her husband”</b> and <b>“all the colleagues, who are the members of the bridal chamber,”</b> are the <b>“preservers of the Torah.”</b>
The [period following the] <b>completion of the rectification</b> and the full redemption is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And there shall be one day which shall be known as the Lord’s, not day and not night; but it shall come to pass that at evening time there shall be light” (Zechariah 14:7). This is the meaning of the statement that <b>“on the day after, the bride is meant to be with her husband under the wedding canopy,”</b> for then the <i>Ban</i> will return to be <i>Sag</i>, and the <i>Mah</i> will be <i>Ab</i>, and <i>Ab</i> is considered to be <b>the day after</b> and a new wedding canopy.
The righteous at that time are called <b>“members of the wedding canopy,”</b> which is the mystical meaning of <b>those who engage in Torah,</b> in whom there is no <b>practice</b> [<i>assiya</i>], for [regarding that time] it is stated: “And the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord” (Isaiah 11:9). Since those righteous ones, through their good deeds, raise the <i>Ban</i> to be <i>Sag</i>, by the force of their drawing on the fear from time past, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the preceding sections, these righteous ones of that future time will no longer have the “fear” we experience in this world resulting from the real possibility of committing evil acts. Instead, they will be driven by the memory of that possibility, which will be sufficient to spur continued good deeds and spiritual development.</i> they are considered as though they fashioned this new wedding canopy, and this is why they are called <b>“members of the wedding canopy.”</b>
2) [The second explanation is]: The night of Shavuot is called <b>“the night when the bride bonds with her husband.”</b> This is because <b>“on the day after,</b> [the bride] <b>is meant to be with her husband under the wedding canopy,”</b> that is, on the day of Shavuot, the day of the receiving of the Torah. Yet this is the very same idea as the first explanation, because on the day of the receiving of the Torah there was an aspect of the completion of the rectification, in the mystical meaning of: “He will eliminate death forever and the Lord God will wipe tears from all faces” (Isaiah 25:8). This is as the Sages expounded with regard to the verse: “Graven [<i>ḥarut</i>] upon the tablets” (Exodus 32:16): Do not read <i>ḥarut</i> but <i>ḥeirut</i> [“freedom”], since freedom from the angel of death has arrived (<i>Shemot Rabba</i>, 41). <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">At the receiving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, death was eliminated and the possibility of the completion of the rectification was manifest. As the author of the <i>Sulam</i> continues to explain, the following sin of the golden calf undid this and extended the process of rectification to our times and beyond.</i>
However, on account of the sin of the calf they once again corrupted the rectification. Thus, the day of the receiving of the Torah is the same concept as the completion of the rectification. Accordingly, on the night before the receiving of the Torah, all the fusions of the days of concealment came to an end. This is why that night is considered <b>“the night when the bride bonds with her husband,”</b> and <b>“on the day after, the bride is meant to be with her husband under the wedding canopy.”</b> This was the festival of Shavuot, when the rectification was completed by means of freedom from the angel of death, which is the time when the righteous, through their good deeds, fashion a new wedding canopy for the bride.
Now, it will be easier for me to continue my commentary by following the first explanation. One who can analyze matters on his own will be able to transfer the concepts to the day of Shavuot [which is the second explanation], since it is the same idea.
Thus, <b>“all the colleagues...</b>” those who <b>preserve the Torah,</b> who are called <b>“members of the wedding canopy”</b> (as stated just above), must cleave to the holy Divine Presence, which is called the <b>bride, “throughout that entire night”</b> of the exile. Then, during the period of the exile, [the bride, the Divine Presence] is rectified by means of those who <b>preserve the Torah</b> through all those good deeds and Torah and mitzvot that they perform, until her purification from good and evil. She is then available for those who <b>engage in the Torah,</b> in whom there is nothing at all in the form of <b>practice,</b> but rather she is entirely <b>good without evil</b> (as stated in section #123#, above, 4th paragraph).
Therefore, all the <b>preservers of the Torah,</b> who are <b>“members of the bridal chamber,”</b> must rejoice with her over the great rectification achieved through them for the bride. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“And rejoice with her in her rectifications which she undergoes, to engage in the Torah,”</b> that is, in the rectifications that come before us, <b>“from the Torah to the Prophets...</b>” which must be performed with joy.
It has thus been explained that all the levels and revelations of the secrets of Torah, which are the construction of the Divine Presence for its complete rectification, are attained only by means of those who <b>preserve the Torah</b> during the exile. Consequently, all these heights and levels that emerge during the exile are called the <b>rectifications</b> of the bride and her <b>adornments.</b> These are [what are] then spelled out in detail: <b>“From the Torah to the Prophets</b> etc.” For <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> are the mystical meaning of Torah; <i>Netzaḥ</i> and <i>Hod</i> are the mystical meaning of the <b>Prophets;</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> itself is the mystical meaning of the <b>Writings;</b> the brains of the six extremities that are drawn forth to [the bride] are the <b>expositions of the verses;</b> and the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] that are drawn forth to [the bride] are the <b>secrets of the wisdom.</b> For all these rectifications must be extended to the bride <b>on that night,</b> since the bride is completed through them for the completion of the rectification, which is the mystical meaning of the day of the wedding canopy.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And she and her maidens</b> etc.” The angels in which the vessels of the “back of <i>Malkhut</i> of the first state”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to one of the different phases of development of the brains in <i>Malkhut</i> along the process of the rectification.</i> are enclothed are called “maidens that serve the Divine Presence.” [The <i>Zohar</i>] adds that the Divine Presence <b>“stand on their heads,” of those who preserve the Torah,</b> in the mystical meaning of: “And above my head the Divine Presence of God.”
Together with her are the <b>maidens</b> that serve her, and she rejoices with them while she is increasingly rectified through them. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that she <b>“rejoices in them all throughout that entire night,”</b> that is, throughout the whole period of rectifications, which is called <b>“night”</b> (see the <i>Zohar Ḥadash</i>, <i>Shir HaShirim</i>, 159). <b>“On the next day</b>...” that is, on the day of the completion of the rectification, which is <b>the day of the wedding canopy,</b> she will be able to enter the wedding canopy only with <b>those who preserve the Torah,</b> who built and established it as much as was necessary, <b>from the Torah to the Prophets</b> etc.” This is why they are called <b>“members of the wedding canopy.”</b>
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And once she comes</b> [to the wedding canopy] etc.” It is known that the completion of the rectification will not bring with it anything new. Rather, by virtue of the supernal light of the <i>Atik Yomin</i>, all the feminine waters and masculine waters, and all the fusions and levels that emerged during the 6, 000 years one after another, will be gathered into a single fusion and one <b>great and precious</b> height, and everything will thereby be rectified (as stated in section #91#, above, 8th paragraph). Then the bride will enter the wedding canopy.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, inquires about them,”</b> that is, about each and every one of those who ever raised feminine waters for a supernal [fusion through collision], for it is as if He is sitting and waiting for all of them to assemble. He thus inquires and waits for each and every one of them. After they have assembled, the fusion of <b>“who had done mighty deeds, of Kabzeel”</b> is performed, as stated above (section #103#), and He <b>“blesses them and crowns them,”</b> that is, they are all blessed and crowned simultaneously. Then the rectification called <b>“the crowns of the bride”</b> is complete.

Paragraph 126

<b>126. “Rabbi Shimon etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon and all the colleagues were singing the song of the Torah. Each of them was innovating words of Torah, and Rabbi Shimon was joyful, and</b> so were <b>the rest of the colleagues. Rabbi Shimon said to them: “My sons, happy is your portion, since tomorrow the bride will come to the wedding canopy only with you, since all those who are performing the rectifications of the bride on this night and are rejoicing in her will all be recorded and written in the book of remembrance. And the Holy One, blessed be He, will bless them with seventy blessings and crowns from the higher world.”</b>
Explanation: The “book of remembrance” is mentioned in Malachi chapter 3, where it is stated: “You have said, it is vain to serve God… they who work wickedness are built up; they also try God, and are delivered. Then those who feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord listened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for those who feared the Lord and who thought upon His name. And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day when I make a treasure etc.” (Malachi 3:14–17). These verses require explanation. At that time, they spoke to one another and uttered such contemptible observations among themselves, that “it is vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept His charge...” and yet the prophet says about them: “Then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another,” and what is more, they are written in the book of remembrance before Him, “for those who feared the Lord, and who thought upon His name.”
The meaning is that at the time of the end, when the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> is revealed, in the mystical meaning of <b>“who had done mighty deeds, of Kabzeel”</b> [mentioned in the previous sections], a great light will be revealed in all the levels, by means of which all flesh shall return in complete repentance out of love. There is a well-known statement of the Sages that if one merits to repent out of love, his willful transgressions become for him like merits (<i>Yoma</i> 86b). This is the meaning of the prophet’s statement about those wicked ones who cursed and blasphemed amongst themselves, saying: “It is vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept His charge.” On the great day of the completion of the rectification, when the light of repentance out of love will appear, even these willful transgressions, which are the worst of all, will become merits, and those who issued them will be regarded as “those who feared the Lord.”
This will happen at the completion of the rectification, as the prophet concludes: “They shall be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day when I make a treasure, ’” which is on the day of the completion of the rectification. Therefore, there is necessarily a book of remembrance before Him, for the willful transgressions and iniquities that are performed in the world, since He will require them on the day when He makes a treasure, for then they will become merits and will join and complete the height of light of the completion of the rectification.
This is the meaning of the verses: “And a book of remembrance was written before Him, for those who feared the Lord, and who thought upon His name. And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day when I make a treasure,” since [God] will need them then, in order to complete the height. This is why the prophet concludes: “And I will spare them, like a man spares his own son who serves him” (Malachi 3:17), for then they will be precious to [God] and dear to [Him] as though they were among those who serve [Him].
When [the <i>Zohar</i>] states [that they] <b>“will all be recorded and written in the book of remembrance,”</b> this comes to include even the willful transgressions that they performed, which will then <b>be recorded and written</b> in the book of remembrance. The Holy One, blessed be He, will write them down as though they were merits, and as though they served Him through them, as the prophet states.
Now, the number seventy alludes to the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called <b>“crowns.”</b> The mystical meaning of the <b>“blessing”</b> refers to the light of giving (as stated in section #37#, above). The world was created with [the letter] <b><i>bet</i></b>, which is the mystical meaning of <i>berakha</i> [“blessing”], which is: “The world is built through mercy [giving]” (Psalms 89:3); study that section carefully. This aspect is of the six extremities. [The <i>Zohar</i>] further states that at the completion of the rectification, the light of giving will also be an expression of <b>seventy crowns,</b> like the <i>Ḥokhma</i>, since the <i>Mah</i> and <i>Ban</i> will ascend to <i>Ab</i> <i>Sag</i>. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And the Holy One, blessed be He, will bless them with seventy blessings and crowns from the higher world”</b> of <i>Ab</i> <i>Sag</i>. Accordingly, at that time as well, the <b>blessings</b> are of the aspect of the number <b>seventy.</b>

Paragraph 127

<b>127. “Rabbi Shimon etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “The heavens declare the glory of God,</b> [and the firmament shows His handiwork” (Psalms 19:2)]. <b>I have already established this verse, but at this time, when the bride is awakening to enter the wedding canopy, for tomorrow, she is rectified and illuminates in her adornments with the colleagues, who rejoiced with her throughout that entire night, and she is joyous with them.</b>

Paragraph 128

<b>128. “On the next day, several etc.”</b><br><b>On the next day, several multitudes, armies and camps, gather to her, and she and all of them,</b> all these armies and camps, <b>wait for each and every one of those who rectified her</b> through their Torah engagement <b>during this night. Once</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> <b>join together and she,</b> the <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>sees her husband,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>what is written? “The heavens declare the glory of God.” “The heavens” is the bridegroom entering the wedding canopy,</b> and this is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, who is called “heavens.” <b>“Declare”</b> means that <b>they illuminate like the brightness of the sapphire, which illuminates and shines from one end of the world to the other.</b>
Explanation: The day of the completion of the rectification is called “tomorrow,” as the Sages have stated: “Today [is the time] to do them; tomorrow [is the time] to receive their reward” (<i>Eiruvin</i> 22a). The <b>multitudes</b> are the nations of the land that do not serve God. The <b>armies</b> are the servants of God, while the <b>camps</b> refer to the supernal camps, which are the angels that accompany the souls, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “For He will give His angels charge over you, to guard you in all your ways etc.” (Psalms 91:11). The statement that <b>“she and all of them wait for each and every one of those”</b> has already been explained (section #125#, above, after the comment “Now, it will be easier for me”; see there). Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, inquires about each and every one, the Divine Presence likewise waits for each one of them.
This is why it is stated that <b>“once they join together and she sees her husband</b> etc.” She cannot see her husband until they have all gathered together, as stated [She and her husband] are dependent on one another.
<b>“‘The heavens’ is the bridegroom entering the wedding canopy.”</b> This is expounded in reference to the completion of the rectification, about which it is stated: “And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun etc.” (Isaiah 30:26). [The <i>Zohar</i>] states that <b>“the heavens’ is the bridegroom entering the wedding canopy”</b> because the Holy One, blessed be He, is called <b>“heavens,”</b> and at the time of the completion of the rectification He is called a <b>“groom,”</b> in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall Your God rejoice over You” (Isaiah 62:5). The meaning is that wherever it is stated: “And the Lord descended,” this involves judgment or restraint, because it is indicative of a descent from His height and exaltedness, since “strength and gladness are in His place” (I Chronicles 16:27).
However, at the completion of the rectification, when all the flaws and sins will be transformed into merits, because at that time it will become clear that all the descents were nothing other than ascents, the Holy One, blessed be He, will be called a <b>“groom,”</b> and the Divine Presence will be called a <b>“bride.”</b> The term <i>kalah</i> [“bride”] is related to the completion of the rectification, as in the phrase: “And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end [<i>kalot</i>] of setting up the Tabernacle” (Numbers 7:1), which means that he had completed all the work and construction of the Tabernacle. The word <i>ḥatan</i> [groom] also indicates descent, since <i>red</i> [“descend”] is translated [to Aramaic] as <i>ḥut</i>, as in the statement of the Sages: “Descend [<i>neḥeit</i>] a level to marry a woman” (<i>Yevamot</i> 63a). However, this descent is greater than all the previous ascents, for it is towards the bride, which is the Divine Presence at the time of the complete rectification, when she is called a <b>“bride.”</b>
The <b>“wedding canopy”</b> is the gathering and assembling of all the returning light that emerged by means of the feminine waters that the righteous raised in all those fusions of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, which were revealed one after the other throughout all the days and times of the 6, 000 years [that make up the time of this world]. [Through this process] they have now all become one great, single light of returning light that ascends and hovers over the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, which are now called <b>“groom and bride.”</b> The returning light hovers over them like a <b>wedding canopy,</b> for which reason the righteous are then called “members of the wedding canopy.” Each and every one of them has a portion in this wedding canopy, according to the measure of the feminine waters that each raised to the partition in <i>Makhut</i> for raising returning light. When it states that <b>“the heavens’ is the bridegroom entering the wedding canopy,”</b> this is referring to the time of the completion of the rectification, when the Holy One, blessed be He, will be called a <b>“groom,”</b> and He will then enter His wedding canopy.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“declare”</b> means that <b>“they illuminate</b> etc.” <b>“Declare</b> [<i>mesaprim</i>, which is similar to the language of “<i>sappir,”</i> sapphire]<b>”</b> is the mystical meaning of the great [fusion through collision] that will occur in the future, as in the phrase: “A wife converses [<i>mesapperet</i>] with her husband” (<i>Berakhot</i> 3a). “Sapphire [<i>sappir</i>]” is the name of the holy Divine Presence, as in the verse: “And there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone” (Exodus 24:10). <b>“The brightness of the sapphire”</b> is the returning light that [<i>Malkhut</i>] raises from below upwards. “Illuminates” refers to the direct light, while “shines” refers to returning light. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that through this great fusion that will be performed at the completion of the rectification, which is a gathering together of all the fusions, the direct light and the returning light in this fusion will illuminate and shine from “one end of the world to the other,” which is the mystical meaning of: <b>“The heavens declare.”</b>

Paragraph 129

<b>129. “The glory of God is” etc.”</b><br><b>“The glory of God</b> [<i>El</i>]” <b>is the glory of the bride,</b> that is, the <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>who is called <i>El</i>, as it is stated: “God</b> [<i>El</i>] <b>is furious every day”</b> (Psalms 7:12). <b>On all the days of the year she is called <i>El</i>, but now,</b> on the festival of Shavuot, <b>when she has</b> already <b>entered the wedding canopy, she is called “glory” and she is</b> [also] <b>called “<i>El</i>.”</b> This is indicative of <b>honor on top of honor, light on top of light, and reign on top of reign.</b>
Explanation: The name <b><i>El</i></b> is the name of the great <i>Ḥesed</i>. Now, the verse states that “God [<i>El</i>] is furious every day,” which appears to be the opposite of <i>Ḥesed</i>. The concept here is that this is the mystical meaning of: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). The holy Divine Presence is the mystical meaning of “the lesser light to rule the night” (Genesis 1:16), and it is called “fear of heaven,” for the righteous must raise feminine waters by means of their awakening from below, and [they must] rectify [<i>Malkhut</i>] with the partition that raises returning light. Then the <i>shefa</i> will be drawn from above to below, but in no other manner, as is known.
This is the mystical meaning of: “And God has so made it, that men should fear before Him” (Ecclesiastes 3:14). There can be no awakening from below or raising of feminine waters without fear. This is the mystical meaning of [the] rule [of the attribute of judgment] over the night. [It is] through the lack of light, which is the aspect of night and which includes all judgments and suffering, which are the opposite of the aspect of day which is <i>Ḥesed</i>, that there is “fear before Him.” Were it not for the fear, the attribute of the day and the morning would not be revealed. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of night represents the concept of our dependence upon God, since at night our limitations are more pronounced. This conceptual environment drives us to turn toward the divine Source, the “raising of feminine waters,” which gives rise to the release of greater divine light and higher brains, embodied in the concept of “day.”</i>
This is the mystical meaning of: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day.” The night also infiltrates the morning, since were it not for the night there would be no morning, and it is impossible otherwise. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the concept of contrasts. Like all things, without its opposite (night), the concept of morning would not exist. Thus, instead of viewing night and day as two opposites that are conceptually distant, they should be thought of as dependent on each other for conceptual existence. This dynamic of contrasts is the intent underlying the next few sentences illustrating the contrast between “fury” and the attribute of <i>Ḥesed</i>.</i> This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“God</b> [<i>El</i>] <b>is furious every day,”</b> because the attribute of <i>Ḥesed</i>, which is called <b><i>El</i>,</b> is revealed only through the night, which is the aspect of <b>fury.</b> This is why the fury is also considered <i>Ḥesed</i>, because the <i>Ḥesed</i> cannot be revealed in any other way [other than this contrast]. From this perspective, the holy Divine Presence is also called <b><i>El</i></b>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“Glory of God</b> [<i>El</i>]” <b>is the glory of the bride, who is called <i>El</i>,”</b> that is, with respect to the verse: <b>“God</b> [<i>El</i>] <b>is furious every day,”</b> which means that it is impossible for there to be day without the fury of the night. <b>“On all the days of the year she is called <i>El</i>,”</b> for such is the case in the six days of creation: It is written on each of them, “and there was evening and there was morning, one day” or “a second day,” and so on and so forth. Thus, the night [in each case] falls under the name of the day. Therefore [<i>Malkhut</i>] is called <b><i>El</i>,</b> which is the name of <i>Ḥesed</i>, on the six days of creation, and also during the 6, 000 years [of this world].
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“But now,</b> [on the festival of Shavuot] etc.” At the great fusion of the completion of the rectification, the light of the moon shall be like the light of the sun, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “But it shall come to pass that at evening time there shall be light” (Zechariah 14:7). Thus, the levels [of <i>Malkhut</i>] are doubled, because [it was even] during the 6, 000 years as well, that the light of the moon [which is <i>Malkhut</i>] was in the mystical meaning of: “And there was evening and there was morning.” <b>“But now,”</b> when [the <i>Malkhut</i>] itself has become as large as the sun, which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> called <b>“glory,”</b> [the <i>Malkhut</i>] has glory on top of glory, for [the <i>Malkhut</i>] has now become the essence of glory, since it has grown [to match] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.
“Glory” is translated as <b>honor</b>, which is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states <b>“honor on top of honor.”</b> The same [applies] to “double light,” because [it was also the case] during the 6, 000 years that [the <i>Malkhut</i>] was incorporated in the morning light, in the mystical meaning of: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day.” But now that [the <i>Malkhut</i>] has grown [to match] the sun, it becomes the essence of the light, and [the <i>Malkhut</i>] then has its own <b>light, in addition to the light</b> it had from its incorporation from before [during the 6000 years of this world].
The same [can be said] with [regard to the] <b>“reign on top of reign.”</b> During the 6, 000 years [the <i>Malkhut</i>] had reign, which was dominion, only with respect to “the lesser light to rule the night.” Now, however, the dominion of the day has also been added to [the <i>Malkhut</i>], since it has grown [to match] the light of the sun, which is for the rule of the day. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thereby teaches us that we must not erroneously think that when [the <i>Malkhut</i> has grown to [match] the light of the sun, the pre-existing levels [of the <i>Malkhut</i>], which [the <i>Malkhut</i>] had during the 6, 000 years, are nullified, Heaven forbid. This is not the case; rather, there is only an addition here to the levels [of the <i>Malkhut</i>], in such a manner that it has <b>glory on top of glory</b> etc.

Paragraph 130

<b>130. “Then, at that time etc.”</b><br><b>Then, at that time, when the heavens,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>enters the wedding canopy, and comes and illuminates for her, all those colleagues who established her,</b> through the Torah engagement during the night, <b>all become known by their names there. This is</b> the meaning of <b>the verse: “And the firmament says His handiwork”</b> (Psalms 19:2). <b>“His handiwork” are those who have the sign of the covenant,</b> who <b>are called “His handiwork,” as it is stated: “Establish You upon us the work of our hands,” which is</b> a sign of the <b>covenant that is imprinted upon a man’s flesh.</b>
Explanation: The <b>colleagues</b> are those who preserve the Torah, in which there is practice [<i>assiya</i>], which is [relating to] good and evil. The [<i>Zohar</i>] is saying that even those parts in which the aspect of evil is still without rectification are also <b>“known by their names”</b> of holiness. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that <b>“this is</b> [the meaning of] <b>the verse: And the firmament says His handiwork [<i>ma’aseh</i>],”</b> because the firmament is the <b>book of remembrance,</b> as explained below, which is the mystical meaning of the light of the great fusion [of the future], which brings to repentance out of love, when willful transgressions become for them like merits (<i>Yoma</i> 86b). Even with regard to those who chose to slander, it will be said about them, “Then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another etc.” (Malachi 3:16, as explained above in section #126#; see there).
Thus, it is this practice [of Torah], of the preservation of the Torah in which there is good and evil, and in which it is good for one who merits and bad for one who does not merit, the whole of the practice has now ascended into a state of holiness and has become the <b>handiwork</b> of the Holy One, blessed be He. Even upon those who did not merit, <b>“the firmament says”</b> that “then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another,” as stated. Accordingly, it is [revealed] that all the colleagues performed only holy service, because they established her for the wedding canopy, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, through their practice, even the ill deeds and the ostensibly “ungodly” part of the world of <i>Asiya</i> becomes part of the holy service that establishes the canopy.</i> and they <b>“all become known by their names.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“As it is stated: Establish You upon us the work of our hands.”</b> Now, this proof appears to contradict [the idea for which it was cited as evidence]. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The main text refers to the “the work of His hands,” while the proof text refers to the “the work of our hands.”</i> The verse states <b>“the work of our hands,”</b> not <b>“the work of His hands.”</b> However, the proof is cited from the verse only with respect to [the claim that] <b>the sign of the covenant</b> is called <b>“the work of our hands.”</b> “Establish You upon us” is the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> that establishes and founds the entire structure, and the rectification of the <i>Yesod</i> is the covenant of circumcision. Consequently, the sign of the covenant is called <b>“the work of our hands,”</b> since we remove the foreskin from the <i>Yesod</i>, and this is <b>the work of our hands.</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The foreskin on the male sexual organ represents the barrier that can exist between us and God, or in other words, the <i>kelippa</i> and the <i>Sitra aḥara</i>. The male sexual organ corresponds to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>Yesod</i>. When there is a foreskin present, it represents an impediment to the connection between the male and female. This corresponds to the male and female aspects of existence (God and the Divine Presence), in which such an impediment prevents divine development in the world.</i>
This is [the case] only before the completion of the rectification, but at the completion of the rectification, everything will be revealed as the <b>handiwork</b> of the Holy One, blessed be He, and He Himself will remove the foreskin. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that [“His handiwork”] <b>are those who have the sign of the covenant,</b> [who] <b>are called “His handiwork.”</b> For then the Holy One, blessed be He, will Himself remove the foreskin, which is the mystical meaning of: <b>“The firmament shows His handiwork,”</b> and a proof is brought regarding the rectification of the covenant, which is currently called <b>“the work of our hands,”</b> from the verse: <b>“Establish You upon us the work of our hands.”</b>

Paragraph 131

<b>131. “Rav Hamnuna Saba etc.”</b><br><b>Rav Hamnuna Saba said the following: “Do not let your mouth bring your flesh into sin”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). This means <b>that a person must not let his mouth</b> cause <b>the arrival of an evil thought, and</b> [thereby] <b>cause that holy flesh in which the holy covenant is inscribed to come to guilt. For if he does so, he will be drawn into Gehennom. The one appointed over Gehennom is called Duma, and several myriads of destructive angels are with him, and he stands before the entrance to Gehennom, but he has no permission to draw near to all those who protected the holy covenant in this world.</b>
<b>“The arrival of an evil thought.”</b> This is a warning that every person should guard his mouth, which [refers to] the concept of raising feminine waters through Torah and prayer, so that it should be in [a state of] complete purity. If there is any purchase in [one’s mouth] for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> will receive [the person’s] feminine waters, and with this strength [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] will lead him to doubt the Holy One, blessed be He, that is, through alien thoughts, Heaven forfend. <b>“And</b> [he will thereby] <b>cause that holy flesh in which the holy covenant is sealed to come to guilt.”</b> [It is] by means of the [alien] thoughts [that] he pulls the foreskin over the holy covenant, and the holy soul falls captive in the hands of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, at which point the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> draws his soul to Gehennom. This is in accordance with what Rabbi Elazar said (section #68#, above), that from this word a false firmament is fashioned, which is called “emptiness,” and one falls into the hands of Lilith; see there. Here, however, it is referring specifically to a defect in the holy covenant. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The concepts in these sections oscillate between sexual analogies and the underlying conceptual dynamic represented by the analogies. The holy covenant is a term for the circumcised male sex organ, in which the foreskin, a barrier between the male and female in sexual intimacy, is removed. Similarly, the holy covenant conceptually is the covenant between man and God, in which the insertion of foreign thoughts serves as a conceptual foreskin forming a barrier between man and God.</i>
When [the <i>Zohar</i>] states “[thereby] <b>cause that holy flesh in which the holy covenant is sealed to come to sin,”</b> it is referring to the holy soul, which is tied [to the body] and protected by the holy covenant, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Lekh Lekha</i>, 410): “‘From my flesh I shall see the Lord’ (Job 19:26) – what is [the meaning of] ‘from my flesh’? It should say ‘from myself. ’ Rather, from my actual flesh... as we learned: Whenever a person is inscribed with this holy inscription of that sign, he sees the Holy One, blessed be He from within himself, literally from within himself, and the holy soul cleaves to him. But if he does not merit it, because he did not protect this sign, what is written? ‘from the breath (soul) of God they perish’ (Job 4:9).” See there.
This is the meaning of the statement here: <b>“And</b> [thereby] <b>cause that holy flesh</b> […] <b>to come to sin.”</b> In other words, through the strength of the [alien] thoughts, the foreskin, which is the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, returns and touches the holy covenant, as a result of which the Divine soul immediately departs from [the person]. This is the mystical meaning of the tree’s cry: “Wicked one; do not touch me” (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i>, 263b, <i>Hashmatot</i>, and in <i>Avot DeRabbi Natan</i>, Ch. 1). The tree is the <i>Yesod</i>, and the coronet of the <i>Yesod</i> is the mystical meaning of the tree of knowledge of good and evil (as stated in <i>Etz Ḥayyim</i>, section 43, chapter 3, and in my book, <i>Beit Sha’ar HaKavanot</i>, p. 45, s. v., <i>U-veḥet</i>). <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The coronet of the <i>Yesod</i> represents the glans of the male sex organ, the region uncovered by the removal of the foreskin during a circumcision.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The one appointed over Gehennom is called Duma.”</b> [The word] Duma is related to <i>demama</i> [“silence”], since [Duma] takes the soul of life from him and leaves him in the silence of death. It can also be suggested that it is because [Duma] is the angel that brings the [evil] thoughts to the sinner and [thereby] renders the thoughts of the Holy One, blessed be He, similar [<i>domeh</i>] to the thoughts of a mortal being. As long as one understands that His thoughts are not our thoughts, and His ways are not our ways (see Isaiah 55:8), that is, that a thought [of ours] cannot grasp Him at all, neither His thoughts nor His ways, [a person] will not even conceive that it is possible to have any doubts about Him at all, Heaven forbid.
However, on account of sin, the angel <b>Duma</b> attaches to [the person] and brings into him a spirit of folly, to say that a mortal being is similar to the Holy One, blessed be He, in knowledge and intellect. [The person] is then primed for all sorts of thoughts, and [Duma thereby] draws him into Gehennom. This is the mystical meaning of: “Who is like You, Master of restraint, and who is similar [<i>domeh</i>] to You, O King who causes death and restores to life.” When one stumbles in thinking he is similar to You, there is death, while when one understands that nothing is similar to Him, there is life. Accordingly, <b>“several myriads of destructive angels are with him, and they stands over the entrance to Gehennom.”</b> The thoughts that [Duma] brings to a person are endless <b>myriads,</b> and all these are over the entrance to <b>Gehennom,</b> that is, the entrance through which a person is pulled into Gehennom, although it is not Gehennom itself.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“But he has no permission to draw near to all those who kept the holy covenant in this world.”</b> That is, although they are not completely clean and there is still the aspect of good and evil within them, nevertheless, if they keep the holy covenant in a manner that they never come to doubt [God], then the angel <b>Duma</b> has no permission to pull them into Gehennom.

Paragraph 132

<b>132. “When that episode etc.”</b><br><b>When that incident happened to him, King David was afraid. At that time, Duma arose before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said to Him: “Master of the universe, it is written in the Torah: “And the man who commits adultery with another man’s wife”</b> [Leviticus 20:10], <b>and it is stated: “And with your neighbor’s wife etc.”</b> [Leviticus 18:20]. <b>David, who desecrated his covenant with a forbidden relation, what is he?” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: “David is righteous, and the holy covenant stands in its proper state, for it is revealed before Me that Bathsheba was prepared for him since the day that the world was created.”</b>
Explanation: Even though he did not sin, as the Sages said: “Anyone who says that David sinned is nothing other than mistaken” (<i>Shabbat</i> 56a), he was nevertheless as afraid as though he had actually sinned. The <i>Zohar</i> explains that this was due to the slander of <b>Duma,</b> as stated here. <b>“It is written in the Torah: ‘And the man who commits adultery’... and it is written</b> etc.” Two verses are cited, one of which details the punishment, while the other is the warning.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And the holy covenant</b> etc.” [God] replied to [Duma] that <b>David</b> had no thought of sin, because <b>Bathsheba</b> was his [designated] partner since the time of the creation of the world (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 107a). Accordingly, he never corrupted his covenant, Heaven forbid, <b>“and the holy covenant stands in its proper state.”</b> When he lusted, he lusted after his own. Uriah took her before David because, as explained in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Aḥarei</i>, 395), Uriah took her with mercy even though she was not his; see there.
Now, this requires explanation, for the male and female are two halves of a single body. Consequently, if she is half of King David’s body, how could Uriah take her, when he had nothing to do with her? The explanation is that <b>Bathsheba</b> was truly the female side of <b>David</b> from the day the world was created, for David is the male in <i>Malkhut</i> and Bathsheba is the female in <i>Malkhut</i>. However, just as at the time of the rectification of the <i>Malkhut</i> for [the process of] the emanation of the worlds [from <i>Atzilut</i> and downward], there was an ascent of the <i>Malkhut</i> to <i>Bina</i> [in the second constriction], in order to temper [<i>Malkhut</i>] with the attribute of mercy [which is <i>Bina</i>]. So too Bathsheba required this tempering in the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], for without this tempering, she would be completely unfit to beget the soul of King Solomon.
Now, Uriah the Hittite was a very lofty soul, as he was entirely from the [level of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], as his name attests: <b><i>Or-yah</i></b> [“light of <i>yod-heh</i>,” referring to the light of the first three <i>sefirot</i> alluded to in the first two letters of <i>yod-heh</i> of the name <i>Havaya</i>], and there was nothing at all in him of the six extremities, which is <b><i>vav-heh.</i></b> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Tetragrammaton, <i>Havaya</i>, made up of the letters of <i>yod</i>-<i>heh</i> and <i>vav</i>-<i>heh</i>, corresponds to the levels of the first three <i>sefirot</i>, <i>Keter</i>-<i>Ḥokhma</i>-<i>Bina</i> and the six extremities-<i>Malkhut</i>, respectively.</i> Therefore, in order to temper Bathsheba with the attribute of mercy, Uriah, who is the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], took her, and she was tempered by him, after which she was fit for the kingship of Israel. This is the meaning of the statement that <b>“Uriah took her with mercy,”</b> that is, in order to temper her with mercy, which is with the name <b><i>yah</i></b> in Uriah. He thus took her despite the fact that she was not his. This will be further clarified below.

Paragraph 133

<b>133. “He said to Him, if etc.”</b><br>Duma <b>said to Him: “If it is revealed before You, it is not revealed before him.”</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, <b>said to him: “In addition,</b> everything <b>that occurred was with permission, since none of all those who go to war ventures forth before giving his wife a writ of divorce.”</b> Duma <b>said to Him: “If so, he should have waited three months, but he did not wait.” He replied: “When does this apply?</b> Only <b>in a case where there is concern that she might have conceived. But it is revealed to Me that Uriah never once approached her, for My name is inscribed upon him as testimony,</b> since <b>it is written Uriah,</b> with the letters <i>Or</i> [“light”] <i>yah</i> [<i>yod-heh</i>], <b>and it is written Uriahu,</b> which are the letters <i>Or yod-heh</i><b>-</b><i>vav</i>. Thus, <b>My name is inscribed upon him as testimony that he never had intercourse with her.</b>
Explanation: It is necessary to understand this idea that the name <b><i>yod-heh</i> in Uriah</b> testifies regarding him that he <b>never</b> touched <b>Bathsheba.</b> Now, this [issue] is clarified by the Biblical account, in the analogy [presented] by Nathan the prophet (II Samuel, 12). [Nathan] compares <b>David</b> to a rich man, and <b>Uriah</b> to a poor man, while Bathsheba is the poor man’s lamb, and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> a <b>traveler.</b> [The text] states that <b>“the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb</b>...” (II Samuel 12:3). The mystical meaning of this statement is that Uriah was of the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] without the six extremities. The <i>Zohar</i> thus infers that <b>“it is written Uriah and it is written Uriahu,”</b> for this name is written [in reference to someone else] (in Jeremiah 26:20) as <b>Uriahu,</b> with <b><i>yod-heh</i>-<i>vav</i>,</b> in which the <b><i>yod-heh</i></b> are the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and the <b><i>vav</i></b> is the six extremities. Here [in reference to Bathsheba’s husband], however, it is written only <b>Uriah,</b> without the <i>vav</i>, to indicate that there was nothing of the six extremities in him at all, but only <i>Ḥokhma</i> without light of giving.
This is why [Uriah] is considered <b>“the poor man had nothing</b> [<i>beli kol</i>],” as the light of giving is implied by <b>“<i>kol</i>”</b> [“everything”]. That which [the text] states: “Save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared” refers to Bathsheba, for [Uriah] had acquired her. This indicates that she was not part of his soul, but he had merely acquired her in order to rear her and rectify her with mercy. This is [the meaning of] <b>“which he had acquired and reared,”</b> and the text further states: <b>“And she grew up together with him, and with his children.”</b> This shows that he bestowed of his greatness to her, as to his children, in such a way that <b>“she would eat from his own morsel, and drink from his own cup, and lay in his bosom.”</b> However, in order to prevent us mistakenly thinking that he also approached her [for intercourse], the verse concludes: “and was <b>like a daughter</b> to him” (II Samuel 12:3), not like a wife.
The verse thus attests that Uriah did not approach her. The <i>Zohar</i> wishes to explain the reason why he did not do so, so it adds: “<b>It is written Uriah and it is written Uriahu; My name is inscribed upon him as testimony that he never had intercourse with her.”</b> That is, the name <b><i>yah</i>,</b> without the <b><i>vav</i>,</b> indicating that he lacked the light of giving, which is <b><i>vav</i>.</b> Accordingly, he could not approach her, for there is no coupling without the light of giving. It follows that the name <b><i>yah</i></b> which is inscribed in [Uriah’s] name testifies regarding him that he was entirely unfit to perform a coupling with her.

Paragraph 134

<b>134. “He said to Him, Master etc.”</b><br>[Duma] <b>said to Him: “Master of the universe, this is what I said: ‘If it is revealed before You that Uriah did not lie with her, was it revealed to him? He should have waited three months. Furthermore, if You say that David knew that he had never laid with her, why did David send him away and command him to have intercourse with his wife, as it is written, “Go down to your house and wash your feet’</b> [II Samuel 11:8]?”

Paragraph 135

<b>135. “He said to him, if etc.”</b><br>[God] <b>said to him: “He certainly did not know, but he waited more than three months, for it was four months. As we learned, on the twenty-fifth of Nissan David sent a proclamation through all of Israel to go to war. They were with Yoav on the seventh of Sivan, and they went and destroyed the land of the children of Ammon. They were detained there through Sivan, Tammuz, Av, and Elul, and on the twenty-fourth of Elul the incident involving Bathsheba occurred. And on Yom Kippur, the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave him for that sin. Some say that he sent the proclamation on the seventh of Adar and they gathered on the fifteenth of Iyyar, and the incident involving Bathsheba happened on the fifteenth of Elul. And on Yom Kippur he was informed: “The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die”</b> [II Samuel 12:13]. <b>What is</b> [the meaning of] <b>“you shall not die”?</b> It means that <b>you shall not die by the hand of Duma.</b>
Explanation: <b>Duma</b> is appointed over forbidden relations, and this sin was atoned for him on Yom Kippur, meaning that he would not die <b>“by the hand of Duma.”</b> However, his death was on account of the sin with Uriah, for he killed him with the sword of the children of Ammon, as the verse attests regarding him: “Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and did not turn aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except only for the matter of Uriah the Hittite” [I Kings 15:5]. This is the meaning of <b>“you shall not die by the hand of Duma,”</b> since [Duma] is appointed over forbidden relations, “except only for the matter of <b>Uriah the Hittite.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that David did not die for the sin of his relationship with Bathsheba, but rather for causing Uriah’s death by deliberately sending him to the front lines of the war against the Ammonites.</i>

Paragraph 136

<b>136. “Duma said, Master etc.”</b><br>Duma <b>said: “Master of the universe, I have one</b> [outstanding] <b>matter with respect to him. For he opened his mouth and declared, ‘As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die’</b> [II Samuel 12:5]. <b>He thereby sentenced himself to death,</b> and consequently <b>I have power</b> [<i>teruneya</i>] <b>over him</b> to put him to death.” [God] <b>replied: “You have no permission</b> to put him to death, <b>for he confessed before Me and said, ‘I have sinned against the Lord’</b> [II Samuel 12:13], <b>even though he did not sin. But for his sin with</b> the killing of <b>Uriah, I wrote</b> [his] <b>punishment for him and he accepted it.” Immediately, Duma returned to his place, bitterly disappointed.</b> The meaning of <i>teruneya</i> here is similar to its meaning in the saying “the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not deal tyrannically [<i>be-teruneya</i>] with His creations” (<i>Pesikta Rabbati</i>, <i>Ki Tissa</i> [<i>Avoda Zara</i> 3a]), that is, forcefully, with power.
Explanation: It was explained above, with regard to the mystical meaning of the commandment of circumcision, that it is connected to the sign of the covenant, the name <i>Elohah</i> [God] (as stated above in section #131#; see there). Now, this letter <b><i>heh</i></b> in the name <i>Elohah</i>, which is <i>Malkhut</i>, incorporates two aspects: Judgment and mercy (as stated above, in sections #120–124#). The whole rectification of the covenant is that the power of judgment will be concealed and hidden, while that of mercy is in a revealed state. [When this is achieved, ] then the name <i>Elohah</i> rests upon him. Although, there is also <i>Malkhut</i> there [within the <i>heh</i>], upon which the first constriction took place and which an aspect of judgment from which all the external forces suckle; nevertheless, because [this <i>Malkhut</i>] is concealed and hidden, and only the attribute of mercy from <i>Bina</i> is in a revealed state, the external forces do not have the power to grasp hold of [that <i>Malkhut</i>]. This is as stated above: <b>“But he has no permission to draw near to all those who kept the holy covenant in this world”</b> [section #131#].
However, one who corrupts the covenant thereby exposes the aspect of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, that is, in the letter <b><i>heh</i></b> of <i>Elohah</i>, and all the external forces immediately approach her to suckle from her, since she is their portion and all their vitality. Consequently, the holy soul, which is the name <i>Elohah</i>, instantly departs, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “By the breath of God they perish” (Job 4:9).
Now, David himself was from the aspect of <i>Malkhut</i> that was tempered through the attribute of mercy, and therefore he required extra protection so the aspect of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> would not be revealed through him. Accordingly, when he said: <b>“As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die,”</b> thereby sentencing to death one who corrupts the covenant by giving the poor man’s lamb to the traveler who is the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, the judgment was revealed in [David] himself, before the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, that is, the angel <b>Duma.</b> [Duma] therefore wished to grasp hold of the soul of David, since, through [David’s words], the power of judgment that was concealed and hidden in him was revealed.
This is the meaning of the angel Duma’s claim: <b>“I have one matter with respect to him. For he opened his mouth and declared, ‘As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die. ’ He thereby sentenced himself to death.”</b> That is, it is by virtue of these words, in which he sentenced to death anyone who corrupts the covenant, he thus <b>sentenced himself</b>, because the judgment that was concealed and hidden in his soul was thereby revealed. Consequently, <b>“I have power over him”;</b> [Duma is saying] I have control over him, to suckle from his soul.
God replied: <b>“You have no permission, for he confessed before Me and said, ‘I have sinned against the Lord, ’ even though he did not sin.”</b> As explained, through [David’s words] in sentencing <b>himself,</b> he exposed the aspect of judgment before the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, like one who impairs his covenant. The angel Duma thus wished to grasp hold of his soul and draw it to Gehennom, as explained previously. But the Holy One, blessed be He, retorted that he had already confessed and repented for the forbidden relation, <b>“even though he did not sin”</b> in this regard at all. Therefore, this repentance for what <b>“he sentenced himself”</b> was effective for him, and accordingly <b>“you have no permission to draw near him.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: “<b>But for his sin with Uriah, I wrote</b> [his] <b>punishment for him and he accepted it</b>.” In other words, <b>for the sin</b> of killing <b>Uriah</b> by the sword of the children of Ammon, he has already received his punishment from Me, and this is no concern of yours, for you are appointed only over forbidden relations. <b>“Immediately, Duma returned to his place, bitterly disappointed.”</b> That is, he returned to the entrance to Gehennom, which is his place, as stated above [section #131#].

Paragraph 137

<b>137. “And with regard to this, etc.”</b><br><b>And with regard to this, David declared: “Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul would almost have dwelled in silence</b> [<i>duma</i>]” [Psalms 94:17]. <b>“Unless the Lord had been my help,”</b> that is, had He not <b>been my guardian</b> [<i>apotropa</i>] and watchman over me, with respect to the angel Duma. <b>“Would almost have dwelled</b> etc.” – <b>what is</b> [the meaning of] <b>“almost”? Like the measure of a fine thread that is between me and the Other Side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>]; <b>it was that measure away from my soul dwelling with Duma,</b> that is, with the angel Duma in Gehennom. <i>Apotropa</i> means a guardian, a watchman, for the Aramaic translation of “and let him appoint overseers” (Genesis 41:34) is “and let him appoint an <i>apotropos</i>.”
Explanation: David is the mystical meaning of <i>Malkhut</i>, regarding which it is stated: “Her feet go down to death” [Proverbs 5:5], because [<i>Malkhut</i>] is the aspect of the endpoint of holiness, from which the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i> are sustained, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And His kingdom rules over all” (Psalms 103:19). However, when the <i>Malkhut</i> is in its rectified state, with the attribute of mercy, in the manner that Rabbi Ḥiyya stated above (section #122#), it is considered as two points, which are the point of judgment, [derived] from itself, and the point of mercy, which [the <i>Malkhut</i>] received from <i>Bina</i>. The judgment within it is concealed and hidden, and only the mercy within it is in a revealed state; see there.
By virtue of this rectification, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> has [access] only [to] a thin light from the illumination of the <i>Malkhut</i>. This [light] is only sufficient for a root for the sustenance of the <i>kelippot</i>, but they have no power of expansion at all. This root is also called <b>“a fine</b> [<i>ḥuta</i>] <b>thread,”</b> which means a thin root for sins [<i>ḥata’im</i>]. This is as the Sages said: “Initially, [the evil inclination] is like a strand of a spider’s web, but subsequently it is like the thick ropes of a wagon” [<i>Sukka</i> 52a]. It is called <b>“thin”</b> because it is the judgment that is concealed and hidden at the point of mercy, as stated.
However, one who impairs his covenant causes the point of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> to be exposed, and then the <i>kelippot</i> approach it and suckle great <i>shefa</i> from it, receiving strength for a great expansion. One who does this actively forfeits his soul, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “By the breath of God they perish” (Job 4:9). But when he merits and repents, he rectifies the <i>Malkhut</i> once again with the rectification of the attribute of mercy. This is why it is called <i>teshuva</i> [repentance], which has the letters of <i>tashuv heh</i> [“let <i>heh</i> return”], that is, this brings the attribute of mercy back to her place, and thus the power of judgment is concealed inside her once more, in the mystical meaning of only <b>a thin</b> light.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Unless the Lord had been my help, been my guardian.”</b> In other words, He accepted my repentance and repelled the angel Duma to his place, as stated. He brought the <i>Malkhut</i> back to its place, to the attribute of mercy, and left only a thin light from the attribute of judgment, <b>“‘almost, ’ like the measure of a fine thread that is between me and the Other Side.”</b> That is, only that small amount which must necessarily remain between the <i>Malkhut</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, in order to give the [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] sustenance through a slight illumination, called <b>“a fine thread.” “It was that measure away from my soul dwelling with Duma”</b> – this measure saved me from falling into the hands of the angel <b>Duma.</b> Had the power of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> not returned to the measure of <b>a fine thread,</b> I would have already been in the hands of <b>Duma.</b>

Paragraph 138

<b>138. “For this reason, one must be careful, etc.”</b><br><b>For this reason, one must be careful not to speak like David, because one cannot say to the angel Duma “that it was an error,” as occurred with David, such that the Holy One, blessed be He, defeated</b> [the angel] <b>in the judgment. “Why should God be angry at your voice,”</b> that is, <b>at that voice which said: “And destroy the work of your hands”</b> [Ecclesiastes 5:5], <b>meaning the holy flesh,</b> which is <b>the holy covenant that he impaired and was drawn into Gehennom by Duma.</b>
Explanation: There are two types of repentance: 1) Repentance out of fear, in which intentional sins are counted for a person as unwitting transgressions; 2) Repentance out of love, when intentional sins are counted for a person as merits (<i>Yoma</i> 86b). The [underlying] meaning is that before the completion of the rectification, as long as the force of judgment is required in the world, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “God has so made it so that men should fear before Him” [Ecclesiastes 3:14], the <i>Malkhut</i> must at least sustain the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> to the extent of a thin light, so that the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> will not be nullified. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained in the preceding sections, a "thin light" refers to the minimum divine sustenance required for these levels to continue to exist.</i> Accordingly, the entire rectification of the <i>Malkhut</i> is in the mystical meaning of two points: mercy and judgment. However, the judgment is hidden and concealed, while the mercy is in a revealed state. [<i>Malkhut</i>] thereby contains [the aspect of] fear, in the mystical meaning of the tree of [the knowledge of] good and evil: “If a person merits, it is good; if he does not merit, it is evil” (as stated in section #123#, above).
Thus, the repentance we perform during the 6, 000 years [of this world] is only repentance out of fear, in which intentional sins are counted for [a person] as unwitting transgressions. By means of the repentance, we restore the <i>Malkhut</i> to the attribute of mercy, while the judgment in [<i>Malkhut</i>] is concealed to the size of a thin light and a fine thread, since the <i>Malkhut</i> must still remain with [some amount of] the attribute of fear. This is why it is called “repentance out of fear.”
This <b>fine thread</b> that must remain is called “unwitting transgressions,” since an unwitting transgression is not a sin in and of itself, but rather the unwitting transgressions lead one to sin deliberately. This is because one does not sin on purpose before he first suffers some unintentional lapse. The same applies to this fine thread [of judgment] that remains in <i>Malkhut</i>, for although in remaining, there is no sin, but due to this concealed [force of] judgment we come to intentional sins. This is the mystical meaning of the statement of the Sages: “Initially, it is like a hair’s breadth,” that is, this <b>fine thread,</b> but subsequently, if we do not keep the covenant properly, it becomes “like the thick ropes of a wagon,” when the attribute of judgment within <i>Malkhut</i> is exposed.
This is the mystical meaning of [the statement that] Duma is sitting at the opening to Gehennom. This is the force of the fine thread, which is only an opening, in the mystical meaning of “it is like a hair’s breadth.” Consequently, this repentance [from fear] of ours is considered only as though our iniquities have been pardoned and have become unwitting transgressions, since the fine thread, which can lead us to intentional sin, remains intact. [Regarding the] concept of the second type of repentance, which is out of love, is that intentional sins become like merits, see section #126#, above.
This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states that <b>“one must be careful not to speak like David.”</b> That is, one must avoid <b>speaking</b> in such a manner that could cause the exposure of the attribute of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, as David did, <b>“because he cannot say to the angel Duma that it was an error.”</b> A person cannot be sure that he will be able to repent immediately, such that the iniquity will be atoned and turned into an unwitting transgression for him, <b>“as occurred with David, for the Holy One, blessed be He, defeated</b> [the angel] <b>in the judgment.”</b>
[This lack of certainty is because] David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life. He committed no sin during his lifetime, except for the matter of Uriah. This is why the Holy One, blessed be He, became his <b>guardian,</b> and immediately helped him to repent, and the iniquity became like an unwitting transgression for him, as it is stated: <b>“Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul would almost have dwelled in silence</b> [<i>duma</i>].” Other people, however, should fear that they will not be able to say “before the angel <b>that it was an error”</b> [Ecclesiastes 5:5] and will fall into the hands of <b>Duma,</b> to Gehennom.
<b>“‘And destroy the work of your hands, ’ meaning the holy flesh, the holy covenant that he impaired and was drawn into Gehennom by Duma.”</b> The rectification of <b>the holy covenant</b> is called <b>“the work of our hands,”</b> as it is stated: <b>“Establish You upon us the work of our hands”</b> [Psalms 90:17]. The mystical meaning of the holy soul is called the holy flesh, in the mystical meaning of: “From my flesh I shall see the Lord” (Job 19:26; see section #131#, above). By exposing the [force of] judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, the rectification of the covenant is corrupted and the soul is drawn to Gehennom by Duma, as stated above.
The words <b>“for this reason”</b> refer back to the entire section of Rav Hamnuna Saba, which [the <i>Zohar</i>] presented to us. The issue of the rectification of the covenant was thoroughly explained there, both with regard to its reward and its punishment, and the reason why the rectification of the covenant is called “<b>the work of our hands.”</b> Here, [the <i>Zohar</i>] returns to the [original] issue, to explain the completion of the rectification for that day, that the heavens is the bridegroom who enters his wedding canopy with the bride (as stated above, in the interpretation of the verse: “The heavens declare the glory of God” [Psalms 19:2; section #128#]).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says that <b>“for this reason”</b> the verse states regarding the completion of the rectification: <b>“And the firmament shows His handiwork”</b> [Psalms 19:2]. Then it will be revealed that all those rectifications are not <b>“the work of our hands”</b> but <b>“the work of His hands.” The firmament shows</b> this, as the great fusion in the mystical meaning of <b>“who had done mighty deeds, of Kabzeel”</b> was performed upon it (as stated in section #92#, above). <b>“Shows”</b> refers to the revelation of the drawing forth of the <i>shefa</i>.
Know that this is the entire difference between this world before the rectification, and the completion of the rectification. Before the completion of the rectification, the <i>Malkhut</i> is called “the tree of [the knowledge of] good and evil,” as stated. This means that the <i>Malkhut</i> is the mystical meaning of God’s governing of this world. As long as the recipients have not achieved a state of completion, such they can receive His complete benevolence which He had in mind for us in [His initial] intent for the Creation, [God’s] governing must be in the form of good and evil, reward and punishment. This is because our vessels of receiving are still tainted with selfish receiving, which is greatly constricted in its measure, and which also separates us from the Creator.
The complete benevolence, in the great measure that He had in mind for us, is only in the form of bestowal, which is pleasure without any boundary or constriction. This is not the case for selfish receiving, which is limited and highly constricted, because satiation sharply extinguishes the pleasure. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Selfish receiving, which is receiving for its own sake, is being contrasted here with receiving in order to bestow. Receiving for its own sake is very limited, for as soon as that which is lacking is received, the yearning for that which was lacking vanishes, nullifying the will to receive.</i> This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose” [Proverbs 16:4], that is, everything that occurs in the world was created from the outset only to bestow satisfaction to Him. Therefore, this means that people engage in worldly affairs in complete contrast [to the purpose] for which they were initially created, since the Holy One, blessed be He, declares: “The entire world was created for Me,” which is the meaning of: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose,” and likewise “Every one that is called by My name, I have created for My glory” [see Isaiah 43:7].
Yet we say the exact opposite, for we state that “the entire world was created only for us.” We wish to swallow all the goodness of the world into our bellies, for our own pleasure and for our own glory. Consequently, it is no wonder that we are still unworthy of receiving His complete benevolence. For this reason, His providence has been made palatable for us in the form of good and evil, that is, a system of reward and punishment. [Reward and punishment] are interdependent [with good and evil], since reward and punishment are the result of good and evil. When we use the vessels of receiving in the opposite manner to how they were created, we necessarily feel that the [responsive] reactions of [God’s] governing are evil for us. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that when we use our vessels of receiving in a selfish manner, we experience negative results as a reflection of the divine governance of God.</i>
It is a rule that a creature cannot receive evil from God in a revealed fashion, since it would impair the glory of God, Heaven forfend, for a creature to perceive Him like an evildoer, as that is unbecoming of the complete Actor. <sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is a term for God, describing Him as acting in perfect, undistorted ways.</i> Therefore, when a person experiences [something] negative, to that same extent the denial of God’s providence rests upon him and the Actor is hidden from him. This is the greatest punishment in the world.
Thus, the experiencing of good and evil within His providence contains within it the experiencing of reward and punishment, for one who makes the effort not to separate from his loyalty to God is rewarded, even though he tastes evil in the providence. But if he does not make that effort, Heaven forbid, he will suffer punishment because he is separated from his loyalty to God. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">When a person experiences something negative in his life, if that causes him to separate himself from God within himself, that itself will be a punishment in addition to the negative experience. This separation is a person's choice, however, meaning that human beings have a choice as to how to view circumstances that befall them. If we choose to view them negatively, this gives rise to a separation between us and God, a natural "punishment" for perceiving God's actions as evil.</i> Accordingly, although God alone did, is doing, and will do all of the deeds, this [fact] remains hidden from those who experience good and evil, since at the time of a negative [event], the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is granted the power to conceal His providence and faith. [A person] thereby arrives at the great punishment of separation and becomes filled with heretical thoughts. But when [the person] repents, he receives the corresponding reward and can cleave to God once again.
However, through the governing of reward and punishment itself, God has prepared [matters] so that we will ultimately be rewarded through [that governance] with the completion of the rectification. This means that all people will attain the rectified vessels of receiving in order to give satisfaction to their Maker, per the verse: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose,” which is in accordance with their initial creation, as stated.
Then the great fusion of the <i>Atik Yomin</i> will be revealed, we will arrive at repentance out of love, all intentional sins will be transformed into merits, and all evils into great good. Then His personal providence will be revealed throughout the entire world, that is, all will see that He alone did, is doing, and will do all the actions and deeds [including also the] preceding [ones]. At that stage, once the evil and the punishments have become benefits and merits, it will be possible to grasp [the presence of] the Actor [within those actions], for they are now fitting for the work of His hands. Then they will praise and bless Him for [what appeared to be] those imaginary evils and punishments at the time [of the past].
This is the main idea of the section. Thus far the rectifications were also regarded as <b>the work of our hands,</b> which is why we received rewards or punishments for them. However, at the great fusion of the completion of the rectification it will be revealed that both the rectifications and the punishments were all solely <b>“the work of His hands,”</b> as stated. This is as it says: <b>“The firmament shows His handiwork,”</b> for the great fusion upon the firmament will show that everything is <b>the work of His hands</b> and He alone did, is doing, and will do all of the deeds.

Paragraph 139

<b>139. “For this reason, etc.”</b><br><b>For this reason, “and the firmament shows</b> [<i>maggid</i>] <b>His handiwork”</b> [Psalms 19:2]. <b>These are the colleagues who bonded with this bride,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, by engaging in Torah on the night of Shavuot (as explained previously in section #130), <b>and those of hers who have</b> the sign of the covenant, and who are called “the work of His hands” (as stated there), <b>He states</b> [<i>maggid</i>] <b>and registers each and every one. Who is “the firmament”? It is the firmament in which there are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, and it is called “the book of remembrance,” which states, registers, and writes them down, so that they will be the members of His chamber, and so that He will always perform their will.</b>
Explanation: <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, within which took place the [fusion through collision] for the revelation all the higher heights and levels – which are <b>the sun, moon, stars, and constellations</b> – is called the “firmament.” This is as it is stated (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i>, 402): <b>“‘And</b> [God] <b>set them in the firmament of the heaven’ – and when they all stand there, they are happy with one another. Then the moon diminished herself before the sun,</b> [and] <b>everything that</b> [the sun] <b>takes is only in order to illuminate it. This</b> [is the meaning of] <b>the verse: ‘To give light upon the earth’</b> [Genesis 1:17].”
Explanation: All the supernal lights were placed <b>in the firmament of the heaven,</b> which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. <b>They all stand there,</b> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] <b>happily</b> couples with the <i>Nukba</i>, who is called <b>“earth,”</b> and he gives her all of those lights. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“To give light upon the earth.”</b> At that point, the <i>Malkhut</i> is regarded as smaller than the sun, which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. However, at the completion of the rectification, <b>“Rav Yitzḥak said: ‘The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days</b> etc. ’ [Isaiah 30:26].” That is, at that time the <i>Malkhut</i> will not be smaller than <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> but will grow [to be] like <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> during the six days of creation, while the <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> itself will rise sevenfold, like the six days of creation.
Rabbi Yehuda asks there: <b>“And when will this be? At the time</b> [about] <b>when it is stated:</b> ‘<b>He will eliminate death forever’</b> [Isaiah 25:8], <b>and then it is stated: ‘On that day, the Lord shall be one and His name one’</b> [Zechariah 14:9]”; see there. This means that the firmament, which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, is <b><i>Havaya</i>,</b> which is called <b>“sun.”</b> “<b>His name”</b> is the <i>Nukba</i> that receives from Him, which is called <b>“moon.”</b> During the six thousand years, which receive from the six days of creation, it is not revealed to them that He is one and His name one, since the moon is smaller than the sun which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, and called <b><i>Havaya</i>.</b> The meaning of this smallness [of the moon which is <i>Malkhut</i>] is that the <i>Malkhut</i> is rectified in the mystical meaning of action that consists of good and evil, reward and punishment (as explained at length in the section just above; see there in detail). There is a great difference between “He” and “His name,” for in “His name,” which is the <i>Malkhut</i>, the couplings come one after the other, at times joined while at other times separated; see there.
However, at the completion of the rectification, that is, <b>at the time</b> [about] <b>when it is stated:</b> “<b>He will eliminate death forever,”</b> it will then be <b>“the Lord</b> [<i>Havaya</i>] <b>is one and His name one.”</b> For <b>“His name,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>, will return to be truly like the light of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, that is, all good without any evil at all, and personal providence will be revealed within [the moon], as stated above. This is the mystical meaning of: “The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun.”
Therefore, at that time, the <i>Nukba</i> will be called <b>“a book of remembrance.”</b> This is because the <i>Malkhut</i> is called <b>“a book,”</b> since the deeds of all the people in the world are inscribed in [the <i>Malkhut</i>]. The <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> is called <b>“remembrance”</b> because it remembers the deeds of the world and examines all those formed long ago. [All beings] receive from [this <i>Yesod</i>], as stated above with regard to the mystical meaning of the verse: “To give light upon the earth.” During the six thousand years before the completion of the rectification, the <b>book</b> is alone and the <b>remembrance</b> is alone, that is, at times joined [together with each other] while at other times separated. But at the completion of the rectification both of these levels will become one [level], in the mystical meaning of: <b>“<i>Havaya</i> is one and His name one.”</b> Then the <i>Malkhut</i> itself will be called <b>“a book of remembrance,”</b> for they will be truly one, since the light of the moon will have become like the light of the sun (see <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Vayak’hel</i> 100).
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“What is ‘the firmament’? It is the firmament in which there are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations,”</b> that is, the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> from which all the lights in the world emerge, and through which they are sustained. [This <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] bestows these [lights] to the <i>Malkhut</i> at the time that [the <i>Malkhut</i>] is smaller than [the <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], and while [the <i>Malkhut</i>] is not yet an aspect of: “The Lord is one and His name one.” <b>“This is called ‘the book of remembrance, ’”</b> that [this firmament] itself will also be the <i>Malkhut</i> of the completion of the rectification, [the <i>Malkhut</i> of which] will therefore be called <b>“a book of remembrance,”</b> for then the <i>Malkhut</i> will receive all of the level of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>. This <b>firmament,</b> which is called <b>“remembrance,”</b> will then be called <b>“a book of remembrance,”</b> that is, an aspect of the <i>Malkhut</i> itself, which is called <b>“a book,”</b> and the <b>remembrance,</b> which is <b>the firmament,</b> will be actually one with [the <i>Malkhut</i>], in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“On that day, the Lord shall be one and His name one.”</b>

Paragraph 140

<b>140. “Day to day, etc.”</b><br><b>“Day to day utters speech,</b> [and night to night reveals knowledge,” Psalms 19:3]. This is referring to <b>a holy day, from amongst those lofty days of the King,</b> that is, from the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, which are called “days.” <b>They praise the colleagues</b> who engaged in Torah on the night of Shavuot, <b>and</b> they each <b>tell his colleague that matter which he said.</b> This is the meaning of the verse: <b>“Day to day utters” that “speech” and praises him. “And night to night” –</b> this means that <b>every level that governs in the night,</b> the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Malkhut</i>, which governs in the night, <b>praises one another,</b> with <b>that <i>Da'at</i> that each receives from his colleague. And in the great perfection, they become friends and beloved ones.</b>
Explanation: After having explained that the phrase “and the firmament shows His handiwork” [Psalms 19:2] is referring to <b>the book of remembrance</b> mentioned in Malachi [3:16], he proceeds to interpret the ensuing verses as the prophet’s detailing of what is written in the book of remembrance. It states there (Malachi 3:14–17): “You have said, it is in vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked mournfully because of the Lord of hosts etc. Then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another; and the Lord listened and heard, and <b>a book of remembrance</b> was written before Him, for those who feared the Lord and thought upon His name. And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, on the day that I make a treasure, and I will have compassion over them, as a man has compassion for his own son who serves him.”
You thus find that <b>that matter which they each tell his colleague,</b> “it is in vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept His charge...” is written in <b>the book of remembrance</b> for those who feared the Lord and thought upon His name. God will have compassion over them “as a man has compassion for his own son who serves him,” but only on the day when “I make a treasure,” which is the day of the completion of the rectification.
The meaning of all this is as follows: Before the completion of the rectification, that is, before we have prepared our vessels of receiving to receive only in order to give satisfaction to our Maker, rather than for our own benefit, the <i>Malkhut</i> is called “the tree of [the knowledge of] good and evil.” This is because the <i>Malkhut</i> is the governing of the world in accordance with people’s actions. And since we are unfit to receive all the delight and goodness that God had in mind for us in [His initial] intent for the Creation, for the reason stated in the previous section, we are forced to receive the governing of good and evil from the <i>Malkhut</i>. This governance [incrementally] prepares us to ultimately rectify our vessels of receiving [so that we can receive] in order to give, and [thus] to merit the delight and goodness He had in mind for us. We have already explained this at length above (in section #138#; see there).
As explained there, our experience of good and evil is intertwined with the concepts of reward and punishment as well, since the experience of [something] bad causes one’s separation from his faith in God. Thus, if a person makes the effort, during the period of his bad feeling, not to impair his faith on that account, and he is able to observe the Torah and the commandments in a complete manner, he receives a reward. But if he fails to withstand the test, Heaven forbid, and [allows] separation to enter [him], he is filled with negative thoughts, as stated there.
It is known that the Sages said about such thoughts that the Holy One, blessed be He, punishes one for them as for an action (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 40a). In this regard it is stated: “In order to take hold of the house of Israel by their heart” [Ezekiel 14:5]. It is also known that “the righteousness of the righteous will not save him on the day of his transgression” [Ezekiel 33:12], although this applies only to those who regret their earlier goods deeds [see <i>Kiddushin</i> 40a]. However, sometimes such negative thoughts overcome a person until he regrets, Heaven forbid, the many good deeds he has done and says: “What profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked mournfully because of the Lord of hosts?” He then becomes a completely wicked person, for he regrets his earlier deeds and he forfeits all of the good deeds he had done, due to this evil thought. This is in accordance with the verse: “The righteousness of the righteous will not save him on the day of his transgression.” And yet, despite all this, repentance is effective, although he is then considered as one who is starting to serve the Creator afresh, like a newly born infant, since all of his righteousness from previous days has completely vanished.
Now, the governance [of the world by] good and evil often causes us to experience ups and downs, as stated, each person in accordance with his [individual] situation. You should know that for this reason, each ascent is regarded as a separate day, since on account of the great descent that he has experienced in the meantime, when he regretted his earlier deeds, he is considered like a newly born child upon the ascent. Accordingly, at each ascent it is as though he is beginning to serve the Creator anew, and therefore every ascent is considered a specific day, and likewise, each descent is considered a specific night.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Day to day utters speech, a holy day, from amongst those lofty days of the King.”</b> In other words, for each ascent a person experienced, when he cleaved to the <b>lofty days</b> of the Holy One, blessed be He, <b>they praise the colleagues and</b> [they each] <b>tell his colleague that matter which he said.”</b> For by virtue of the great coupling [between <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>] at the completion of the rectification, they will merit repentance out of love, since the rectification of all the vessels of receiving will be completed, and [these vessels] will exist only in order to give satisfaction to God. Through that coupling, all of the great goodness and delight of [His initial] intent for the Creation will be revealed to us, and then we will clearly see that all those punishments that occurred at the time of the descents, which led us into regretting the earlier deeds, were the very things that purified us and were the direct causes of all the happiness and goodness that we have received at the time of the completion of the rectification. Were it not for those terrible punishments, we would never have arrived at this delight and goodness. At that stage, these intentional sins will then have been transformed into actual merits.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“Day to day utters speech,”</b> which means that each ascent before the completion of the rectification is one of <b>those lofty days of the King,</b> which praise the colleagues. [The day] is thus revealed now once again in all the splendor of its wholeness that belongs to that day, and it praises the colleagues who keep the Torah with <b>that matter which they each tell his colleague. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, the "days" are the ascents. The ascents, the spiritual advances of the person, are revealed at that time in their entirety, and the negative attitude of "It is in vain to serve God" becomes a merit for the person.</i></b> This [matter] is: “It is in vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept His charge,” which at the time caused them to suffer great punishments. These have now been turned into merits, since the entire wholeness and happiness of that day would have been unable to be revealed in its magnificence and splendor, were it not for those punishments. Consequently, those who utter those words are regarded as “those who feared the Lord and thought upon His name,” [and those words are] the same as the truly good deeds [that were committed]. It is therefore stated about them too that “I will have compassion over them, as a man has compassion for his own son who serves him.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Day to day utters that speech and praises him.” A</b>ll those nights are the descents, the sufferings, and the punishments that stopped one’s cleaving to God, until they became many days, one after the other. But now, once the night and darkness between [the days] have also become merits and good deeds, and “the night shines like the day, and the darkness is like the light” [see Psalms 139:12], there are no more breaks in between [the days], and all six thousand years unite into a single great day. Thus, all the fusions that emerged one after the other, revealing ascents and descents that were each separate from the other, have now gathered together into a height of a single, sublime, transcendent [fusion through collision], which shines from one end of the world to the other. This is the mystical meaning of <b>“day to day utters speech,”</b> for the word mentioned previously which separated between <b>one day and the next,</b> has now become a great praise and it <b>praises him,</b> since it has become a merit. In this manner, all [these nights and days] become one day for the Lord.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And night to night – every level that governs in the night praises one another,</b> [with] <b>that knowledge that each receives from his colleague.”</b> All those words and sufferings that are called “nights,” on account of which the levels became discrete, one after the other, they too now shine like the day, because they have all gathered together and become a single receptacle for the great knowledge that fills the whole earth with the knowledge of the Lord [see Isaiah 11:9]. Thus, each night by itself would have remained in the darkness, had it not now joined into a single gathering, together with all the other nights. Each night receives its share in [contributing to] the <b>knowledge</b> only through the bonding with the rest of the nights. Therefore, each night is regarded as <b>revealing knowledge</b> to its colleague, for it would not be fit for the <b>knowledge</b> without combining with its colleague.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“Every level that governs in the night,”</b> that is, each night that has now been completed as a receptacle for the knowledge of God, <b>“praises one another.”</b> Accordingly, each one praises his colleague because of <b>that knowledge that each</b> one of them <b>received from his colleague,</b> by means of that bond with his colleague, the night. [A particular night] would not have received it other than by bonding with its colleague, since only all of them together, in a gathering, became worthy of receiving that great knowledge. The section thus concludes: <b>“And in the great perfection, they become friends and beloved ones,”</b> for in the great wholeness that they achieve together, all the nights become beloved friends with one another.

Paragraph 141

<b>141. “There is no speech, there are no words, etc.”</b><br><b>“There is no speech, there are no words”</b> [Psalms 19:4]. This means that there is <b>no speech concerning other worldly matters, which are not heard before the holy King and that He does not want to hear. But those matters, “their line has gone out through all the earth”</b> [Psalms 19:5], that is, <b>those matters form a line from those who reside above and those who reside below. From these things the firmaments are fashioned, and from these things, from that praise, the earth</b> is fashioned. <b>And if you say that those things roam in the world in a single place,</b> the verse states: <b>“And their words to the end of the world”</b> [Psalms 19:5].
Explanation: Thus far, we have spoken about the worst punishments and sufferings, namely the separation from one’s faith in God. Here it states that punishments and sufferings due to <b>other worldly matters,</b> that is, personal transgressions, the torments of Gehennom and physical suffering and the like, which fill this whole world, also gather and are incorporated in this great fusion, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And it shall come to pass, that just as the Lord rejoiced over you to do good to you and to multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you etc.” [Deuteronomy 28:63]. [All these punishments] will gather and become a great light and be transformed into great joy and gladness.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“There is no speech, there are no words concerning other worldly matters”</b> – that is, all the suffering of this world – <b>“which are not heard before the holy King,”</b> at their transformation into joy and gladness, <b>“and</b> [about which it could be said that] <b>He does not want to hear.”</b> Due to their conversion into joy and gladness, the <b>holy King</b> will seek them and long to hear them. In other words, the memory of any sorrow and pain from past times will now, at the completion of the rectification, be a cause of great gladness and delight, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “In those days, and in that time, [says the Lord, ] the iniquity of Israel shall be sought, and there shall be none” [Jeremiah 50:20]. When these [transgressions] turn into merits, they will cause such satisfaction that the iniquities from past times will be sought as a source of amusement, but they will not be found. That is, it will seem to us that they no longer exist in their true form, as they were in days past. This is the meaning of: <b>“And which He does not want to hear,”</b> that there <b>is no speech and there are no words</b> to which He will not return with a great will and desire to hear, because now they have all become holy and faithful lights.
Now, this great height, which is generated at the completion of the rectification through the great [fusion through collision] from all the souls and all the good and bad deeds, is considered like a line and a pillar of light that shines from one end of the world to the other. This is the mystical meaning of the great unification, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “The Lord shall be one and His name one” (Zechariah 14:9). [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states regarding <b>“those matters,”</b> that is, the aforementioned <b>other worldly matters,</b> [that] <b>“their line has gone out through all the earth,”</b> since the height that emerges from upon those matters, which are all types of suffering and punishment, illuminates from one end of the world to the other, that is, “through all the earth.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“From those who reside above and those who reside below.”</b> This is a very lofty concept, which I will try to clarify as much as possible. One should know that there is no order of time in eternity, unlike in this world. Accordingly, when God contemplated creating the world, all the souls, together with all their ways of behavior, in their complete wholeness that is required of them, were already created with respect to Him, in order to receive all the delight and goodness that He had in mind for them for their benefit. For Him, the future is like the present, and future and past do not apply to Him.
You can thereby understand the statement of the Sages (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b): The Holy One, Blessed be He, showed Adam the first [man], every generation and its interpreters,... and likewise to Moses (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Lekh</i>, 331; <i>Vayḥi</i>, 369). At first glance, this is puzzling: Since they had not yet been created, how could He show them? Rather, this is as we stated, that all the souls and all their ways of behavior, [from the beginning of Creation] through the completion of the rectification, have already emerged before Him in reality. They are all present in the mystical meaning of the supernal Garden of Eden. From there, they descend, becoming enclothed in bodies in this world, each of them at its proper time. From [the supernal Garden of Eden], the Creator showed them to Adam the first [man] and to Moses, and to all who were worthy of it. This is a lengthy [and complex] idea, which not everyone is capable of grasping (and which I have explained at length in my book, <i>Panim Masbirot</i>, section 1).
This is the mystical meaning of what is stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Teruma</i>, 163) that <b>“as they unite above, in the secret of one, she too unites below, in the secret of one.”</b> The height of the great fusion at the completion of the rectification – in the mystical meaning of the verse: “The Lord shall be one and His name one” – has already emerged above, from all the souls and all the deeds in the world which will be created until the completion of the rectification, that is, from the perspective of God’s eternity, since the future is like the present to Him. Thus, this pillar of light that shines from one end of the world to the other, which will shine at the completion of the rectification, is already standing in this manner in the supernal Garden of Eden and illuminating before Him, just as it will be revealed to us at the completion of the rectification.
This is the meaning of the statement there: <b>“One opposite the other; the Holy One, Blessed be He, is one.”</b> At the time of the completion of the rectification, the two heights will illuminate <b>one opposite the other,</b> and then “the Lord shall be one and His name one.” This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Those matters form a line from those who reside above and those who reside below,”</b> that is, one opposite the other. That height shines <b>from those who reside above,</b> which are all the souls that are in the supernal Garden of Eden, and it also shines from <b>those who reside below,</b> which are all the souls once they have undergone the actualization of enclothing in a body in this world and reached the completion of the rectification. In other words, those two heights shine at the completion of the rectification together, at which stage God’s oneness is revealed, in the mystical meaning: “The Lord is one and His name one.”
Now, one might mistakenly think that this pillar of light which illuminates in the supernal Garden of Eden is drawn forth and shines in this world at the completion of the rectification. In response to such a claim, we are informed that this is not the case. Rather, <b>“from these things the firmaments are fashioned,”</b> since this height emerges upon the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, which is called “a firmament” (as stated in section #138#, above). Consequently, this distinction [of above and below] is still maintained in all the fusions, that the height [of light] first emerges from the firmament and above, before subsequently illuminating to the recipients from the firmament and below. The height [of light] that emerges from the firmament and above is called <b>“heaven,”</b> while the height which is received from the firmament and below, is called <b>“earth.”</b>
This is the meaning of the statement that when the line of light unites <b>those who reside above and those who reside below,</b> there still remains the distinction between the supernal Garden of Eden and those who reside in this world. [This distinction is that] the height of the fusion that emerges from the firmament and above is received by those who reside in the supernal Garden of Eden, because <b>“from these things the firmaments are fashioned,”</b> that is, a new heaven for those who reside above. It is only the brightness that is drawn from the firmament and below which is received by <b>those who reside below,</b> and which is called “a new land” (as stated in section #64# above, third paragraph; see there). This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] adds <b>“from that praise,”</b> meaning that those who reside below attain only <b>the praise</b> and the brightness that extend from heaven to earth.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And if you say that those things roam in the world in a single place</b> [etc. ].” Since it was explained that the [future] fusion is performed in the manner of all the fusions, in that it is drawn from the firmament and above to from the firmament and below, one might mistakenly claim that it is only a thin line, which rises in the mystical meaning of one place, as mentioned in the act of creation: “Let the waters be gathered together to one place” [Genesis 1:9], that is, only to the internal aspect of the levels [of reality], which reaches Israel alone, but not the external aspects of the levels (see <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Bereshit</i>, 218). [The <i>Zohar</i>] therefore states that it is not so, but rather they <b>“roam in the world,”</b> for the light wanders and fills the world from the end to the other, that is, <b>“their words to the end of the world.”</b> This means even to the external aspects of the levels, for it reaches the nations of the world as well, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord” [Isaiah 11:9].

Paragraph 142

<b>142. “Since firmaments were fashioned, etc.”</b><br><b>And since firmaments were fashioned from them, who resides in them? He reiterated and said: “In them He set a tent for the sun”</b> [Psalms 19:5]. <b>That holy sun,</b> which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> – <b>there is its chamber, and its abode is in them, and it is crowned in them.</b>
Explanation: Since we have said that the pillar of light emerges from the firmament and above, and from the firmament and below only their praise is drawn, the question arises: Who is using this pillar of light? This is the meaning of the question: <b>“Who resides in them?”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] replies that the <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, which is called the <b>sun,</b> is crowned and sets <b>its abode</b> in this pillar of light. [The <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is crowned with this pillar like being under a canopy, since a <b>tent</b> means a canopy above. This is the meaning of the verse: <b>“In them He set a tent for the sun.”</b>

Paragraph 143

<b>143. “Since it is present in those, etc.”</b><br><b>Since</b> <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> <b>is dwells in those firmaments and is crowned in them, it is then “like a bridegroom emerging from his canopy”</b> [Psalms 19:6]. <b>[<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] is joyous and races through those firmaments, emerging from them and entering and running into one other tower, in another place. “His going forth is from the end of the heaven”</b> [Psalms 19:7]. <b>[<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] certainly emerges from the higher world, which is the edge of the heaven above,</b> that is, <i>Bina</i>. <b>“And its circuit” – what is “its circuit”? This is the edge of the heaven below,</b> that is, <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>which is the time of the year that encircles all endings and which is tied from the heavens until this firmament.</b>
Explanation: Here he alludes to a great and awesome secret, which is the emergence of the sun from its sheath, that is, from its canopy. Once the great fusion is performed <b>in those firmaments,</b> in the mystical meaning of the canopy, [the sun, which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] emerges from those firmaments <b>“into one other tower in another place,”</b> that is, in the place of the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called “the name of the Lord is a strong tower” [Proverbs 18:10]. Then the <i>Malkhut</i> ascends and unites with Him in the secret of oneness.
The endpoint of the <i>Malkhut</i> is called <b>“the time of the year.”</b> Before the rectification, the <i>kelippot</i> that are called “the end of days” grasped hold there (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Bo</i>, 31). Now, after the completion of the rectification, this aspect [of <i>Malkhut</i>] requires a special rectification. This is achieved through the emergence of the sun from its sheath, in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“And it is like a bridegroom emerging from his canopy.”</b> It illuminates and enters <b>another tower,</b> which is the <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated. Then it “rejoices as a strong man to run his course” [Psalms 19:6], for it runs in that same tower; “and its circuit to its ends” [Psalms 19:7], since it shines <b>from the edge of the heaven above,</b> until all the ends of <i>Malkhut</i>, in order to rectify this <b>time of the year of the edge of the heaven below.</b> <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This means to say that the shine of the "sun, " which is <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>, when it emerges in this way, rectifies the edge of <i>Malkhut</i> that requires a unique rectification, due to its vulnerability to the external forces.</i>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“That encircles all endings.”</b> This rectification completes the rectification of all aspects of the endings in <i>Malkhut</i>. It was thereby <b>“tied from the heavens until this firmament,”</b> that is, the <i>Malkhut</i> receives the illumination of the <b>edge of the heaven</b> from above, until <b>this firmament</b> of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>.

Paragraph 144

<b>144. “And there is nothing hidden from its heat, etc.”</b><br><b>“And there is nothing hidden from its heat”</b> [Psalms 19:7], that is, <b>there is nothing hidden from its heat from that time of the year,</b> which is that time of the year discussed above, <b>and</b> from <b>the circuit of the sun, which circles on every side. “And there is nothing hidden”</b> means that <b>there is none who can hide from it from among all the higher levels, for they would all go round and come to it, and</b> [with regard to] <b>each and every one, there was none that could hide from it. “From its heat” means that it heats up and returns to them,</b> the colleagues, <b>when they are in a state of complete repentance. All this glory and all this worth is due to</b> their engagement in <b>the Torah, as it is stated: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect”</b> [Psalms 19:8]. <i>Iluya</i> means worth as in the phrase “when they divided it according to its worth” [<i>be-iluya</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 42b].
Explanation: After the great fusion [at the completion of the rectification], a covering and concealment is formed for all the supernal lights (as stated in section #94# above; see there in detail). Therefore, this new fusion is necessary in this <b>one tower,</b> in the mystical meaning of: <b>“And its</b> [powerful] <b>circuit to its ends”</b> [Psalms 19:7]. [This new fusion] again reveals all the supernal lights that were <b>hidden</b> as a result of the nullification of the <i>Ban</i> before its ascent to <i>Sag</i>, as stated above; see there.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“There is nothing hidden from its heat from that time of the year, and the</b> [powerful] <b>circuit of the sun, which surrounds on every side.”</b> This aforementioned fusion of the circuit of the sun with the time of the year rectifies the endpoints of <i>Malkhut</i> on every side, that is, in all aspects, until it is sufficient for the complete rectification, when the <i>Ban</i> ascends and becomes <i>Sag</i> again. This is a complete rectification of all the aspects, such that subsequently “<b>there is nothing hidden,</b> [meaning that] <b>there is none who can hide from it from among all the higher levels.”</b> All the supernal levels and lights are completely revealed once again; <b>“for they would all go round and come to it, and</b> [with regard to] <b>each and every one, there was none that could be hidden from it,”</b> because all the supernal levels and lights return and come to [the sun] slowly, until nothing is hidden from it.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that <b>“‘from its heat’ means that it heats up and returns to them when they are in a state of complete repentance.”</b> In other words, the aforementioned revelation does not occur in a single moment; rather, the circuit of the sun gradually illuminates until it is sufficiently heated up for <b>complete repentance,</b> in the manner that the Sages stated that the wicked are sentenced by it and the righteous are healed by it [see <i>Nedarim</i> 8b]. At this stage, they merit [and receive] that great revelation.

Paragraph 145

<b>145. “Six times, etc.”</b><br><b>Six times</b> <b><i>Havaya</i> is written here, and they are six verses, from: “The heavens declare” until: “<i>The</i> Torah of the Lord is perfect”</b> [Psalms 19:2-8]. <b>With regard to this secret it is written <i>Bereshit</i></b> [“In the beginning”], <b>which consists of six</b> [Hebrew] <b>letters. “God created the heavens and the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:1] <b>are six</b> [Hebrew] <b>words. The other verses,</b> from “the Torah of the Lord is perfect” until “which are more to be desired than gold” [Psalms 19:12] only <b>correspond to the six times</b> that <b><i>Havaya</i></b> is written in them, but these six verses themselves are not expounded. <b>The six verses</b> from “the heavens declare” until “the Torah of the Lord is perfect” <b>are for the six letters here,</b> in the word <i>Bereshit</i>. <b>The six names are for the six words here,</b> that is, “God created the heavens and the earth.”
Explanation: It is known that every level that is revealed from the [supernal] levels first manifests through the aspect of letters, at which point [the level] is still unknown. After this, it manifests as combinations of words, and then that which is contained within the level becomes known, in the manner explained above with regard to the mystical meaning of the 216 letters and seventy-two words (section #116#). This is the mystical meaning of the <b>six letters</b> in the word <b><i>Bereshit</i>,</b> which already include the entire existence of heaven and earth in the mystical meaning of their six letters. However, they are still unknown because they are alluded to only through the letters, without any combinations of words. Afterwards, there are six words: <b><i>Bara Elohim et HaShamayim ve-et ha’aretz</i></b> [“God created the heavens and the earth”]. Here, [in this phrase, ] what is contained in the word <b><i>Bereshit</i></b> becomes revealed, for they are the heavens and the earth and all that fills them.
In this manner we must understand the <b>six verses</b> from <b>“the heavens declare”</b> until <b>“the Torah of the Lord is perfect.”</b> This is still the beginning of the revelation of the completion of the rectification, that is, when it is still in the form of letters, similar to the <b>six letters</b> in the word <b><i>Bereshit</i>.</b> The full revelation of the completion of the rectification starts from <b>“the Torah of the Lord is perfect”</b> and onward, where there are <b>six names,</b> such that each name indicates [a certain level of] attainment. This shows that only after the full repentance, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And <b>there is nothing hidden from its heat”</b> [Psalms 19:7], all the combination of words that were in the great fusion of the completion of the rectification will then be revealed, that is, the <b>six names.</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“With regard to this secret it is written <i>Bereshit</i>, which consists of six letters; ‘God created the heavens and the earth’ are six words.”</b> With respect to the mystical meaning of those six verses and six names, the Torah writes six <b>letters</b> in <i>Bereshit</i>, within which heaven and earth are concealed. In the six words they are revealed: <b><i>Bara Elohim et HaShamayim ve-et ha’aretz</i>.</b> Likewise, in the six verses from <b>“the heavens declare” until “the Torah of the Lord is perfect,”</b> the great fusion of the completion of the rectification has not been revealed in its clarity. It is only subsequently, after the verse: <b>“And there is nothing hidden from its heat,”</b> that the <b>six names</b> were revealed. In those six names the entirety of the great revelation of the completion of the rectification comes to its fullest and complete state.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The other verses correspond to the six times <i>Havaya</i>,”</b> that is, the <b>six names</b> of <i>Havaya</i>. The verses written after “and there is nothing hidden from its heat,” until the end of the psalm, allude to the <b>six names</b> that are written in them. It follows that <b>“the six verses are on account of the six letters here; the six names are on account of the six words here.”</b> This is as explained, that the six verses from <b>“the heavens declare” until “the Torah of the Lord is perfect,”</b> are like the <b>six letters of <i>Bereshit</i>,</b> which are not fully revealed, while the <b>six names</b> that are written from <b>“the Torah of the Lord is perfect”</b> until the end are like the six words: <b><i>Bara Elohim et HaShamayim ve-et ha’aretz</i>,</b> which here have come to their complete state. He is teaching us that in the case of the <b>six verses</b> their level is not yet known, and they are like the <b>six letters</b> of <b><i>Bereshit</i>.</b> However, after the six verses, in <b>“the other verses,”</b> in which there are <b>six names,</b> they achieve the desired revelation.

Paragraph 146

<b>146. “While they were sitting, etc.”</b><br><b>While they were sitting, his son Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba entered. [Rabbi Shimon] said to them, certainly, the face of the Divine Presence has come, and this is why I called you Peniel</b> (as stated in section #119# above), which has the letters of <i>penei El</i> [“face of God”], <b>for you saw the face of the Divine Presence face-to-face</b> [see Genesis 32:31]. <b>And now that you know, and he has revealed to you the verse involving Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, it must certainly be a word of the holy <i>Atik</i>,</b> which is the mystical meaning of the <i>Keter</i>. <b>And likewise the subsequent verse: “And he slew an Egyptian”</b> [II Samuel 23:21]. [<b>Regarding] that which is the most sealed away of all, they said that</b> is the holy <i>Atik</i>.
Explanation: This is referring back to the episode of the donkey driver, who revealed the soul of <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba, on account of which Rabbi Shimon called them Peniel (section #119# above). The soul of <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> is this very height that will be revealed in the future, at the completion of the rectification, as stated there. For this reason, [Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Abba] too experienced the covering and concealment of all the supernal lights (as stated in section #113# above), as stated here [in the preceding sections] with regard to the fusion of the circuit of the sun at the time of the year, until they reached Rabbi Shimon, son of Lakunya and saw Rabbi Shimon there, at which point they merited all the lights once again, as stated there.
This is the meaning of Rabbi Shimon’s statement to them here: <b>“And now that you know, and he has revealed to you the verse involving Benayahu Ben Yehoyada.”</b> He hinted to them that they have already merited the <b>six verses</b> of “the heavens declare,” and they are already at the <b>six names</b> in the other verses, since the soul of <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> has already been openly revealed to them. When they attained the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada by means of <b>“that donkey driver,”</b> their apprehension [of that soul] was still unrevealed, since at that time they were in the mystical meaning of <b>six verses,</b> and this is why they underwent that path of miracles and signs. Now, however, the soul of Benayahu was openly revealed to them, and [Rabbi Shimon] thus states: <b>“And now that you know, and he has revealed to you the verse involving Benayahu Ben Yehoyada.”</b>
Thus [Rabbi Shimon] says: <b>“It must certainly be a word of the holy <i>Atik</i>, and likewise the subsequent verse.”</b> The soul of <b>Benayahu Ben Yehoyada</b> is the mystical meaning of the <b>“word of the <i>Atik</i>,”</b> that is, the great fusion of <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which they <b>knew</b> then as well. Now, however, [they] also know <b>the subsequent verse,</b> that <b>“he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab</b> etc.” [II Samuel 23:20], <b>“and he slew an Egyptian</b> etc.” All those verses are also the word of the <i>Atik</i>. <b>“And they said that that one, which is the most obscure of all”</b> meaning <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which is the <b>most obscure of all.</b>

Paragraph 147

<b>147. “This verse, etc.”</b><br><b>This verse,</b> “and he slew an Egyptian,” <b>is explained elsewhere,</b> that is, on another level, <b>in a similar manner. He began</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall”</b> [I Chronicles 11:23]. <b>It is all one mystical meaning. This Egyptian is that known one,</b> about whom it is stated: <b>“Very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the eyes of the people etc.”</b> [Exodus 11:3], <b>for he was great and distinguished, as that old man had revealed</b> (section #99# above).
Explanation: That verse, which Rav Hamnuna Saba had interpreted, namely <b>“and he slew an Egyptian, a man of appearance</b> etc.” [II Samuel 23:21], is explained on another level in a different manner, that is, in accordance with the version that appears in Chronicles, as [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain.
<b>“And he slew an Egyptian,</b> etc.”; <b>it is all one mystical meaning.</b> The two verses are one mystical meaning, for it is written (in II Samuel 23): <b>“And he slew an Egyptian, a man of appearance,”</b> and here in Chronicles it is stated: <b>“And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall.”</b> They are both one mystical meaning, which refers to Moses. As for the differences in wording, this will be explained below.

Paragraph 148

<b>148. “This verse was taught, etc.”</b><br><b>This verse was taught in the supernal yeshiva. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A "yeshiva" is a Torah study hall.</i> “A man of great measure”; it is all one. “A man of vision” and “a man of great stature</b> [<i>mida</i>]”; <b>it is all one, since he is Shabbat and the</b> Shabbat <b>boundary, as it is stated: “And you shall measure</b> [<i>u-madotem</i>] <b>outside the city”</b> [Numbers 35:5], <b>and it is stated: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measurement</b> [<i>be-mida</i>,” Leviticus 19:35]. <b>Accordingly, he is “a man of great measure</b> [<i>mida</i>].” <b>And he is truly a man of great measure: His length stretches from one end of the world to the other. This was</b> [the case for] <b>Adam the first</b> [man]. <b>And if you say: “But it is written, ‘five cubits tall, ’” these five cubits stretched from one end of the world to the other.</b>
Explanation: This is the yeshiva of the Holy One, blessed be He. It is with regard to the students of this yeshiva that Rabbi Shimon said: “I have seen the men of ascent, and they are few” (<i>Sukka</i> 45b). There is also a yeshiva below, which is the yeshiva of Metatron. [Rabbi Shimon] says that <b>this verse,</b> which the [Rav Hamnuna] Saba interpreted, was clarified in <b>the supernal yeshiva,</b> as explained here.
<b>“A man of vision”</b> refers to the level of Moses, about whom it is stated: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:10), and which is the mystical meaning of the verse: “In a vision, and not in riddles” (Numbers 12:8). <b>“A man of great measure</b> [<i>mida</i>] also refers to the mystical meaning of the vision [<i>mareh</i>], but [specifically] to the mystical meaning of the measure of that vision, since the mystical meaning of the measure of that vision is from one end of the world to the other.
Vision and measure are similar to Shabbat and the Shabbat boundary, for the Shabbat boundary is the edge of the measure of Shabbat. However, during the six thousand years [of this world] the measure of the Shabbat boundary is restricted to a mere two thousand cubits. After the completion of the rectification, the Shabbat boundary will be from one end of the world to the other, which is the mystical meaning of: “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth” (Zechariah 14:9).
[Rabbi Shimon] thus states: <b>“A man of vision and a man of great measure; it is all one, since he is the Shabbat and the boundary, as it is stated: ‘And you shall measure outside the city, ’ and it is stated: ‘You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measurement. ’”</b> Thus, the concept of a measure is the edge of the boundary of something. Accordingly, <b>a man of measure</b> indicates the edge of the Shabbat boundary after the completion of the rectification, which is from one end of the world to the other. [Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“And he is truly a man of great measure.”</b> A man of great measure means the master of that measure, that is, the measure does not rule over him, but rather he rules over the measure and executes it in accordance with his will and desire. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As the next paragraph explains, the "measure" refers to the vessels of the "man, " the first man whose soul vessels corresponded to the <i>sefirot</i>. These vessels serve to limit us (as in the concept of boundaries explained here), but a master of these vessels (a level we will reach after the completion of the rectification) knows how to use them in accordance with his will.</i>
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“This was</b> [the case for] <b>Adam the first</b> [man],” that is, before he sinned with the tree of [the knowledge of] good and evil. [Before the sin] his length stretched from one end of the world to the other (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 12a), and he illuminated from one end of the world to the other, like the measure of the Shabbat boundary after the completion of the rectification. 
<b>“These five cubits stretched from one end of the world to the other,”</b> for these <b>five cubits</b> are the mystical meaning of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, which are essentially only <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> (as stated above in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, section #1#, second paragraph; see there). They will spread from one end of the world to the other after the completion of the rectification.

Paragraph 149

<b>149. “And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, etc.”</b><br><b>“And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand”</b> [II Samuel 23:21], <b>this is like when it states: “Like a weaver’s beam”</b> [I Samuel 17:7], <b>which is the staff of God that was in his hand</b> [see Exodus 17:9]. <b>It was carved with the engraved and explicit name, through the illumination of the letter combinations, as engraved by Bezalel and his yeshiva, which is called “weaver,” as is stated: “He has filled them etc. of the craftsman and of the skillful workman and of the weaver in colors</b> [and in fine linen, and of the weaver,” Exodus 35:35]. <b>And</b> [regarding] <b>that staff, the name that was engraved on it would illuminate in all directions, through the light of the wise ones who engraved the explicit Name in forty-two aspects. The verses from here onward are as</b> the elderly man <b>explained above; happy is his portion.</b>
Explanation: The mystical meaning of the letter combinations for the holy names are called acts of <b>“weaving.”</b> Like a weaver who weaves threads into a garment, the letters join and combine into words of the holy names, which means [the achievement of] holy [spiritual] attainments. [Rabbi Shimon] says that with <b>the staff of God</b> that was in Moses’ hand, those letter combinations of the explicit Name were <b>engraved,</b> for <b>Bezalel and his yeshiva</b> engraved them in the work of the Tabernacle. This is why <b>the staff of God</b> is called <b>“a weaver’s beam,”</b> after <b>Bezalel</b>, who was called <b>“a weaver.”</b> A <b>“beam [<i>manor</i>]”</b> is like an illumination [<i>ma’or</i>], while the weaver is <b>Bezalel,</b> implying that the illumination of the letter combinations of the explicit name was of the aspect of the illumination of the explicit name that Bezalel engraved. This is why he states: <b>“Through the illumination of the letter combinations, as was as engraved by Bezalel and his yeshiva, which is called ‘weaver’</b> etc.”
Now, before the completion of the rectification the staff did not illuminate from all sides, since there was a difference between it, between the staff of God and the staff of Moses. With regard to Moses’ staff, it is stated: “Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail […] and it became a rod in his hand” [Exodus 4:4]. [This shows] that it did not illuminate from all sides. However, after the completion of the rectification it illuminates from all sides.
[Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>"And</b> [regarding] <b>that staff, the name that was engraved on it would illuminate in all directions, through the light of the wise ones who engraved the explicit Name in forty-two aspects. "</b> The explicit name that was engraved in the staff illuminated <b>on all sides,</b> that is, in [an expression of] the aspect of “He will eliminate death forever” [Isaiah 25:8]. Accordingly, it illuminated equally on all sides, and the light of the name that was engraved on the staff was in the mystical meaning of the illumination of the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the name of forty-two [letters].

Paragraph 150

<b>150. “Sit down, dear ones, sit down,” etc.”</b><br><b>Sit down, dear ones, sit down, and we will renew the rectification of the bride on this night. Anyone who bonds with her on this night will be protected throughout that whole year, above and below, and he will complete his year in peace. With regard to them, it is stated: “The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and delivers them. Taste and see that the Lord is good”</b> [Psalms 34:8-9].
Explanation: There are two interpretations of this, both of which are true (see section #125#, above). The same is true regarding the phrase <b>“will complete his year in peace.”</b> According to the first interpretation, as cited there, this should be understood by its plain meaning. The day of the Giving of the Torah is of the aspect of an illumination of [the light of] the completion of the rectification, when “He will eliminate death forever” [Isaiah 25:8] and there is freedom from the angel of death. Therefore, it is fitting to make the effort to draw this light at its proper time, on the day of Shavuot. This is because it is the nature of lights that they are renewed in their special time. He will thus be assured even now that he will complete his year in peace and he will have freedom from the angel of death.
According to the second interpretation mentioned there, that it is referring to the actual time of the completion of the rectification [and not just an illumination of it], the meaning of <b>“will complete his year in peace”</b> is as follows: The <i>Malkhut</i> is called a “year,” and [thus] on account of the renewal of the lights of those who preserve the Torah after the completion of the rectification, a person will be guaranteed to rectify the ["year, "] which is <i>Malkhut</i>, in all its totality. The renewal of the lights of those who preserve the Torah is called “the rectification of the night of the bride,” which is <i>Malkhut</i>, called “a year,” as stated there. In this manner, <b>“he will complete his year in peace</b> [<i>shalom</i>],” in total completion [<i>shelemut</i>], as explained.

Paragraph 151

<b>151. “Rabbi Shimon opened,” etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “In the beginning God created”</b> [Genesis 1:1]. <b>This verse requires examination. Anyone who says that there is another god perishes from the world, as it is stated: “Thus you shall say to them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens”</b> [Jeremiah 10:11]. <b>Because there is no god other than the Holy One, blessed be He.</b>
Explanation: This refers back to his previous statement: “<b>Sit down, and we will renew the rectification of the bride”</b> [section #150#]. [Rabbi Shimon] thus began to explain thoroughly the verse: “In the beginning God created,” which is the root of all the rectifications of the bride during the six thousand years. [He] based himself on his earlier explanation (section #14#) that ["God"] is [referring to] the supernal <i>Elohim</i>, which is <i>Bina</i>. This is called <i>Elohim</i> in the mystical meaning of: <b>“<i>Mi</i></b> [who] has created <b><i>eleh</i></b> [these,” Isaiah 40:26]. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As in section #14#, "<i>mi</i>" and "<i>eleh</i>" form the letters of the word <i>elohim</i>, the name used here to refer to <i>Bina</i>.</i> And just as <i>Mi</i> partnered with <i>eleh</i>, so too this name is always in partnership [with existence], and through this secret the world is sustained; see there in detail.
With this [explanation] in mind, [Rabbi Shimon] explains here that <b>“the gods that have not made the heavens</b> etc.” The Holy One, blessed be He, is the <i>Bina</i> that is called <b><i>Elohim</i>,</b> in the mystical meaning of the partnering of <b><i>Mi</i></b> with <b><i>eleh</i></b>. [This is effected] by means of the enclothing of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the precious garment that shines with the [the light of giving], as stated above, which is the secret through which the world is sustained. Therefore, “<b>the gods</b> [<i>elahaya</i>] <b>that have not made the heavens and the earth,”</b> and which could not give sustenance to the world, that is, the foreign gods which separate <b><i>eleh</i></b> from <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> must certainly perish <b>“from under the heavens,”</b> [heavens] which are rectified by connecting <b><i>eleh</i></b> with <b><i>Mi</i>.</b> The force [of these foreign gods] can never bring sustenance to the world, but only destruction. This is why the verse emphasizes: <b>“And from under these</b> [<i>eleh</i>] <b>heavens,”</b> and this is why he states [at the start of the next section]: <b>“This verse is a translation, apart from the word at the end of the verse,”</b> that is, <i>eleh</i>, for this represents that bonding of <b><i>Mi</i></b> with <b><i>eleh</i>,</b> as he proceeds to explain.

Paragraph 152

<b>152. “This verse is,” etc.”</b><br><b>This verse is a translation, except for the word</b> <i>eleh</i> <b>at the end of the verse. You might say that this is because the holy angels do not listen to translation,</b> that is, to the Aramaic language, <b>and are not familiar with it.</b> But if so, then the opposite is the case – <b>he should have said this word in the Holy Tongue, so that the holy angels would hear.</b> They would listen <b>in order to give thanks for it.</b> [Rabbi Shimon] responds: <b>Rather, this is certainly the reason why it is written in translation: Because the holy angels will not listen to it, and they will not envy a person and harm him. For the holy angels are included in this verse, since they are also called “gods</b> [<i>elohim</i>].” <b>They are included in “the gods” and they did not make the heavens and the earth.</b>
Explanation: In order to understand this, [one must know that] the language of the Aramaic translation is similar to the Holy Tongue, and yet the angels do not relate to it and do not know it, whereas they do relate to and know the rest of the languages of the nations of the world. The reason is that the language of the Aramaic translation is the mystical meaning of the “back” of the Holy Tongue, that is, it is an expression of the six extremities of the Holy Tongue. [Anything of the aspect of] the six extremities is called the “back” and “deep sleep,” without the brains which are the [the aspects of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. Accordingly, the [Aramaic] translation is in fact very similar to the Holy Tongue. However, there is another reason here why the angels do not relate to it: The mystical meaning of the Holy Tongue [<i>lashon</i>] is that it is the language that directs toward the middle, [clothing <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the light of giving. [Accordingly, it is] the fulcrum [<i>lashon</i>] of the scale that tips the scale of merits over liabilities, returning everything to holiness. This is why it is called “the Holy Tongue” [<i>lashon ha-kodesh</i>].
You can understand the mystical meaning of the scales based on what we said above (sections #16-18#): <b>“The heavens and their hosts were created with <i>Ma</i></b> etc. <b>and ‘In the beginning, <i>Elohim</i> created’ is the supernal <i>Elohim</i>, for <i>Ma</i> is not so, and was not constructed. But when these letters, <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>], <b>are drawn forth from above to below – for the mother lends her garments to the daughter</b> etc. <b>‘These</b> [<i>eleh</i>] <b>things I remember’</b> [Psalms 42:5] – <b>I hereby recall in my mouth, and I pour out tears with the desire of my soul, in order to draw forth these letters,</b> <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>. <b>Then ‘I will lead them’ from above ‘to the house of <i>Elohim</i>, ’ so that</b> [<i>Malkhut</i> ] <b>will be</b> [called] <b>‘<i>Elohim</i>’”</b> etc. See the commentary of the <i>Sulam</i> there, in detail.
Thus, with regard to the heavens and earth that were created with <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> the name of <b><i>Elohim</i></b> is not revealed in them, except by drawing forth the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> from the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i> [which is the female aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] by means of feminine waters and good deeds. This is as it is stated: <b>“‘These</b> [<i>eleh</i>] <b>things I remember’ – I hereby recall in my mouth, and I pour out tears</b> etc.” This is the mystical meaning of [the fact] that the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called <i>Elohim</i>, are not permanently [present] in [the levels of] heaven and earth, which are [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. When feminine waters are raised from below, <b><i>Ma</i></b> becomes <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> and the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> join with <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> [<i>Mi</i>], and thus the name <b><i>Elohim</i></b> is formed, which are the brains [of the level of] heaven and earth. But if the lower [beings] corrupt their deeds, the brains depart from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and remain [of the level of] <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the vessels, and <i>ruaḥ</i> and <i>nefesh</i> of the lights, which are called <b><i>Mi</i></b> or <b><i>Ma</i>.</b> The letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> then fall to the <i>kelippot</i>. This [falling to the <i>kelippot</i>] is because <b><i>Mi</i></b> is the mystical meaning of <i>gulgalta</i> and the eyes [which are the vessels of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i>], and <i>eleh</i> is the mystical meaning of the ears, nose, and mouth [which are the lower <i>sefirot</i> that now fall to the <i>kelippot</i>] (as stated above; see there in detail).
Thus, the entire rectification depends on the connecting of the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> with <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> [which spells <i>elohim</i>]<b>,</b> by means of feminine waters. This is why this rectification is called “the Holy Tongue,” which is the mystical meaning of the fulcrum of the scale that directs toward the middle and through which the brains, which are called “holiness,” are drawn down. This [Holy Tongue] extends the holy name <i>Elohim</i> to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and tips the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> to the side [of the scale] of merit, of holiness. The [Holy Tongue] is called <i>moznayim</i> [scales] from the word <i>ozen</i> [ear], for the lights of the ears, nose, and mouth are named after their highest expression, which is <i>ozen</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The lower vessels of the higher lights represented by the three letters of the word <i>elohim</i> (<i>alef-lamed-heh</i>) are pulled back to the side of holiness through the Holy Tongue. The highest vessel of these three letters which are called <i>ozen</i>-<i>ḥotem</i>-<i>peh</i> (ear-nose-mouth) is the <i>ozen</i> (ear) so the tilting scale returning these lights and vessels is called <i>moznayim</i>, which is derived from the word <i>ozen</i> (ear).</i>
In contrast to [the Holy Tongue], there is the language of <b>the Aramaic translation.</b> When the lower [beings] do not raise feminine waters in purity, they are regarded as wishing to hold onto the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> alone, without connecting them to the name <b><i>Mi</i></b> which is <i>Bina</i>. This reveals the backside of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which is the mystical meaning of <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> as stated, and the heavens and earth, which are [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, return to [being] an aspect of six extremities. <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is a lower state, lacking the higher brains achieved when <i>Ma</i> becomes <i>Mi</i> and the letters forming the word <i>elohim</i> are combined. This lower state of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> is a state of "backside" because it lacks the light of the first three <i>sefirot</i>.</i> This [state in which there is only the six extremities] is the language of the Aramaic translation. You can thereby understand why <b><i>tardema</i></b> [“deep sleep”] has the same numerical value as <b><i>targum</i></b> [“translation”]. It is also the letters of <b><i>tered Ma</i></b> [“<i>Ma</i> will descend”], since through this [translation] language, which is not in a state of purity (in the manner of “<b>I hereby recall in my mouth</b> etc.”), the backside, which is the mystical meaning of <b><i>Ma</i></b>, is revealed. This is the mystical meaning of <b><i>tered Ma</i>.</b> The result is that the scales descend and come to the scale of deficiency.
All of this relates to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> which are the heaven and earth that <b>“were created with <i>Ma</i>.”</b> [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] emerged from the “fusion of foundations,” which is called <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> as stated above. The holy angels, however, emerged from the “fusion of kisses” of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>] and have nothing of <b><i>Ma</i></b> in them, but only <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> which is the higher world, [which is] <i>Bina</i>. Thus, on the one hand [the level of these angels] is for this reason always only of the six extremities without the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. On the other hand, their six extremities is the light of giving of the higher [level, the level of] <i>Bina</i>, <b><i>Mi</i>.</b> [The lights from this higher level] are considered like a true set of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and [yet] do not require [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, like the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i> [aspect of <i>Bina</i>], and therefore they are holy, since the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] are called “holiness,” as is known. <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that these angels emerge from a higher level, the level of <i>Mi</i>, and therefore are considered holy, untouched by the same dynamics of the vessels of <i>alef-lamed-heh</i> mentioned previously. This dynamic involves the level of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, and not the higher level of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> from which the angels emerged.</i>
Consequently, the angels are not at all impacted by the language of the Aramaic translation that reveals the aspect of <b><i>Ma</i></b> in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and restores them back to the [level of the] six extremities. This is for two reasons: 1) Even when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> have [brains of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] from the [aspect of] Holy Tongue, the [angels] do not receive the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, since [the angels] desire only the light of giving, like the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i> [aspect of <i>Bina</i>]. 2) The revelation of the backside of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> in the level of] <b><i>Ma</i></b> does not concern the [angels], because there is nothing of <b><i>Ma</i></b> in [those angels, which derive from the level of <i>Mi</i>].
This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“The holy angels do not listen to the translation and are not familiar with it.”</b> They have no need because they do not lose anything on account of it, nor do they gain anything from its departure, since in any case [the angels] are only of the level of six extremities. <b>“And are not familiar with it,”</b> for there is nothing of this aspect of <b><i>Ma</i></b> in them at all (with this in mind, you can understand what is written about this regard, in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Lekh Lekha</i>, from 289-295).
<b>“And they will not envy a person and harm him</b> etc.” The main thrust of this verse is to curse foreign gods that disrupt the revelation of the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. For this reason, these [foreign gods] must perish from the earth and from under these [<i>eleh</i>] heavens. [Additionally, ] since the angels also lack [a set of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> and only [possess] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of the light of giving, the [angels] will accordingly sense the degradation of their level [in comparison to ours, which has access to the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] and will envy us for thinking so highly of ourselves.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“They are also called ‘gods. ’ They are included in ‘the gods’ and they did not make the heavens and the earth.”</b> The [angels] are called “gods [<i>elohim</i>]” because they are drawn from the <i>Imma Ila'ah</i> which is called <i>Elokim</i> [and is <i>Bina</i>], and therefore “they are included in ‘the gods. ’” <b>“And they did not make the heavens and the earth”</b> because [these angels] too cannot sustain the heaven and the earth through [the light of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and there is no sustaining of heaven and earth for human habitation through [the sowing of] seed and harvest other than through the brains of [the light of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Thus, [these angels that are only of the light of giving] also <b>did not make the heavens and the earth.</b>

Paragraph 153

<b>153. “<i>Ve-arka</i>, but shouldn’t it have said <i>ve-ar’a</i>, etc.”</b><br>[Rabbi Shimon] asks: The verse states <b>“<i>ve-arka</i>”</b> [“and the earth,” Jeremiah 10:11], <b>but shouldn’t it have said <i>ve-ar’a</i></b> [the usual Aramaic word for “earth”]? He answers: <b>It is because <i>arka</i> is one of seven lands below, and in that place there are the descendants of the descendants of Cain. After</b> [Cain] <b>was expelled from upon the face of the earth, he descended there, produced offspring, and</b> his mind was <b>confused</b> [<i>ishtabesh</i>] <b>there,</b> [meaning] <b>that he did not know anything. It is a doubled land, doubled with darkness and light.</b> <i>Ishtabesh</i> means confused, for the term “branches” (Genesis 40:12) is translated into Aramaic as <i>shivshin</i>, and because the branches of a vine are intertwined and intermingled with one another, the word was borrowed to [express] the language of confusion and entanglement.
Explanation: The lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] are incorporated in one another, and in each of the [individual <i>sefirot</i>] there are [again] seven <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>. [Similarly, all seven] are also found in <i>Malkhut</i>. This is the mystical meaning of: “And similarly, in the lower land there are seven lands,” which are <b><i>eretz</i>; <i>adama</i>; <i>arka</i>; <i>gai</i>; <i>nashya</i>; <i>tziya</i>;</b> and <b><i>tevel</i>.</b> Our earth is <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> which is the highest of the seven lands, while <b><i>arka</i></b> is the third among the seven lands.
Now, the souls of Cain and Abel were drawn from the name <b><i>Elohim</i>,</b> but due to the contamination with which the serpent infected Eve, the soul of Cain emerged first, from the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> after which Abel emerged from the letters <b><i>mem-yod</i>.</b> The [two of them] should have been included in one another in mercy, and then the name <b><i>Elohim</i></b> would have rested on both of them together, just as <b><i>Mi</i></b> is always combined with <b><i>eleh</i></b> in the mystical meaning of the name <b><i>Elohim</i>,</b> as stated. However, the contamination of the serpent that emerged with the soul of Cain caused him to slander his brother Abel, who is the mystical meaning of <b><i>Mi</i></b> of <i>Elohim</i>, until “[Cain] rose up against [Abel his brother] and slew him” [Genesis 4:8]. [Cain] caused the removal of the letters <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> from <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the killing of Abel. Then <b><i>eleh</i>,</b> which is the aspect of [Cain] himself, fell to the <i>kelippot</i>.
[Rabbi Shimon] thus states that <b>“he was expelled from upon the face of the earth,”</b> since he fell from the land of holiness, and <b>“he descended there,”</b> to <i>arka</i>, which is the place of the <i>kelippot</i>. <b>“He produced offspring, and</b> [his mind was] <b>confused there,</b> [meaning] <b>that he did not know anything,”</b> for he produced offspring under the control of the <i>kelippot</i>, and therefore the Holy Tongue in his mouth became <b>confused</b> into the language of the [Aramaic] translation. <b>“He did not know anything,”</b> because he had lost the aspect of <i>Da'at</i>, since the <i>kelippot</i> lack <i>Da'at</i>, due to the fact that the [<i>kelippot</i>] have only <i>brains</i> of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, without <i>Da'at</i>.
The idea of the killing of Abel is as stated above (in section #152#), that only through the power of feminine waters in purity is <b><i>Mi</i></b> drawn down to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. Afterwards, the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> are drawn back, and the name <i>Elohim</i> is completed in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> as well, like [it already is] in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. Then the <i>Nukba</i> is also completed with male garments, like the [<i>Imma Ila'ah</i> aspect of <i>Bina</i>], in the mystical meaning of the departure of the letter <b><i>heh</i></b> and its replacement by a <i>yod</i> (as stated in section #17# above).
This does not mean that the letter <b><i>heh</i></b> of <b><i>Ma</i></b> of <i>Nukba</i> is removed entirely. Rather, the <b><i>heh</i></b> enters the interiority of the <i>Nukba</i> into concealment, while the <b><i>yod</i></b> of <b><i>Mi</i></b> is exposed on the outside. In this manner, the holy name of <i>Elohim</i> resides in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> as well, which are heaven and earth. However, Cain raised impure feminine waters and he wanted to strengthen the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of his own aspect, for his own benefit. This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“Cain rose up against Abel his brother,”</b> because he raised himself through dominion over <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> which is his brother Abel. Then the backside of the <i>Nukba</i> was immediately revealed, which is the <b><i>heh</i></b> of <b><i>Ma</i></b> that was in concealment, and the name <b><i>Mi</i></b> departed from the <i>Nukba</i>. As a consequence, the soul of Abel, which was drawn from the <b><i>Mi</i></b> of the <i>Nukba</i>, also departed to above, and therefore he <b>“slew him.”</b>
This is the mystical meaning of the statement of the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Bereshit</i> II, 241): “When Cain killed Abel etc. he bit him with his teeth like the serpent”; see there. This is as we stated, that the contamination of the serpent was within [Cain], for which reason [Cain] wished to strengthen the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> and to nullify the <b><i>Mi</i></b> and subdue [Abel] under himself. [Cain] therefore revealed the backside, which is the [aspect of] <b><i>Ma</i></b> in the <i>Nukba</i>, and the <b><i>Mi</i></b> departed from <i>Nukba</i>. As a result, the soul of Abel that is drawn from [the <i>Mi</i>] departed and [Cain] <b>“slew him,”</b> while Cain himself, who is <b><i>eleh</i>,</b> fell under the domain of the <i>kelippot</i>, which are <b><i>arka</i>,</b> called <b>“the land of Nod”</b> in the Bible, as it states: “And he dwelled in the land of Nod” (Genesis 4:16).
[Rabbi Shimon] thus concludes: <b>“It is a doubled land, doubled with darkness and light. And there are two appointed angels there”</b> [see next section], because light and darkness operate as a mixture there, without boundaries between them, because there are two appointed angels there who equally control this land. One of them is appointed over the darkness, and he sets the darkness there, while the other is appointed over the light, and he sets the light there.

Paragraph 154

<b>154. “And there are two controlling officials there, etc.”</b><br><b>And there are two appointed ruling</b> [angels] <b>there who rule, one over darkness and the other over light. They were hostile toward one another. At the time that Cain descended there they joined with each other and became united as one. Everyone saw that they were Cain’s offspring. Therefore they have two heads, like two serpents, except when the official that rules over the light is in control,</b> [as then] <b>he is victorious over his own,</b> that is, the light, <b>and is victorious over the other</b> official, the one appointed over the darkness. <b>Consequently, those in the darkness were incorporated into those in the light and</b> [they] <b>became one.</b>
Explanation: In order to understand this, it is necessary to delve further into the issue of Cain and Abel in greater depth. It has already been explained (section #14#, above) that during the emergence of the holy name <i>Elohim</i>, the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> first ascend and join <b><i>mem-yod</i>,</b> in a state of the concealed name, since they lack the light of giving. The holiness, which is [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, cannot be enclothed in the [structure of these letters forming this concealed name] without a garment of the light of giving. [These letters] are therefore concealed [in their structure of] the name <i>Elohim</i>. Subsequently, a second [fusion through collision] is performed in <b><i>Mi</i></b> to draw out [a height of] the light of giving, such that now <i>Ḥokhma</i> is enclothed in the light of giving and the name <i>Elohim</i> is complete. As stated there, this is the mystical meaning of: <b>“Who</b> [<i>Mi</i>] <b>has created these</b> [<i>eleh</i>],” [Isaiah 40:26], because He created light for His light, that is, the precious garment of the light of giving, and enclothed [the light of  <i>Ḥokhma</i>] in the [light of giving], and thus <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> joined with <i>mem-yod</i>, and <i>Elohim</i> was complete.
The explanation is that in <i>Mi</i>, which is <i>Bina</i>, there are [a set of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. They were established in the mystical meaning of “pure air” [<i>avira dakhia</i>] in the mystical meaning of: “Because He delights in mercy” [Micah 7:18] [which refers to the light of giving], and they do not receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Only the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> [forming the <i>partzuf</i> called] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Therefore, at the beginning of the ascent of the letters <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> to <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> they ascend to the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <b><i>Mi</i></b> that receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and then they are [in the] concealed [form] in the name <i>Elohim,</i> as stated. However, afterwards there occurs the second [fusion through collision] of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> which are <b>“</b>pure air,” and [these first three <i>sefirot</i>] bestow the precious garment [which is the light of giving] that shines for <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>, and then [the letters] are completed in the holy name <b><i>Elohim</i>.</b>
The soul of Cain was from <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> [of the aspect of] when they are still in a state of concealment in the name, and therefore the holiness, which is <i>Ḥokhma</i>, was concealed for him due to the lack of a garment of the [light of giving]. Yet not only did he fail to raise feminine waters to draw the <b><i>Mi</i></b> of the [light of giving], but he also wished to draw <i>Ḥokhma</i> from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>. As a result, he killed Abel, for he uncovered the backside of the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as stated. He himself dropped his soul to the <i>kelippot</i> of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> and the place of these <i>kelippot</i> is in <b><i>arka</i></b> [which is the level of the land described in the previous sections]<b>.</b>
The concept of the two appointed [angels] that are there is [that they] are from the <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippot</i>, since <b>“God made one thing corresponding to the other”</b> [Ecclesiastes 7:14]. As explained above, the <i>Nukba</i> possesses a backside [of the aspect] of <b><i>Ma</i></b> in a concealed state, and of the aspect of <b><i>Mi</i></b> in a revealed state. [In this state, the <i>Nukba</i>] can then illuminate to the souls using the holy name <i>Elohim</i> in complete fullness. [This is] because the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> which [the <i>Nukba</i>] received from the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> are then enclothed in the light of giving of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> and [as a result] the holy name is revealed.
However, in the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, whose entire suckling [of divine light] is from the backside of holiness, which is <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> have two deficiencies: 1) They lack the light of giving entirely; 2) Even the <i>Ḥokhma</i> in <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> cannot be enclothed there, due to the lack of the light of giving of <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> and therefore they reside in darkness rather than in light.
This is the male of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i>, for its vessels are vessels of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which are <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> but [these vessels] are devoid of <i>Ḥokhma</i> on account of the lack of the light of giving of <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> such that [this male aspect] is entirely dark, from both the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and the light of giving. Nevertheless, [this male aspect] is of a high caliber in terms of the power of its vessels, for [these vessels] would be fit for <i>Ḥokhma</i>, were it possible for the [male aspect] to receive a garment of the light of giving. The <i>Nukba</i> of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i> is from the backside of the [aspect of] <b><i>Ma</i></b> of the <i>Nukba</i> of holiness, which is a vessel of the light of giving. But [in this <i>kelippa</i> version, the <i>Nukba</i>] is very flawed, and [this <i>Nukba</i>] is the root of separation which falsifies in the name of the King. This [<i>Nukba</i>] contains many names of impurity in accordance with its corruptions. However, [this <i>Nukba</i>] has a thin light as a result of the power of its vessels, which are from the backside of <b><i>Ma</i>,</b> [and these vessels] at their root are vessels of the light of giving.
Know that these male and female [aspects] of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i> are the two appointed [angels] in the land of <i>arka</i>: The male is appointed over the darkness, while the female is appointed over the light there. Therefore, they are hostile to one another because they are the opposites of each other. The male, because he contains the empty vessels of <i>Ḥokhma</i> from the letters of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> hates the power of falsification and separation in the vessels of his <i>Nukba</i> and prefers the darkness within himself. The female, who has the thin light from the light of giving, has no desire for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> whatsoever, much less the darkness of the male, and therefore she is hostile toward him and flees from him.
[Rabbi Shimon] thus states: <b>“Two appointed ruling</b> [angels] <b>there who rule, one over darkness and the other over light. They were hostile toward one another.”</b> The male rules over darkness and the female over light, and they are hostile towards one another and hate each other. Since they remain separate from each other, they are unable to spread at all, and they do not have the power to cause harm.
However, after Cain sinned and caused the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of holiness in his soul to fall to the <i>kelippot</i> in <i>arka</i>, his letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> which were also blocked from the light of giving, became enclothed in the light of the <i>Nukba</i> of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i>. [Through this enclothing] small sparks of the aspect of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that remained in Cain’s vessels of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> were thereby revived, as the light of the evil <i>kelippa</i> revived them like the light of giving of holiness. As a result, the male of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i> also mated with this <i>Nukba</i> that enclothed the <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of Cain, for [that male aspect] also possessed those same vessels of Cain. Through this mating, Cain begot offspring, which [emerged] from the sparks of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that remained in those letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of his that were mingled with the vessels of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the male of the <i>kelippa</i>, and which became enclothed in the light of the evil <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>.
This is why [Rabbi Shimon] states that <b>“when Cain descended there they joined with each other and were completed as one,”</b> since the sparks of <i>Ḥokhma</i> that remained in the <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of Cain became enclothed in the light of the female of the <i>kelippa</i>. As a result, the male of the <i>kelippa</i> also desired her, in order to receive and enjoy Cain’s sparks of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>.</b> They mated with each other, that is, they joined with each other <b>as one,</b> and were completed through one another <b>as one.</b> [Rabbi Shimon] continues: <b>“And everyone saw that they were Cain’s offspring,”</b> [meaning that] the union produced offspring, which were of the aspect of the enclothing of Cain’s sparks of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> in the light of the <i>kelippa</i>. The sparks of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of Cain’s soul were thereby revealed, and everyone saw that they were <b>Cain’s offspring,</b> born from that evil coupling.
<b>“Therefore they have two heads, like two serpents.”</b> Since the [offspring] emerged from the bonding of the male and female of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i>, who are opposites from their roots, as stated, therefore the offspring that Cain bore with the help [of the <i>kelippa</i>] have the same two heads as those two <i>kelippot</i>: One leans toward the darkness of vessels of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, while the other leans toward the light in the vessels of impurity of the <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>.
[Rabbi Shimon] says that they are <b>“like two serpents”</b> because they are the corresponding opposite of the two animals in the Divine Chariot, which are the <b>ox</b> and the <b>eagle,</b> as detailed below. 
Now, regarding his statement that they have two heads, this is the case only when the male dominates, meaning, the dominion of [his tending toward] the darkness. By means of his enclothing in the light of <i>Nukba</i>, in order to enjoy Cain’s sparks of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated, he thereby also maintains the dominion of his <i>Nukba</i> against his will, because he needs her light. Consequently, at that stage the offspring have two heads, one pulling one way while the other pulls the other way.
This is not the case for the <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>, for she does not need her male at all, since he does not give her anything, because he is all darkness, as stated. Therefore, when the <i>Nukba</i> governs and wishes to win with her impurity, she has complete control and leaves nothing of the aspect of the male. Then the two heads of Cain’s offspring also return to be one [since there is no aspect of the male].
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Except when the</b> [appointed one] <b>that rules over the light is in control. He is victorious over his own, and is victorious over the other.”</b> In other words, when the <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>, which is the mistress of the light, is in control, she strengthens herself in order to defeat the male, the other appointed one. <b>“He</b> [referring to the <i>Nukba</i>] <b>is victorious over his own,”</b> since the strength [of the <i>Nukba</i>] wins, <b>“and is victorious over the other”</b> as well, defeating the other appointed [angel], who is the male, because she completely triumphs over the male under her control. <b>“Consequently, those in the darkness were incorporated into those in the light and became one.”</b> As a result, the dominion of the male, which is darkness, is incorporated within the dominion of the female, which is the light, and the two heads become one.

Paragraph 155

<b>155. “Those two officials, etc.”</b><br><b>Those two officials</b> are called <b>Afrira and Kastimon, and their form is like the forms of the holy angels, with six wings. One has the form of an ox, while the other has the form of an eagle, and when they unite, they become the form of a man.</b>
Explanation: The male is called <b>Kastimon,</b> from the word <b><i>kosti</i>,</b> which means “destruction.” He is called this name because he is darkness and unfit for human habitation. The female is called <b>Afrira,</b> from the word <b><i>afar</i></b> [dust], which refers to something unfit for sowing [seeds]. She is called by this name to indicate that although she contains light, as stated, it is still not enough [to serve as a medium for] sowing and harvesting to provide nourishment for people.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] states that <b>their form is like the forms of the angels, with six wings.</b> This is because they are the corresponding opposites of the supernal angels, who have six wings corresponding to the [letter] <i>vav</i> [numerical value of six] of [the divine name] <b><i>Havaya</i></b>. [It is also] in order to distinguish them from the holy <i>ḥayot</i>, [a lower form of angel, ] who have only four wings, corresponding to the letters of the name <b><i>Adonai</i>.</b> This comes to indicate the stature of these <i>kelippot</i>, in that they are the corresponding [opposite] of the supernal holy angels.
Now, the male, <b>Kastimon, has the form of an ox,</b> which is the primordial clothing in which the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> dresses. This is as it is stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parashat Ki Tissa</i>, 57) that from wine dregs <b>there emerges one protesting accuser, the primordial damager. He is in the mystical meaning of the form of a man when he approaches to enter the holiness. Once he has moved away from there and wishes to descend to below, he seeks to be enclothed in a garment, in order to harm the world, and he and his chariots descend. That primordial garment that he takes is the form of an ox, the image of an ox. The first of the damagers of the four [primary damagers] is an ox.</b>
The meaning is as follows: The supernal brains are called “wine that delights God and people” [Judges 9:13]. At their bottom there is an aspect of dross, which is termed <b>“wine dregs. "</b> From this waste the original damager emerges to the world, which, while he is still connected to holiness, that is, to the sediments, he has <b>the form of a man.</b> However, when he descends to harm people, he enclothes himself in <b>the form of an ox.</b> Accordingly, the ox is the first of the four primary damagers [in Jewish laws of damages] [see <i>Bava Kamma</i> 2a].
This is why [Rabbi Shimon] says here that this <b>Kastimon</b> is the aspect of damager [and that he] has <b>the form of an ox.</b> It is to indicate that he is the root of all damagers that are called <b>“ox</b> of the <i>kelippa</i>.” [This damager category] is of the aspect of dross of the supernal brains of the holy name <i>Elohim</i>. As stated above, this is the aspect of <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of the <i>kelippa</i>, which corresponds to <i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i> of the name <i>Elohim</i> and exists as the dross and sediments that stand below them. Therefore, while [this Kastimon] was still connected to holiness he had <b>the form of a man,</b> because these brains of <i>Elohim</i> are the mystical meaning of the <b><i>tzelem</i></b> [“shape”; “image”] of a man, regarding whom it is written, <b>“For in the image</b> [<i>be-tzelem</i>] <b>of God</b> [<i>Elohim</i>] <b>He made man”</b> [Genesis 9:6]. However, when he separated from the holiness and descended to his place, which is the aforementioned <b><i>arka</i>,</b> he enclothed himself in the clothing of an ox.
His female in <b><i>arka</i></b> has <b>the form of an eagle,</b> due to her role of dropping human souls that fall under her control. <b><i>Nesher</i></b> [eagle] is from <i>neshirat</i> [“dropping of”] leaves from a tree. It is her task to wander through the world and cause people to experience nocturnal emissions, that is, to impair the holy covenant. On account of [this impairment] the souls fall off people (as stated in section #131#, above). [Rabbi Shimon] states that <b>“when they unite, they take on the form of a man,”</b> meaning that if they reconnect with [the aspect of] holiness, in order to be [positioned again] as of the aspect of sediment under the wine, they return to <b>take on the form of a man</b> as they were before they descended into <b><i>arka</i></b> and became damagers (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Ki Tissa</i>, cited above; see also <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Naso</i>, 336).

Paragraph 156

<b>156. “When they are in the dark, etc.”</b><br><b>When they are in the dark, they transform into the form of a serpent with two heads, and they walk like a serpent and fly inside the deep, and bathe in the great sea. When they arrive at the chain of Aza and Aza’el they enrage them and awaken them, and they leap into the mountains of darkness, and think that the Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to summon them for judgment.</b>
Explanation: This is referring back to the previous statements [section #154#]: <b>“Except when the appointed</b> [angel] <b>that rules over the light is in control. He is victorious over his own, and is victorious over the other. Consequently, those in the darkness were incorporated into those in the light and became one.”</b> At the time of the dominion of the <i>Nukba</i>, which is <b>light,</b> the two heads return to be one head, as stated. Here, however, [the <i>Zohar</i>] says that <b>when they are in the dark,</b> that is, at the time of the dominion of the male who is called <b>Kastimon, they transform into the shape of a serpent with two heads,</b> because the male cannot nullify the dominion of the <i>Nukba</i>, since he has to enclothe himself in her light (as stated above). Therefore, they are like a serpent with two heads, <b>“and they walk like a serpent,”</b> that is, they proceed with the aim of inflicting harm in the manner of a serpent, which is the same way that the serpent seduced Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge.
Now, through the power of the head of the <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>, they <b>“fly inside the deep,”</b> where the root of the <i>kelippot</i> is found, which is called <b>“deep.”</b> This is referring to the lowest descent of all, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “They ascended to the heavens; they descended to the deeps” [Psalms 107:26]. Meanwhile, through the power of the head of the male of the <i>kelippa</i> they <b>“bathe in the great sea,”</b> which is the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>, since <b>“sea”</b> is the name of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Know that this is why <b><i>arka</i></b> is called “the land of Nod,” because they are constantly oscillating [<i>mitnadnedim</i>] on account of the two heads of these officials, first rising in the great sea before again descending to the depths.
The explanation of [the concept of] these angels, <b>Aza and Aza’el,</b> is a very lengthy matter, which I have already partially clarified in my book, <i>Beit Sha’ar La-Kavanot</i> (p. 63, s. v. “<i>Ze’er</i> and <i>Nukba</i>,” ff. ). Here I will attempt to provide as much explanation as necessary. Know that <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> are two of the loftiest angels. Even after their fall from the heavens into this world, to the mountains of darkness, where they were tied with iron chains, Balaam attained all his levels in prophecy through them. With regard to them it is stated [about Balaam]: “Who sees the vision of the Almighty,” meaning, through the power of his [spiritual] attainment of those angels. [Balaam is] called “fallen down and open-eyed” [Numbers 24:4]. [This is] because <b>Aza</b> is called “falling” on account of his fall from heaven to earth, while <b>Aza’el</b> is called “open-eyed” in relation to <b>Aza,</b> because the Holy One, blessed be He, threw darkness in the face [of Aza'el] (all this is laid out in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Balak</i>, 416).
You might claim that the Balaam’s level of prophecy is a small thing, but the Sages have stated [regarding the verse]: “There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses” [Deuteronomy 34:10], that it is in Israel where no other arose like him, whereas in the nations of the world one has arisen, and who is that? Balaam (<i>Bemidbar Rabba</i>, 14). As for why they fell from heaven to earth, this is explained in several places in the <i>Zohar</i>: It was because they slandered mankind at the time of the creation. However, this requires further elaboration, for many angels slandered [mankind] at that time, as stated in the rabbinic midrashim, and if so, why did the Holy One, blessed be He, fell only <b>Aza and Aza’el?</b>
A full explanation of this matter can be found in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Balak</i> (416-425): <b>“At the time when it entered the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, to create man, He summoned numerous sects of the supernal angels, sat them down before Him, and said to them: ‘I wish to create man’</b> etc. <b>The angels said before Him: ‘What is man, that You are mindful of him’</b> [Psalms 8:5]? [In other words, ] <b>what is the nature of this man that You wish to create? He replied: Man was created in our image, and his wisdom will be greater than your wisdom.”</b>
[The meaning of this is as follows:] The soul of man is comprised of all the angels and supernal levels, just as his body includes all [the aspects of] the creatures of this world. Therefore, upon the creation of the soul of man, [God] called upon all the supernal angels to incorporate themselves into the soul of man. This is the mystical meaning of: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” [Genesis 1:26]. That is, He had all the angels participate [in the creation process] so that they would be included in the image and likeness of man. They then asked the Holy One, blessed be He: “What is the nature of this man?” that is, “what will we gain from him, through our incorporation in him?”
He replied to them: <b>“Man was created in our image, and his wisdom will be greater than your wisdom.”</b> He promised them that the wisdom of this man, who was to be comprised of Our image, would possess greater wisdom than your [the angels'] wisdom. You will thus also achieve that tremendous attainment which you have lacked thus far. This is as the Sages stated, with regard to the verse “at that time it will be said to Jacob and of Israel: what has God wrought?” [Numbers 23:23], that in the future the angels will inquire of Israel what they themselves do not know, for Israel’s merit will be greater than that of the angels. [The angels] therefore all participated and were incorporated in the image of man.
It further states there: <b>“After He created man and he sinned, and he left guilty from before Him, Aza and Aza’el came and said to Him: We have a claim against You: This man that You made sinned before You’</b> etc. <b>He replied: ‘If you were with them,... you would be worse than him. ’ What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He felled them from their holy level, from the heavens</b> etc. <b>After the Holy One, blessed be He, felled them from their holy place, they went astray after the women of the world and misled the people of the world.”</b>
You can thus see that not all the angels came to complain before the Holy One, blessed be He, after Adam’s sin, but only <b>Aza and Aza’el.</b> This is because they knew that he would repent, but Aza and Aza’el were aware that this flaw they had obtained because of Adam’s sin would not be rectified at all by his repentance. What is more, they actually preferred that he not to repent at all. This is why they alone complained about Adam’s sin, because for them it was “that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered” [Ecclesiastes 1:15].
The meaning is as follows: The breaking of the vessels and the sin of Adam the first [man] are the same concept. However, with respect to the existence of the worlds it is called “the breaking of the vessels”, whereas with respect to the souls it happened through Adam’s sin. It is known that the breaking of the vessels had control over the eight kings, which are the king of <i>Da'at</i> and the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>]: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>. In each of those kings there are 40 aspects, which are ten <i>sefirot</i> in which [in each of the ten] there are four aspects, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> in each <i>sefira</i>. There are thus eight times forty aspects, which are 320. These are known as the 320 sparks that were thrown in all directions upon the breaking of the vessels.
The concept of repentance is that by raising feminine waters we elevate these sparks from the <i>kelippot</i> back to their place in <i>Atzilut</i> as they were before the sin of Adam the first [man]. However, we do not have the power to purify [the aspects of] <i>Malkhut</i> in those eight kings, because their flaw is entirely above our power. Therefore, we are permitted to elevate only 288 sparks through our repentance, which are merely nine times thirty-two, but with regard to the thirty-two [<i>lamed-bet</i>] aspects of the <i>Malkhut</i> in them, we are forbidden so much as to touch them. This is called <b>“the stony heart</b> [<i>Lev</i> which means “heart” is spelled <i>lamed-bet</i>, which is 32 numerically].”
Because of this [inability to purify those thirty-two aspects of <i>Malkhut</i>], the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> [of the level of <i>nekudim</i>, which are called the “inner <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,” were hidden. [This is] because those thirty-two sparks belong to [that] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma,</i> for the [purpose of] completing their ten <i>sefirot</i>, and as long as [those sparks] are missing from [that] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> [of <i>nekudim</i>], they have no fusion. However, once the elevation of all 288 sparks has been completed, the stony heart will be automatically purified, without the need for any action on our part. Regarding this it is stated: “And I will remove the stony heart from your flesh” [Ezekiel 36:26]. Then, the inner <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> will attain their brains, which will occur at the completion of the rectification. But before the completion of the rectification, this backside of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> cannot receive any rectification through our repentance.
Know that these angels, Aza and Aza’el, are of the aspect of the backside of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which were nullified at the time of the breaking of the vessels. Before the sin of Adam the first [man], [but after the breaking of the vessels, ] they were returned and rectified to a great extent. But after the sin of Adam the first [man] they returned to their state of nullification, and they can no longer be rectified [in the period] preceding the completion of the rectification. This is why Aza and Aza’el complained before the Holy One, blessed be He, about their brains, which they lost on account of Adam’s sin, because they realized that they had no hope that man would be able to rectify them through his repentance.
Moreover, they realized that through his repentance Adam the first [man] would fell them even lower than their [current] level. [This is] because the entire repentance must apply only to the 288 sparks, without touching the heart of stone that belongs to the rectification of the inner <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, to which the brains of these angels relate, as stated. The whole idea of repentance and the raising of feminine waters is to remove this waste, that is, the thirty-two sparks, from the food, which are the 288. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The "waste" refers to the heart of stone, the 32 sparks that are inaccessible through repentance. The "food" is the 288 sparks that can be purified through repentance. Thus, by engaging in the purification of the 288 sparks, the 32 sparks of the heart of stone are lowered further, cast away as "waste" that is unsalvageable.</i> Consequently, the [feminine waters raised for repentance] bring <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> even further down by removing the waste – which is the heart of stone – from the [aspect of] holiness entirely. For this reason, [Aza and Aza’el] slandered and prevented the man from repenting, since repentance would bring them even lower down, because those thirty-two sparks belong to their structure.
When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that their slandering would weaken Adam from repenting, He said to them: <b>“If you were with them, you would be worse than him.”</b> He was saying to them that Adam the first [man] did not corrupt them at all through his sin. Although [these angels] have merit and holiness, because they are in heaven where there is no purchase for the <i>kelippot</i>, that is not a complete wholeness as long as they cannot [successfully] exist in this world of ours, the place of the <i>kelippot</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, was thus informing them: “You did not lose anything through Adam’s sin, since in any case you are no better than him, because your whole merit is only caused by the place.”
Now, the speech of the Holy One, blessed be He, is [manifest as] action, and they therefore immediately fell from heaven to our earth. And <b>“after the Holy One, blessed be He, felled them from their holy place, they went astray after the women of the world and misled the people of the world.”</b> In other words, upon arriving in this world, they began to purify the heart of stone, which is incorporated in “the daughters of man.” This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and they took for them wives, from whomever they chose” [Genesis 6:2]. They did not wish to set aside the waste of the heart of stone and choose only the 288 [sparks to purify], but rather they took “from whomever they chose,” that is, the [sparks of the aspect of] the heart of stone as well. Then they too failed with the <i>Nukba</i> of the wicked Lilith, and they wished to mislead the world with these evil deeds of theirs because they did not want the man to repent, since that would contradict their root, as stated.
<b>“What did the Holy One, blessed be He do? Seeing that they were misleading the world, He tied them with iron chains in the mountains of darkness.”</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, saw that if they would have the strength to return to heaven after this sin of theirs, all of humanity would fail in their wake and [humanity] would be unable to repent, for the control [of these angels over humanity] would be very great. Therefore, although the root [of these angels] is lofty, He granted permission to the root of the <i>kelippot</i>, which is called <b>“iron,”</b> in the mystical meaning of the verse: “No tool of iron was heard in the house, while it was being built” [I Kings 6:7]. Since this <i>kelippa</i> became attached to the [angels], they were tied by it as though with iron chains, within the mountains of darkness, and they are unable to rise from there until the completion of the rectification. This [information] is enough for now, for I have already expanded too much here; later I will clarify this issue more.
This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states here: <b>“When they arrive at the chain of Aza and Aza’el</b> [etc. ],” for after <b>they bathe in the great sea,</b> which is <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>, they receive the strength to bond with <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> in the mountains of darkness, and they awaken [these angels] so [the angels] will bestow <i>Ḥokhma</i> upon them. <b>“They enrage them and awaken them,”</b> [referring to] the awakening of the fourth level, which is the [level of fully developed receiving, called [here] “anger” and “rage,” in the sense that the Sages said: “All gluttons are angry.” <b>“They leap into the mountains of darkness, and think that the Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to summon them for judgment,”</b> because they were unable to ascend to their root and receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> for them, due to the iron chains that were upon them.
They are therefore considered to be jumping up and falling back [down], through which they deepen their place in the mountains of darkness, and [thus] they thought that the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to renew the power of judgment over them, on account of their jumps to receive from their root. Accordingly, they stopped leaping further. And yet, <b>“those two appointed</b> [angels] <b>swim in the great sea”</b> [start of next section]<b>.</b> That is, although in effect [the angels] could not give [the two appointed angels] anything, since they merely jumped and fell, as stated, this [partial ascent] was sufficient for the two appointed angels to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> from them, to the extent that <b>they swam in the great sea.</b> Now the [two appointed angels] had [acquired] the strength to swim there in the sea of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the <i>kelippa</i>, whereas beforehand they had only the strength to bathe there.
The reason [why this jumping and falling was sufficient to access some amount of <i>Ḥokhma</i>] is because in the level of these higher <i>kelippot</i> there is no [manifestation on the level of] action. All "actions" of [these levels] are completed at the point of thought and desire alone, which is due to their status as forces of separation. [However, ] before [these thoughts] are manifest into actions, the holiness departs from there, and therefore it is inconceivable that [these theoretical "actions"] will [ever] be manifest in [the level of] action. This is the mystical meaning of why, in this case, which is considered idolatry, the Holy One, blessed be He, punishes also for the mere thought and desire, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “That I may capture the house of Israel in their own heart” [Ezekiel 14:5]. [This is as] the Sages stated, that a man is punished for a thought of idolatry in the heart as for an action [see e. g., <i>Berakhot</i> 12b]. [As a result of this theoretical level of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, ] the jumps of <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> were enough for receiving their <i>Ḥokhma</i>, despite the fact that in [terms of the level of] action they were given nothing.

Paragraph 157

<b>157. “Those two officials, etc.”</b><br><b>Those two appointed angels swim in the great sea, and they depart from there and at night they go to Na’ama, the mother of the demons, whom the first “sons of God”</b> (Genesis 6:2, 4) <b>strayed after. They think about approaching her, and she leaps over sixty thousand parasangs and transforms into several shapes for people, so people will be led astray after her.</b>
Explanation: After receiving strength from <b>Aza and Aza’el,</b> [the two appointed angels] were able to mate with <b>Na’ama</b> as well, after whom the first angels, <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> also went astray. From that coupling, <b>Na’ama</b> gave birth to all the evil spirits and demons of the world (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> I, 102). [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus says <b>“whom the first ‘sons of God’</b> [<i>deḥalin</i>] <b>strayed after,”</b> meaning <b>Aza and Aza’el,</b> who are called <i>deḥalin</i>, which refers to the “sons of the gods” that are mentioned in Genesis 6. But this matter requires explanation: If they were lofty angels, how did they come to go astray by whoring with <b>Na’ama?</b> Furthermore, why did this lead <b>Na’ama</b> to give birth only to <b>demons and spirits,</b> and not people?
In brief, the meaning is as follows: As you know, the higher world, which is [the level called] <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> [of the level of <i>nekudim</i>] was created with a [letter] <b><i>yod</i>,</b> which is the aspect of male, and there is nothing of the fourth level [which is <i>Malkhut</i>] in [this level of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] at all. However, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which are the lower world, were created with a [letter] <b><i>heh</i>,</b> which also includes the fourth level [within it] (see section #48#, above). You are also aware that the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i>, always desire the light of giving, for this is the origin of [the level of] <i>Bina</i> when it emerged initially, [as part of] the four levels of direct light [flowing down from the <i>Ein Sof</i>]. Yet the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> require specifically the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> because this is how the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> of the direct light was emanated, with the illumination of [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> in [the light of giving] (see my book, <i>Talmud Eser Sefirot</i>, p. 6, s. v., “<i>Ve-ta’am</i>).
Now, from the fusion of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> merged angels who are at the endpoint of the <i>yod</i> [of the name <i>Havaya</i>] like [this <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>], and [those angels] desire only the [light of giving] and not [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, like [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>]. [In contrast, ] the souls of people emerged from the lower world, [which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and these souls are at the endpoint of the <b><i>heh</i></b> [of the name <i>Havaya</i>]<b>,</b> upon which the [first constriction] of the fourth level included in [the <i>heh</i>] occurred, to not receive [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Accordingly, these [souls] need and desire [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, like the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, since these [souls] are drawn from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>.
Now, when Adam the first [man] was born from the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> were enclothing the higher world of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and [in that state <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> also ended in the <b><i>yod</i></b> [like <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] while the <b><i>heh</i></b> was hidden in the “back” [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>]. Consequently, Adam the first [man] had a very high stature. Since he was [rooted] in the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [while they were enclothing] the higher world, and [Adam also thus] had an endpoint in the <b><i>yod</i>,</b> therefore his level was like that of the angels above, who are born from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>. At the same time, [Adam] would receive supernal [light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, because he is of the aspect of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and the name <i>Elohim</i> – which is <i>Ḥokhma</i> – rested upon him in the wholeness of the higher world, since there is no [first constriction] or [constricting presence of the] fourth level in the <b><i>yod</i></b> at all. From this level, [Adam] bore Cain and Abel: Cain from [the aspect of the name <i>Elohim</i> called] <b><i>eleh</i></b> and Abel from [the aspect called] <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> as stated. In both of them, the lower <i>heh</i> [of the name <i>Havaya</i>] was not revealed, only the <b><i>yod</i></b> alone. As a result, they possessed supernal <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and the primary carrier of the <i>Ḥokhma</i> is <b><i>eleh</i>,</b> which is the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, the soul of Cain.
However, Cain was envious of the additional twin sister, who was hidden in <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> since the lower <i>heh</i> is concealed in this <b><i>yod</i>,</b> as stated. Cain wished to mate with her, i. e., he sought to extend his <i>Ḥokhma</i> into this fourth level that was hidden in the soul of Abel. He thereby killed Abel, because once the lower <i>heh</i> was uncovered, the constriction upon it was uncovered as well, which is that [this lower <i>heh</i>, the fourth level, ] is forbidden to receive from the supernal light [of <i>Ḥokhma</i>]. Consequently, the name <i>Elohim</i> departed from both of them, but the <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> which is the [the aspect of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i> of Abel], departed above, and in this respect it is considered that [Cain] killed Abel. The <b><i>eleh</i></b> of Cain, as it is of the aspect of the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>], fell into the place of the <i>kelippot</i>, which is <b><i>arka</i>,</b> as stated above. As has already been explained, although it fell to the <i>kelippot</i>, there still remained a few sparks of <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the vessels [of <i>eleh</i>]. [Cain's] daughters in particular, who were not impaired that much, have even more sparks from the <i>Bina</i>.
You can now understand why this <b>Na’ama,</b> who was one of Cain’s daughters, was more beautiful than all of the daughters of man. [This is because] the sin [of Cain] was primarily in the males of Cain, not in the females, who are considered like [mere] natural ground (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 74b). <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of "natural ground" means that people who are in a state of passivity, as opposed to activity.</i> Therefore, after the Holy One, blessed be He, dropped <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> into this world, which was created with a <b><i>heh</i>,</b> and they saw <b>Na’ama,</b> a great new craving was awakened in them, one that had never existed before, a craving for the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. [Aza and Aza'el, ] at their root only desire the [light of giving], but the sight of <b>Na’ama</b> produced in them this new craving to draw <i>Ḥokhma</i>.
Because [Aza and Aza'el] do not have the constricted lower <i>heh</i> in their own structure at all, and the lower <i>heh</i> was also not uncovered in the structure of <b>Na’ama</b> herself because she is drawn from the <b><i>eleh</i></b> of Cain, they <b>strayed</b> after her, [thinking] that she was fit for receiving [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and they mated with her. Their mistake was twofold: 1) Even though they did not have the lower <i>heh</i> in their own structure, the place [in which they were] was nevertheless a factor: Since they were already in this world, the lower <i>heh</i> already had dominion over them and they were forbidden to draw the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. 2) Their thought that there was also no lower <i>heh</i> in the structure of <b>Na’ama</b> [was also an error], because she did in fact have the lower <i>heh</i>, [albeit] in a concealed state. Consequently, all the demons and spirits that harm the world emerged from their mating.
You can now understand the Sages’ statement that that the demons are half like ministering angels and half like people (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 16a). From the side of their father, <b>Aza and Aza’el,</b> they are like angels, while from the side of their mother, <b>Na’ama,</b> they are like people. However, she could not give birth to people, because there was no seed of people in her, but only [the seed] of angels. They cause harm because they were born from the harlotry of the greatest separation [from the divine] in the world, and therefore they take their contamination with them to cause harm wherever they find themselves.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states here: <b>“And at night they go to Na’ama, the mother of the demons, whom the first ‘sons of God’ strayed after.”</b> Once [these officials] received strength from these angels who were the first to whore with this <b>Na’ama,</b> they also could go off and whore with her, like them. And <b>they go at night</b> because the power of <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the <i>kelippot</i> rules only in the dark and at night, when the judgments have dominion. This is also on account of their root, which are <b>Aza and Aza’el,</b> who were bound in the mountains of darkness.
<b>“They think about approaching her, and she leaps over sixty thousand parasangs</b> etc.” After they whored with her, she leaped sixty thousand parasangs [<i>parsa’ot</i>], which means that she raised such a stench that [it was as if] she wanted to disable the diaphragm above the six extremities of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> (because every <i>sefira</i> of [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] is considered ten thousand, the six extremities [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] is thus sixty thousand parasangs). However, it does not say that they approached her, only that <b>they think about approaching her.</b> Furthermore, it does not say that she roams sixty thousand parasangs, but only that <b>she leaps sixty thousand parasangs.</b> The meaning is that she only leaped, for she immediately fell back down and did not touch them. This is for the aforementioned reason, that no action applies to those lofty <i>kelippot</i>, Heaven forbid. Their only destructive impact is in thought and desire, as was explained in the previous section.
Yet despite this [lack of active impact], she already has enough strength that <b>“people will be led astray after her.”</b> Although [Na'ama] does not cause anyone to perform an actual deed, but only thoughts and desire like her, in this case the Holy One, punishes for the thought as for an action, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “That I may capture the house of Israel in their own heart” (Ezekiel 14:5), as stated above [section #156#]. As for the statement <b>“and transforms into several shapes for people,”</b> this means with respect to both forbidden relations and bloodshed (as stated below, in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> II, 354): “And she was appointed with Lilith over the death of children from diphtheria etc. for she was appointed to toy with people”; see there.

Paragraph 158

<b>158. “Those two appointed angels, etc.”</b><br><b>These two appointed angels fly off and roam throughout the world, and return to their place. They awaken the descendants of Cain’s children with a spirit of evil inclinations, to produce offspring.</b>
Explanation: <b>They roam throughout the world</b> in order to harm people, because they cause people to be defiled by nocturnal emissions, as stated below.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And return to their place. They awaken the descendants of Cain’s children... to produce offspring.”</b> After they have caused the people of this world to sin, they return to their permanent place, which is <b><i>arka</i>,</b> where they awaken the descendants of Cain’s children to produce offspring in their contamination, as stated. [The <i>Zohar</i>] informs us that besides causing the sons of Cain to sin in <b><i>arka</i>,</b> they also roam through our land, which is <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> and they cause the dwellers of this land to sin as well.

Paragraph 159

<b>159. “The heavens that govern there, etc.”</b><br><b>The heavens that govern there are not like our heavens, and the land does not produce seed and harvesting through their strength, like ours, and nor do</b> the seeds grow <b>again, but only every several years and seasons. They are</b> the ones about whom it is stated: <b>“The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth”</b> [i. e., from the] <b>higher</b> [earth]<b>, which is</b> called <b><i>tevel</i>. For they will not govern it, nor roam it, nor will they cause people to be defiled by nocturnal emission. Therefore, “these shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens”</b> [Jeremiah 10:11] – <b>those who were made with the name <i>eleh</i></b> (see section #14#, above), <b>as we learned.</b>
Explanation: Our heavens receive from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which possesses brains of reproduction. Therefore, our land, which receives through the <i>Nukba</i> [of <i>Ze'er Anpin</i>], receives seed and harvesting. However, the heavens of <b><i>arka</i></b> have no brains of reproduction, due to the domination of the <i>kelippot</i> that are there. Accordingly, <b>“the land does not produce seed and harvesting through their strength, like ours,”</b> since there is no power in the land to receive seed that would produce crops and harvests, as normally occurs in our land. <b>“And nor do</b> [the seeds grow] <b>again, but only every several years and seasons,”</b> i. e., the seed that is planted there grows only once every several years and seasons.
That which [the <i>Zohar</i>] states, <b>“The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,”</b> is referring to those two appointed [angels] <b>Afrira and Kastimon</b> [see section #155#], who are <b>“the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth</b> [<i>arka</i>].” That is, they are unable to rectify <b>the heavens and the <i>arka</i>,</b> to render them fit for producing fruit. Consequently, they have no permission to roam and cause people in our land, which is <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> to sin. This is because when they are here [in our world], they damage our land as well, to become like their <b>heavens and <i>arka</i>.</b>
The <i>Zohar</i> continues: <b>“These shall perish from the earth,</b> [i. e., from the] <b>higher one, which is <i>tevel</i>,”</b> i. e., they will perish from our earth, which is called <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> “for they will not govern it, nor roam it, nor will they cause people to be defiled by nocturnal emission.” When they roam in our <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> they cause people to sin <b>“by nocturnal emission,”</b> which is the curse that hangs over <b><i>arka</i>,</b> on account of their dominion there.
[They will thus perish from the earth] under our heavens, “which were made with the name <i>eleh</i>.” Our heavens receive from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which were established <b>“with the name <i>eleh</i>, as we learned”</b> in the mystical meaning of: “In the beginning God created” [Genesis 1:1], that <b><i>Mi</i></b> combined with <b><i>eleh</i>.</b> Therefore, our land is also established with supernal holiness, as it is through that secret [of <i>Mi</i> and <i>eleh</i>] that the world exists (as stated in section #15#, above). For this reason, those two appointed [angels] have no permission to roam here.

Paragraph 160

<b>160. “Therefore, this, etc.”</b><br><b>Therefore, this verse is a translation, so that the supernal angels will not think that it is stated about them, and</b> [therefore] <b>they will not be hostile toward us. Thus, the secret of the word <i>eleh</i> is as we stated,</b> that <b>it is a holy word which is not replaced in the translation.</b>
Explanation: The entire verse is written in [Aramaic] translation, except for the word <i>eleh</i>, as it states: <b>“Shall perish from the earth and from under these</b> [<i>eleh</i>] <b>heavens.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] says that the reason is because this word has no translation. Since the connection of <b><i>eleh</i></b> to <b><i>Mi</i></b> draws the supernal brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated, if, Heaven forfend, the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>] are blemished like Cain, they fall into the <i>kelippot</i>, and then not even the sanctity of the <b>translation</b> remains in them. This means that it is inconceivable that they should have a <b>translation,</b> which is of the aspect of six extremities of holiness (see section #152#, above).

Paragraph 161

<b>161. “Rabbi Elazar said to him, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar said to him: This verse which is stated: “Who would not fear You, O King of the nations, for it suits You”</b> [Jeremiah 10:7], <b>what kind of praise is that? Rabbi Shimon replied: Elazar, my son, this verse was stated in several places, but certainly it is not so,</b> in accordance with its literal meaning, <b>as it is written</b> [in the same verse]: <b>“For among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms,</b> [there is none like You].” <b>This comes to give a claim to the wicked, to those who think that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not know their contemplations and thoughts. For this reason their methods must be made known. Once, a certain philosopher from the nations of the world came to me. He said to me: You say that your God rules over the entire expanse of the heavens,</b> and <b>all the armies and camps cannot attain or know His place. Now, this verse does not grant Him much respect, as it is stated: “For among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.” What is this comparison to people, who have no endurance?</b>
Explanation: This follows the approach of the verses: “And they say: How does God know, and is there knowledge in the Most High? Behold, such are the wicked, and those who are always at ease increase riches” [Psalms 73:11–12]. This is similar to the statement of the philosopher that [the <i>Zohar</i>] cites here. This philosopher was one of the great scholars of the nations. He came before Rabbi Shimon to disparage Israel’s wisdom and our service in complete faith, which is performed in great simplicity, since no thought can grasp [God] at all. This wise man was one of those philosophers who maintain that the essence of the service of God is to attain Him, for they imagine that they are capable of doing so. Thus, he came to mock us.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] therefore states: <b>“That your God rules over the entire expanse of the heavens.”</b> In other words, He is above any human intellect and He rules from this lofty state. He commanded you to serve Him in faith and simplicity, without questioning Him at all, because <b>“all the armies and camps cannot attain</b> [Him].” Not only is the human mind unable to grasp Him, but even the armies and the supernal angels do not attain Him at all, <b>“or know His place.”</b> That is, they do not grasp even His place, for it is written that [the angels] declare: <b>“Blessed be the glory of God from His place”</b> [Ezekiel 3:12], which indicates that they do not know where His place is.
[The philosopher] said all this in order to raise his difficulty, that <b>“this verse does not grant Him much respect, as it is stated: ‘For among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. ’”</b> If the point of this prophetic passage is to praise the God of Israel, that He is more important than the God that the wise men of the nations grasp with their own human strength and wisdom, it <b>“does not grant Him much respect, "</b> because <b>“what is this comparison to people, who have no endurance?”</b> What sort of significance is there to a comparison between the Creator and mortal beings? In fact, this is highly demeaning to your God, to compare Him to the mortal scholars of the nations.

Paragraph 162

<b>162. “Furthermore, you say, etc.”</b><br><b>Furthermore, you say,</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“There has not arisen another prophet in Israel like Moses”</b> [Deuteronomy 34:10], [that] <b>it is in Israel where no other arose like him, whereas in the nations of the world one has arisen</b> [<i>Bemidbar Rabba</i>, 14]. <b>I, too, maintain likewise: There are none like him among all the wise men of the nations, but there are</b> like him <b>among the wise men of Israel. If so, a God who has like Him among the wise men of Israel is not a lofty, ruling God. Look in the Bible and you will find that I have derived appropriately.</b>
Explanation: Here he spoke with intellectual language, when he said: “<b>Look in the Bible and you will find that I have been suitably precise.”</b> He realized that they would easily be able to resolve the [textual] difficulty he raised, [simply by pointing out] that [the verse] means that <b>“among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms”</b> there is no one who can grasp You, because <b>“there is none like You”</b> in the sense of: “Were I capable of knowing Him, I would be Him.” Since the wise men of the nations boast about grasping Him, [they are effectively claiming that] they should be regarded as <b>like Him.</b> The verse therefore states that they lied and they are not like Him, for they do not grasp Him but rather mislead themselves.
[The philosopher] therefore presented his challenge in a subtle manner: It can be inferred that <b>there are none like Him</b> only <b>among all the wise men of the nations, but there are</b> like Him <b>among the wise men of Israel,</b> i. e., there are those [in Israel] who can grasp [God]. “If so, a God who has like Him among the wise men of Israel is not <b>a lofty, ruling God.”</b> In other words, according to this [logic], why do you claim that no thought can grasp the God of Israel at all, and that He rules over His servants by the power of faith in His transcendence? This refers back to [the philosopher's] earlier statement [in the previous section] that <b>“you say that your God rules over the entire expanse of the heavens,”</b> [to which he retorts]: But the verse says that there are like Him <b>among the wise men of Israel,</b> i. e., there are wise men of Israel who can grasp Him. Thus, the text contradicts your claim.

Paragraph 163

<b>163. “I said to him, you have certainly etc.”</b><br><b>I said to him: You have certainly spoken well,</b> that <b>there are those like Him in Israel. Who revives the dead? Is it the Holy One, blessed be He, alone? Elijah and Elisha came and revived dead. Who brings rainfall? Is it the Holy One, blessed be He, alone? Elijah came and withheld them, and</b> [subsequently] <b>brought them down with his prayer. Who makes heaven and earth? Is it the Holy One, blessed be He, alone? Abraham came, and the heaven and earth continued to endure on his account.</b>
Explanation: Rabbi Shimon explained to him that he is undoubtedly correct, that there are others like Him in Israel; <b>“you have certainly spoken well.”</b> And yet, this does not at all contradict our simple faith that no thought can grasp [Him] in any way whatsoever. He <b>“rules over the entire expanse of the heavens,”</b> i. e., not even the loftiest angels can grasp Him <b>“or know His place.”</b> However in counterpart to that, He has given us Torah and the commandments, for by engaging in the Torah and the commandments for their own sake Israel merit to truly cleave to Him. His Divine Presence is enclothed in them until they perform the same deeds as the Creator: They revive the dead, cause rainfall, sustain the heavens and earth, and so on. From this perspective they are actually like Him, which is the mystical meaning of: “Through Your actions we know You.” Yet they attain all this only through a complete and simple faith, for they do not even contemplate grasping Him by means of their wisdom, in the manner of the wise men of the nations.

Paragraph 164

<b>164. “Who guides the sun etc.”</b><br><b>Who directs the sun? Is it not only the Holy One, blessed be He? Joshua came, silenced it and commanded it to stand in its spot, and it went silent, as it is stated: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed”</b> [Joshua 10:13]. <b>The Holy One, blessed be He, decrees a judgment, and so did Moses: He decreed a judgment and it was fulfilled. Furthermore, the Holy One, blessed be He, issues decrees and the righteous of Israel nullify them, as it is stated: “The righteous rules the fear of God”</b> [II Samuel 23:3]. <b>In addition,</b> the Holy One, blessed be He, <b>commanded them to follow in His very ways, to resemble Him in everything. That philosopher went and converted in the village of Shaḥalyim. They called him Little Yosei, and he learned much Torah, and he was among the Sages and the righteous ones of that place.</b>
Explanation: [One] might claim that when they merit to be exactly like Him, this ultimately diminishes the power of their simple faith. However, they act in this manner because He commanded them to do so, and to grasp Him through the power of His actions, for He <b>“commanded them to follow in His very ways.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And walk in His ways” [Deuteronomy 28:9]. They perform the commandments of the King in order <b>“to resemble Him in everything.”</b> The philosopher was so impressed by this truth that he went and converted and accepted upon himself the yoke of Torah and its commandments.

Paragraph 165

<b>165. “Now we should examine etc.”</b><br><b>Now we should examine the verses. It is stated: “All the nations are as nothing before Him”</b> [Isaiah 40:17]. <b>What advantage is there here?</b> He responds: <b>Rather, “who would not fear You, O King of the nations”</b> [Jeremiah 10:7]. <b>But is He the king of the nations and not the king of Israel? Rather, in all places, the Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to be glorified through Israel. He is named only after Israel, as it is stated: “The God of Israel”</b> [e. g., Exodus 24:10]; <b>“the God of the Hebrews”</b> [Exodus 5:3], <b>and it is stated: “Thus says the Lord, King of Israel”</b> [Isaiah 44:6]. <b>Certainly,</b> [God is] <b>the King of Israel. The nations of the world said: “We have another protector in heaven, for your King rules over you alone, but He does not rule over us.”</b>
Explanation: [The term] “now” means on that night, when the queen is summoned to come to the wedding canopy, where Rabbi Shimon was, and he now wishes to adorn the bride with an ornament, as stated. That verse should be re-examined, <b>“who would not fear You, O King of the nations,”</b> and interpret it with respect to the adornment of the bride. [Rabbi Shimon therefore] restates the beginning of the verse, which says: “Who would not fear You, O King of the nations” [and then asks:] <b>“What advantage is there here?”</b> After all, it is written, “All the nations are as nothing before Him,” and if so, what is [the verse] teaching us here? When [the <i>Zohar</i>] says, <b>“we have another protector in the heaven,”</b> this means that the nations harass Israel by saying that they have a good protector and guide in heaven who gives them wisdom and power, while the King of Israel does not rule over them.

Paragraph 166

<b>166. “The verse comes and says etc.”</b><br><b>The verse comes and says: “Who would not fear You, O King of the nations,”</b> i. e., <b>a lofty King</b> over them, <b>to tyrannize them and strike them, and to treat them as He pleases. “For it suits You” to be feared above and below. “For among all the wise men of the nations,” which are the rulers and ministers above, who are appointed over them; “and in all their kingdoms</b> [<i>malkhutam</i>,” Jeremiah 10:7], <b>in that <i>Malkhut</i> above. There are four governing <i>Malkhut</i>s above, which rule over all the other nations, by the will</b> of the Holy One, blessed be He. <b>Yet there is none among them who will do even the slightest thing other than as He commanded them, as it is stated: “And He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth”</b> [Daniel 4:32]. <b>“The wise men of the nations” are the officials and the ministers above, from whom the wisdom</b> [<i>ḥokhma</i>] <b>of the nations comes. “And in all their kingdoms” is the <i>Malkhut</i>, which governs</b> over them, as stated. <b>This is the plain meaning of the verse.</b>
Explanation: This verse is explaining how the bride is summoned, during the period of exile, to come to the wedding canopy at the completion of the rectification. All of the nations’ power to hold us under their rule in exile is [maintained] through their wisdom and kingship. These [terms refer to] the supernal officials in the heaven of the [side of the] <i>kelippot</i>, which grant [the other nations] wisdom and rulership. Through their wisdom they lead us to think evil thoughts, to seek to understand God in all aspects: Him, His ways, and His thoughts, without any awe or consideration of the sublimity of His rule. Through these evil thoughts we are emptied of any <i>shefa</i> of holiness, and the <i>shefa</i> moves to the <i>Malkhut</i> [of the nations], in the mystical meaning of: “Tyre was filled only from the ruin of Jerusalem” [see <i>Megilla</i> 6a]. The [other nations] thereby attain the strength to tyrannize us and strike us, and to force us to do their will. This is the mystical meaning of the four kingdoms that enslave us in the four exiles, which are alluded to in the four levels of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> [of the other nations]. These are [also] alluded to in the image of Nebuchadnezzar, as it is stated: <b>“Its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay”</b> [Daniel 2:32–33]. When that image is in control, they mock us [by claiming] that they have “another protector in the heaven” [see previous section].
However, all that is the mystical meaning of: “God has so made it so that men should fear before Him” [Ecclesiastes 3:14], since the Divine Presence is called the “fear of heaven.” This hints that the only way we can cleave to God forever is through great fear of His sublimity, accepting upon ourselves the burden of Torah and [its] commandments with complete and pure faith, without doubting His attributes in any way at all, Heaven forbid, lest He conceal Himself from us. Then we will cleave to Him for all eternity through an unbreakable bond, and God will also bestow the goodness of all that He had in mind to benefit us in [His initial] intent for the Creation. We will [then] merit the full redemption and the completion of the rectification. But before that [stage], whoever “earns wages, earns wages for a bag with holes” (Haggai 1:6). The <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> always has the strength to exploit the <i>shefa</i> we receive, through the evil thoughts that it injects into us, in the mystical meaning of: “Tyre was filled only from the ruin of Jerusalem”
Yet even these punishments are not for our detriment, but only to render us fit to fear Him, through the numerous trials that the exile brings upon us, until we merit to receive faith in Him in wholeness and with awe of [His] sublimity. Then the verse will apply: “He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God” [Psalms 98:3], for at the time of the end [which is the completion of the rectification] God will remember all His mercies for us, together with the wholeness of His faith, all at once.
Once we have received the strength to receive His faith in wholeness, Jerusalem will be built from the ruin of Tyre, for all the giving and <i>shefa</i> that the kingdoms of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> stole from us during the exile, as stated, will return to us after [we acquire] the completeness of His faith, in all of its fullness, with nothing at all missing. Then, “all the ends of the earth [will] have seen the salvation of our God,” for all the nations will see that even before that time they were only unpaid guardians over our <i>shefa</i>, in order to restore [that <i>shefa</i>] to us at the desired time. This illustrates that when “man controlled man... it was to his detriment” [see Ecclesiastes 8:9]. The hardship of the subjugation with which they ruled over us, during the period when the wicked man controlled the man of holiness, was only to the detriment of the wicked man, since we thereby speedily arrived at faith in God, and we collected from [the wicked man] all the thefts that he had extorted from us.
It is with regard to that time that the prophet declared: “Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?” Then it will have been revealed that You are the King of the nations, <b>“to tyrannize them and strike them, and to treat them as he pleases.”</b> What [the nations] previously imagined, that they were tyrannizing us, will then have been revealed as the opposite, that they were only our attendants and servants, in order to bring us into complete faith. Additionally, what appeared to be the case beforehand, that they were striking us, has now been revealed as the reverse, that they themselves were struck, for they thereby speedily brought us into a state of wholeness, and hurried their own bitter end upon themselves, as stated. And instead of what they supposed, that they were rebelling against God and doing exactly what they desired and wished, to oppress us for the fulfilment of their evil lusts, and that there was no judgment or judge, Heaven forfend, it has now been revealed that they were only performing God’s will, in order to bring us to the [state of] wholeness. It is thereby made clear that You are “the King of the nations” from beginning to end, because You ruled over them and compelled them to do Your will at all times, in the manner of a king over his servants. [At that time] the fear of Your sublimity will have been revealed among all the nations, and it thus states: <b>“Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?”</b>
The phrase <b>“among all the wise men of the nations”</b> refers to the rulers and the ministers appointed over [the nations]. These are the officials <b>Afrira and Kastimon</b> who are in <i>arka</i> [see section #155#], and likewise <b>Aza and Aza’el</b> [see section #155#]... from whom the wise men of the nations draw their wisdom and oppress Israel. 
<b>“And in all their kingdoms</b> etc. <b>four <i>Malkhut</i>s that govern above, which rule over all the other nation, by His will.”</b> These four kingdoms are alluded to in the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw: 1) <b>Its head was of fine gold;</b> 2) <b>its breast and its arms of silver;</b> 3) <b>its belly and its thighs of brass;</b> 4) <b>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.</b> These four are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of the <i>kelippot</i>, which rule over all seventy nations of the world.
And yet there is not one among these [ministers] who will do even the slightest thing by himself, but only as You have commanded them. This is as we explained earlier at length, that at the end of [this phase, at the completion of the rectification, ] it will be revealed that through all the tyranny and the blows by which [the nations] distanced Israel from their Father in heaven, they were nothing other than loyal servants bringing them closer to their Father in heaven, such that they did not do anything except as You commanded them to do; see there in detail.
This is in accordance with the verse: <b>“And He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth.”</b> That is, [God does this] in order to bring us into [the state of] complete faith, to merit receiving all of His giving, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.” Then the image will be broken, as it is stated: “You saw that a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image upon its feet of iron and clay etc. and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them, and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth” [Daniel 2:34–35]. The holy faith is called “a stone [cut out] without hands,” [for] after He remembers His mercy and His faithfulness, that stone cut not by hand will have "struck the image upon its feet etc. and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors, and the wind carried them away,” so that their place is unknown. Then, “all the ends of the earth [will] have seen the salvation of our God.” That stone will become a great mountain, filling the whole earth, as it is stated: “And the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9).

Paragraph 167

<b>167. “However, for among all the wise men etc.”</b><br><b>However, [</b>regarding the clause] <b>“for among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms,” this I found in the books of the ancients, that they, the camps and armies above, although they were charged over the affairs of the world and He commanded each to perform his task, who is he who can do even one of them like You? For You are inscribed in Your value, and You are inscribed in Your deeds,</b> [more] <b>than all of them. This is “there is none like You”</b> [Jeremiah 10:7], <b>O Lord. Who is a hidden, holy one above and below, who will act and be like You, and will resemble You in all the deeds of the holy King</b> in <b>heaven and in earth? But they are “vanity</b> [<i>tohu</i>], <b>and their delectable things shall not profit”</b> [Isaiah 44:9]. <b>With regard to the Holy One, blessed be He, it is stated: “In the beginning, God created...” whereas with regard to their kingdom it is stated: “And the earth was unformed</b> [<i>tohu</i>] <b>and void”</b> [Genesis 1:2].

Paragraph 168

<b>168. “Rabbi Shimon said etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon said to the colleagues: “My sons, this wedding, each of you will adorn the bride with one ornament.” He said to his son Rabbi Elazar: “Elazar, give one gift to the bride, for tomorrow, when</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> <b>enters the wedding canopy, he will look at these songs and praises that the members of the chamber have given her, so that she will stand before Him.”</b>

Paragraph 169

<b>169. “Rabbi Elazar opened etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “Who is this, rising from the wilderness etc.”</b> [Song of Songs 8:5]. <b>“Who</b> [<i>mi</i>] <b>is this” is the integration of two sanctities, two worlds,</b> <i>Bina</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>in one connection and one bond. “Rising”</b> means that she is <b>actually</b> rising <b>to be the holy of holies, since <i>Mi</i>,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>, <b>is the holy of holies, and she is connected with “this,”</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>in order that</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>will be rising, which is the holy of holies. “From the wilderness,” for she inherited</b> this <b>from the wilderness, to be a bride and enter the wedding canopy.</b>
Explanation: The verse: “Who is this, rising from the wilderness, clinging to her beloved,” is referring to the completion of the rectification, when the bride rises to the wedding canopy, as explained below.
[Rabbi Elazar] proceeds to explain that <b>“who</b> [<i>mi</i>] <b>is this”</b> refers to the <i>Bina</i>, which is called <i>Mi</i>, and to the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called “this.” He says that at that time, “who is this” will be incorporated as one, [as] <b>“the integration of two sanctities.”</b> Before the completion of the rectification, the <i>Bina</i> alone is called <b>“holy,”</b> while the <i>Malkhut</i> that ascends to the <i>Bina</i> is sanctified only in the holiness of the <i>Bina</i>. At that time [of the completion of the rectification], however, the <i>Malkhut</i> itself will be holy as well, like the <i>Bina</i>, and <b>“who is this, rising”</b> will be an <b>“integration of two sanctities,”</b> because <b>“two worlds</b> [will be] <b>in one connection and in one bond.”</b>
[This] “bond” is the bundle of life, which is the endpoint of the <i>Malkhut</i> with the partition that raises the returning light and binds all the <i>sefirot</i> as one. At that time, [the endpoint of the <i>Malkhut</i>] will be of the aspect of [the letter] <b><i>yod</i>,</b> [representing the unification of the ten <i>sefirot</i> into one, and] forever equal to the <i>Bina</i>. This is called <b>“one bond,”</b> while <b>“one connection”</b> means that the height of the light of the <i>Malkhut</i> will be connected to the height of the [the light of] <i>Bina</i>, really like one, for then [the <i>Malkhut</i> will be] <b>“actually rising to be the holy of holies,”</b> i. e., the <i>Malkhut</i> itself will ascend to be a genuine holy of holies, like the <i>Bina</i>.
When [Rabbi Elazar] says <b>“actually rising</b> [ola],” this means like a burnt [<i>ola</i>] offering, which is [classified as an offering of] holy of holies. <b><i>Mi</i>,</b> which is the mystical meaning of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>], is holy of holies, and it connects with <b>“this,”</b> which is the <i>Malkhut</i>, in order for the <i>Malkhut</i> to be an expression of “rising,” which is holy of holies. Then the connection of <b><i>Mi</i></b> with <b>“this”</b> is achieved, to render <b>“this”</b> itself <b>holy of holies.</b> When this takes place, it is no longer possible for there to be any diminution in the <i>Malkhut</i>, since its own sanctity is <b>holy of holies,</b> like the <i>Bina</i>. Therefore, [it is stated that] “He will eliminate death forever” [Isaiah 25:8].
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“For she inherited</b> [this] <b>from the wilderness, to be a bride and enter the wedding canopy</b>. The wilderness is the place of “serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions” [Deuteronomy 8:15]. It has already been explained above (section #124#) that those who preserve the Torah are mainly regarded as makers of the Torah through [its] practice. Thus, this great fusion of the completion of the rectification was performed <b>specifically from the wilderness.</b>

Paragraph 170

<b>170. “Furthermore, she rises from the wilderness etc.”</b><br><b>Furthermore, she rises “from the wilderness</b> [<i>midbar</i>],” <b>as it is stated: “And your mouth</b> [<i>midbarekh</i>] <b>is comely”</b> [Song of Songs 4:3]. That is, <b>she rises in that wilderness of the whispering of the lips,</b> for <i>midbar</i> means <i>dibur</i> [speech]. <b>And we learned: What is</b> [the meaning of that] <b>which is stated: “These mighty gods”</b> [I Samuel 4:8]? <b>These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. But was everything that the Holy One, blessed be He, did to them in the desert? Was it not in an inhabited place? Rather, “in the wilderness</b> [<i>midbar</i>]” means <b>with speech, as it is stated: “And your mouth</b> [<i>midbarekh</i>] <b>is comely,” and it is stated: “From the wilderness comes lifting up”</b> [Psalms 75:7]. <b>So too, “rising from the wilderness” is the same – certainly “from the wilderness,”</b> i. e., <b>with that speech of the mouth,</b> <i>Malkhut</i> <b>rises and enters between the mother’s wings,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>. <b>Subsequently, through speech,</b> <i>Malkhut</i> <b>descends and rests over the heads of the holy people.</b>
Explanation: Before the completion of the rectification, when the <i>Malkhut</i> is still called <b>“the tree of</b> [the knowledge of] <b>good and evil,”</b> its entire rectification is achieved through the feminine waters by means of which the righteous raise the <i>Malkhut</i> to the <i>Bina</i>. By virtue of this ascent, <i>Malkhut</i> temporarily becomes as holy as <i>Bina</i>. These feminine waters are the mystical meaning of a whispered prayer, since <i>Malkhut</i> is the mystical meaning of speech, and it is not possible that in the aspect of speech there should be only good without any evil at all. [The exception is] only when the voice in the speech is of the aspect of <i>Bina</i>. [This state] is the mystical meaning of the unification of voice and speech, which is a fusion of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in maturity.
The <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> receives the voice of the [aspect of] <i>Imma</i> [<i>Bina</i>] and bestows [this] to the speech of the <i>Malkhut</i>. In that state, the speech is all good without any evil at all, and [the <i>Malkhut</i>] receives the brains of holiness. Indeed, without this tempering from the voice of <i>Bina</i>, the voice of <i>Malkhut</i> is of the aspect of good and evil, as stated, and there is a purchase point for the <i>kelippot</i> [upon <i>Malkhut</i>] and [<i>Malkhut</i>] cannot receive from the holiness. Therefore, the ascent of the feminine waters raised by the righteous in prayer are considered a <b>“whispering of the lips,”</b> i. e., speech without a voice, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Only her lips moved but her voice could not be heard” (I Samuel 1:13). Then there is no purchase [for the <i>kelippot</i>] upon the feminine waters that they raise, and they can also raise the <i>Malkhut</i> to <i>Bina</i>, so that [<i>Malkhut</i>] receives the voice from the <i>Bina</i>. [The <i>Malkhut</i>] then becomes a holy structure and receives brains in a fusion of voice and speech, and the sanctity of the speech [of <i>Malkhut</i>] <b>“rests over the heads”</b> of the righteous who rectified [that speech] in this manner.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“She rises from the wilderness</b> [<i>midbar</i>], <b>as it is stated, and your mouth</b> [<i>midbarekh</i>] <b>is comely.”</b> The bride is now prepared for the great fusion, <b>to enter the wedding canopy</b> through the raising of the feminine waters by the righteous, in the mystical meaning of <b>“and your mouth is comely,”</b> when they extend the voice from the <i>Imma</i> [aspect of <i>Bina</i>] through speech, which is the <i>Malkhut</i>. The wilderness of the <i>Malkhut</i> is thereby rendered as comely and as beautiful as the <i>Bina</i>, because all those fusions that were performed one after the other have now been collected together into the great fusion, to admit her to the wedding canopy. As a result, [before, ] <b>“she rises in that wilderness of the whispering of the lips,”</b> by means of the feminine waters that they previously raised through <b>the whispering of the lips,</b> i. e., in a speech without a voice, when the voice [of <i>Malkhut</i>] was still [a mixture of] the aspect of good and evil, as stated, and the voice of the <i>Imma</i> [aspect of <i>Bina</i>] was extended into [<i>Malkhut</i>]. Now, [at the time of the great fusion, ] all those good deeds [before the completion of the rectification] form the great fusion to bring [the bride] up into the wedding canopy. Now her own voice has also become good without any bad at all, and she has become <b>holy of holies</b> like the <i>Imma</i>.
A whispered speech is regarded like the <b>“speech of the mouth,”</b> i. e., without the inclusion of the palate, throat, tongue, and teeth, but only the outlet of the lips and the <b>mouth,</b> so that it is an aspect of “her voice could not be heard,” as stated. [Rabbi Elazar] thus states: <b>“With that speech of the mouth,</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] <b>rises,”</b> like in the manner of raising feminine waters. [The <i>Malkhut</i>] then <b>“enters between the mother’s wings”</b> and ascends between the wings of the <i>Bina</i>. In other words, [<i>Malkhut</i>] receives the voice of the wings of the <i>Imma</i> into her speech, and <b>“subsequently, through the speech that</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] receives<b>,</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] <b>descends and rests over the heads of the holy people.”</b> Once [<i>Malkhut</i>] receives the voice of the attribute of mercy from the <i>Imma</i>, [<i>Malkhut</i>] becomes <b>holy</b> like [<i>Bina</i>] and the holiness [of <i>Malkhut</i>] returns to those who rectified her [which are the righteous], and they are also called “holy people,” like [<i>Malkhut</i>], because the speech of [<i>Malkhut</i>] is now holy, like the <i>Imma</i>. This is the meaning of <b>“through speech,</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] <b>descends</b> etc.”

Paragraph 171

<b>171. “How does it ascend through speech etc.”</b><br>He asks: <b>How does</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>ascend through speech?</b> He answers <b>that at first, when a person rises in the morning, he should bless</b> his Master <b>when he opens his eyes. How does he bless? This is what the early pious ones would do. They would set a vessel containing water before them, and when they awoke at night they would wash their hands, stand and engage in Torah, and recite a blessing over its reading. When the rooster calls out, when it is exactly midnight, at which point the Holy One, blessed be He, is with the righteous in the Garden of Eden. It is prohibited to bless in the morning with impure and contaminated hands, and the same applies at every hour.</b>
Explanation: [Rabbi Elazar] raises the following difficulty: Since it was said that the start of the rectification of the <i>Malkhut</i> should be with <b>“the whispering of the lips,”</b> why do we bless out loud immediately upon waking up from sleep? [It would make more sense that] one should rather bless in a whisper, in order to first draw the voice from the <i>Imma</i> [aspect of <i>Bina</i>], which is to raise the <i>Malkhut</i> through <b>speech,</b> with the voice of the <i>Imma</i>.
[Rabbi Elazar] answers that <b>the early pious ones</b> instituted that this rectification should be through action, for the ascent of the feminine waters occurs either through action or speech, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Beḥukkotai</i>, 5). Therefore, since during one’s sleep the spirit of holiness departs and the spirit of impurity of the primordial snake rests upon him (for sleep is one sixtieth of death, as is known (<i>Berakhot</i> 57b) and death is from the impurity of the primordial snake), it follows that upon waking up from sleep, that evil spirit has not entirely separated from him. It still rests upon the tips of his fingers. The reason [for this] is that the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> cleaves greatly to anything which is very holy and the fingers are holier than the rest of the body, for they are the place of resting of the <i>Ḥokhma</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And all the wise-hearted [<i>ḥokhmat lev</i>] women spun with their hands” [Exodus 35:25]. Consequently, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is the aspect of death, does not separate from there even after one wakes up.
This [state of impurity] requires an action, which is the washing of hands, for which one must prepare two vessels: A higher one, which is called a <b><i>natla</i></b> [“washing cup”], and a lower vessel for receiving the contamination. The higher vessel that is called a <b><i>natla</i></b> alludes to the vessel of the <i>Bina</i>, for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> flees from the light of the <i>Bina</i>. Thus, the washing of fingers with the waters of the <i>Bina</i> chases away the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> from there, and the <i>Malkhut</i> is purified from the aspect of evil within it and remains good. Then it is possible to engage in the Torah and recite a blessing over the Torah. The act of washing the hands resembles the raising of the feminine waters through <b>the whispering of the lips</b> to <b>the wings of the mother.</b> This resolves the difficulty that [Rabbi Elazar] raised.
Now, when the rooster calls out, it is exactly midnight, which is the mystical meaning of the verse: “The greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night etc.” (Genesis 1:16). The holy Divine Presence was diminished in the mystical meaning of the lesser light, and it was enclothed in the <i>kelippot</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “Her feet go down to death” (Proverbs 5:5). This is referring to the tree of [the knowledge of] good and evil: “If a person merits, it is good; if he does not merit, it is evil” (as stated in section #123# above; see there). There are thus two halves in [<i>Malkhut</i>]: Good and evil, i. e., a half if one merits and a half if one does not merit.
Therefore, the rule [of <i>Malkhut</i>] as well, which is the night, was likewise divided into two halves. The first half of the night is an expression of “he does not merit, and it is evil,” in the mystical meaning of the verse: “You make darkness and it becomes night, in which all the beasts of the forest prowl” (Psalms 104:20), while the second half of the night is of the aspect of “one merits and it is good.” Now, the first rectification for the good half is performed at the exact point of midnight, since then the <i>Malkhut</i> receives the voice of <i>Bina</i>, that is, the <i>Malkhut</i> ascends and is tempered within the <i>Malkhut</i> of the <i>Imma</i> [aspect of <i>Bina</i>]. The [aspect of] judgment inside the <i>Malkhut</i> becomes a holy judgment, from the side of the good, without any evil at all. The meaning [of this] is that this judgment falls and rests over the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] becomes mercy over Israel.
You can thereby understand the statement of the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parashat Shelaḥ</i>, p. 103, 267): <b>After midnight, a flame of Isaac’s pillar emerges and strikes that rooster who is called <i>gever</i></b> [“rooster”; “man”], <b>in the form of another man, higher than him.</b> Isaac is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i>. The <b>flame of Isaac’s pillar</b> is the mystical meaning of the judgment of <i>Bina</i>, and the angel Gabriel is called <b>a rooster, <i>gever</i>,</b> alluding to the attribute of <i>Gevura</i>, for he serves <b>a man higher than him,</b> i. e., <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, the mystical meaning of the lesser light. [The <i>Zohar</i>] adds that the judgment of <i>Bina</i> <b>strikes</b> under the wings of Gabriel, and thus the <i>Malkhut</i> receives the voice of <i>Bina</i> through him.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] further states there (268): <b>When</b> [Gabriel] <b>calls, all the roosters of this world call out, and another flame emerges from him, reaching them under their wings, and they call out.</b> When Gabriel sounds the voice of <i>Bina</i> to the <b>higher man,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, the flame emerges from Gabriel, <b>reaching</b> all the roosters of this world, which is the aspect of the judgments in the space of this world. All of them call out only through this voice that was tempered with the attribute of mercy from <i>Bina</i>.
As a result, the aspect of the voice, which is the [power of] judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, no longer rules over the second half of the night. Its place is taken by the voice of <i>Bina</i>, represented by the roosters of this world. [Rabbi Elazar] thus states here that <b>“when the rooster calls it is exactly midnight,”</b> because the rooster indicates that the voice of <i>Bina</i> has already been accepted into <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated, which is the exact point of midnight, from when the <b>half of the night</b> begins that is good without any evil at all, as stated.
Once the <i>Malkhut</i> has received the voice of <i>Bina</i>, the righteous raise feminine waters by means of the Torah in which they engage after midnight. They raise [the feminine waters] to the [level of] the joyous restraints of the supernal <i>Imma</i>. Then it is stated: “She rises while it is yet night” (Proverbs 31:15), for then she appears in all her splendor and glory. This is the manner of the holy <i>Malkhut</i>, to appear only at night, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parashat Pineḥas</i>, p. 267; <i>Saba DeMishpatim</i>, p. 7, 15): <b>“She goes by day and appears by night, and dispenses</b> [food] <b>in the morning.”</b>
The revealing of [<i>Malkhut</i>] is only in the Garden of Eden, i. e., to those righteous who rectify [<i>Malkhut</i>] in that fashion, with their Torah engagement, which they study after midnight (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Lekh Lekha</i>, p. 123). This is the meaning of the statement here [that] <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, is with the righteous in the Garden of Eden.”</b> The holy Divine Presence is then rectified in the mystical meaning of the Garden of Eden, as [the Divine Presence] is watered from the river of pleasantness, which is the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and plays with the righteous, who are included in [the Divine Presence] in the mystical meaning of the feminine waters.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“It is prohibited to bless in the morning with impure and contaminated hands, and the same applies at every hour.”</b> As has already been explained at the start of this section, the spirit of impurity from the primordial snake remains on one’s fingers even after he has awoken from his sleep, and this contamination can be removed only by washing with a vessel; see there. [The <i>Zohar</i>] states that the same applies at every <b>hour,</b> i. e., not necessarily after sleep. Rather, all contamination and dirt is a purchase place for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and it is prohibited to bless until after one has washed [one's hands] in water.

Paragraph 172

<b>172. “For at the time etc.”</b><br><b>Because, at the time when a person is asleep, his spirit departs from him, and when the spirit departs from him the spirit of impurity is ready for him and rests upon his hands and defiles them. It is prohibited to bless in that state, without washing the hands. You might say: If so, during the daytime, when one does not sleep and the spirit does not depart from him and the spirit of impurity does not rest upon him, and</b> yet <b>when he enters a lavatory, he may not recite a blessing or read even a single word of the Torah until he has washed his hands. If you say that it is because they are dirty, that is not the case, for with what did they become dirty?</b>

Paragraph 173

<b>173. “Rather, woe to those inhabitants etc.”</b><br><b>Rather, woe to those inhabitants of the world who do not notice and are unaware of the glory of their Master, and do not know on what the world stands. There is a certain spirit in every lavatory in the world, which resides there and enjoys that disgust and feces, and immediately rests upon those fingers of a person.</b>

Paragraph 174

<b>174. “Rabbi Shimon opened etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “One who rejoices on the festivals but does not give his portion to the Holy One, blessed be He, that evil-eyed one, the <i>satan</i>, hates him, slanders him, removes him from the world, and brings upon him troubles several times over.”</b>
Explanation: As has already been explained above (section #68#, 4th paragraph), there are male and female [aspects] in the <i>kelippot</i>. The male is not as evil as the female and he does not cause people to stumble into lying in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. On the contrary, he encourages [a person] to perform commandments, only not in purity, in order to give contentment to his Maker, but with a mixture of his own pleasure. This is the mystical meaning of: “Do not eat the bread of he who has an evil-eye etc. ‘eat and drink’ he says to you, but his heart is not with you” (Proverbs 23:6–7).
Since [the person's] intention [in this impure form] is not to give [to his Maker], the commandment has no flavor, and it lacks love and fear, i. e., the heart is not in it. However, since [the male of the <i>kelippot</i>] has already lured the person into his net, [the male] subsequently has the strength to engage in a pairing with his <i>Nukba</i> of the great deep, an evil and bitter <i>kelippa</i>, who [creates] forgeries in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and then removes [the person's] soul from him (see there in detail). This is the meaning of the statement here: <b>“That evil-eyed one, the <i>satan</i>, hates him, slanders him, removes him from the world, and brings upon him troubles several times over.”</b> Once [the male of the <i>kelippot</i> called the <i>satan</i>] has caused [the person] to stumble with respect to the commandment of rejoicing on a festival, so that [the person] does not give satisfaction to his Maker (which is evident from his eating alone and not providing benefit to the poor), [the male of the <i>kelippot</i>] proceeds to engage in a pairing with his <i>Nukba</i> and removes [the person's] soul.

Paragraph 175

<b>175. “The share of the Holy One, blessed be He, is to gladden etc.”</b><br><b>The portion of the Holy One, blessed be He, is to gladden the poor as best as one can, for on these days,</b> the festivals, <b>the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to see these broken vessels of His. He enters their</b> [place]<b>, and sees that they have nothing with which to rejoice, and He weeps for them and ascends upwards to destroy the world.</b>
Explanation: In order to comprehend this section, and the accusation of the higher angels, one must first understand a midrash of the Sages (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 8:5), that upon the creation of the world, when [God] said to the angels, “Let us make man in our image” [Genesis 1:26], Kindness said: “Let him be created, for he performs acts of kindness.” Truth said: “Let him not be created, for he is all falsehoods.” Charity said: “Let him be created, for he performs charity,” and Peace said: “Let him not be created, for he is all conflict.” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He took Truth and cast it to the ground, as it is stated: “And cast truth to the ground” (Daniel 8:12). See there.
The meaning [of this midrash] is as follows: There is a well-known statement of the Sages that a person should always engage in Torah and commandments even not for their sake, because from [doing them] not for their sake one comes to [perform them] for their sake (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 50b). The reason is that due to man’s lowly state, he cannot begin at the very outset by engaging in commandments in order to give satisfaction to his Maker. For “a man is born a wild donkey’s colt” (Job 11:12), and he is unable from his nature to make any kind of movement other than for his own benefit. He must therefore necessarily start by engaging in commandments not for their sake, [but instead, ] for his own advantage. And yet, by means of the actions [he performs] of commandments, he draws forth a <i>shefa</i> of holiness, such that through the <i>shefa</i> that he draws forth he will eventually come to engage in commandments for their own sake, which is in order to bring satisfaction to his Maker.
This is the meaning of Truth’s complaint about the creation of man, when [Truth] said that [man] is all falsehoods. [Truth] was complaining, [saying] how can such a man be created from the outset in order to engage in Torah and [its] commandments in complete falsehood, i. e., not for their own sake? However, Kindness declared: “Let him be created, for he performs acts of kindness,” since through the acts of kindness that he does, which are necessarily distilled acts for the purpose of giving, he is thereby gradually rectified until he can engage in all the commandments in order to give. Consequently, he is certain to eventually reach his goal of engagement for their own sake. This is why Kindness argued that he should be created.
Similarly, Peace complained that he was all strife, since he cannot engage in the commandments in order to give, but only together with a mixture of his own pleasure, and thus he is always in a state of conflict with the Holy One, blessed be He, because it seems to [the person] that he is completely righteous. He does not sense his own deficiencies at all; that is, he does not realize that all of his engagement in Torah and the commandments is not for their own sake, and he grows increasingly angry with the Holy One, blessed be He, when he does not receive the appropriate reward of a completely righteous person. He is therefore constantly changing his mind: At certain times he is in harmony with God, while at others he is in a state of conflict, Heaven forbid. This is why Peace claimed that [man] should not be created.
But Charity said: “Let him be created, for he performs charitable acts,” since through the commandment of giving charity to the poor, one gradually draws closer to the attribute of giving until he comes to engage [in Torah] for its own sake and he will be rewarded with eternal peace with the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, he should be created. After their arguments were heard, the Holy One, blessed be He, agreed with the angels Kindness and Charity, and cast Truth to the ground. This means to say that He permitted the initial engagement in commandments to be not for their sake, even though this is a falsehood. He thus “cast Truth to the ground” because He accepted the argument of Kindness and Charity that through the commandments of acts of kindness and giving charity to the poor, one will eventually arrive at the truth, which is to serve the Holy One, blessed be He, only in order to please Him. [The person] will eventually come to [perform them] for their sake, and then truth will rise from the ground.
This, too, is the mystical meaning of the breaking of the vessels which occurred before the creation of the world. Through the breaking of the vessels of holiness and their fall into the [worlds of] <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> of separation, sparks of holiness fell with them into the <i>kelippot</i>. From these [sparks], all the different kinds of pleasures and loves came into the domain of the <i>kelippot</i>, [and these <i>kelippot</i>] transfer them into man’s reception and for his pleasure. They thereby cause all sorts of transgressions, such as theft, robbery, and murder. However, at the same time He also gave us the Torah and [its] commandments. Even if one begins by engaging in them not for their own sake, but for one’s own pleasure, to satisfy his base lusts, in accordance with the powers of the breaking of the vessels, [the person] will thereby eventually come to [perform them] for their own sake. [Through this, the person] will merit the purpose of creation, which is to receive all the delight and pleasure of [God’s initial] intent for the Creation, in order to give Him satisfaction, as stated.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“On these days, the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to see these broken vessels of His.”</b> On the festivals, when a person observes the commandment to rejoice on a festival from all the abundance that the Holy One, blessed be He, has given him, the Holy One, blessed be He, goes to examine His broken vessels. [It is] through [these broken vessels] that man has been given an opportunity to engage in commandments not for their own sake, as stated. He wishes to see the extent to which [the vessels] have fulfilled their purpose of bringing man to [the state of performing them] for their own sake.
But He <b>“sees that they,”</b> the broken vessels, <b>“have nothing with which to rejoice, and He weeps for them.”</b> He sees that nothing has yet been distilled from them, i. e., they have not brought the person into [performing the commandments] for their sake at all, but rather he engages in the joy of the festival only for his own pleasure. He thus <b>“weeps for them,”</b> i. e., it is as though He regrets having broken them, since He broke them and cast Truth to the ground only for man’s benefit, so that he could begin to serve [God] not for [God's own] sake and then arrive at [performing the commandments] for [God's] sake. When He sees that man has not budged one iota from his selfish desires, this shows that He has broken them in vain, and He therefore weeps for them.
“[God] <b>ascends upwards to destroy the world.”</b> That is, it as though He is rising to remove the <i>shefa</i> from the world and destroy it. [This is] because if the [act of performing commandments] not for their sake is unable to bring man into [performing them] for their sake, the consequence is that the <i>shefa</i> itself is bad for him, since he thereby sinks further into the <i>kelippa</i> of [selfish] receiving. Consequently, it is better for man that [God] stops the <i>shefa</i> for him and destroys it entirely.

Paragraph 176

<b>176. “The members of the academy come, etc.”</b><br><b>The members of the academy come before Him and say: Master of the world. You are called merciful and compassionate. Let Your mercies roll upon your children. He replies: Have I not made the world with anything other than mercy, as it is stated: “The world is built through mercy”</b> [<i>ḥesed</i>, Psalms 89:3], <b>and the world stands upon this.</b> If they do not perform kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>] with the poor, I will destroy the world. <b>The supernal angels say before Him: Master of the world, here is So-and-So, who ate and drank to satiate</b> [himself]<b>, and who could perform mercy with the poor, but he gave them nothing. The accuser comes, claims permission, and pursues that man.</b>
Explanation: The higher souls who are called <b>“members of the academy”</b> begin at that time to pray for the lower [beings], that He will not cease the <i>shefa</i> from them, and that He should be merciful toward His children. They speak in [the lower ones’] favor before Him, saying: “Since they perform His commandments with faith, they are called ‘children of the Omnipresent, ’ and therefore they are worthy of mercy, as a father has mercy upon his children.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replies to them: “Did I not build the world on <b>mercy,</b> as it is written etc. and the world stands only upon <b>mercy.</b>
In other words, no rectification will come to them through the <i>shefa</i> while they fail to provide benefit to the poor, since the creation of the world was based on My agreement with the angels of mercy that by performing mercy with one another the world will exist and they will come to [perform commandments] for their own sake. But now that they are not [performing] actions of mercy, no rectification will sprout from it.
The supernal angels then said before Him: “Master of the world, here is So-and-So, who ate and was satiated, and he could perform mercy with the poor, but he gave them nothing.” That is, even the supernal angels, i. e., the angels Kindness and Charity and all those who agreed to the creation, began to slander it, for they only agreed with creation in this manner of not for its own sake in order that kindness and charity will be performed, through which [the people] will come to [perform commandments] for their own sake. Now, however, since [people] are not doing this, and they are not capable of arriving at [the performance of commandments] for their own sake, [the angels] regret their agreement and slander man. Then <b>“the accuser comes, claims permission, and pursues after that man,”</b> for once it has been made clear that the man is unfit to achieve [doing good] for its own sake through [the performance of] his commandments, permission is granted to the accuser to execute [his mission].

Paragraph 177

<b>177. “Who in the world, etc.”</b><br><b>Who in the world is greater for us than Abraham, who performed kindness with all people? On the day when he made a feast, what is written? “And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned”</b> [Genesis 21:8]. <b>Abraham made a feast and called all the greatest in the generation to that feast. And we learned</b> [that] <b>in any feast of joy, that accuser goes and observes: If that person first performed kindness with the poor, and if there are poor in the house, the accuser departs from that house and does not enter there. But if not, the accuser enters there and he sees the mixture of joy without the poor and without first performing kindness with the poor,</b> [and] <b>he ascends upwards and slanders him.</b>

Paragraph 178

<b>178. “Since Abraham invited, etc.”</b><br><b>Since Abraham invited the greatest of the generation, the accuser descended and stood at the door, like a poor man, but there was no one to notice him. Abraham was serving the kings and the ministers. Sarah was nursing everybody’s children, because they did not believe it when she gave birth; instead, they said that Isaac was a foundling, that they had brought him off the street. For this reason they brought their children with them, and Sarah took them and nursed them in front of them, as it is stated: “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?”</b> [Genesis 21:7]. It should have said: “Sarah would nurse a child.” <b>Rather, “children”</b> [is] <b>certainly</b> [meant], i. e., the children of all the guests. <b>Now, that accuser was standing at the door. Sarah proclaimed: “God has made laughter for me”</b> [Genesis 21:6]. <b>Immediately, the accuser ascended before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said to Him: “Master of the world, You said, ‘Abraham My friend’</b> [Isaiah 41:8], <b>but he has prepared a feast and has not given You anything, nor to the poor. He did not offer before You even a single dove. Furthermore, Sarah said that You laughed at her.”</b>
This requires explanation: [Abraham] excelled primarily in hospitality and kindness, and he would always stand at crossroads in order to invite guests (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Emor</i>, p. 171, 279). How, then, could he have failed in this matter of not giving to the poor? Moreover, why did the accuser go to the trouble of disguising himself as a pauper, which he did not do in other cases? In fact, this is not to be understood in accordance with its plain meaning, but there is a great secret here, which applies only to the loftiest holy ones.
See the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parashat Pekudei</i>, p. 106, 329): <b>“Rabbi Shimon said: Even though</b> etc. <b>and it is necessary to subdue the impure spirit on all sides. Come and I will tell you a secret that can be revealed only to the lofty, holy ones</b> etc. <b>It is required, for the secret of <i>tefillin</i>, to insert a single hair of a calf, such that it sticks out and is visible,</b> etc. <b>And that hair should be placed inside our higher holiness... so he will not accuse him and will be unable to harm him above or below, for he has given him this place. And if that portion in holiness is not given to him,</b> [the accuser] <b>could harm him below and ascend and accuse him above</b> etc.”
The meaning is as follows: Before the completion of the rectification, it is impossible to remove the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> entirely, even for the loftiest righteous and holy ones. As much as a righteous person is careful to perform a commandment in purity, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> still has the power to accuse him and show some deficiency in the commandment. For this reason, God prepared for the righteous another manner of subduing and silencing the accuser, which is to give a small portion of the holiness to that accuser who remains. This silences the accuser, for he does not wish to accuse [the person], so as not to lose his portion of the holiness that he has from that commandment. This is the mystical meaning of the hair that we place in <i>tefillin</i>, and it is also the mystical meaning of the goat that is sent away [on Yom Kippur], and the red heifer; see there in detail. You can find further elaboration on this in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parashat Emor</i>, p. 88).
Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] says here: <b>“The accuser descended and stood at the door, like a poor man, but there was no-one to notice him.”</b> Of course [Abraham] fed all the poor from his feast, in his unwavering hospitality. Only that accuser, which no purification can effectively remove except by providing him with a little benefit from that holiness, as stated, appeared here as a poor man because he wanted to receive his share of the holiness. Abraham, however, did not wish to give the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> any part of the holiness. Rather, he wished to defeat it with his strength and rebuff it completely. Therefore, the accuser ascended and complained, as [the <i>Zohar</i>] continues to explain. This is why the <i>Zohar</i> says that <b>the accuser descended as a poor man,</b> for it was not really a poor man but rather the accuser disguised as a poor man, demanding to enjoy Abraham’s feast, as explained. But Abraham sensed that he was from the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and therefore he did not wish to give him anything.
When [the <i>Zohar</i>] says <b>“even a single dove,”</b> this contains a lofty allusion, for according to the order of the sacrifices young pigeons must be brought in pairs, corresponding to the two points that are incorporated together in the <i>Malkhut</i> that is tempered with the attribute of mercy. [This <i>Malkhut</i>] contains judgment and mercy together; the [attribute of] judgment within it is hidden and concealed, while the mercy inside it is in a revealed state (as stated in section #122#, above). Without this tempering [of judgment with mercy] the world would not be able to exist, as stated. For this reason, doves are only sacrificed in pairs. This is indicated in [the fact that] the mystical meaning of <b>a single dove</b> is the dove that Noah sent out from the ark, which did not return to him again (Genesis 8:12). A single dove alludes to the attribute of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> without the tempering of the attribute of mercy. Since Noah could not effect any rectification in [that single dove], it did not return to him again (see <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Shelaḥ</i>, p. 52).
We have already explained the issue of the accuser demanding his share from Abraham’s feast on the day he weaned his son. It is the rectification of a deficiency that cannot be rectified before the completion of the rectification in any other manner (as stated just above). Know that this is the mystical meaning of the attribute of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, through which [in isolation, without the tempering of mercy] the world cannot exist, and which must remain hidden and concealed. This is also the mystical meaning of the dove that did not return again to Noah, as stated. Abraham, however, had the ability to rectify it, and he was obliged to do so by giving something to the accuser in order to silence him (as stated just above). But since he did not give anything to the accuser, [the accuser] ascended and accused.
This is the meaning of [the <i>Zohar</i>'s statement]: <b>“And has not given You anything, nor to the poor.”</b> His accusation was that in this entire feast, [Abraham] did not rectify anything of the attribute of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, which is called “poor,” since [this <i>Malkhut</i>] has nothing of its own. [This <i>Malkhut</i> is the share of the Holy One, blessed be He, since it is the essence of the <i>Malkhut</i> that is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, [and <i>Ze'er Anpin</i> is called] the Holy One, blessed be He. [The Holy One] only tempered [<i>Malkhut</i>] with the attribute of mercy for the purpose of sustaining the world. Consequently, the brains that are drawn forth by the attribute of mercy are regarded as the share of the inhabitants of the world, for they thereby rectify the essence of the <i>Malkhut</i> as well, which is the share of the Holy One, blessed be He, alone.
[Now, ] because of the great miracle, that <b>Sarah nursed children</b>, Abraham was able to draw forth all the brains that are in the attribute of mercy. [This gave him] sufficient ability to rectify the aspect of the "poor" in <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the share of the Holy One, blessed be He. This is why [the accuser] accused: <b>“He has not given You anything,”</b> i. e., the share of the Holy One, blessed be He; <b>“nor to the poor,”</b> that is, the share of the main essence of the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is in a state of poverty because the inhabitants of the world cannot rectify with it. <b>“He did not offer before You even a single dove,”</b> i. e., the dove that Noah could not rectify, as stated.
<b>“Furthermore, Sarah said You laughed at her.”</b> Sarah is the mystical meaning of <i>Bina</i> and the attribute of mercy that illuminates in <i>Malkhut</i>. When she declared: <b>“God has made laughter for me; whoever hears will laugh for me”</b> [Genesis 21:6], she thereby drew forth a complete light and very great tempering, until there was no longer any visible deficiency in the essential attribute of the <i>Malkhut</i>. This caused a great concern that as a consequence there would be no attention given to rectifying the essence of the <i>Malkhut</i>. This is similar to the mystical meaning of the verse: “Lest he put forth his hand [and take also] from the tree of life, and eat and live forever” (Genesis 3:22), meaning that he would no longer feel any deficiency in himself and would not be compelled to rectify the flaw in the Tree of Knowledge.

Paragraph 179

<b>179. “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, etc.”</b><br><b>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: “Who in the world is like Abraham?” But</b> the accuser <b>did not budge from there until he had confused all of that joy and the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded to sacrifice Isaac as an offering and Sarah was condemned to die with grief for her son. All of that sorrow was because he did not give something to the poor.</b>
Explanation: The purpose of the binding of Isaac was to rectify the essence of the <i>Malkhut</i>, which he did not rectify through the great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. The death of Sarah was due to the great lights that she drew forth in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“God has made laughter for me</b> etc.” [Genesis 21:6], which obstructed the rectification of the <i>Malkhut</i>, as stated.

Paragraph 180

<b>180. “Rabbi Shimon opened, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: With regard to the verse: “And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord”</b> [Isaiah 38:2] – <b>come and see how great is the power of the Torah and how it is superior to everything. Anyone who engages in the Torah fears neither the higher ones nor the lower ones, and he does not fear evil illnesses in the world, because he is holding onto to the tree of life and he learns from it every day.</b>

Paragraph 181

<b>181. “For the Torah teaches, etc.”</b><br><b>Because the Torah teaches a person to walk along the path of truth. It provides him with counsel on how to repent before his Master, to revoke the decree. Even if it is sentenced upon him that the decree will not be revoked, it is immediately nullified and removed from him, and it does not reside upon a person in this world. For this reason, a person must engage in Torah day and night and never depart from it, as it is stated: “And you shall meditate on it day and night”</b> [Joshua 1:8]. <b>If one departs from the Torah or separates from it, it is as though he has separated from the tree of life.</b>
Explanation: [Rabbi Shimon] began with a prayer, from the verse: <b>“And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall,”</b> which he interprets as referring specifically to the Torah. The idea is, as stated elsewhere (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashat Vaetḥanan</i>, p. 4, 11), that his prayer was accepted because nothing separated between him and the wall, which is the mystical meaning of the holy Divine Presence.
[Rabbi Shimon] thus states here that this counsel was successful for him only through the power of the Torah, by means of which he achieved complete repentance, to the extent that there was nothing separating him from holy Divine Presence. Consequently, the sentence of death that was decreed upon him was nullified. This is why [Rabbi Shimon] concludes with <b>“for this reason</b> [etc. ],” because we see that the power of the Torah is so great that it can nullify a death sentence, [and therefore] <b>“a person must engage in Torah day and night, and never depart from it.”</b>

Paragraph 182

<b>182. “Come and see, a counsel for a person, etc.”</b><br><b>Come and see, advice for a person: When one goes to bed at night, he should accept upon himself the kingship of above with a whole heart, and straight away deposit his soul with Him. Immediately, he will be spared of all bad illnesses and all the evil spirits, for they will not rule over him.</b>
Explanation: The Lord called the light “day,” i. e., the light of cleaving and holiness that we attain from God. This is the “governance of the day.” He called the darkness “night,” i. e., the forces of separation that separate us from His light. This is “the governance of the night” [see Genesis 1:5, 16]. Therefore, we sleep at night, which is one-sixtieth of death [see <i>Berakhot</i> 57b], which is [under] the governance of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Due to these two [categories of] governance, we are unable cleave to Him constantly, because we stop cleaving to Him due to the force of the governance of the night, which always returns over us and bars us from His service.
To rectify this, Rabbi Shimon offers us the advice that every night, before going to sleep, one <b>“should accept upon himself the kingship of above with a whole heart.”</b> When the night is rectified like in the act of creation, as it is stated: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day” [Genesis 1:5] – which means that night and day were both united into a single body and one day – then the night is called “the rule of <i>Malkhut</i>,” and no <i>kelippa</i> will be mingled with it.
Therefore, a person should likewise accept upon himself this supernal kingship [<i>Malkhut</i>] with a whole heart, without any barrier between himself and the <i>Malkhut</i>. In other words, he must accept upon himself the kingdom of heaven whether for life or for death, such that nothing in the world could remove him by any degree from the supernal kingdom. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might” [Deuteronomy 6:5]. If he accepts this upon himself wholeheartedly, he can be certain about himself that nothing could possibly separate him from God.
He will thereby be considered through this [acceptance] as having straight away <b>deposited his soul,</b> i. e., he did not delay in handing his soul over to the Holy One, blessed be He. [This] means [to show] that [the person] observes His commandments in full, to the extent that [the person] would relinquish his soul [for God]. Consequently, when he sleeps and his spirit departs, he no longer tastes one-sixtieth of death [in that departure], which is the power of Samael, but only the aspect of giving his life for the path of the commandments. The power of death no longer controls him, since he has inserted it into the power of giving his life for the commandments.
Once he has done so, the governance of the night can no longer harm him and prevent him from the pleasantness of the service of God. For him, the evening and the morning are now one day, and the night is truly only a part of the day. Accordingly, <b>he will immediately be spared of all bad illnesses and all the evil spirits, for they will not rule over him.</b> His night has already left the domain of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, since he can no longer imagine that anything could come between him and the holy Divine Presence, and the forces of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and judgment no longer rule over him.

Paragraph 183

<b>183. “And in the morning, when one rises from his bed, etc.”</b><br><b>And in the morning, when one rises from his bed, he must bless his Master and enter His house and bow before His sanctuary in great fear. Subsequently, he should pray his prayer. He should take counsel from the holy forefathers, as it is stated: “But as for me, in the abundance of Your kindness I will come into Your house; I will bow towards Your holy sanctuary in fear of You”</b> [Psalms 5:8].
Explanation: This is an interpretation of the verse “But as for me, in the abundance of Your lovingkindness I will come into Your house; I will bow towards Your holy sanctuary in fear of You.” <b>“But as for me, in the abundance of Your kindness”</b> means <b>to bless his Master</b> for the kindness He has performed to him. <b>“I will come into Your house”</b> is <b>to enter His house.</b> “<b>I will bow towards Your holy sanctuary”</b> is <b>to bow before His sanctuary. “In fear of You”</b> is <b>with great fear. Subsequently, he should pray his prayer.</b> The reason for this will be clarified below.
The [<i>Zohar</i>] states that one should <b>“take counsel</b> [from the holy forefathers].” The prayer that we recite is the rectification of the holy Divine Presence, to draw the <i>shefa</i> to [the Divine Presence], to make it whole from all deficiencies. This is why all requests are in the plural form, such as: “And grant us knowledge...” “Restore us, our Father, etc.” Prayer is on behalf of the whole of Israel, since everything that is in the holy Divine Presence is in the whole of Israel. [Similarly, ] that which is lacking in [the Divine Presence] is likewise lacking in the whole of Israel. Thus, when we pray on behalf of the whole of Israel, we are praying for the sake of the holy Divine Presence, since they are one and the same.
Accordingly, before the prayer we must look toward the deficiencies [in the Divine Presence], in order to know what requires rectification and must be completed. However, all the generations of the whole of Israel are incorporated in the holy Divine Presence, and we no longer need to rectify all those rectifications that it has undergone from the generations that came before us. Instead, we must complement them, i. e., rectify what is still lacking in [the Divine Presence] after their rectifications.
Now, the holy forefathers are the macrocosm of the whole of Israel, for they are the three roots of all six hundred thousand souls of Israel from each generation until the completion of the rectification. All the drawings forth and <i>shefa</i> that the whole of Israel draw forth and receive throughout the generations are first received by way of the holy forefathers, from whom the <i>shefa</i> reaches the whole of Israel in that generation who drew forth the <i>shefa</i>. This is the spiritual order: No branch can receive anything other than through its root and the primary illumination remains in the root, and only a part of it extends to the branch. It therefore follows that all the rectifications that were already rectified in the holy Divine Presence flourish in the souls of our holy forefathers.
This is the meaning of the statement [in the next section]: <b>“One should not enter the synagogue unless he has first consulted with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</b> As explained, the entire purpose of our prayer is to complete what is still lacking in the holy Divine Presence, after the rectifications that have already been wrought in it up to this point. Therefore, we must first know and draw forth in the holy Divine Presence all the rectifications that have already been rectified in it, and then we will know what still needs to be added to them.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that a person may not enter the synagogue before seeking counsel from the holy forefathers, since one must consult them in order to know what still needs rectification. This is possible only after we have drawn forth in the holy Divine Presence everything that the holy forefathers have already rectified, and we will then be able to see what remains lacking in [the Divine Presence]. This is the meaning of the statement [in the next section]: <b>“For they instituted the prayer”</b> – the holy Divine Presence that Abraham instituted [and rectified] is called <b>the morning prayer,</b> that of Isaac is <b>the afternoon prayer,</b> while that of Jacob is <b>the evening prayer.</b> Consequently, we must first draw forth the full measure of rectification that they already rectified [by instituting] <b>the prayer,</b> and then we will know what prayer is still required, and how to rectify what remains lacking in [the Divine Presence].

Paragraph 184

<b>184. “They established it as follows, etc.”</b><br><b>They established it as follows: One should not enter the synagogue unless he has first consulted with,</b> i. e., received permission from, <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they instituted the prayer before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated: “But as for me, in the abundance of Your kindness</b> [<i>ḥasdekha</i>] <b>I will come into Your house” – this is Abraham,</b> who is <i>Ḥesed</i>. <b>“I will bow towards Your holy sanctuary” – this is Isaac,</b> on whose account the <i>Malkhut</i> is called a “sanctuary.” <b>“In fear of You” – this is Jacob,</b> who is the mystical meaning of <i>Tiferet</i>, called “awesome.” <b>One must first be incorporated in them, and subsequently enter the synagogue and pray his prayer. Then it is stated: “And He said to me: You are My servant Israel, in whom I will be glorified”</b> [Isaiah 49:3].
Explanation: Here [the <i>Zohar</i>] presents three encompassing rectifications that were performed on the holy Divine Presence by the forefathers: <b>Abraham</b> rectified it in the aspect of <b>house,</b> meaning a permanent residence, such that one can cleave to [the Divine Presence] enduringly, just as a person is constantly in his own home. <b>Isaac</b> added a rectification and rectified it in the aspect of a <b>holy sanctuary.</b> This means that the King resides in [the Divine Presence] on a permanent basis, for the King is always in His palace.
<b>Jacob</b> added another rectification and rectified [the Divine Presence] with the aspect of <b>fear,</b> which is the concept of <b>the gate to the residence,</b> the aspect of an opening, both for the aspect of house and the aspect of holy sanctuary within [the Divine Presence], in the mystical meaning of the verse [spoken by Jacob: “And he was afraid, and said]: How full of awe is this place! [This is none other than the house of God, ] and this is the gate of heaven” [Genesis 28:17]. Once a person is already completely incorporated in those three rectifications of the forefathers, he can experience the full measure that has already been rectified in the holy Divine Presence. Then he may <b>“enter the synagogue and pray his prayer,”</b> to rectify the Divine Presence in what is still lacking in it.
The meaning is as follows: Abraham is the root of <i>Ḥesed</i> in the souls of Israel, because he rectified the holy Divine Presence into a receptacle for the light of <i>Ḥesed</i>, and [the Divine Presence] received the light of giving for all the souls of Israel, in their fullness. Had it remained thus, all of Israel would have cleaved to the Creator in a permanent manner, and the holy Divine Presence would be the house of <i>Malkhut</i>, filled with every goodness and pleasure, and not a single person would wish to part from her even for a moment.
However, the entire rectification of Abraham was in the mystical meaning of fashioning a whole receptacle without any possibility of a flaw, for the light of giving. That is, he raised [the Divine Presence within himself] into an expression of giving and satisfaction to our Maker, without receiving anything for our own benefit, since this is the [essence of the] attribute and receptacle of the light of <i>Ḥesed</i>. This is as the Sages said regarding the attribute of a person who says “what is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours,” that he is a pious individual [<i>ḥassid</i>; <i>Avot</i> 5:10], as he does not demand anything at all for his own benefit.
Since all the constrictions and the whole grip of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> are only the aspect of receiving for oneself, it follows that [Abraham, by rectifying to receive only in order to give] thereby entirely removed the filth of the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and the Divine Presence was established [within him] in complete purity. However, [God’s initial] intent for the Creation was not completed through this, since [His] intent for the Creation was primarily to provide benefit to His creatures. Now, the measure of benefit is dependent upon and evaluated only by the measure of the desire to receive, because the measure of pleasure from receiving [what one desires] is in accordance with the maturity of the desire to receive.
Therefore, since the Divine Presence had been rectified [by Abraham] only into a vessel of giving, without any receiving for himself at all, this was an avoidance of [Abraham] receiving from Him and only giving to Him. As a result, no rectification came from this with respect to the fundamental intent for the Creation, since that can come only through the matured desire to receive.
This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“Abraham begot Isaac”</b> [Genesis 25:19]. When Isaac found the Divine Presence in a state of utter wholeness and fullness from the light of <i>Ḥesed</i>, by means of Abraham’s rectifications, he sensed the deficiency in the Divine Presence, that it was still unfit to receive all that is included in the intent for the Creation, as stated. He therefore went and rectified it into a receptacle, so that it would be fit to receive all the perfection that was desired and incorporated in the intent for the Creation. That is, he awakened the desire to receive from Him as well, but only in the form of a receiving in order to give. This means that one has a great desire to receive, but only because the Giver wishes it to be so. Had the Giver not wished for this, there would be no desire in [the receiver] whatsoever to receive from Him.
It is known that receiving in order to give is regarded as actual giving. As a result, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> no longer has any purchase upon this [kind of] will to receive. Thus, the holy Divine Presence was rectified by him in final, great wholeness, for now it was fit to receive all the pleasantness and softness from all that the Creator had in mind to provide benefit to His creatures, when they arose in [His] intent to create them.
For this reason, the holy Divine Presence is now called “His holy sanctuary,” for now the King resides in it in all his grandeur and splendor, like a king in his palace. However, with respect to the rectification of Abraham, it is called merely a house, i. e., the house of <i>Malkhut</i>, for His total glory and majesty was still not apparent there, since the glory of a king is apparent only in a sanctuary dedicated to him.
It is thus illustrated that Isaac rectified all of the restraint [<i>gevurot</i>] in the souls of Israel, meaning the tempering of all the judgments in His governing [of existence]. This is because all the constrictions, sufferings, and punishments that come into the world exist only in order to rectify the souls’ vessels of receiving, that they should be capable of receiving all of the goodness incorporated in [God’s initial] intent for the Creation. Since Isaac already fully rectified the Divine Presence back then, all of the restraints have thereby been rectified, since they have already achieved the desired goal for them.
However, his rectification also did not remain as such. The reason is that the world was still unfit for the completion of the rectification. Therefore, the evil Esau came out of him, who corrupted his rectification and did not maintain it such that he would receive only in order to give, as Isaac had rectified. Rather, [Esau] failed by receiving for himself. In other words, even when it was clear to [Esau] that the Giver did not want him to receive [something], he still wished to receive [that thing] for his own enjoyment. Accordingly, the <i>kelippot</i> and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> clung to [Esau], in the mystical meaning of “ruddy” [Genesis 25:25] and “a hairy man” [Genesis 27:11]. He thereby lowered the legs of <i>Malkhut</i> into the <i>kelippot</i> once again, in the mystical meaning of: “Her feet go down to death” [Proverbs 5:5].
When Jacob saw the corruption of the evil Esau, he went and rectified the holy Divine Presence through the attribute of fear. This is the mystical meaning of: “And his hand was holding onto Esau’s heel” [<i>akev</i>, Genesis 25:26]. As stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, that [letter] <i>yod</i> which Esau tossed to his heel [<i>akevoi</i>], Jacob [<i>Ya’akov</i>] raised to his head. That is, since Jacob saw the corruption of Esau in that <i>yod</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the Divine Presence, he rectified himself with great fear until he raised the Divine Presence to the form of a crown over his head. He thereby grabbed hold of the two rectifications of Abraham and Isaac at the same time, and no impaired [descendant] emerged from him.
However, this rectification is not yet a complete rectification, because the fear is similar to the fear of sin, as Esau’s heel caused [Jacob] to have that fear, so that he should not sin like [Esau]. By contrast, the completion of the rectification is after Esau’s heel has been nullified, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “He will eliminate death forever” [Isaiah 25:8]. At that stage, the fear will be only <b>because He is great and rules over everything.</b> Now, Jacob himself certainly attained that genuine fear as well, but in terms of the aspect of the whole of Israel this rectification still remains for all the generations that come after him, until the completion of the rectification.
Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“‘But as for me, in the abundance of Your kindness</b> [<i>ḥasdekha</i>] <b>I will come into Your house’ – this is Abraham,”</b> because <b>Abraham</b> rectified [the Divine Presence] with the aspect of the house of <i>Malkhut</i>, filled with all goodness, in the light of <i>Ḥesed</i>, as stated. <b>“‘I will bow towards Your holy sanctuary’ – this is Isaac,”</b> for <b>Isaac</b> rectified [the Divine Presence] with the aspect of the holy sanctuary, for the glory of the King’s honor, as is appropriate for Him, as stated. <b>“‘In fear of You” – this is Jacob,”</b> for <b>Jacob</b> rectified [the Divine Presence] with the attribute of fear, and thereby rectified it into a receptacle for all of the rectifications of Abraham and Isaac together, as stated above.
<b>“One must first be incorporated in them,”</b> for [without this] how will [the person] know what is still left to rectify in the Divine Presence unless he incorporates himself in all of these three rectifications that the holy forefathers have already rectified in [the Divine Presence]. That is, he must accept upon himself to behave in accordance with these rectifications, and he will thereby be considered to have been incorporated in their attributes, as stated.
It is only after [the person] has been incorporated in all three rectifications of our holy forefathers that he will begin to rectify [the Divine Presence] from the place that our forefather <b>Jacob</b> left for us, i. e., to elevate fear to the quality of exaltedness, “because He is great and rules over everything.” <b>“And subsequently enter the synagogue and pray his prayer,”</b> that is, he should pray and draw forth the higher lights into [the Divine Presence], with the fear of exaltedness, in order to bring [the Divine Presence] to the completion of the rectification. <b>Then it is stated: ‘And He said to me: You are My servant Israel, in whom I will be glorified. ’”</b>

Paragraph 185

<b>185. “Rabbi Pineḥas was, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Pineḥas was often in the presence of Rabbi Reḥumai, by the shore of the Kinneret.</b> [Rabbi Reḥumai] <b>was a great and elderly man, and his eyes had grown dim. He said to Rabbi Pineḥas: “I have heard as a fact that our colleague Yoḥai has a gem, a valuable stone,</b> i. e., a son. <b>I peered at the light of that gem, which bursts forth like the shining of the sun from its sheath, illuminating the entire world.”</b>
Explanation: The <i>Malkhut</i>, when fully rectified, is called <b>“a valuable stone,”</b> and it is [also] called <b>“a gem.”</b> [Rabbi Reḥumai] said: <b>“Our colleague Yoḥai has a gem, a valuable stone,”</b> [meaning that] he has already merited <i>Malkhut</i> with all of its rectifications and adornments. He peered, with the Holy Spirit, into the light of the gem, [and saw] that it was shining like the light of the sun upon its emergence from its sheath. This is the mystical meaning of the future rectification of <i>Malkhut</i>, that the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun [Isaiah 30:26], for then [the <i>Malkhut</i>] illuminates the entire world.
Now, after the light of the <i>Malkhut</i> became the light of the sun and its apex ascended to heaven, it illuminated from the heaven to the earth in one pillar of light, to the entire world. [That pillar] was continuously illuminating until Rabbi Shimon Bar Yoḥai was able to rectify the throne of <b><i>Atik Yomin</i> properly</b> [see next section]. This is alluding to the fact that he had already merited the two revelations of the completion of the rectification, which are <b>the six verses and six names</b> (as stated in section #145#, above). The <b>“light</b> [that] <b>stands from heaven to the earth</b> etc.” [see next section] is the mystical meaning of <b>the six verses,</b> while <b>“until <i>Atik Yomin</i> arrives and sits on the throne properly”</b> is the mystical meaning of <b>the six names;</b> see there thoroughly.

Paragraph 186

<b>186. “And that light, etc.”</b><br><b>And that light stands from heaven to the earth and illuminates the entire world until <i>Atik Yomin</i>,</b> i. e., <i>Keter</i>, <b>arrives and sits on the throne properly,</b> which [occurs] at the completion of the rectification. <b>And that light is entirely incorporated in your home,</b> that is, in his daughter, because the daughter of Rabbi Pineḥas was the wife of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yoḥai, <b>and from the light that was incorporated in your home, a small, thin light emerges,</b> which is the son of [Rabbi Pineḥas's] daughter, Rabbi Elazar. <b>It emerges and illuminates the entire world; happy is your portion. Emerge, my son, emerge; follow that gem which illuminates the world, for the time is ready for you.</b>
Explanation: The daughter of Rabbi Pineḥas Ben Yair was the wife of Rabbi Shimon, and thus Rabbi Shimon is included in the house of Rabbi Pineḥas Ben Yair. The reference is to Rabbi Elazar, who emerged from the <b>light that was incorporated</b> in the home of Rabbi Pineḥas Ben Yair, which is Rabbi Shimon and his wife, for [Rabbi Elazar] emerged [from there] and illuminated the entire world.

Paragraph 187

<b>187. “He departed from him and was about, etc.”</b><br><b>He departed from him and was about to enter the ship. There were two men with him. He saw two birds approaching and flying over the sea. He raised his voice and proclaimed: “Birds, birds, since you fly over the sea, have you seen the place where the son of Yoḥai is?” He waited a little</b> [and then] <b>declared: “Birds, birds, go and bring me a reply.” They flew away, entered the sea, and departed.</b>
Explanation: Rabbi Shimon had fled from the [Roman] monarchy, which had ordered his execution, and he and his son had hidden themselves in a cave (as recounted in <i>Shabbat</i> 33b), and thus they did not know where he was. For this reason, Rabbi Pineḥas Ben Yair set out to look for him in the islands of the sea.

Paragraph 188

<b>188. “Before he departed, etc.”</b><br><b>Before he departed to the ship, the birds arrived, and in the mouth of one of them there was a letter. It stated that Rabbi Shimon Bar Yoḥai had emerged from the cave with Rabbi Elazar, his son. Rabbi Pineḥas went to him and found that he had changed and his body was filled with holes and sores</b> [<i>ḥaludin</i>], from sitting so long in the cave. <b>He wept with him, saying: “Woe that I have seen you in this state.”</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said</b> to him: <b>“Happy is my portion that you have seen me in this state, for had you not seen me thus, I would not be in this state.”</b> <i>Ḥaludin</i> has a similar meaning to its use in the phrase “they break up [<i>maḥlidin</i>] the ground” (<i>Bava Batra</i> 19b), i. e., they make holes in the ground. <b>Rabbi Shimon opened with the commandments of the Torah and said: “The commandments of the Torah that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Israel are all written in the Torah in a general manner.”</b>
Explanation: During the many years that he was forced to stay in the cave, he had to sit there inside the sand, in order to cover his nakedness so that he could engage in the Torah, and this caused his flesh to become punctured and sore. [Rabbi Pineḥas] wept over him, saying: “Woe unto me that I have seen you in this state.” Rabbi Shimon replied: “Happy is my portion that you have seen me in this state, for had you not seen me thus, I would not be in this state.” In other words, “I would not have merited the revelations of the secrets of the Torah,” for he merited all the great heights of his wisdom during those thirteen years when he was hiding in the cave.
<b>“Rabbi Shimon opened</b> etc.” All the commandments of the Torah that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Israel are all written in the Torah in a general manner in the verse: <b>“In the beginning God created”</b> [Genesis 1:1], until the utterance: <b>“Let there be light</b> etc.” [Genesis 1:3], as he will proceed to explain. This is the commandment of <b>fear</b> and its punishment, which incorporates all of the commandments of the Torah.

Paragraph 189

<b>189. “In the beginning</b> [<i>bereshit</i>] <b>God created”</b> [Genesis 1:1]. <b>This is the first commandment of them all, and this commandment is called “the fear of God,” called <i>reshit</i></b> [beginning], <b>as it is stated: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning</b> [<i>reshit</i>] <b>of wisdom”</b> [<i>Ḥokhma</i>] [Psalms 111:10]. <b>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning</b> [<i>reshit</i>] <b>of knowledge</b> [<i>Da’at</i>]<b>”</b> [Proverbs 1:7], <b>since this matter,</b> fear, <b>is called <i>reshit</i>. This is the gate to enter faith, and the entire world is sustained by this commandment.</b>
Explanation: [Rabbi Shimon] was troubled by the following [textual] difficulty: [One] verse considers fear the <b>beginning</b> of <b>wisdom</b> [<i>Ḥokhma</i>]<b>,</b> whereas [the other] verse states that [fear] is the <b>beginning</b> of <b>knowledge</b> [<i>Da’at</i>]<b>.</b> He explains that this is because fear is the beginning of each of [the various] <i>sefirot</i>, since one cannot grasp any <i>sefira</i> without first acquiring fear.
This is why [Rabbi Shimon] says that it is <b>“the gate to enter faith,”</b> for it is impossible to attain complete faith other than through one’s fear of God. Commensurate with the measure of [a person’s] fear [of God], is the measure of [that person’s] faith. Thus, <b>“the entire world is sustained by this commandment,”</b> for the world is sustained only through the Torah and [its] commandments, as it is stated: “If not for My covenant of day and night, I would not have placed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). Since <b>fear</b> is the <b>beginning</b> and the gate to every commandment, in that it is the gate to [reach] faith, it follows that fear sustains the entire world. This is the meaning of the verse: <b>“In the beginning</b> [<i>bereshit</i>] <b>God created the heavens and the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:1], i. e., with <b>fear,</b> which is called <b><i>reshit</i>,</b> in which all the commandments are incorporated, <b>God created the heavens and the earth.</b> Were it not for [this] fear, God would not have created anything.

Paragraph 190

<b>190. “Fear branches out into three etc.”</b><br><b>Fear branches out into three types, two of which do not contain a proper root, while one is the root of fear. There is a person who fears the Holy One, blessed be He, in order that his children will live and not die, or he fears a physical punishment, or</b> a punishment <b>that</b> [will affect] <b>his money, and therefore he constantly fears Him. Thus, he does not place the fear that he fears the Holy One, blessed be He, as the root,</b> for the root is his own personal benefit, while the fear is merely a consequence of that. <b>And there is a person who fears the Holy One, blessed be He, because he fears the punishment of that world</b> [to come] <b>and the punishment of Gehennom. These two kinds of fear,</b> i. e., the fear of punishment in this world and fear of punishment in the World-to-Come, <b>are not the essence of fear and its root.</b>

Paragraph 191

<b>191. “The fear that is the essence, etc.”</b><br><b>The fear that is the essence is that a person should fear his Master because He is great and governs,</b> [He is] <b>the essence and the root of all the worlds, and everything is considered like nothingness before Him. As it is written, “And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing”</b> [Daniel 4:32]. <b>One should place his will in that place, which is called “fear.”</b>
Explanation: He is teaching us that there are three forms of the fear of God, only one of which is considered genuine fear: a) One fears the Holy One, blessed be He, and observes His commandments, so that his children will live and he will be spared physical or monetary punishments. This is the fear of punishments in this world; b) one fears the punishments of Gehennom as well. Those two are not manifestations of genuine fear, because he is not maintaining the fear due to the commandment of the Holy One, blessed be He, [to fear God] but [rather] for his own benefit. Accordingly, his own gain is the root, whereas the fear is a derivative of his personal interest.
Rather, <b>“the fear that is the essence is that a person should fear his Master because He is great and governs</b> [reality]<b>,</b> [and He is] <b>the essence and the root of all the worlds, and everything is considered like nothingness before Him.”</b> In other words, [such a person] fears God because He is great and rules over everything. He is great because He is the root from which all the worlds spread, and His greatness appears upon His creations. He rules over everything, for all the worlds He has created, the higher and lower alike, are considered as nothing compared to Him, for they do not add anything to His essence.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“One should place his will in that place, which is called ‘fear. ’”</b> That is, [a person] should place his heart and desires in that place which is called “fear,” meaning that he should cleave to the fear of God willingly and with passion, as is befitting and appropriate for a commandment of the King.

Paragraph 192

<b>192. “Rabbi Shimon wept, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon wept and said: “Woe if I tell; woe if I do not tell. If I tell, the wicked will know how to serve their Master. If I do not tell, the colleagues will forfeit this matter.” In a place where holy fear resides, there is a corresponding evil fear below, which strikes, beats, and accuses. It is a strap with which to lash the wicked,</b> i. e., to punish them for their sins. This is why he feared to reveal [it], so that the wicked would not know how to avoid punishment, for their punishment is their purification.
Explanation: [Rabbi Shimon] is hinting here that he is unable to reveal his words fully in this context because he is afraid of harming the wicked. The reason is that his purpose here is to reveal how to cleave to the tree of life, and never touch the tree of death, which is fitting only for those who have already rectified the aspect of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. However, the wicked, who have not yet rectified the sin of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, must not be allowed to know [this secret], for they first have to toil in all the [forms of divine] service until they rectify the sin of the Tree of Knowledge.
A similar idea is expressed in the verse: “Lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever” (Genesis 3:22). After Adam sinned with the Tree of Knowledge he was expelled from the Garden of Eden, due to the concern that he might cleave to the tree of life and live forever, which would mean that the flaw [he had] inflicted upon the Tree of Knowledge would remain unrectified forever. Consequently, in order that the righteous, who are worthy of knowing this matter, should not lose, [Rabbi Shimon] revealed it by way of allusion.

Paragraph 193

<b>193. “And one who fears, etc.”</b><br><b>And one who fears out of the punishment of striking and hatred, as stated, that fear of God, which is called “the fear of God for life,” does not rest upon him. Rather, what rests upon him? That evil fear; and thus, that strap, the evil fear, rests upon him, and not the fear of God.</b>

Paragraph 194

<b>194. “For this reason, the place that is called, etc.”</b><br><b>For this reason, the place that is called “fear of God” is called “the beginning of knowledge,” and this is why this commandment is included here. This is the root and the foundation of all the other commandments of the Torah. One who observes the</b> [commandment of] <b>fear observes everything,</b> and <b>one who does not observe</b> [the commandment of] <b>fear does not keep the commandments of the Torah, for this</b> fear <b>is the gate to everything.</b>
Explanation: This is referring back to what was mentioned previously, that one [verse] states <b>“the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,”</b> whereas [according to] another [verse], <b>“the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.”</b> [Rabbi Shimon] explained that <b>“in a place where holy fear resides, there is a corresponding evil fear below, which strikes, beats, and accuses</b> etc.” [section #192#, above]. In other words, at the [lower] endpoint of the holy fear that is called <b>“the fear of God for life”</b> [see previous section], there is <b>“an evil fear, which strikes, beats, and accuses, and it is a strap with which to lash.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of: “Her feet go down to death” [Proverbs 5:5], such that one who observes the commandment of fear because <b>“He is great and rules”</b> thereby clings to <b>the fear of God for life.</b>
But it is stated regarding those who fear [God out of fear of] the punishment of the strikes, not because of the commandment [to fear God]: “The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him” (Proverbs 10:24). [For such a person, ] the fear of the [lower] endpoint rules over him and strikes him. From this perspective, that the [lower] endpoint of the fear rests in <b>an evil strap</b> to strike the wicked, the higher and holy fear is called also by the name of <b>“the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.”</b> This indicates that one should cleave only to the aspect of the beginning [of fear], which is <b>the fear of God for life,</b> while staying wary of <b>the corresponding</b> [lower] <b>fear,</b> which is the evil strap. In this manner, the sin of the Tree of Knowledge will be rectified.

Paragraph 195

<b>195. “For this reason, it is written ‘in the beginning. ’ etc.”</b><br><b>For this reason, it is stated: “In the beginning,” which is fear, “God created the heavens and the earth.” One who violates this, violates all the commandments of the Torah and the punishment of one who violates this is that this evil strap,</b> which is the evil fear, <b>strikes him. This</b> [the meaning of]: <b>“And the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God</b> [hovered over the face of the waters,” Genesis 1:2]. <b>Those are the four punishments with which to punish the wicked.</b>

Paragraph 196

<b>196. “<i>Tohu</i> is strangulation, etc.”</b><br><b><i>Tohu</i></b> [“unformed,” Genesis 1:2] <b>is strangulation, as it is stated:</b> “[He shall stretch over it] <b>the line of confusion”</b> [<i>tohu</i>, Isaiah 34:11]; <b>“a measuring rope</b> [in his hand,” Zechariah 2:5]. <b><i>Bohu</i></b> [“void”] <b>is stoning,</b> i. e., <b>stones that are sunk into the great deep for the punishment of the wicked. “And darkness” is burning, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart of the sky”</b> [Deuteronomy 5:19], <b>“darkness,</b> [cloud, and thick darkness,” Deuteronomy 4:19]. <b>This is a powerful fire that shall whirl upon the head of the wicked</b> [see Jeremiah 23:19] <b>to burn them.</b>
Explanation: Those who fulfill the fear of God, not because is it a commandment of the King but out of fear of punishment, are trapped in the <i>kelippa</i> of <b><i>tohu</i>,</b> for they wonder [<i>temehim</i>] why they do not understand the thoughts and words of God. This <i>kelippa</i> is considered like a strangling rope over a person’s neck, blocking the air of holiness [that is needed] for the breath of his life. This is the meaning of: <b>“As it is written, ‘the line of confusion’; ‘a measuring rope. ’”</b> In one verse it is stated: <b>“The line of confusion,”</b> while the other one states: <b>“A measuring rope,”</b> and each of them teaches something about the other. That is, the meaning of “the line of confusion” is “a measuring rope.” According to the line and measure of one’s bewilderment corresponds the measure of the rope that the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> throws around one’s neck and strangles him. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“Woe to them who draw iniquity with false cords”</b> (Isaiah 5:18).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“<i>Bohu</i> is stoning.”</b> Once he has been trapped by the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> with a rope around his neck, [the <i>kelippot</i>] now have the strength to do with him as they please: Either to stone him, burn him, or to kill him with the sword, as [Rabbi Shimon] proceeds to explain. <b>Stoning</b> means that they break his skull through evil desires and evil thoughts and pull him into the great deep in order to punish him. <b>“‘And darkness’ is burning</b> etc. <b>to burn them,”</b> that the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> surrounds him with a powerful fire that burns away the vitality of holiness from [him].

Paragraph 197

<b>197. “‘And the spirit’ is killing etc.”</b><br><b>“And the spirit,”</b> [<i>ruaḥ</i>, Genesis 1:2] <b>this is death by the sword,</b> since <b>it is a stormy wind</b> [<i>ruaḥ</i>, Psalms 148:8], <b>a sharpened sword that enflames him. Similarly, it says: “and the flaming sword which turned every way”</b> [Genesis 3:24], <b>and it is called “spirit.” This is a punishment for one who violates the commandments of the Torah that is written following after fear,</b> called <b><i>reshit</i>, which is the incorporation of everything.</b> After <i>Bereshit</i>, which is fear, [the Torah] states <i>tohu</i>, <i>bohu</i>, darkness, and spirit, which are the punishment of the four death sentences. <b>From here onwards</b> [in the Torah] <b>are the rest of the commandments of the Torah.</b>
Explanation: The <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> sends <b>a stormy wind</b> upon him, which is like a sharpened sword that separates his head from his body and ends his life. 
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“This is a punishment</b> etc. <b>that are written after fear, [</b>which is] <b><i>reshit</i>,</b> [and] <b>which is the incorporation of everything.”</b> This is referring back to the earlier point that all the commandments of the Torah are incorporated in the first two verses, from <b>“In the beginning”</b> to <b>“And God said: Let there be light.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says that <b>this punishment,</b> mentioned above, the four death sentences alluded to by <b><i>tohu</i>, <i>bohu</i>, darkness, and spirit,</b> is written after <b>fear, <i>reshit</i>,</b> that is hinted in the verse: <b>“In the beginning</b> [<i>Bereshit</i>] <b>God created.”</b> Thus, [that] first verse [of the Torah] is <b>fear, <i>reshit</i>,</b> i. e., the primary <b>fear,</b> which is <b>for life,</b> while the second verse is the punishment for one who does not cleave to <b>fear, <i>reshit</i>.</b> These are <b>“the incorporation of everything,”</b> since they are the gate to faith in God, as stated. This illustrates that all the commandments in the Torah are incorporated in [this fear]. <b>“From here onwards are the rest of the commandments of the Torah,”</b> i. e., from the verse: <b>“And God said, Let there be light,”</b> and onward. In other words, all the commandments in the Torah are the details of the commandment of <b>fear.</b>

Paragraph 198

<b>198. “The second commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The second commandment is a commandment which the commandment of fear attaches to and from which it never departs. It is love, that a person should love his Master with a whole love. And what is a “whole love?” This is a great love, as it is stated: “Walk before Me and be wholehearted”</b> [Genesis 17:1]. “Wholehearted” means <b>whole with love. When it is stated: “And God said, Let there be light”</b> [Genesis 1:3], <b>this is whole love, which is called “great love.” Here it is a commandment, that a person should love his Master appropriately.</b>
Explanation: There is conditional <b>love</b> [see <i>Avot</i> 5:16], which results from the abundance of good that God has bestowed upon a person, through which he cleaves to Him with heart and soul. Now, although he cleaves to God completely, this is still considered an incomplete <b>love.</b> This is as the Sages expounded (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i>, 30) on the verse: “Noah walked with God” [Genesis 6:9], that Noah required assistance to support him, for he was assisted by all the good that God had bestowed upon him.
Abraham, by contrast, did not require assistance to support him, as it is stated: <b>“Walk before Me and be wholehearted.”</b> For <b>“walk before Me”</b> means without assistance, but rather <b>“before Me,”</b> even though you do not know if I will come after you to assist you. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“A whole love, this is a great love, as it is stated: ‘Walk before Me and be wholehearted. ’</b> That is, that [a person] should not require any assistance to support him, as it is stated regarding Abraham: “walk before Me <b>and be wholehearted,” whole with love,”</b> that although I am not giving you anything, your love should still be whole, to cleave to Me with [your] whole heart and soul.

Paragraph 199

<b>199. “Rabbi Elazar said, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Elazar said: “Father, I have heard</b> the explanation of <b>whole love.” He replied: “Say it, my son, before Rabbi Pineḥas, for he is at that level.” Rabbi Elazar said: “Great love is whole love, for it is whole on both sides. Were it not incorporated on both sides, it would not be appropriately whole.”</b>
Explanation: [Rabbi Shimon] instructed [Rabbi Elazar] to explain “great love” <b>before Rabbi Pineḥas</b> because [Rabbi Pineḥas] had already attained the attribute of <b>great love</b> in the proper manner, and therefore he would fully understand what [Rabbi Elazar] would say.
[Rabbi Elazar] responded [that it is] <b>“whole love, for it is whole on both sides,”</b> as stated below [section #201#]: <b>“Whether in judgment or in giving.”</b> Even if He takes your soul, your love for Him must remain in complete wholeness, just as when He gives you all the goodness in the world.

Paragraph 200

<b>200. “Therefore, we learned, etc.”</b><br><b>Therefore, we learned</b> [that] <b>love for the Holy One, blessed be He, is interpreted on two sides: There is one who loves Him because he has wealth, long life, children surrounding him, he rules over his enemies, his ways are successful for him</b> [see Proverbs 4:26], <b>and as a result he loves Him. But if the opposite were the case, and the Holy One, blessed be He, were to reverse the fortune upon him through harsh judgment, he would hate Him and would not love Him at all. Consequently, this love is not a love that has a foundation.</b>
Explanation: Since the root of his love is based on something, it follows that if that thing were to be nullified, the love would be nullified [as well].

Paragraph 201

<b>201. “The love that is called whole, etc.”</b><br><b>The love that is called whole is that</b> love <b>which is on both sides, whether in judgment or in giving and the success of one’s ways. One should love the Holy One, blessed be He, as we learned, even if He takes your soul from you. This is a complete love, for it is on both sides,</b> in giving and in judgment. <b>Therefore, the light of the act of creation emerged and was subsequently concealed. When it was concealed, the harsh judgment emerged and the two sides,</b> giving and judgment, <b>were incorporated together, to become whole. This is proper love.</b>
Explanation: The light that was created in the six days of creation, i. e., through the utterance: “Let there be light” [Genesis 1:3], was subsequently concealed again, as it is stated (<i>Bereshit</i> I, page 281, section 352): <b>“Let there be light for this world, and let there be light for the World-to-Come.”</b> The light was concealed from this world, and is revealed only for the righteous in the World-to-Come.
Why was it concealed? <b>“When it was concealed, the harsh judgment emerged.”</b> That is, with the concealment of the light, harsh judgment came out in this world, by means of which <b>“the two sides were incorporated together, to become whole.”</b> Room was given for the incorporation of the two extremes as one. Now it became possible [for a person] to reveal the wholeness of his love even when He takes one’s soul from him, and this made room for the wholeness of the <b>love.</b> Had it not been concealed and the harsh judgment not been revealed, this <b>great love</b> would have been lacking from the righteous, and it would never have been possible for it to have ever been revealed.

Paragraph 202

<b>202. “Rabbi Shimon took him, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon took him and kissed him. Rabbi Pineḥas came and kissed him and blessed him, and said: “Certainly, the Holy One, blessed be He, has sent me here. This is the delicate light that I was told was integrated into my house, and which will subsequently illuminate the entire world”</b> [see section #186#, above]. <b>Rabbi Elazar replied: “Certainly, fear must not be forgotten in all the commandments, and certainly not in this commandment,</b> of love; <b>fear should be attached to it.” How is it attached?</b> L<b>ove is good on one side, as it is stated: When He gives him wealth and goodness, long life, children, and sustenance. Then fear should be awakened, that one should fear lest sin causes</b> [his downfall] and his [fortune] is reversed upon him. <b>Regarding this it is stated: “Happy is the man who fears always”</b> [Proverbs 28:14], <b>since the fear is incorporated in the love.</b>

Paragraph 203

<b>203. “Thus, one should, etc.”</b><br><b>Thus, one should awaken the fear on the other side of harsh judgment: When one sees that a harsh judgment rests upon him, he should awaken the fear and fear his Master appropriately, and not harden his heart. With regard to this, it is stated: “He who hardens his heart will fall into evil”</b> [Proverbs 28:14], meaning that he will fall <b>to that other side, which is called “evil.” The result is that fear holds onto both sides,</b> the side of good and love and the side of harsh judgment, <b>and is incorporated in them. If the fear incorporates the side of good and love, it is an appropriate whole love.</b>
Explanation: Fear is a commandment that incorporates all of the commandments of the Torah, since it is the gate to faith in God. In accordance with the awakening of one’s fear, so will the faith in His providence reside upon [the person], as stated above. Consequently, <b>“this fear must not be forgotten in all the commandments”</b> [section #202#] – one must not forget the <b>fear</b> in each and every commandment, <b>“much less in this commandment,”</b> especially with regard to the commandment of <b>love,</b> i. e., fear must be awakened along with it. This is because it is in the commandment of love that fear is actually united together with [love], as stated. Accordingly, one must awaken the fear on <b>both sides</b> of the <b>love,</b> both <b>love “in mercy and the success of one’s ways”</b> [section #201#] and <b>love</b> at a time of <b>harsh judgment,</b> as [the <i>Zohar</i>] proceeds to explain.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Fear should be attached to it. How is it attached? Love</b> [etc.,” section #202#]. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is taking care that we will not err in its words, with regard to its statement that complete <b>love</b> is when He takes one’s soul, i. e., at a time of <b>harsh judgment.</b> We [might] think that the meaning is that we should not be afraid of the harsh judgment at all but only cleave to His love with devotion and without any <b>fear.</b> [To counteract this erroneous conclusion, the <i>Zohar</i>] concludes that <b>“fear should be attached to it. How is it attached? Love.”</b> That is, <b>fear</b> should also be awakened at that time, just as one awakens the <b>whole love.</b>
Here [the <i>Zohar</i>] reiterates the <b>two sides</b> of <b>love</b> that were mentioned earlier, i. e., <b>“whether in judgment or in mercy and the success of one’s ways.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] states that one must awaken the <b>fear on both sides</b> of <b>love,</b> i. e., that at the time of <b>mercy and success of one’s ways</b> one must awaken the fear of Him, lest sin [due to lack of fear should manifest and] cause [his downfall] and his love of God cools. [The person should] thus incorporate the <b>fear</b> in <b>love.</b> Likewise, on the other side of the <b>love,</b> at a time of <b>harsh judgment,</b> [the person] should awaken the fear of God and not harden his heart or distract his mind from the judgment. He will thus incorporate the <b>fear</b> in <b>love</b> here as well. If [a person] follows this practice, he will always be in a state of complete <b>love,</b> as is appropriate.
With respect to the incorporation of <b>fear</b> in <b>love</b> on the side of mercy, [the <i>Zohar</i>] cites the verse: <b>“Happy is the man who fears always.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] expounds the word <b>“always”</b> as implying that even when God treats [a person] favorably, he should still fear Him, lest [the lack of fear lead to] sin [which will] cause [his downfall]. Regarding the incorporation of <b>fear</b> in <b>love</b> on the side of <b>judgment,</b> [the <i>Zohar</i>] quotes the verse: <b>“He who hardens his heart will fall into evil,”</b> meaning that one should not harden his heart at a time of judgment for any reason in the world, for then he will fall <b>“to that other side</b> [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>]<b>, which is called ‘evil. ’”</b> Rather, one must then awaken the <b>fear</b> even more, to fear Him and incorporate the <b>fear</b> in his whole <b>love</b> at that time. Both the first fear and the second fear are not for [the sake of the person's] own benefit, Heaven forbid. Rather, [the person should be] frightened that he might deteriorate in providing satisfaction to his Maker. Understand this well.
The first two commandments have thus been thoroughly clarified. The <b>first commandment</b> is fear, and it is a general principle [which incorporates] the whole of Torah and the commandments. It is [referenced in the word] <b><i>Bereshit</i>,</b> and it is clarified in the first verse, which is: <b>“In the beginning</b> [<i>Bereshit</i>] <b>God created the heavens and the earth.”</b> In other words, from the <b>fear,</b> which is <b><i>reshit</i></b>, there emerged <b>the heavens and the earth,</b> which are [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and their offshoots, which are <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>. The second verse is the clarification of the punishment [for violations of the commandment of fear], which are the four death penalties: <i>Tohu</i> is <b>strangulation;</b> <i>bohu</i> is <b>stoning;</b> “darkness” is <b>burning,</b> and “spirit” is <b>decapitation.</b>
The <b>second commandment</b> is love, which is clarified in the verse: <b>“And God said, Let there be light</b> etc.” [This love] contains <b>two sides:</b> The first side is in <b>wealth, long life, children</b> etc. [section #200#]. The second side is <b>“with all your soul and with all your might”</b> [Deuteronomy 6:5], that is, when He takes your <b>soul</b> and your <b>might</b> the love should be as whole as when He gives you <b>wealth and long life</b> etc. In order to reveal this <b>love,</b> the light of the act of creation was concealed, and <b>when it was concealed, the harsh judgment emerged,</b> as stated above [section #201#]. The <b>fear</b> should also be incorporated with the <b>love</b> on its <b>two sides:</b> On the first side, one should fear lest [the lack of fear lead to] sin [which will] cause [his downfall] and his love will be diminished. On the second side, one should fear the concealment [of the light of creation], which is the judgment to which God sentences him. This is in accordance with the plain meaning of the words of the <i>Zohar</i>.
However, in order to continue onto the rest of the commandments, we must clarify these matters more deeply, [at the level of understanding of] the lofty level of <i>Atzilut</i>. 
Know that in the <i>Zohar</i> the four letters of the name <b><i>Havaya</i>,</b> which are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>, are called <b>fear, love, Torah, and commandment.</b> The [letter] <i>yod</i>, which is <i>Ḥokhma</i>, is called <b>fear;</b> the first [letter] <i>heh</i>, which is <i>Bina</i>, is <b>love;</b> the <i>vav</i> is called <b>Torah;</b> and the last <i>heh</i> is called <b>commandment</b> (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i>, <i>Hashmatot</i>, old editions, page 265a, and in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Naso</i>, 37).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“In the beginning</b> etc. <b>This is the first commandment</b> etc. <b>This commandment is ‘the fear of God, ’ which is called <i>reshit</i>”</b> [see section #189#]. The meaning is as follows: The <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> is the entirety of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, which illuminates to all the worlds through its garments, which are called <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>] is also called sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>, since its <i>Ḥokhma</i> is sealed in its own head and it does not give any of [this <i>Ḥokhma</i>] to the worlds [below]. Only <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> illuminates to the [lower] worlds.
Therefore, this <i>Bina</i> is called <b><i>reshit</i>,</b> since it is the beginning [<b><i>reshit</i></b>] and the root of all the worlds [below]. It is called <b>“the fear of God,”</b> i. e., the fear of sublimity, resulting from <b>“because He is great and rules, the essence and the root</b> [of all the worlds], <b>and everything is considered like nothing before Him”</b> [section #191#]. From this <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> emerge, which are called “heavens and earth. " This, then, is how the verse should be understood: <b>“<i>Bereshit</i>,”</b> with <b>fear,</b> “God created heaven and earth,” which are [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“As it is stated: The beginning</b> [<i>reshit</i>] <b>of wisdom</b> [<i>ḥokhma</i>] <b>is fear of the Lord</b> [Psalms 111:10]; <b>‘the fear of the Lord is the beginning</b> [<i>reshit</i>] <b>of knowledge</b> [<i>da'at</i>]<b>’</b> [Proverbs 1:7], <b>since this matter is called by the word <i>reshit</i>”</b> [see section #189#]. The brains are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da'at</i>. However, the <i>Ḥokhma</i> of the brains is not the actual <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, but only <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, as stated above. When the <i>Bina</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> ascends to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, [that <i>Bina</i>] returns to be <i>Ḥokhma</i> there, and gives <i>Ḥokhma</i> to the <i>partzufim</i>. Thus, the <i>Bina</i>, which is <b>fear,</b> is the beginning of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and this is the meaning of the verse: <b>“The beginning of wisdom</b> [<i>ḥokhma</i>] <b>is fear of the Lord</b>.” Similarly, [fear of the Lord] is the <b>beginning</b> of knowledge [<i>da'at</i>], because <i>Da'at</i> is the mystical meaning of the root of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, because [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] raise [<i>Da'at</i>] to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and therefore [<i>Ze'er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> also receive <i>Ḥokhma</i> from [<i>Arikh Anpin</i>]. This is the meaning of the verse: <b>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge</b> [<i>da’at</i>].” The words of the <i>Zohar</i> from here onwards are as explained above.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“The second commandment is a commandment which the commandment of fear holds onto and from which it never departs. It is love”</b> [section #198#]. <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called <b>love,</b> because the [letter] <b><i>yod</i></b> of <b><i>Havaya</i></b> is the mystical meaning of the essence of <i>Bina</i>, i. e., the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>], which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, of the aspect of pure air [<i>avira dakhya</i>] and the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is concealed in them (as stated in section #198# above, fourth paragraph). The place of the revelation of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is from the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the first <b><i>heh</i></b> of <b><i>Havaya</i></b>. For this reason, [that <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> transmit the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> which is called love, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] are called <b>love.</b> This [love] is the <b>second commandment</b> after <b>fear,</b> because this <i>Ḥokhma</i> is not received from <i>Ḥokhma</i> of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> itself, but from the [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> aspect of] <i>Bina</i>, [and <i>Bina</i> is] fear, as stated.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says that <b>the commandment of fear holds onto it and never departs from it.</b> [This refers to how] the <i>Bina</i> is always united with <i>Ḥokhma</i> and never separates from it. In any place where there is <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i> is necessarily with it as well, since <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> are always attached to one another, and you will never find <i>Ḥokhma</i> without <i>Bina</i> or <i>Bina</i> without <i>Ḥokhma</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thereby teaches us that although it was stated that the <b>first commandment</b> is <b>fear,</b> i. e., <i>Bina</i>, one should not mistakenly think that it is <i>Bina</i> without <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Likewise, regarding the <b>second commandment,</b> which is <b>love, i. e.,</b> <i>Ḥokhma</i>, one should not mistakenly think that it is <i>Ḥokhma</i> without <i>Bina</i>. Rather, there is <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the <b>first commandment</b> as well, and there is also <i>Bina</i> in the <b>second commandment,</b> since <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> are incorporated and come together, and they never part. However, we name them in accordance with the dominant factor. In the <b>first commandment,</b> which is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, and the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are the essence of <i>Bina</i>, the dominant factor is <i>Bina</i>, and therefore we call it <b>fear.</b> In the <b>second commandment,</b> the dominant factor is <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and we therefore call it <b>love.</b> Remember this; do not forget it.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And what is a whole love? This is a great love,</b> etc. <b>When it is stated: ‘And God said, Let there be light’</b> [etc. ]” [see section #198#]. <b><i>Bereshit</i></b> is a sealed utterance, and the main revelation of <b><i>Bereshit</i></b> starts from the verse: “Let there be light,” which is the mystical meaning of the ascent of <i>Bina</i>, which is <b><i>reshit</i>,</b> to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where it returns to [be] an aspect of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated above. Then <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> are together called <b>“great love.”</b> This is the mystical meaning of the utterance: “<b>Let there be light,”</b> since the <i>Bina</i> ascended to <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and transmits light to all the worlds [below], in the mystical meaning of <b>great love,</b> which is <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Love for the Holy One, blessed be He, is interpreted on two sides: There is one who loves Him because he has wealth, long life,</b> etc.” [section #200#]; <b>“for one should love the Holy One, blessed be He, as we learned, even if He takes your soul</b> etc. <b>Therefore, the light of the act of creation emerged and was subsequently concealed. When it was concealed, the harsh judgment emerged</b> [section #201#]. The meaning is as follows: It states below (<i>Bereshit</i> I, page 281, section 352): <b>“Let there be light for this world, and let there be light for the World-to-Come.”</b> [God] saw that this world is not fit to be used, and [therefore] He arose and concealed it in the World-to-Come, which is above the diaphragm inside the intestine of [the <i>partzuf</i> of] <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. [In this aspect of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] is the aspect of the World-to-Come, [which is] in the place where <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> are positioned, [which are the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> that end at the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. [At that place of the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> lies] the diaphragm that separates between the upper waters, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, from the lower waters, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. From the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and below, the light is dimmed and no longer illuminates, and the light is concealed in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are positioned from the chest to the navel of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and the light does not illuminate in them.
This illustrates that the <i>Bina</i> was divided into <b>two sides,</b> since the light is revealed in the first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>], which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> that are positioned above the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, in the mystical meaning of the upper waters. One who merits the level of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> has wealth, long life, children like olive plants around his table [see Psalms 128:3], he rules over his enemies, his ways are established for him, and in whatever he does he shall prosper [Psalms 1:3]. However, the light has already been concealed from the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are positioned below the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, in the mystical meaning of the lower waters. Those who receive from [those lower seven <i>sefirot</i>] must love God in the aspect of “even if He takes your soul.” This is the mystical meaning of the two sides of <b>love,</b> which are the first three and the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, of the aspect of the right [side in <i>Bina</i>], which is <b>love.</b> This [formation of two sides of <i>Bina</i>] is the result of the concealing of the light of the act of creation. If one merits to be whole in the love of God, both in the <b>love</b> of the aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> and in the love of the aspect of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, <b>“this is appropriate love.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says that one must integrate the <b>fear</b> in those two sides of <b>love.</b> On the side of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> <b>“fear should be awakened, that one should fear lest sin causes</b> [his downfall]” [section #202#]. In a similar manner, on the side of the love of [the aspect of] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> <b>“he should awaken the fear and fear his Master appropriately, and not harden his heart.”</b> That is, since <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, which are <b>love</b> and <b>fear,</b> are always attached to one another, the aspect of the <i>Bina</i>, which is <b>fear,</b> must be incorporated, [and this refers] both to the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila'in</i>, and the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which are <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.
Then <b>“the result is that fear holds onto both sides and is incorporated in them. This is the appropriate whole love.”</b> Here there are two which are four. There is no <b>love</b> except [love] with <b>two sides,</b> namely the first three and lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>. Each [of these two aspects of] <b>love</b> is incomplete on either one of the two sides unless there is <b>fear</b> in each [one] of them. [This incompleteness is because] there cannot possibly be <i>Ḥokhma</i> without <i>Bina</i>, which is <b>love</b> without <b>fear.</b>

Paragraph 204

<b>204. “The third commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The third commandment is to know that there is a great and governing God in the world, and to unify Him every day with an appropriate unification, in the upper</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>,</b> <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and to render them into one unification with the six words of “Hear O Israel,” and to direct the will upwards with them. Therefore, we must protract</b> the word <b>“one”</b> [<i>eḥad</i>] <b>for the length of six words.</b>
Explanation: [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying two things: 1) One must <b>know</b> [that there is a great and governing God in the world]; 2) <b>“and to unify Him</b> etc.” First one must <b>know</b> those two sides of <b>love,</b> which are <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, as stated above. <b>“That there is a great God,”</b> this is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which are mighty and great in [the light of giving]. <b>“And governing God in the world,”</b> i. e., <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is called “ruler,” indicating the judgments that arise from [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>], as the light was concealed from [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] and harsh judgment emerged (as stated in the previous section). The terms “ruler” and “governor” denote judgments.
The meaning is that one must know those <b>two sides</b> of <b>love,</b> and incorporate <b>fear</b> in each of them, as stated, and he will [subsequently] receive His love, both <b>“in mercy and the success of one’s ways”</b> and <b>“in judgment”</b> [section #201#], since [only] then, but not otherwise, is it considered whole <b>love.</b> Subsequently, one must <b>“unify Him every day with an appropriate unification, in the upper</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>,”</b> that is, by raising feminine waters to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [ascend] to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. Then <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> ascend and unite as one with <b>“the upper</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>,”</b> which are <b>[</b><i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>]. They are called “the upper <b>six extremities</b>” because they enclothe the six extremities of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. By means of this unification, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> ascend to the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], above the diaphragm of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. There lies the mystical meaning of the higher waters, and the light is not concealed from [the six extremities of that level]. When [as a result of that ascent] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are filled with light, they transmit to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [transmit] to all the worlds [below], and [divine] giving is revealed in the worlds [below]. This is the mystical meaning of <b>the reading of <i>Shema</i>,</b> as stated here.
Now, the six words of <b>“Hear O Israel”</b> are the six sides of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that the six sides of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> must be unified so that they unite as one with the <b>six upper sides,</b> which are [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, as stated just above. [A person] must <b>“direct the will upwards with them,”</b> i. e., [when saying <i>Shema</i>, a person must] direct his will and [levels of] <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> to be incorporated with [these levels of <i>partzufim</i>] in the aspect of feminine waters.
Therefore, in order to form one unification in the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are <b>the six words of “Hear O Israel,”</b> one must prolong the [word] <b>“one”</b> [<i>eḥad</i>]. That is, one must draw the <i>Ḥokhma</i> in the word <b><i>eḥad</i>.</b> The light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which extends from <i>Ein Sof</i>, blessed be He, to the higher six extremities, which are [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, unites the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in the light of <i>Ein Sof</i>. [The word] <b><i>eḥad</i></b> has a numerical value of <b>thirteen,</b> which alludes to the drawing of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> (as stated in <i>Marot HaSulam</i>, section #2# above; see there). One must therefore have the intention in the <b><i>eḥad</i></b> to draw the <i>Ḥokhma</i> to the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.
However, in this unification there is no intention to extend [a level of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, but only to expand the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> through their integration in the higher six extremities. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that <b>“we must protract <i>eḥad</i> to the length of six words.”</b> “Protract” [<i>arkha</i>] means the drawing of <i>Ḥokhma</i>; “<b>to the length of six words,”</b> means into the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. The six extremities [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] thereby become six extremities of maturity, because <b>the six words</b> of <i>Shema</i> correspond to the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Through this unification, which expands [the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] into the six extremities of maturity, it is possible, subsequently, to extend the manifestation of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> as well.

Paragraph 205

<b>205. “This is that which is written, etc.”</b><br><b>This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place”</b> [Genesis 1:9]. This means: <b>Let the levels under the heavens be gathered into one place, to be in wholeness for</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>, as is appropriate. And yet, in that unification</b> of “Hear O Israel,” <b>one must connect fear to it,</b> [which means] <b>that one must protract the</b> [letter] <b><i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i></b> [“one”]. This is the reason <b>that the <i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i> is large, and this is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “And let the dry land appear”</b> [Genesis 1:9] – <b>that the <i>dalet</i>, which is “the dry land,” should appear and be connected to that unification.</b>
It has already been explained above that the unification of <i>Shema</i> means to draw forth six extremities of maturity. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: ‘Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place’; let the levels under the heavens be gathered into one place, to be in wholeness for</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>, as is appropriate.” “One place”</b> is the higher six extremities, where the light of <i>Ein Sof</i>, blessed be He, shines in [the form of] the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that that <b>“the levels under the heavens,”</b> i. e., the <b>six sides</b> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are <b>“under”</b> the <i>Bina</i> and called “heavens” in relation to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, will be gathered <b>“into one place.”</b> These are the <b>“six higher sides,</b> [which will be gathered] <b>into one place, to be in wholeness for</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>, as is appropriate,”</b> so that they too will receive the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Then six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> will unite in the proper manner, although only <b>“in wholeness for</b> <b>six extremities</b><b>,”</b> i. e., only [the level of] maturity of six extremities, as stated.
This is the meaning of: <b>“And yet, in that unification one must connect fear to it,</b> [which means] <b>that one must protract the <i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i>.”</b> This refers to the lower [aspect of] fear, as stated above (section #201#): <b>“The love that is called whole is that which is on both sides, whether in judgment or in mercy</b> etc. <b>Therefore, the light of the act of creation emerged and was subsequently concealed. When it was concealed, the harsh judgment emerged and the two sides were incorporated together, to become whole. This is appropriate love.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] subsequently stated (section #202#) that <b>fear</b> should be awakened in this <b>love</b> as well (see the <i>Sulam</i> on section #202#).
It was explained there that there are two kinds of <b>love and fear:</b> Higher <b>love and fear,</b> which are called <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, and lower <b>love and fear,</b> which are called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. Wholeness is achieved only through both aspects together. Therefore, the light is concealed in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, in order to reveal the lower <b>love,</b> which is even [in a situation] when He takes your soul away; the <b>fear</b> must cleave to this lower <b>love: “And fear his Master appropriately, and not harden his heart”</b> [section #203#]. Then [the person] will have whole <b>love and fear,</b> and he will cleave to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> and to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, and receive all the pleasantness and good in them.
This is what [the <i>Zohar</i>] is saying here, with regard to the unification of the reading of <i>Shema</i>. One first raises the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and incorporates them in the higher <b>six sides,</b> to draw forth the <b>“great love”</b> into [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> through the word <b><i>eḥad</i>,</b> which is the light that was created on the first day, in the utterance of: “And God said, Let there be light.” <b>“And yet, in that unification, one must connect fear to it.”</b> One must also reveal and draw forth the aspect of concealment of this light that was performed in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, in order [for the person] to become completed with the lower <b>love and fear</b> as well, since [without this, one] is not considered whole, as stated. This is the meaning of that statement here, <b>“that one must protract the <i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i>, that the <i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i> is large,”</b> as large letters are in <i>Tevuna</i>. Accordingly, <b>“the <i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i> is large,”</b> for it alludes to the place of the concealment of the light, which was performed in <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of [the aspect of] <i>Tevuna</i> [in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>]. This is the reason why one must protract it, and direct one’s intent toward [thoughts of] the concealment [of the light] in it. This is in order [that the person] should also cleave to the lower <b>love and fear,</b> as [the <i>Zohar</i>] proceeds to explain.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“‘And let the dry land appear’ – that the <i>dalet</i>, which is ‘the dry land, ’ should appear and connect to that unification.”</b> There is no wholeness in <b>the higher love and fear</b> that were drawn forth through the six words of the reading of the <i>Shema</i> (by means of the word <b><i>eḥad</i>,</b> which is the mystical meaning of <b>“Let there be light”</b>) without the lower <b>love and fear</b>. [This lower love and fear] are revealed by means of the concealment of the light in <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of [the aspect of] <i>Tevuna</i> [of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>], which are called <b><i>dalet</i>,</b> as stated. Therefore, after “<b>Let the waters be gathered together to one place,”</b> which is the mystical meaning of the drawing forth of light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> to the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are <b>“under the heavens,”</b> it is then written: <b>“And let the dry land appear.”</b> This is referring to the <b><i>dalet</i> in <i>eḥad</i>,</b> that one must <b>protract it</b> and have the intention that it should become <b>dry</b> through the concealment of the light. This is in order <b>“that the <i>dalet</i>, which is ‘the dry land, ’ should appear and connect to that unification,”</b> [i. e., ] that this <b><i>dalet</i>,</b> which is the mystical meaning of the [aspect of] <i>Tevuna</i>, should appear and connect <b>to that unification</b> of light in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which were drawn forth into the six extremities of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, in order to complete the <b>love on two sides</b>, as explained.

Paragraph 206

<b>206. “Once it connected there above, etc.”</b><br><b>Once</b> <i>Malkhut</i> <b>connected there above,</b> to the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>she must be connected below, in her crowds which are the other six edges that are below,</b> in <i>Malkhut</i>. These are [represented by]: <b>“Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever,” which contains six other</b> [Hebrew] <b>words of unification. Then, that which was “dry land” becomes a land for bearing fruits and offspring, and for planting trees.</b>
Explanation: After the higher unification through the reading of <i>Shema</i>, in which the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b> is connected above in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], that <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b> must be connected to the other six extremities that are below, that is, on the <b>six sides</b> of the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. This is Rachel, who is positioned from the chest of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and below, in whom all six hundred thousand souls of Israel are incorporated, called the <b>crowds</b> of the <i>Nukba</i>, or “her crowds.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says that after <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is incorporated in the aspect of light of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, and the aspect of concealment of <i>Tevuna</i> is also revealed in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] – which is the mystical meaning of <b>“Let the dry land appear”</b> [Genesis 1:9] of the <b><i>dalet</i></b> – those two aspects must be drawn forth to the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> which is [positioned] from the chest [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and below. This is the mystical meaning of <b>the six words: <i>Barukh</i></b>; <b><i>shem</i></b>; <b><i>kevod</i></b>; <b><i>malkhuto</i></b>; <b><i>le’olam</i></b>; <b><i>va’ed</i></b> [“blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever”]. These <b>six words</b> correspond to the <b>six sides,</b> <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] mentions <b>“blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever,”</b> since it consists of six other words of unification.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Then, that which was dry land becomes a land for bearing fruits and offspring.”</b> The meaning is as follows: Previously, [the <i>Zohar</i>] stated (in section #201#) that in order to [ultimately] reveal <b>whole love</b> [that includes] <b>both sides,</b> the light <b>emerged and was subsequently concealed, and when it was concealed the harsh judgment emerged and the two sides were incorporated together.</b> Thus, the <b>love</b> comprised of <b>both sides</b> was not completed by concealment alone, but only through <b>the harsh judgment</b> that emerged after the concealment.
Accordingly, before <b>the harsh judgment emerged,</b> the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b> was merely <b>dry land,</b> without any use whatsoever. [The <i>dalet</i>] had left its inclusion in the light as a result of the concealment, and the aspect of fear was not [yet] completed in [the <i>dalet</i>] either, that it could be rectified with lower [aspects of] <b>love</b> and fear, which complement the higher [aspects of] <b>love</b> and <b>fear,</b> since the <b>harsh judgment,</b> which is the primary revealing factor of the lower [aspects of] <b>love</b> and <b>fear,</b> had not yet been revealed.
Now, the place of that harsh judgment is in the heels of Leah, which is in the place of Rachel’s head. [This is because] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> has two [manifestations of] <i>Nukba</i>: 1) from the chest and above, which is called Leah; 2) from the chest and below, called Rachel. Thus, Leah’s heels, which end at the chest of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, touch the head of Rachel, which is positioned from the chest of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and below. The presence of the <b>harsh judgment</b> is at the end of Leah’s heels, which touch inside the head of Rachel. Consequently, the <b>harsh judgment</b> operates only within [the aspect called] Rachel, as no partition and judgment can reveal its influence other than from its placement and below. It follows that the aspect of concealment is completed into [becoming] the level of lower <b>love</b> and <b>fear</b> only after [this concealment] has been drawn to the place of Rachel, where the <b>harsh judgment</b> operates.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Then, that which was dry land becomes a land for bearing fruits and offspring, and for planting trees.”</b> That <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i>,</b> which in its place, before the <b>harsh judgment</b> was revealed, was <b>dry land</b> and a place of desolation unfit for inhabitation, has now, after being drawn to the six extremities of Rachel (which are from the chest of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and below), become a fruit-bearing land, suitable for planting trees, i. e., a place of inhabitation. In other words, the lower <b>love</b> and fear have been revealed in [this <i>dalet</i>] in wholeness, complementing the higher [aspect of] love and <b>fear</b> so that the love will be on <b>both sides.</b> It is only in this manner that all the pleasantness and goodness in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> can be revealed, as stated above.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] will then proceed to state [in the next section]: <b>“And this is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: ‘And God called the dry land Earth’</b> [<i>Eretz</i>; Genesis 1:10]; <b>in that unification below,</b> it became <b>Earth,</b> which is <b>a completed will, as is appropriate.</b> <i>Eretz</i> is linguistically associated with <i>ratzon</i> [“will”], and it is thus written: <b>“And God called the dry land <i>Eretz</i>,”</b> meaning that He drew forth the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b> to the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, to <b>its six sides,</b> where the activity of the <b>harsh judgment</b> is already revealed. Then the <b><i>dalet</i></b>, which was <b>dry land</b> and desolate, transforms, in the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and by means of the pairing of [<i>Nukba</i> with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>], into a fruit-bearing land and a place of inhabitation. In this manner, “God called the dry land <b>Earth,”</b> which is <b>a completed will, as is appropriate,</b> for the completed will was revealed in [this structure], in the appropriate fashion, and this is <b>whole love.</b>

Paragraph 207

<b>207. “And this is that which is stated: ‘And God called, ’ etc.”</b><br><b>And this is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “And God called the dry land Earth</b> [<i>Eretz</i>,” Genesis 1:10]. <b>In that unification below,</b> in “blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever,” it became <b><i>Eretz</i>,</b> which is <b>a complete will, as is appropriate.</b> This is because <i>Eretz</i> is associated with <i>ratzon</i> [“will”]. <b>Therefore, it is written “it was good,” “it was good,” twice</b> Genesis 1:10, 12]<b>: Once for the higher unification, and once for the lower unification. Since</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>was unified on both sides,</b> in the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and in its own six extremities, <b>from that point forward: “Let the earth put forth grass”</b> [Genesis 1:11], <b>for she was established to bear fruits and offspring properly.</b>
Explanation: The <b>higher unification</b> is the unification of the <b>six words</b> of <b>the reading of <i>Shema</i>.</b> This [unification] is in the [level of the] large, higher six sides of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], as clarified in the verse: “<b>Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one</b> [<i>eḥad</i>] <b>place”</b> [Genesis 1:9]. This unification draws the light that was created on the first day, from the <b>six sides</b> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> to the six extremities of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as stated. This is the first [instance of] <b>“it was good”</b> that was stated regarding the third day of the act of creation [Genesis 1:10].
The <b>lower unification,</b> i. e., the unification of the <b>six words <i>barukh</i></b>; <b><i>shem</i></b>; <b><i>kevod</i></b>; <b><i>malkhuto</i></b>; <b><i>le’olam</i></b>; <b><i>va’ed</i></b> [“blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever”], is the completion of the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i>.</b> [The <i>dalet</i>] has no completion other than in the <b>six sides</b> of the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as stated. This is clarified in the verse: <b>“And God called the dry land Earth,”</b> and in the verse: <b>“Let the earth put forth grass</b> etc.” [It is] through the six extremities of <i>Nukba</i> that the <b>dry land</b> became a fruit-bearing land. It is with regard to this unification of the six extremities of <i>Nukba</i> that [the phrase] <b>“it was good”</b> is stated for a second time [Genesis 1:12].
Thus, the first <b>“it was good”</b> is for the first unification, and the second <b>“it was good”</b> is for the second unification. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“Since</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> <b>was unified on both sides,”</b> i. e., <b>the two sides of love,</b> by means of the <b>higher unification</b> and the <b>lower unification, “from that point forward: ‘Let the earth put forth grass, ’ for she was established to bear fruits and offspring properly.”</b> The <b>lower unification</b> completes the <b>love on both sides,</b> and the lights of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> are drawn to the six extremities of <i>Nukba</i>, giving <b>fruits and offspring to</b> her <b>masses,</b> who are the six hundred thousand souls of Israel, [and this] is appropriate.

Paragraph 208

<b>208. “The fourth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The fourth commandment is to know that the Lord, He is God, as it states: “Know this day, and lay it to your heart, that the Lord</b> [<i>Havaya</i>]<b>, He is God</b> [<i>Elohim</i>,” Deuteronomy 4:39]. That is, <b>the name <i>Elohim</i> should be incorporated in the name <i>Havaya</i>, to know that they are one and there is no separation between them.</b>
Explanation: <b><i>Havaya</i></b> is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, while <b><i>Elohim</i></b> is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> must be united without any <b>separation</b> between them, i. e., <b>the name <i>Elohim</i>,</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>, should be incorporated <b>in the name <i>Havaya</i>,</b> which is the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and [then] the <i>Nukba</i> would also be of the aspect of <b><i>Havaya</i>,</b> as explained here. This unification is the mystical meaning of the drawing forth of the [level of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. The unification of the reading of <i>Shema</i>, as explained in <b>the third commandment,</b> was for the drawing forth of six extremities from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, while the unification that is clarified here is for the drawing forth of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. This is the general rule: The drawing forth of any level, whatever it is, cannot be achieved all at once. Rather, first one must draw the six extremities of that level, and afterwards [draw the aspect of] the first three [<i>sefirot</i>].

Paragraph 209

<b>209. “This is the secret of the verse, etc.”</b><br><b>This is the secret of the verse: “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven</b> […] <b>to give light upon the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:14, 15]. This means <b>that the two names, </b><i>Havaya</i> <i>Elohim</i>, <b>should be one without any separation at all. The “lights”</b> [<i>me’orot</i>] <b>without</b> [the letter] <i>vav</i>, which is the <i>Malkhut</i> that is called <i>Elohim</i><b>, will be incorporated in the name “heaven,”</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called <i>Havaya</i>, <b>for they are one and there is no separation in them. A black light,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>in white light,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>: <b>There is no separation between them and it is all one. This is the white cloud of the day and the cloud of fire of the night.</b> That is, <b>the attribute of day,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and the attribute of night,</b> <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>will be rectified in one another in one unification, to illuminate, as it is stated: “To give light upon the earth.”</b>
Explanation: The <i>Nukba</i> is called <b><i>me’orot</i> without a <i>vav</i>,</b> which represents the diminution of the moon, in accordance with the statement of the Sages that initially the two great lights were on an equal level but the moon complained that two kings cannot use the same crown, and the Holy One, blessed be He, instructed her: “Go and diminish yourself” (<i>Ḥullin</i> 60b). Then her lower nine descended to the world of <i>Beria</i> and she was diminished to a point under <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that after she was diminished, the <i>Malkhut</i> needs to be incorporated <b>in the name “heaven,”</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. That is, [the <i>Malkhut</i>] must be enlarged once again so that it is a height equal with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, face-to-face. The <i>Nukba</i> must be raised back from the world of <i>Beria</i> to <i>Atzilut</i>, and the separation that occurred between the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> at the time of the diminution of the moon is to be rectified.
The meaning of the diminution of the moon is that the harsh judgment in the heels of Leah ruled over [the <i>Malkhut</i>], on account of which [the <i>Malkhut</i>] diminished into a point and its lower nine [<i>sefirot</i>] fell into <i>Beria</i>. Now, by means of the unification of the reading of <i>Shema</i> (as stated above, in the third commandment) the <i>Nukba</i> was constructed into [a level of] the six extremities, in the mystical meaning of <b>the lower unification of “Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever.”</b> The reason is that through the power of judgment in [the <i>Malkhut</i>], the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b> which was <b>dry land</b> and desolate, was rectified into <b>a land</b> that bears <b>fruits and offspring</b> (as stated above [in section #207#]; see there thoroughly).
It now becomes clear that the <b>black</b> in the <i>Nukba</i>, which is the force of judgment in her, and which had [caused the <i>Nukba</i>] to fall to [the level of] a point, is now considered to have ascended to a manifestation of actual light. [The black becomes the light because] it is specifically by the power of the judgment that the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b> was constructed into an inhabited, fruit-bearing land. Were it not for the force of judgment in the <i>Nukba</i>, the <b><i>dalet</i></b> in <b><i>eḥad</i></b>, which is the <i>Tevuna</i> [aspect of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>], would remain <b>dry</b> and desolate. Thus, the force of judgment in [the <i>Nukba</i>] becomes actual light. It is called <b>black light</b> because the blackness was the cause of this light. It is also regarded as the light of six extremities, which is the light of giving.
Therefore, [after the manifestation of the black light] it is now possible to extend <b>white light</b> to the six extremities of <i>Nukba</i> as well, meaning the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is the [light of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>], since white means <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is achieved by raising the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> to the palace of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>. Now the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> can be incorporated with [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] like the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, since the force of judgment in [the <i>Nukba</i>] has transformed into actual light. Even though it is <b>black light,</b> [this light] does not act as a barrier at all to prevent the [<i>Nukba</i>] from being incorporated in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, because <b>“a black light in white light: There is no separation between them and it is all one.”</b> Since [this black light] is of the aspect of <b>light,</b> [the <i>Nukba</i>] can be incorporated in the <b>light</b> of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], since light in light are a mixture of two [things] of the same kind and are regarded as one. As for the <b>blackness,</b> which is the cause of [this black] light, it does not act as a barrier or lower [the <i>Nukba</i>] now at all, because it is the cause of the elevation [of the <i>Nukba</i>, for without it [the <i>Nukba</i>] would not be of the aspect of light.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“This is the white cloud of the day and the cloud of fire of the night; the attribute of day, and the attribute of night.”</b> In other words, through this unification of the incorporation of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] – as <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is incorporated there in <i>Abba Ila’ah</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> in <i>Imma Ila’ah</i> – <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> becomes <b>a white cloud</b> for the light of day, and the <i>Nukba</i> <b>a cloud of fire</b> for the light of the night. This is <b>the attribute of day and the attribute of night</b> that are unified in one another, in the mystical meaning of: <b>“And there was evening and there was morning, one day”</b> [Genesis 1:5]. This is the meaning of: <b>“Will be rectified in one another in one unification, to illuminate, as it is stated: ‘To give light upon the earth. ’” The attribute of day</b> is incorporated in <b>the attribute of the night,</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>, in the mystical meaning of <b>“one day,”</b> and they are rectified in each other to give light upon the earth, to the <b>crowds</b> of the <i>Nukba</i> that are in the three worlds of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>.

Paragraph 210

<b>210. “This is the sin of that, etc.”</b><br><b>This is the sin of that primordial snake,</b> which <b>connects below and separates above. Through this, it caused what it caused to the world. For</b> [instead] <b>there must be separating below and connecting above, and the black light,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>must be unified above,</b> in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>in one connection, so that afterwards she will be unified in her hosts in her unification, to separate her from the side of evil.</b>
Explanation: The unification of the drawing forth of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> is achieved only by raising [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> to the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], above the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, such that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is incorporated in <i>Abba</i> and the <i>Nukba</i> in <i>Imma</i>, and then they both unite. [In that united state, ] the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> transmits the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] from <i>Abba</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>, which is enclothing <i>Imma</i>. Below the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, however, where the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are positioned [in this phase], it is forbidden to perform the unification of the drawing forth of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to <i>Nukba</i>. The reason for this is a lengthy matter, but I will say that this is the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, through which the primordial <b>snake</b> brought death to the world. It incited Adam and Eve to perform this unification below, in the place of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, below the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and this thereby impaired [the levels] above, as well, stopping the pairing of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“This is the sin of that primordial snake,</b> which <b>connects below and separates above. Through this, it caused what it caused to the world.”</b> [The snake] connected the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, for the [purpose of] transmitting the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to the <i>Nukba</i> <b>below,</b> in the place [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>]. This thereby <b>caused what</b> it caused to the inhabitants of the world, i. e., it brought death upon them. This is because it <b>separated above,</b> causing the stopping of the pairing of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], from which life is drawn to the inhabitants of the world.
[Explaining further, ] when the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> approaches to suckle from the pairing that is below the chest of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which is the place of the hold [of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>], the upper pairing of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] immediately stops, because they are instantly separated from transmitting to each other, so that the <i>shefa</i> [of their pairing] will not descend to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. All of this is because <b>“it must be separated below and connected above,”</b> that caution must be taken <b>to separate</b> [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> <b>below</b> in their place, so that they will not pair with each other down below in drawing forth the first three [<i>sefirot</i> from above], and <b>connecting</b> should only occur <b>above,</b> i. e., in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] themselves.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And the black light must be unified above, in one connection.” The black light,</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, must be raised with the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> <b>above, to the white light,</b> that is, to [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and connect the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> there <b>“in one connection.”</b> [In this state] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> transmits the <i>shefa</i> of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] from <i>Abba</i> to the <i>Nukba</i>. After [this], the <i>Nukba</i> returns with the <i>shefa</i> that she received to her place below, where the <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> of the souls of Israel are located, in [their state of as] aspects of feminine waters.
<b>“So that afterwards she will be unified in her hosts in her unification” –</b> [the <i>Nukba</i>] unites with the souls of the children of Israel, called “the <b>hosts</b> of the <i>Nukba</i>,” in one unification, and transmits to them from the <i>shefa</i> that she received above in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>]. <b>“To separate her from the evil side,”</b> because by refraining from connecting the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [with each other] in their place <b>below,</b> the <i>Nukba</i> is separated <b>from the evil side,</b> [meaning] that the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> cannot [receive and] benefit from the <i>shefa</i>. However, if the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> are connected <b>below,</b> the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> can receive the <i>shefa</i>, and therefore [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] separate <b>above</b> and their pairing is stopped, as stated.

Paragraph 211

<b>211. “With all that, one must, etc.”</b><br><b>With all that, one must know that <i>Elohim</i> and <i>Havaya</i>; it is all one, without separation. <i>Havaya</i> is the <i>Elohim</i></b> [Deuteronomy 4:39]. <b>When a person knows that it is all one, and does not put a separation, even the other side will depart from the world and will not be drawn downward.</b>
Explanation: “With all that,” that there is such a fear that one might arouse a pairing of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in their place [below], one should not refrain for this reason from performing the unification in its proper manner, which is in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>]. Instead, <b>“one must know that <i>Elohim</i> and <i>Havaya</i>; it is all one, without separation.”</b> The unification of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> must be drawn forth in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], in order to unite the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> as one, without separation.
<b>“When a person knows that it is all one, and does not put a separation, even the other side will depart from the world and will not be drawn downward.”</b> If a person intensifies [his efforts in] the raising of feminine waters and the raising of the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, to unify them in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], as is proper, not only will the <b><i>Sitra Aḥara</i></b> not grasp hold of the <i>shefa</i>, but this will actually cause the removal of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> so that it cannot rule over the world.

Paragraph 212

<b>212. “This is the secret of the verse, etc.”</b><br><b>This is the secret of the verse: “And let them be for lights”</b> [<i>me’orot</i>, Genesis 1:15], which consists of the letters of <i>or</i> [light], <i>mot</i> [death]. <b>For the</b> <b><i>kelippa</i></b> <b>follows the brain.</b> The <b>brain is light,</b> and the <b>other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>is death. <i>Or</i> is</b> [spelled out] <b>in the connected letters</b> of the word <i>me’orot</i>, whereas <b><i>mot</i> is</b> [spelled out] <b>in the separated</b> letters of the word <i>me’orot</i>. <b>When this <i>or</i> departs from there, the separated letters of <i>mot</i> connect.</b> In other words, when you remove the letters of <i>or</i> [<i>alef</i>; <i>vav</i>; <i>resh</i>] from the word <i>me’orot</i>, the letters of <i>mot</i> [<i>mem</i>; <i>vav</i>; <i>tav</i>] join together.
Explanation: This is the mystical meaning of the verse: “And let them be for lights.” The <i>kelippa</i> ascends and follows after the brain. Brain is “light,” while the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is “death.” <b><i>Or</i></b> [light] is [spelled out] in the connected letters whereas <b><i>mot</i></b> [death] is [spelled out only] in the separated letters. Explanation: the force of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> is the root of the existence of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i>, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And His kingdom rules over all” [Psalms 103:19]. Now, by virtue of the unification of the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] for the drawing forth of the six extremities and the first three [<i>sefirot</i> from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>], the force of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> is transformed into <b>black light,</b> through the drawing forth of six extremities in the <b>lower unification</b> of <b>the reading of <i>Shema</i>,</b> as stated. Subsequently, [<i>Malkhut</i>] is raised once more to [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and the <b>black light</b> of <i>Malkhut</i> unites with the <b>white light</b> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, as stated above.
Thus, this unification is alluded to in the verse: “And let them be for lights [<i>me’orot</i>],” which is the letters of <b><i>or</i>-<i>mot</i>. “<i>Or</i> is</b> [spelled out] <b>in the connected</b> letters”: By drawing forth the six extremities and the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to the <i>Nukba</i> in <b>one connection</b> with the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], just as the force of judgment was transformed in the <i>Nukba</i> into actual <b>light</b> so too all the forces of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and the <i>kelippot</i> that are drawn from this force of judgment are [also] nullified. As a result, <b>“the</b> <b><i>kelippa</i></b> <b>follows after the brain,”</b> [meaning] that the <i>kelippa</i> is nullified because of the power of the brains of the <i>Nukba</i>, since the root of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is the force of judgment in the <i>Nukba</i>, was nullified in the <b>brains</b> of the <i>Nukba</i> and became light. Accordingly, the force of the <i>kelippa</i> was necessarily nullified as well.
Consequently, <b>“<i>or</i> is</b> [spelled out] <b>in the connected letters</b> of the word <i>me’orot</i>, whereas <b><i>mot</i> is</b> [spelled out only] <b>in the separated</b> letters.” By means of the connection of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, through which the force of judgment became <b>light,</b> the letters of <b><i>mot</i>,</b> which are the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, were separated. That is, they were nullified inside the <b>light</b> and the combination [of letters spelling out] <b><i>me’orot</i></b> [with the letters of] <b><i>or</i></b> formed in the middle, in the [state of] <b>connection.</b> [In contrast, ] <b><i>mot</i></b> is in [a state of] separation, [since] the letter <i>mem</i> is at the start of the word, while the letters <i>vav-tav</i> are at the end of the word.
However, <b>“when this <i>or</i> departs from there, the letters of the separation, <i>mot</i>, connect.”</b> In other words, when one does not perform the unification in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], but in the place of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> below, then <b>“this <i>or</i> departs from there,”</b> because [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are immediately separated from their pairing [with each other] and the <b>light</b> is stopped. Then the word <b><i>or</i></b> comes out of <b><i>me’orot</i></b> and the result is that <b>“the letters of the separation, <i>mot</i>, connect.”</b> [This means that] after the exit of <b><i>or</i></b> from the word <b><i>me’orot</i></b>, the word <b><i>mot</i></b> remains there, because the letters of <b><i>or</i></b> have already left the word and they no longer separate between the letters of <b><i>mot</i>.</b> This alludes to <b>“the sin of that primordial snake,</b> which <b>connects below,”</b> in the place of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, and therefore <b>“separates above”</b> [section #210#] [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], since their pairing stopped because of [the snake] and this brought <b>death</b> [<i>mot</i>] into the world.

Paragraph 213

<b>213. “Eve began from these letters, etc.”</b><br><b>Eve’s</b> [sin] <b>began from these letters and caused evil to the world, as it is stated: “And the woman saw</b> [<i>va’tere</i>] <b>that</b> [the tree] <b>was good”</b> [Genesis 3:6]. <b>She inverted the letters of <i>me’orot</i>;</b> that is, she took the letters of <i>va’tere</i> from there, and <b>there remained</b> [the letters] <b><i>mem-vav</i></b> from the word <i>me’orot</i>. <b>They went and took the letter <i>tav</i> with them,</b> creating the combination <i>mot</i> [death]. <b>She</b> [thus] <b>caused death to the world, as it is stated: “<i>Va’tere</i>.”</b>
Explanation: The unification was explained in <b>the letters of “Let them be <i>me’orot</i>,”</b> which are the drawing forth of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. When one unifies them above, in the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], this draws forth light in <b>a</b> [state of] <b>connection,</b> for this light] separates <b>the letters</b> of <b><i>mot</i></b> as [the light] expands into them, and the combination [of letters spelling the word] <b><i>me’orot</i></b> is formed. But if one unifies [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> below in their place, the light departs once again from the combination <b><i>me’orot</i>,</b> leaving <b><i>mot</i></b> there in the connection of the letters (as stated in the previous section above).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says [that] <b>“Eve began from these letters”</b> because Eve’s sin through the Tree of Knowledge starts with: <b>And the woman saw</b> [<i>va’tere</i>] <b>that</b> [the tree] <b>was good.”</b> This alludes [to the idea] that <b>Eve</b> drew for herself the letters of <i><b>va’tere</b></i> from the word <b><i>me’orot</i>,</b> i. e., she accepted the advice of the snake to connect [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in their place below, thereby impairing the combination of <b><i>me’orot</i>.</b> [In doing so] <b>“she inverted the letters of <i>me’orot</i>,”</b> for by forming a connection below she caused the separation of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] <b>above.</b> Thus, the <b>letters</b> of the combination <b><i>or</i></b> [<i>alef-vav-resh</i>], which separate and negate the combination <b><i>mot</i></b> in the mystical meaning of the word <b><i>me’orot</i>,</b> were separated. She formed the combination <b><i>va’tere</i>,</b> in which the <b>letters of <i>or</i></b> are scattered in <b>inverted</b> order, because of the <b><i>tav</i></b> that was wedged between them. This <b><i>tav</i></b> is the aspect of the <i>Nukba</i> of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, called <b><i>mot</i>,</b> which approached the <b>light</b> to receive and suckle from it.
The <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which is called <b><i>mot</i>,</b> contains male and female: <b><i>Samael</i></b> [“poison”] and <b>Lilith.</b> The letter <b><i>mem</i></b> is the male of <b><i>mot</i>,</b> called <b><i>Samael</i>,</b> while the letter <b><i>tav</i></b> is his female, called <b>Lilith.</b> By virtue of [Eve’s] acceptance of the advice of the snake to connect from <b>below,</b> the female of <b><i>mot</i></b> immediately approached to suckle from the <i>shefa</i>, and the <b>letters</b> of <b><i>or</i></b> were scattered in <b>inverted</b> order, as in the combination <b><i>va’tere</i>,</b> because the <b><i>tav</i></b> became wedged inside the <b><i>or</i></b> and scattered them.
After <b>Eve</b> drew forth the letters <b><i>va’tere</i></b> from <b><i>me’orot</i>, “there remained <i>mem-vav</i>”</b> from the word <b><i>me’orot</i>,</b> which are the male, called <b><i>mem</i></b> of <b><i>m</i></b><i>ot<b></b></i>, and the expression of <i>Yesod</i>, called <b><i>vav</i></b> of <i>mot</i>. <b>“They went and took the letter <i>tav</i> with them,”</b> [meaning] that the male of <b><i>mot</i>, <i>mem-vav</i>,</b> which remained from <b><i>m</i></b><i>e’or<b>o</b>t<b></b></i>, went to the female, the <b><i>tav</i></b> of <i>mo<b>t</b></i>. The two of them mated and brought <b><i>mot</i></b> upon the world, <b>“as it is stated: <i>Va’tere</i>,”</b> because the male of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, <b><i>mem-vav</i>,</b> engaged in a coupling with the <b><i>tav</i></b> of <i>va’<b>t</b>ere</i>, who was already in <b>Eve.</b> This is the mystical meaning of the snake engaging in relations with Eve and infecting her with contamination [see <i>Shabbat</i> 146a]. By her acceptance of the snake’s advice, the <b><i>tav</i></b> entered her, separating and scattering the letters of <b><i>or</i></b> [<i>alef-vav-resh</i>], and forming the combination of the letters <b><i>va’tere</i></b> in her field of vision. Subsequently, the male of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, <b><i>mem-vav</i>,</b> came and engaged in a coupling with that <b><i>tav</i></b> which was already in Eve, and <b><i>mot</i></b> [“death”; <i>mem-vav-tav</i>] appeared in the world.

Paragraph 214

<b>214. “<i>Va’tere</i>. Rabbi Elazar said, etc.”</b><br><b><i>Va’tere</i>. Rabbi Elazar said: “My father, I learned</b> that after Eve took the letters <i>va’tere</i> from <i>me’orot</i>, it was not <i>mem-vav</i> that remained, but rather the <b><i>mem</i> alone was left.</b> For <b>the <i>vav</i>, which is always a sign of life, was transformed</b> into <i>mot</i>, death, since <b>it left and took the <i>tav</i></b> with it, <b>as it is stated: ‘and she took... and she gave’</b> [<b><i>v</b>a’<b>t</b>ikaḥ<b></i></b>…<b><i>v</b>a’<b>t</b>iten<b></i></b>; Genesis 3:6]. <b>This word was</b> [thereby] <b>completed and the letters</b> of <i>mot</i> <b>joined together.” He replied to him: “Blessed are you, my son.” We have thus established this matter.</b>
Explanation: Rabbi Eliezer responded [to his father Rabbi Shimon]: We learned that the <b><i>mem</i></b> alone remained, i. e., without the <b><i>vav</i>,</b> which is <i>Yesod</i>, because <b><i>Samael</i></b> the male of <b><i>mot</i>,</b> had no aspect of <i>Yesod</i>, for a foreign god is infertile. Rather, the <b><i>vav</i>,</b> which is always life, that is, the <i>Yesod</i> of holiness, was transformed from holiness into a <i>kelippa</i> and became a <i>Yesod</i> for the male of <b><i>mot</i>.</b> Subsequently, i. e., after [the male of <i>mot</i>] had gained the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> from the holiness, <b><i>vav</i></b> went and paired with the <b><i>tav</i>.</b> Then the <b><i>mem</i></b> was connected with the <b><i>tav</i>,</b> by means of the <b><i>vav</i></b> that [the male] stole from the [side of] holiness.
[Rabbi Elazar] cites a proof from the verses dealing with the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, since they begin with a connection of <b>a <i>vav</i></b> and <b>a <i>tav</i>, “as it is stated: ‘and she took... and she gave’</b> [<b><i>v</i></b><i>a’<b>t</b>ikaḥ<b></b></i>…<b><i>v</i></b><i>a’<b>t</b>iten<b></b></i>].” The exit of the <b><i>vav</i></b> to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> was born through the sin of the Tree of Knowledge itself [and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> lacked the <i>vav</i>] beforehand. Rabbi Shimon agreed with his point, and <b>“replied to him: Blessed are you, my son</b> etc.”

Paragraph 215

<b>215. “The fifth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The fifth commandment. It is stated: “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures”</b> [Genesis 1:20]. <b>There are three commandments in this verse. One is to engage in the Torah;</b> [the second] <b>one is to engage in procreation;</b> [and the third] <b>one is to circumcise</b> [a male child] <b>on the eighth day and to remove the foreskin from there.</b> One must <b>engage in the Torah, toil in it every day, to rectify his soul and spirit.</b>
Explanation: The four previous <b>commandments,</b> which are drawn from the first four days of the act of creation, came to rectify the levels in the world of <i>Atzilut</i> itself, which are the four levels <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, in the world of <i>Atzilut</i>. The <b>first commandment,</b> which is drawn from the word <b><i>Bereshit</i>,</b> is the mystical meaning of <b>fear,</b> i. e., supernal <i>Bina</i>. This is the mystical meaning of fear <b>“because He is great and rules over everything”</b> [see section #191#]. This [refers] only to the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i> that was established as <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which enclothe <i>Arikh Anpin</i> from the mouth to the chest, called <b><i>yod</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>.
<b>The second commandment,</b> which is drawn from the utterance, <b>“Let there be light,”</b> is for the rectification of the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, in the mystical meaning of the <b>whole, great love,</b> [and these lower seven are] called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. In their main state, [these seven] enclothe <i>Arikh Anpin</i> from the chest to the navel, i. e., below the diaphragm which is inside the intestine of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. However, in the utterance <b>“Let there be light,”</b> which is stated regarding them, they ascended and became one <i>partzuf</i> with [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] above the chest of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and from there to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. The <i>Bina</i> returned to being <i>Ḥokhma</i> there [in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>], which is the mystical meaning of <b>great love</b> and the mystical meaning of the [first letter] <b><i>heh</i></b> of <b><i>H</i></b><i>avaya<b></b></i>. From them, all the brains are transmitted to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>.
However, from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> themselves, which are the [aspect of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> cannot receive brains. [This is] because [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] themselves were established in the mystical meaning of “pure air,” which is the light of giving, in the mystical meaning of “because He delights in <i>ḥesed</i>” [“mercy”; Micah 7:18]. For this reason, [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are called <b>“fear,”</b> because the mystical meaning of <b>great love,</b> the brains of the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, are not transmitted [directly] from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, but only from the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, called <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>.
However, the aspect of <b>great love</b> in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is revealed only from the aspect of the chest of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and above, for [those aspects of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] are then positioned above the diaphragm in the intestine of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. However, from the chest of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and below, which are positioned below the diaphragm of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], there is an aspect of concealment of the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. This is the mystical meaning of <b>“Let there be light”</b> for the next world, which is the <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> above the diaphragm. But the other [aspects of] <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, below the diaphragm, the light was concealed in them and the manifestation of <i>Tevuna</i> in them became the mystical meaning of <b>dry.</b>
<b>The third commandment</b> is drawn from the two utterances of the third day, which are “<b>Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place and let the dry land appear”</b> [Genesis 1:9] and <b>“Let the earth put forth grass”</b> [Genesis 1:11]. These are for the rectification of the brains of the six extremities for [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. The <b>upper unification</b> is drawn from the verse <b>“Let the waters be gathered,”</b> which is for <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, while the <b>lower unification</b> is drawn to the six extremities of <i>Nukba</i> from the verse: <b>“Let the earth put forth grass.”</b>
<b>The fourth commandment,</b> which is drawn from the verse: <b>“Let there be lights”</b> [Genesis 1:14], is for the rectification of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. By the fifth day all the necessary rectifications for [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> had been rectified, to the point that the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> received the [aspect of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] were fit for a face-to-face fusion at an equal height [with each other]. Consequently, from here onward, the rest of the commandments are the required rectifications for drawing forth [illuminations] from the face-to-face fusion of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“The fifth commandment. It is stated: ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures. ’ There are three commandments in this verse.”</b> The wholeness [resulting from] the mystical meaning of the fusion of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> face-to-face needs to be drawn forth. The first [commandment] is to draw forth a holy soul [that wholeness], so that the person himself will also merit a pure and holy fusion. This is achieved through engagement in the Torah. The second is to birth holy souls, while the third is for the rectification of the sign of the covenant by means of cutting and uncovering [of circumcision], as [the <i>Zohar</i>] proceeds to explain.
This is the meaning of <b>“engage in the Torah, toil in it, and add to it</b> etc.” <b>“Engage”</b> means to speak [its words] with [one’s] mouth even if one does not know [its meaning], in the mystical meaning of: “They are life for those who find them” [<i>motz’eihem</i>; Proverbs 4:22] – to one who produces [<i>motzi</i>] them with the mouth, for he thereby acquires a holy <i>nefesh</i> <b>“Toil in it”</b> means to make every effort to do all that one can to grasp it and understand it, for he thereby acquires a holy <i>ruaḥ</i>. <b>“And add to it”</b> means that once one has merited to rectify <b>his soul and spirit,</b> he should not settle for that, but should always be adding to it, in the mystical meaning of “we elevate in sanctity and do not downgrade” [see e. g., <i>Berakhot</i> 28a]. One thereby merits a holy <i>neshama</i>.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And add to it every day, to rectify his soul and spirit,”</b> i. e., increase Torah [study] every day, in order to rectify one’s <i>nefesh</i> and <i>ruaḥ</i>, for by daily adding to the [study of] Torah, and increasing the rectification of his <i>nefesh</i> and <i>ruaḥ</i>, he merits a holy <i>neshama</i>. For <b>“when a person engages in the Torah, he is rectified with another soul, a holy one”</b> [see next section], since one who engages in Torah extensively, in addition to meriting a <i>nefesh</i> and <i>ruaḥ</i>, also merits the establishment of a holy <i>neshama</i>.

Paragraph 216

<b>216. “The fifth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>When a person engages in the Torah, he is rectified with another soul, a holy one, as it is stated: “With swarms of living</b> [<i>nefesh</i>] <b>creatures”</b> [Genesis 1:20]<b>,”</b> which means <b>a soul</b> [<i>nefesh</i>] <b>from that holy creature,</b> i. e., <i>Malkhut</i>. <b>For when a person does not engage in the Torah he does not have a holy soul,</b> meaning <b>that the holiness that is above does not rest upon him. But when he does engage in the Torah, through that whisper that he moved in it, he merits a living soul and to be like the holy angels.</b>
Explanation: “Creature” (<i>ḥaya</i>) is the mystical meaning of the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> in the phase [when the <i>Nukba</i> is in a state] of maturity, face-to-face with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. In that state, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called <b>“the tree of life,”</b> and the <i>Nukba</i> is called <b>“creature.”</b> By means of a person’s raising of feminine waters through engaging in the Torah for its own sake and from the coupling of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> face-to-face, [the person] draws forth a holy soul from their fusion. This is the meaning of <b>“a soul from that holy creature,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. A person attains this only by raising feminine waters through Torah engagement. Thus, <b>“when a person does not engage in the Torah, he does not have a holy soul,”</b> for he has no part in the fusion of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, since [the person] did not raise feminine waters to unite them.
This is the meaning of the verse: <b>“Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures.”</b> The Torah is called <b>“water”</b> [see <i>Bava Kamma</i> 17a], and by swarming with feminine waters, by virtue of the Torah, [a person] merits a holy soul from the supernal <i>ḥaya</i><b>.</b> Know that a person does not merit to cleave to the Holy One, blessed be He, before he attains <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> from the holy supernal <i>ḥaya</i> (as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Vayikra</i>, page 144, section 434). <i>Nefesh</i> is linked to <i>ruaḥ</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i> to <i>neshama</i>, and <i>neshama</i> to the Holy One, blessed be He.

Paragraph 217

<b>217. “For it is written, bless, etc.”</b><br><b>For it is stated: “Bless the Lord, you, His angels”</b> [Psalms 103:20]. <b>These are the ones who engage in the Torah, for they are called “His angels on earth.” This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “And let fowl fly above the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:20]. <b>That is in this world,</b> while <b>regarding that world we learned that in the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will fashion for them wings like eagles, to roam throughout the world, as it is stated: “But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles”</b> [Isaiah 40:31].
Explanation: It is stated: <b>“Bless the Lord, you, His angels, mighty in strength, who perform His word, listening to the voice of His word”</b> [Psalms 103:20]. The Sages explained [the surprising order of] “who perform,” followed by “listening to.” That is, a person typically cannot perform any task before he has heard what his sender has to say to him. This is not the case for the angels; they perform their mission before they hear and understand what God has commanded them. The reason [they function this way] is that the will of God rules over them and there is nothing interposing [between] them [and God] to prevent them from being drawn after God’s will. Consequently, they follow God like a shadow follows a person, so their doing precedes their hearing.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says regarding <b>those who engage in the Torah</b> and draw forth <b>a holy soul,</b> [that] their [physical] substance, although it is from earth, is transformed until it is similar to that of the celestial angels, and [then] their action precedes their hearing. They perform His commandments in total completion [even] before they grasp what they are doing, because they too follow God like a shadow follows a person. This can be compared to the common situation of wind pushing dust into a person’s eyes: He quickly closes his eyelids before his thought can sense it. You will always find in such cases that his action, which is the shutting of his eyes, always precedes his thought’s awareness of the approaching dust.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“His angels. These are the ones who engage in the Torah, for they are called His angels on earth.”</b> Although they are on earth, their bodies are like that of the celestial angels, and their action precedes their hearing. That is, they do not have to ruminate with their minds before they perform His commandments in fullness, but rather they carry out the commandment in completion before they are able to sense in their thought what they are doing. This is like the shutting of the eyelids, which precedes the deliberation in thought. Consequently, they are regarded as angels on earth.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Wings like eagles, to roam throughout the world, as it is stated: ‘But they who wait for the Lord</b> etc. ’” “In the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will fashion for them wings like eagles, to roam throughout the world.” As long as a person has not merited a holy soul, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> rules over him, in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“And the souls of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling”</b> [I Samuel 25:29]. This means (see the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Vayikra</i> 425) <b>“that they go and roam the world but find no place to rest, to which they can connect. They become defiled within the side of impurity</b>... <b>for they did not enter holiness and were not incorporated in it.”</b>
The meaning is as follows: It is impossible to cleave to God and fulfill His commandments properly before one believes in the names of the Holy One, blessed be He, that He is good and performs goodness to all, and He is merciful and gracious etc. Those who have not yet merited a soul of holiness are still governed by the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. Thus, <b>“they go and roam the world but find no place to rest.”</b> When their thoughts roam the world and they see God’s governance over people, they maintain that it is not as good as it ought to be, in accordance with His holy names, [and] they thereby impair the holy names, Heaven forfend. They thus <b>“find no place to rest,”</b> where they can believe in His names, <b>“to connect to Him.”</b> Consequently, <b>“they become defiled within the side of impurity,”</b> meaning that they come to deny Him, Heaven forbid. All this is because <b>“they did not enter holiness and were not incorporated in it,”</b> for they did not merit a soul of holiness and did not take [the necessary] actions to be incorporated in holiness.
By contrast, <b>those who engage in the Torah</b> and have drawn forth a holy soul, their body is transformed to be like angels, [meaning] that they merit to precede hearing before action, like the [angels]. For this reason it is written about them: “And let fowl fly above the earth,” [i. e., ] that <b>“the Holy One, blessed be He, will fashion for them wings like eagles, to roam throughout the world.”</b> This means that they roam the world in their thoughts and perceive God’s governance, and yet not only do they not stumble on <b>the side of impurity,</b> but they even receive the strength to raise feminine waters and to increase their power continuously, <b>“as it is stated: ‘But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles. ’”</b> They thereby mount up <b>wings as eagles</b> to roam through all the events of the inhabitants of the world. They are constantly renewing their strength and raising feminine waters through the power of their faith in God’s unity, and they are always drawing forth the spirit of holiness from above.

Paragraph 218

<b>218. “This is that which is written, and let fowl, etc.”</b><br><b>This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>that which is stated: “And let fowl fly above the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:20]. <b>The Torah, which is called “water”</b> [see <i>Bava Kamma</i> 17a], <b>should swarm and produce the rustle of living creatures; from the place of that creature,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>they should draw it below,</b> as we learned. <b>With regard to this, David stated: “Create for me a pure heart, O God,” to engage in the Torah, and then: “Renew a steadfast spirit within me”</b> [Psalms 50:12].
Explanation: Here [the <i>Zohar</i>] returns to interpret the verse. <b>“Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures.”</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] states that this <b>“water”</b> is <b>Torah. “Swarm”</b> means that [the Torah] should produce a living creature <i>nefesh</i> <i>ḥaya</i>, <b>“from the place of that creature, they should draw it below.”</b> That is, they should draw this soul [<i>nefesh</i>] from the higher <i>Nukba</i>, which is called <i>ḥaya</i>, and from that [<i>Nukba</i>], draw [that <i>nefesh</i>] into this world.
<b>“With regard to this, David stated: ‘Create for me a pure heart, O God, ’ to engage in the Torah.”</b> He asked God to give him a pure heart to engage in Torah and to raise feminine waters. <b>“And then: ‘Renew a steadfast spirit within me, ’”</b> for he will then merit to draw forth the right spirit and he will be able to cleave to [God, ] blessed be He.

Paragraph 219

<b>219. “The sixth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The sixth commandment is to engage in procreation. Whoever engages in procreation causes that river,</b> <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>to be constantly flowing. Its waters will not cease and the sea,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>will be filled from all sides. New souls are renewed and emerge from that tree, and many hosts multiply above with those souls,</b> in order to guard them. <b>This is the meaning of the verse: “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures”</b> [Genesis 1:20]. <b>This is the sign of the holy covenant, the river that is drawn out and emerges, whose waters multiply and swarm a swarm, and the multiplication of souls for that creature.</b>
Explanation: Through the awakening from below [a person] awakens [the levels] above, and causes the coupling of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence. Then the <b>river,</b> which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, will be <b>constantly flowing</b> with masculine waters [from above to below] and its <b>waters will not cease</b> from bestowing upon the <i>Nukba</i>. The <b>sea,</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>will be filled on all sides,</b> i. e., both from the side of the coupling [needed] to animate the worlds [with divine lifeforce], as well as from the side of bearing souls. “New souls are renewed and emerge from that tree,” that is, not actual new souls, but old souls that were already in Adam the first [man] but which fell from him on account of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. They are renewed once again by <b>that tree,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and it is for this reason that they are called “new souls.”
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“New souls are renewed.”</b> Genuinely new souls come to the world only after the completion of the rectification of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. Many hosts are emanated above with those souls, because <b>several angels emerge</b> with each soul, as stated [in the next section] below. Likewise, angels also emerge through the coupling that is for animating the worlds.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“the sign of the holy covenant, the river</b> etc.” The meaning is [as follows]: <b>“Swarms of living creatures”</b> alludes to <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called <b>“the sign of the holy covenant.”</b> It is <b>the river that is drawn out</b> and emerges from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, enclothing the <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> called Eden, to water the garden, which is the <i>Nukba</i> [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>]. <b>“Whose waters multiply and swarm a swarm,”</b> that is, from the couplings of the aspect of six extremities, which are called <b>“swarms</b> [<i>raḥashin</i>],” which is the Aramaic translation of “Swarm with swarms [<i>yishretzu sheretz</i>].” Regarding the aspect of the couplings of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] which is for bearing souls, [the <i>Zohar</i>] states <b>“and the multiplication of souls for that creature.”</b> It is this [creature, the <i>ḥaya</i>, ] that is called <b>“living creature”</b> in that verse.

Paragraph 220

<b>220. “With those souls which enter, etc.”</b><br><b>With those souls which enter that creature</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>]<b>,</b> <i>Malkhut</i><b>, several flying creatures,</b> i. e., angels, <b>emerge.</b> [They] <b>fly and roam throughout the world. When a soul emerges to this world, that flying creature which flew and emerged with that soul, from that tree, emerges with it. How many angels emerge with each and every soul? Two: One on the right and one on the left. If he merits, they protect him, as it is stated: “For He will give His angels charge over you, to guard you”</b> [Psalms 91:11]. <b>And if not, they accuse him. Rabbi Pineḥas said: There are three</b> angels <b>that protect a person when he merits it, as it is stated: “If there is for him an angel, an intercessor, one out of a thousand, to vouch for a person’s uprightness”</b> [Job 33:23]. “If there is for him <b>an angel”</b> is one; <b>“an intercessor”</b> is two; <b>“one</b> out of a thousand, to vouch for a person’s uprightness” is three.

Paragraph 221

<b>221. “Rabbi Shimon said, etc.”</b><br><b>Rabbi Shimon said: They are five angels, for it is further written: “Then he is gracious to him and says,</b> [deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom’’ Job 33:24]. <b>“Then he is gracious to him” is one; “and says” is a second,</b> which makes five [together with the three of the previous section]. [Rabbi Pineḥas] <b>replied: Not so; rather, “then he is gracious to him” is the Holy One, blessed be He, alone,</b> and not an angel, <b>for no other has the authority to pardon him except He</b> Himself. <b>He responded: You have spoken well.</b>
Explanation: Together with the souls, several angels are born and emerge, called <b>birds.</b> These angels support the souls in [their efforts toward] tilting [toward] the scale of merit, or [the angels] act in the opposite manner, when they accuse [the souls that sin] and push [those souls] toward the scale of detriment, as [the <i>Zohar</i>] will proceed to explain. This is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“They fly and roam throughout the world,”</b> and they see God’s providence over all the inhabitants of the world, how they are watched over by Him. They convey this to the soul, and if the soul merits, it tilts itself and the entire world to the scale of merit. If [the soul] does not merit, it tilts itself and the entire world to the scale of detriment. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] asked [in the previous section]: <b>“How many angels emerge with each and every soul?”</b>
Now, Rabbi Pineḥas does not disagree with Rabbi Shimon, who claimed that only <b>two birds</b> are born with the soul. Instead, [Rabbi Pineḥas] maintains that as long as he has only those <b>two birds,</b> he cannot tilt himself fully to the scale of merit, but is tossed back and forth from judgment to mercy and from mercy to judgment. However, through good deeds a third angel is born to him, and then he merits to tilt towards the scale of merit. This is why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states that <b>“there are three</b> [angels that protect a person] <b>when he merits it”</b> [see previous section], for he can merit it only by means of three angels.

Paragraph 222

<b>222. “One who refrains, etc.”</b><br><b>One who refrains from procreation diminishes, as it were, the form that includes all forms,</b> which is the human form, <b>and affects that river,</b> <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>so that its waters do not flow, and impairs the holy covenant on all sides. With regard to him it is stated: “And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me”</b> [Isaiah 66:24]. <b>Indeed “Me”;</b> T<b>his</b> is referring <b>to the body, whereas his soul does not enter the partition at all,</b> i. e., into the domain of the Holy One, blessed be He, <b>and he is banished from that world.</b>
Explanation: The <i>Malkhut</i> is called <b>“the form that includes all forms,”</b> because all the forms of <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> of the righteous and the angels of the three worlds <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> are drawn forth through [the <i>Malkhut</i>]. Those [beings] are the soldiers and armies [of the <i>Malkhut</i>]. Therefore, one who does not engage in <b>procreation</b> diminishes the form of <i>Malkhut</i> and prevents it from bringing out all its soldiers and armies. [This is because it is through] an awakening from below [such as the act of reproduction] that there is a corresponding awakening from above, causing a coupling of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Divine Presence, to beget <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> and angels in <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, as stated above.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And affects that river such that its waters do not flow.”</b> [A person] causes <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to not transmit masculine waters to the Divine Presence. [The person] impairs the holy covenant in all of its aspects, [in that he] holds back the two types of fusion, one from the side of the six extremities and [one] from the side of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. <b>“With regard to him it is stated: ‘And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men who have rebelled against Me, ’”</b> since the [fulfilment of the] commandment of <b>procreation</b> [imparts a] constant expansion of his soul, by virtue of which he also triumphs over his body forever, so that it will stand at the resurrection of the dead. One who does not engage in <b>procreation</b> renders his body like <b>a carcass,</b> as it states regarding him: “And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses etc.” His soul will be unable to enter the domain of the Holy One, blessed be He, and he is rebuffed from the World-to-Come.

Paragraph 223

<b>223. “The seventh commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The seventh commandment is to be circumcised at eight days and to remove the contamination of the foreskin. That creature</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>]<b>,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>is the eighth level of all levels,</b> i. e., [when counting] starting from <i>Bina</i>. <b>That soul which flies from</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] <b>must show itself before</b> [<i>Malkhut</i>] <b>at eight days, for it is the eighth level.</b>
Explanation: The <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called a <b>“creature”</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>] only through its ascent and enclothing of the <i>Bina</i>, which is the eighth level of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, [when counting] from below to above. The <i>Malkhut</i>, which is <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, is also called “eighth,” because it ascended eight levels, from [its own level] to the <i>Bina</i>. Only then is it also called a <b>“creature”</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>], like the <i>Bina</i>.
Now, the soul of man, which is born from the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> called a <b>“creature”</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>] and “eighth,” must show itself before the <i>Nukba</i> with the rectifications of circumcision and [the act of] uncovering [that precedes the circumcision], on the eighth day after [the soul’s] birth. [Through this] it is apparent and evident that the soul [comes] from that holy creature [<i>ḥaya</i>], and not from another side. [This is] because it is through the power of the circumcision and uncovering that the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is entirely rebuffed from <b>that</b> human <b>soul,</b> and [the soul] can receive the full lights of that creature [the <i>Malkhut</i> called <i>ḥaya</i>]. <b>This is the meaning of “Let the waters swarm”</b> [see next section]. Through this, the [soul] receives the supernal masculine waters [flowing from] [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and is completed through these waters.

Paragraph 224

<b>224. “At that time it is seen as a certainty, etc.”</b><br><b>At that time it is visibly clear that it is a living creature</b> [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>], i. e., <b>a soul</b> [<i>nefesh</i>] <b>of that holy creature</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>], which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>and not from the other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>]. <b>This is</b> [the meaning of]: <b>“Let the waters swarm”</b> [Genesis 1:20], which is explained [as follows] <b>in the Book of Enoch: The waters of the holy seed will be imprinted with the impression of the living creature. This is the imprint of the letter <i>yod</i>, which is inscribed in the holy flesh more than all the other inscriptions in the world.</b>
Explanation: [The <i>Zohar</i>] interprets the verse: <b>“Let the waters swarm</b> [<i>yishretzu</i>] <b>with swarms of living creatures”</b> as a language of imprinting and inscription [<i>hitztaiyrut</i>]. Through the circumcision and [the act of] uncovering [prior to the circumcision], the supernal masculine waters which are transmitted to a person’s soul, are imprinted and inscribed in the <b>imprinting</b> and inscribing of the <i>Nukba</i>, which is called a <b>“living creature”</b> [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>].
Now, the higher world, <i>Bina</i>, is inscribed and sealed with the [letter] <b><i>yod</i>,</b> while the lower world, <i>Malkhut</i>, is inscribed and sealed with the [letter] <b><i>heh</i>.</b> When the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the <i>Nukba</i>, ascends and enclothes the higher world, <i>Bina</i>, <b>the <i>heh</i> leaves and is replaced by a <i>yod</i>,</b> like the <i>Bina</i> (as stated at the end of section #17#, above; see the <i>Sulam</i> there).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“This is the imprint of the letter <i>yod</i>, which is inscribed in the holy flesh more than all the other inscriptions in the world.”</b> Through circumcision and [the act of] uncovering [prior to the circumcision], all <b>the inscriptions of</b> this <b>world,</b> which are from the [letter] <b><i>heh</i>,</b> are removed from man as well, and <b>the imprint of the letter <i>yod</i></b> comes in its stead, just as occurred in the <i>Nukba</i> which ascended to <i>Bina</i>, as stated. Since the holy flesh of <i>Yesod</i> is sealed with the <b><i>yod</i>,</b> the man can also receive a complete living soul [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>] from the <b>holy</b> <i>Nukba</i>.

Paragraph 225

<b>225. “And let fowl fly, etc.”</b><br><b>“And let fowl fly above the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:20]. <b>This is Elijah, who flies the entire world in four flights, in order to be there at that covenant of the holy sign</b> of circumcision. <b>A seat must be set up for him, and one must declare with his mouth: “This is the seat of Elijah.” Otherwise, he will not be present there.</b>
Explanation: We must understand that here [the <i>Zohar</i>] is interpreting the verse <b>“and let fowl fly”</b> as referring to <b>“Elijah, who flies the entire world in four flights,”</b> while later (<i>Bereshit</i> I, page 314, section 407) [the <i>Zohar</i>] will expound the ensuing verse, “and every winged fowl after its kind” [Genesis 1:21], in relation to the angels that fly and glide through the world in six flights.
The reason is that here [the <i>Zohar</i>] is mainly interpreting the end of the verse, which states <b>“above the earth.”</b> This cannot be explained as referring to the lofty angels, for they are not in the earth [at all]. Therefore, it must necessarily be <b>Elijah,</b> as stated below, <i>Bereshit</i> II, page 107, section 166: <b>“Fly above the earth” is Elijah, who is always found in the earth, and not at the side of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i></b> [“Father and Mother”]<b>, since he flies in four flights.</b> The meaning is as follows: The angels are <b>from the side of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,</b> and thus they are found only in heaven and they have six extremities: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. Consequently, when [those angels] come to the earth to fulfill their mission, they fly <b>in six flights,</b> for they are enclothed in six <i>sefirot</i>.
<b>Elijah,</b> however, is not <b>from the side of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,</b> but from the side of <i>Malkhut</i>, and this is the mystical meaning of <b>“is always in the earth.”</b> Because the <i>Malkhut</i> has only four <i>sefirot</i> from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, i. e., <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, from his chest and below, he therefore <b>flies the entire world in</b> only <b>four flights,</b> that is, he is enclothed in the four <i>sefirot</i> <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. Since the verse states: <b>“And let fowl fly above the earth,”</b> it cannot be referring to the angels, but only to <b>Elijah,</b> who is on the earth. This is not the case for the verse: <b>“And every winged fowl after its kind,”</b> which does not mention “above the earth.” That is referring to the angels, who are <b>from the side of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, and they fly the entire world in six flights.</b>
<b>“In order to be there at that covenant of the holy sign</b> of circumcision.” Below (<i>Lekh Lekha</i>, page 129, section 388) he states that the reason is because Elijah said: <b>“I have been very jealous for the Lord,</b> [the God of hosts], <b>for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant</b> etc.” [I Kings 19:10]. “[God therefore] <b>said to him: By your life; in every place where My sons inscribe this holy inscription in their flesh, you will be present there. The mouth that testified that Israel have forsaken</b> [the covenant] <b>will testify that Israel are fulfilling it. And we learned: Why was Elijah punished by the Holy One, blessed be He? Because he slandered His children.”</b>
Now, Heaven forbid that this should be understood in accordance with its plain meaning, that Elijah was sentenced to being present at every circumcision in Israel as a punishment for <b>slandering</b> [the people of] Israel. Furthermore, why is it stated here that he must be invited and <b>“one must declare with his mouth: ‘This is the seat of Elijah. ’ Otherwise, he will not be present there”?</b> If, Heaven forbid, he is forced be present at every circumcision as a punishment, then [clearly] he has to be <b>there.</b> In addition, why is <b>Elijah’s</b> testimony required, for him to attest before God that the children of Israel are observing circumcision? Is not everything revealed before God? Rather, a great and awesome secret is concealed here under [the Sages’] sweet words, as is their usual practice.
You can understand this matter by means of a passage cited in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Shelaḥ Lekha</i>, page 39, section 117): <b>Rabbi Ilai opened</b> [his discourse] etc.: <b>With respect to Abraham it is stated: “Walk before me and be wholehearted</b> [<i>tamim</i>]” [Genesis 17:1], [whereas with regard to] <b>Jacob, who was more complete, it is stated: “Jacob was a whole</b> [<i>tam</i>] <b>man”</b> [Genesis 25:27]. <b>Why is he called “a <i>tam</i> man”? Because there was no waste left in him at all, for uncovering had transpired in him</b> etc. <b>The place of uncovering of the flesh is an ox, which is the form of the left of His throne. That ox is called an innocuous</b> [<i>tam</i>] <b>ox... for there is a forewarned</b> [<i>mu’ad</i>] <b>ox on the uncovered area of the foreskin. Several plaintiffs emerge from it until the lower level, called “destruction”... in the company of that forewarned ox</b> etc. <b>“And Jacob was a <i>tam</i> man” means the husband of that <i>tam</i> one.</b> See there.
Explanation: There are four <i>kelippot</i>: “A stormy wind”; “a great cloud” “a fire flashing”; and “a brightness surrounding it” [Ezekiel 1:4]. The first three are all impure <i>kelippot</i>, but the <i>kelippa</i> of the “brightness [<i>noga</i>]” is half good and half evil. When the three <i>kelippot</i> are attached to [this fourth <i>kelippa</i>], it becomes entirely evil, but when it separates from [the other three <i>kelippot</i>] and cleaves to holiness, [this fourth <i>kelippa</i>] becomes entirely good. The place of these four <i>kelippot</i> is at the [lower] endpoint of the <i>partzuf</i>, which is at the endpoint of <i>Yesod</i>, where there are two skins, one atop the other. The first skin is called <b>“foreskin,”</b> and it incorporates the three impure <i>kelippot</i>: “A stormy wind”; “a great cloud,” and “a fire flashing.” The second skin is called the skin of <b>uncovering,</b> which is an embodiment of the <i>noga</i> <i>kelippa</i>, which is half good and half evil.
Now, Adam the first [man] was born circumcised, because the three impure <i>kelippot</i> had no purchase on him, and he had only the <i>noga</i> <i>kelippa</i> in him, which is the skin of <b>uncovering.</b> [That <i>kelippa</i>] was also entirely good, since it was separated from the three impure <i>kelippot</i> and cleaved to the holiness. However, due to the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, through the seduction of the snake which is formed from the three impure <i>kelippot</i>, [Adam] pulled over himself the second skin, which is the <b>foreskin,</b> as the Sages stated (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b): “Adam the first [man] drew his foreskin forward.”
This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“And warning has been given to its owner, and he has not kept it in</b> [but it has killed a man or a woman], <b>the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death”</b> [Exodus 21:29]. At the time when the foreskin sprang upon [Adam] and connected to his <i>Yesod</i>, [Adam’s] soul of [the level of] <i>Atzilut</i> immediately flew away from him and [Adam] fell to <i>Asiya</i>, and death was decreed upon him. This is the mystical meaning of the <i>Zohar</i> passage cited above: <b>“There is a forewarned ox on the uncovered area of the foreskin.”</b> Since [Adam] was warned not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge and he did not observe [that command] but ate, the foreskin sprang upon him, as stated. The two skins were defiled together, because the skin of <b>uncovering,</b> which is <i>noga</i>, was also defiled on account of its connection and attachment to the foreskin, which is [formed of] the three impure <i>kelippot</i>. However, there is a difference between [the two skins], because the skin of uncovering is called <b>“an innocuous ox,”</b> rather than <b>a forewarned</b> one, since it was in [a state of] complete holiness before the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. It was defiled only due to the foreskin that was attached to it.
Therefore, there are two special rectifications [in the procedure of circumcision]: Circumcision and uncovering. It is written regarding the <b>forewarned ox:</b> “The ox shall be stoned,” and likewise the foreskin must be removed and cut off from the holiness and thrown to the dust. In the case of the <b>innocuous ox,</b> by contrast, it is stated: <b>“They shall divide its price”</b> [Exodus 21:35]. Similarly, the skin of uncovering must be placed in holiness, connected to <i>Yesod</i>, but it must be halved and torn this way and that, for the brains are thereby exposed to the <i>partzuf</i> once again and holy flesh is revealed.
This is the meaning of the statement there: <b>“Uncovering is performed with this ox, and the contamination of the waste is completely removed.”</b> By halving the skin this way and that, around the <i>Yesod</i>, all the contamination that the skin of <b>uncovering</b> received from its previous connection to the <b>foreskin</b> is nullified and goes away, and the brains that departed because of the foreskin can be revealed once more.
However, this is still not sufficient to bring back all the brains that left Adam the first [man] on account of the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, for it is written, “And <b>its owner also shall be put to death,”</b> even though <b>the ox is stoned.</b> This is due to the great power of <b>the forewarned ox,</b> which is the mystical meaning of the accusing <i>samael</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This name should not be pronounced out loud.</i> by virtue of the verse: <b>“And warning has been given to its owner, and he has not kept it in.”</b>
In order to rectify this [insufficiency], <b>Elijah</b> took upon himself that same <b>slander</b> of the <i>samael</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This name should not be pronounced out loud.</i> and accused the children of Israel instead of the <i>samael</i>, as it is stated: <b>“For the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant.”</b> He thereby closed the <i>samael</i>’s mouth and the mission of <i>samael</i> was cancelled because <b>Elijah</b> had taken his mission upon himself. This gave [Elijah] the strength to become an advocate later, at the times when he sees that the children of Israel are keeping the covenant.
This is why it states (below, <i>Lekh Lekha</i>, page 129, section 388) that the reason why <b>Elijah</b> must be present at every circumcision is so that <b>“the mouth that testified that Israel have forsaken</b> [the covenant] <b>will testify that Israel are fulfilling it.”</b> Since [Elijah] took upon himself the [accusing] power of <i>samael</i> to accuse the children of Israel, by saying that Israel forsook the covenant (in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“And warning has been given to its owner, and he has not kept it in”</b>), for this reason he also has the power to testify that they are keeping the covenant. Then the power of the <b>forewarned ox</b> is completely removed, and all the brains that left on account of the <b>forewarned ox</b> can be revealed once again. Understand this well; it will be further clarified below.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“A seat must be set up for him.”</b> That is, apart from the seat of the <i>sandak</i> [godfather], on which the <b>circumcision and uncovering</b> are performed, an additional seat must be set up for <b>Elijah.</b> This requires explanation: Why isn’t a single seat enough for both of them? The idea is that the mystical meaning of a seat is that it is always the start of a rectification by which the upper [level] rests upon the lower [level]. As has already been explained above (in the previous section), the issue of the brains that are revealed through the circumcision and uncovering, and the issue of <b>Elijah</b>’s testimony about the fulfilment of the covenant, are two distinct matters: The amount of brains that are revealed by virtue of the <b>uncovering</b> are an expression of <b>the innocuous ox, when it is not known that the ox was wont to gore</b> [see Exodus 21:36]. This is the mystical meaning of the returning of <i>noga</i> to holiness by means of: <b>“They shall divide its price”;</b> see there.
The purpose of <b>Elijah</b>’s testimony is to remove the evil of the <b>forewarned ox,</b> which is the power of the three impure <i>kelippot</i> themselves, and to close their mouths so that they cannot accuse. Consequently, two seats are necessary. The first is the seat of God, which is the seat of the <i>sandek</i>. [This chair] is for imparting the brains through the circumcision and uncovering. The second one is for imparting the illumination of <b>Elijah,</b> who closes the mouth of the <i>kelippot</i> so they cannot accuse. This is <b>the seat of Elijah.</b>
<b>“One must declare with his mouth: This is the seat of Elijah. Otherwise, he will not be present there.”</b> This requires clarification. What is this great obligation to issue the declaration <b>“This is the seat of Elijah,”</b> to the extent that if one does not articulate it, then even if a seat has been prepared for [Elijah], he will not come? The idea is as stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tisa</i>, page 15, section 46), on the verse: “Why are you here [<i>poh</i>] Elijah” [I Kings 19:9], that this is the mystical meaning of the mouth of Elijah, while the sign of the covenant is the mouth [<i>peh</i>] of God; see there. Thus, there is a difference between the sign of the covenant, which is the brains that are revealed through circumcision and uncovering, in the mystical meaning of the mouth of God, and the mouth of Elijah himself.
In order to understand this, one must delve deeper into the issue of closing the mouth of the <b>forewarned ox</b> so it does not accuse Israel after the return of the brains through circumcision and uncovering. Apart from the aforementioned testimony of <b>Elijah,</b> another special rectification is required, which is achieved by throwing the foreskin to the dust. As stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Pekudei</i>, page 212, section 691): <b>“When a person is circumcised on the eighth day,</b> such that the day of <b>Shabbat has</b> already <b>passed over him,</b> which is the mystical meaning of <b><i>Malkut</i></b> in the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, called <b>holy, that foreskin,</b> which <b>is cut and thrown outside, the</b> <b><i>Sitra Aḥara</i></b> <b>rises and sees</b> it, [and realizes] <b>that it has been given a part of that offering</b> of circumcision. By virtue of this gift, [the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>is then broken and is unable to rule over and accuse them, and it is transformed</b> from an accuser <b>into an advocate of Israel before the Holy One, blessed be He.”</b>
Explanation: It is the nature of spiritual beings to be incorporated in one another. Since the foreskin was once attached to <i>Yesod</i>, when it is cut off from <i>Yesod</i> it takes part of the holiness with it. When we throw the foreskin to the external forces, they thereby suckle some illumination from the brains that are revealed through circumcision and uncovering. For this reason, [those external forces] no longer wish to accuse Israel and shut down these brains, for they too would lose their share that they take from these brains. They therefore become advocates for Israel, in order to maintain the brains in them.
As a consequence, <b>Elijah</b> cannot tolerate this rectification, for although [the external forces] stop accusing Israel, they take part of the holiness in return. To rectify this, <b>Elijah</b> took all the accusing upon himself as he does not wish to appease [the external forces] at all by giving [them] a part of the offering of holiness. The result is that although the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> has stopped accusing and become an advocate, <b>Elijah</b> himself is still accusing, in order to uproot the power of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> entirely and separate it from the holiness. Therefore, the mouth of <b>Elijah</b> is required here, in addition to <b>the mouth of God</b> which is revealed through the circumcision and uncovering and which leaves part of the offering to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. <b>Elijah’s mouth</b> completely uproots the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, in the mystical meaning of: <b>“The mouth that testified that Israel have forsaken</b> [the covenant] <b>will testify that Israel are fulfilling it,”</b> as just stated above.
This is why <b>“one must declare with his mouth: This is the seat of Elijah.”</b> That is, it is necessary to mention and draw forth the aspect of <b>the mouth of Elijah</b> on his <b>seat.</b> [It is not sufficient to] make do with <b>the mouth of God,</b> which also removes the accuser and turns it into an advocate. [Relying only on the mouth of God] requires giving a part to the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, as stated. By means of Elijah’s mouth, however, the accuser is removed and he does not need to appease [the accuser] in return at all.
If a person does not make the effort to draw forth the <b>mouth of Elijah</b> with <b>his mouth,</b> upon his <b>seat,</b> then [Elijah] <b>will not be present there,</b> for he must be drawn in. One should not ask: “How is it possible for <b>the mouth of Elijah</b> to rectify more than <b>the mouth of God,”</b> for this is the mystical meaning of <b>“which God in creating had made”</b> [Genesis 2:3]: God initiated creation in such a way that man can complete it through his good deeds.

Paragraph 226

<b>226. “And God created, etc.”</b><br><b>“And God created the great sea-monsters.”</b> “Sea-monsters” indicates <b>two,</b> and <b>these are the foreskin and uncovering,</b> i. e., <b>the cutting of the foreskin, followed by uncovering. And they are male and female. “And every living soul that creeps”: This is the imprint of the sign of the holy covenant, which is a holy living soul, as we have stated. “With which the waters swarmed”</b> [Genesis 1:21] <b>is the upper waters that were drawn to it, to this imprinted sign.</b>
Explanation: The <b>“sea-monsters”</b> are the leviathan and his mate. Corresponding to them are <b>the foreskin and uncovering,</b> which are “the slant serpent” and “the tortuous serpent” [Isaiah 27:1], male and female. T<b>he foreskin</b> is the slant serpent, a male, which must be removed and thrown to the dust, while uncovering is a rectification for removing the evil of the tortuous serpent, the female.
Now, the verse “and every living [soul, <i>nefesh ḥaya</i>] that creeps” alludes to the imprint of the sign of the holy covenant. By means of the uncovering, when the skin of <b>the uncovering</b> is parted this way and that over the <i>Yesod</i>, the imprint of the [letter] <b><i>yod</i></b> appears, which is the aspect of the endpoint of the upper world called <b><i>ḥaya</i></b> (as stated above, in section #17#; see section #224#, above). This is why it is called <b>“an imprint of a holy living soul,”</b> regarding which the verse states: <b>“And every living soul that creeps.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The upper waters that were drawn to it, to this imprinted sign,”</b> this is referring to the masculine <b>waters</b> [that flow downward from] the higher world, <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which are called <b><i>ḥaya</i>.</b> They are drawn down only as [a result of] the imprint of the <b><i>yod</i></b> (as stated in section #17#, above). The [letter] <b><i>heh</i></b> emerges, and the <b><i>yod</i></b> enters [in its stead]; see there.

Paragraph 227

<b>227. “For this reason, Israel were imprinted, etc.”</b><br><b>For this reason, Israel were imprinted with a holy and pure imprints below, like the holy imprints</b> above, <b>to distinguish between the holy side and the other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>]. <b>So is Israel imprinted, to distinguish between the sanctity</b> of Israel <b>and the idol-worshipping nations that come from the other side, as we learned. And just as He imprinted</b> Israel, <b>so too He imprinted their beasts and fowl, to</b> differentiate between them and <b>the beasts and fowls of the idol-worshipping nations. Happy is the portion of Israel.</b>
Explanation: Their beasts and fowl were also imprinted because a person’s relation toward the rest of the creatures in the world is like the relation of the collective toward its individuals. [This is] because man incorporates in his body all the creatures of the world in one collective [form]. Each and every creature is a single unit that exists independently, a [form] differentiated from the [collective] form of man [which collectively contains all those creatures]. Therefore, just as Israel are distinguished from the nations of the world in terms of their human aspect, that same distinction operates in the individualized [creatures], which are the [individualized forms of] <b>beasts and fowl.</b> [The <i>Zohar</i>] singles out <b>beasts and fowl</b> because the verse mentions them, but the same applies to all creatures that are individualized [differentiations from the collective forms] of Israel and the [different collective forms of the humans of the] nations of the world.

Paragraph 228

<b>228. “The eighth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The eighth commandment is to love the convert who comes to be circumcised and to enter under the wings of the Divine Presence. She,</b> the <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>brings under her wings all those who separate themselves from the impure other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>and draw near to her, as it is stated: “Let the earth bring forth the living creature</b> [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>] <b>after its kind”</b> [Genesis 1:24].
Explanation: The topic of the wings of the Divine Presence is a lengthy and profound matter, but I will clarify it as much as necessary to understand this section. The <i>Malkhut</i>, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, is called <b>the Divine Presence</b> with respect to the [dynamic of] revelation. [The <i>Malkhut</i>] does not depart from us even when we are very far from it, in the mystical meaning of: “<b>In every place where they were exiled, the Divine Presence is with them”</b> [see <i>Megilla</i> 29a], and in the mystical meaning of: <b>“That dwells</b> [<i>ha-shokhen</i>] <b>with them in the midst of their impurity”</b> [Leviticus 16:16; see <i>Yoma</i> 56b]. From this perspective, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called <b><i>Shokhen</i>,</b> and the <i>Nukba</i> [is called the] <b>Divine Presence</b>. This revelation [of the Divine Presence] occurs only when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are face-to-face at an equal height, since [in that state] the illumination of their pairing is very great, until the unification [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] is revealed even in the most remote and restricted places.
It is known that the structure of maturity of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> does not develop all at once. Rather, first the immaturity of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> is constructed with the brains of the six extremities. After this [construction, the brains of] maturity are drawn forth. This [process] applies to all levels of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. Moreover, even when [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> have the brains of maturity, the brains of immaturity are not nullified, Heaven forbid, because they too must assist in the pairings [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> when they are in the state] of the brains of maturity. At that stage, [the brains of immaturity are] called <b>“the wings of the Divine Presence.”</b>
This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings”</b> [Exodus 25:20]. The main function [of the wings of the Divine Presence] is to spread their wings and cover the illumination of the pairings [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> when they are in the state] of maturity, such that even the most distant will be able to receive from the light of the pairing without anything thereby reaching the <i>kelippot</i>. Those who are not in a state of complete purity are always rebuffed by the light of holiness, out of fear that they might transfer the <i>shefa</i> to the <i>kelippot</i>. However, by means of the covering of the wings [of the Divine Presence], there is a great protection of the <i>shefa</i>, until even the ones nearest to the <i>kelippot</i> cannot fail and [thereby] bring down the <i>shefa</i> to the <i>kelippot</i>, because the wings protect [those distant entities].
Therefore, one who comes to convert and be circumcised, because his body derives from the aspect of the <b>foreskin</b> – for his ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai and the contamination of the snake was not removed from them – nevertheless, we still have the power to raise him to supernal holiness. [This is achieved] by raising feminine waters for the pairing of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> in the mature state of face-to-face. <b>The wings of the Divine Presence</b> rule there, spreading their wings and covering the light of that pairing, as stated. Then we can also raise the soul of the convert there, and he is sanctified by the light of that pairing.
Although [that convert] is not entirely pure, at that time he can receive from the illumination of the pairing, because the wings protect him so that the <i>shefa</i> [he receives] will not be transferred to the <i>kelippot</i>, Heaven forbid, despite the fact that he is near them. The reason why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states “under the wings of the Divine Presence” is because [the converts] can receive only from the light of <i>Malkhut</i>, and only from the wings [of <i>Malkhut</i>], i. e., the exterior of <i>Malkhut</i>. They cannot [receive] from <b>the body of the Divine Presence,</b> much less from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> itself, as [the <i>Zohar</i>] will proceed to explain.
[The <i>Zohar</i> continues]: <b>“She brings under her wings</b> etc.” One might question [this by noting] that [the <i>Zohar</i>] previously stated <b>“and to enter under the wings of the Divine Presence,”</b> which implies that we must raise the convert [to be] under the wings of the Divine Presence. Here [however], [the <i>Zohar</i>] says that <b>“she brings under her wings,”</b> implying that the Divine Presence herself raises the [converts] up [to be under her wings].
The explanation is that it is only possible to draw the soul of the convert closer at the time of a pairing [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> in the state] of maturity. Only then do the wings of the Divine Presence cover the illumination [generated by] the pairing, as stated. Consequently, we must first raise feminine waters, to arouse this pairing of maturity and draw the illumination of the pairing to our souls. Then the Divine Presence spreads her wings and covers the light of the Divine Presence, bringing the soul of the convert under her wings. Thus, we first elevate the soul of the convert by means of our feminine waters, and after [that soul] has ascended the Divine Presence will receive him under her wings.

Paragraph 229

<b>229. “You might say that this, etc.”</b><br><b>You might say that this <i>nefesh ḥaya</i></b> [living soul, creature]<b>, which is incorporated in Israel, is meant for everyone.</b> [The verse therefore] <b>reiterates: “After its kind”</b> [Genesis 1:24], i. e., <b>for Israel and not for the converts. How many corridors and rooms, one inside the other, are possessed by this Earth</b> called <b><i>ḥaya</i></b> [living], <b>under its wings.</b>
Explanation: It has been explained that it is possible to raise the soul of the convert only when we raise feminine waters for the pairing [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> in their state] of maturity and draw for ourselves the illumination of <i>neshama</i> from that pairing. Then the spreading of the wings of the Divine Presence occurs, towards which the soul of the convert ascends, and he too receives from the light of the pairing, as stated.
In this regard, [the <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“You might say that this <i>nefesh ḥaya</i>, which is incorporated in Israel, is meant for everyone.”</b> [In other words, ] one might claim that the convert also receives from that light of [the pairing of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>, the light of] the living soul [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>] that Israel drew forth for the illumination of their souls. “[The verse therefore] <b>reiterates: After its kind,”</b> [to teach] that the converts receive [only the specific] illumination of the pairing that belongs to their type, i. e., only from the exterior of the pairing, not from the interior, which belongs to Israel alone.
Now, you already know that <b>the wings</b> are the aspect of the six extremities from the phase of immaturity, which function during the pairing of [the phase of] maturity as well, to cover the light [generated by] the pairing. The six extremities consist of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> are called <b>“rooms,”</b> meaning places for dwelling. <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> are called <b>“corridors,”</b> because they are only gateways and entrances to the rooms, but they themselves are not for dwelling, since they serve only as entrances and exits.
The reason [for this distinction] is that the essence of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> is <i>Tiferet</i>, their middle line, which is a complete vessel and a receptacle for the light of giving. [In contrast, ] the essence of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> is <i>Yesod</i>, the middle line, which does not contain a receptacle for itself at all, but serves only as a passageway [for direct light], as well as to raise returning light, as is known. This is why the <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> are called only <b>“corridors.”</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“How many corridors and rooms</b> etc. <b>under its wings,”</b> for she must bring under her wings converts from seventy nations, and therefore <b>many rooms</b> are ready for them in the <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of <b>the wings,</b> and <b>several corridors</b> in the <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of <b>the wings.</b> [The converts] receive the aspect of <i>nefesh</i> from <b>the corridors,</b> and the aspect of <i>ruaḥ</i> from <b>the rooms.</b>

Paragraph 230

<b>230. “The right wing has, etc.”</b><br><b>The right wing</b> of <i>Malkhut</i> <b>has two corridors, which divide from this wing for two other nations that are close to Israel in uniqueness, to bring them into these corridors. Under the left wing there are two other corridors, which divide for two other nations, Ammon and Moab. They are all called “living soul”</b> [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>].
Explanation: [The <i>Zohar</i>] previously stated that there are <b>several corridors,</b> whereas here it says that there are only two on <b>the right</b> and two on <b>the left.</b> The explanation is that here [the <i>Zohar</i>] is speaking only about the encompassing [corridors], [i. e., ] that there are <b>two corridors</b> on the right, encompassing the nations that belong to the right, and there are <b>two</b> encompassing <b>corridors</b> on the left, for the nations that belong to the left.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says that there are <b>two nations</b> from the right side that incorporate all the nations from the right side, [nations which all] relate to the <b>two</b> encompassing <b>corridors</b> on <b>the right wing,</b> but the <i>Zohar</i> does not identify [those two main nations]. Likewise, there are two nations from the left side which incorporate all the nations from the left side. [Those two incorporating nations] are <b>Ammon and Moab.</b> These relate to the <b>two</b> encompassing <b>corridors</b> on <b>the left wing.</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“They are all called living soul.”</b> All the souls of the converts that come from all the nations are called <b>“living soul.”</b> The reason is that they can receive only from the pairing of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> of the phase] of maturity since [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are then in the place of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>. [In that state] the <i>Malkhut</i> is called <b>“living soul”</b> [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>], because she contains the light of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], which is <b>the light of</b> <b><i>ḥaya</i></b><b>.</b> Since the souls of the converts receive from <b>the wings</b> of <b>the living soul,</b> they too are called <b>“living souls.”</b>

Paragraph 231

<b>231. “Several other closed rooms, etc.”</b><br><b>Several other sealed rooms and other chambers are in each and every wing. Spirits emerge from them, to be distributed amongst all those converts who are converting. They are called “living souls,” but “after its kind.” They all enter under the wings of the Divine Presence, but no further.</b>
Explanation: Each wing is comprised of the six extremities, which are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. These are called <b>“rooms”</b> and <b>“corridors.”</b> Each and every nation has its own designated room in <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>, and its own designated <b>corridor</b> in <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>. From the corridors each one receives an aspect of <b><i>nefesh</i></b><b>,</b> and from <b>the rooms</b> each one receives an aspect of <i>ruaḥ</i>. The reason why [the <i>Zohar</i> calls them] <b>“sealed rooms”</b> is because <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> of the six extremities are of the aspect of the covered [dynamic of] giving, which are <b>sealed</b> off from the illumination of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as is known, and thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] calls them “sealed.”

Paragraph 232

<b>232. “But the soul of Israel, etc.”</b><br><b>But the soul of Israel emerges from the body of that tree,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and from there souls fly into this earth,</b> <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>into its intestines, to the innermost place. The secret is: “For you shall be a delightful land”</b> [Malachi 3:12]. <b>Therefore, Israel is a darling son, for whom her innards yearn</b> [see Jeremiah 31:19]. <b>They are called “those who are borne from the belly”</b> [Isaiah 46:3], <b>and not from the wings,</b> which are <b>outside</b> the body. <b>Furthermore, converts have no portion in the supernal tree,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and certainly not in its body. Rather, their share is in the wings</b> of <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>and no more. The convert is under the wings of the Divine Presence, and no more. Righteous converts are those who reside and have a hold there, but not inside, as stated. Because of this it is stated: “Let the earth bring forth the living creature</b> [<i>nefesh ḥaya</i>] <b>after its kind.” Regarding whom? “Cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after its kind”</b> [Genesis 1:24]. <b>All pull soul</b> [<i>nefesh</i>] <b>from that creature</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>], <b>but each after its kind, as befitting it.</b>
Explanation: <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called <b>“a tree,”</b> i. e., “the tree of life” [see Genesis 2:9], and <i>Nukba</i> is called “the land of the living” [see Job 28:13], that is, in the phase of maturity, when they enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, which are the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“The soul of Israel emerges from the body of that tree,”</b> from the interior aspect of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>“and from there souls fly into this earth, into its intestines, to the innermost place.”</b> By means of the pairing of <b>that tree,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>with the land</b> of the living, which is the <i>Nukba</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> transmits <b>the souls of Israel</b> to <i>Nukba</i>, to her innermost point within. From [that innermost point] <b>Israel</b> receive their souls from [<i>Nukba</i>], not like converts who receive only from the <i>Nukba</i> alone, and only from the exterior of the <i>Nukba</i>, from her wings, rather than from <b>“the innermost place,”</b> which means the innermost point within.
The idea is that the <i>Nukba</i> has three <i>partzufim</i> [reflecting phases of maturity] enclothed in one another, which are called gestation, infancy, [and] brains. The <i>partzuf</i> of the brains is enclothed in the <i>partzuf</i> of infancy, while the <i>partzuf</i> of infancy is enclothed in the <i>partzuf</i> of gestation. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is precise [in saying] that <b>Israel</b> receives from the innermost point within the <i>Nukba</i>, i. e., from the <i>partzuf</i> of the brains.
This is the meaning of <b>“a darling son</b>...” [i. e., ] Israel is therefore called a darling son, for whom her innards yearn. They are called “those who are borne from the belly, and not from the wings,” which are her exterior. The explanation of this is that the <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>Nukba</i> are called <b>“belly,”</b> because that is the place of the gestation and growth of the souls of Israel. However, it is not referring to aspects of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of the two external <i>partzufim</i>, called gestation and infancy, which are aspects of the wings. Rather, the reference is to <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>partzuf</i> of the brains, which are of the aspect of the innards.
This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“Is Ephraim a darling son to Me? Is he a child who is dandled? For as often as I speak of him, I earnestly remember him still; therefore My innards yearn for him,</b> etc.” [Jeremiah 31:19]. Since the souls of Israel are from the interior of <i>Malkhut</i>, called “the innards,” it therefore states: <b>“My innards yearn for him.”</b> This is why the verse calls them: <b>“Borne from the belly,”</b> for they are all of the aspect of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of the <i>partzuf</i> of the brains, <b>“and not from the wings,</b> which are <b>outside</b> the body,” [i. e., ] not from <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> of the two outer <i>partzufim</i>, which are an aspect of the wings.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Furthermore, converts have no</b> etc.” [In other words, ] converts have no share in the supernal tree, and certainly not in its body. Rather, their portion is only in the wings and no more, meaning that which is under the wings of the Divine Presence and no further. This is why they are called “righteous converts,” because the Divine Presence is called righteous. They reside under her wings, and they unite with her, and they have no portion from above, from the Divine Presence.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Regarding whom? Cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth</b> etc.” Any [being] that has a soul from the aspect of <b>cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth</b> receives [that soul] only from <b>the soul</b> [<i>nefesh</i>] <b>of that creature</b> [<i>ḥaya</i>], which is <i>Malkhut</i> in [a state of pairing in the phase] of maturity face-to-face with <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. And yet <b>each is after its kind, as befitting it,</b> i. e., only from the aspect of <b>the wings</b> and not from the interior of the illumination of this great pairing.

Paragraph 233

<b>233. “The ninth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The ninth commandment is to be gracious to the poor and give them food, as it is stated: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”</b> [Genesis 1:26]. <b>“Let us make man”</b> [means] <b>in partnership,</b> for he <b>consists of male and female. “In our image”</b> means [the] <b>wealthy; “after our likeness”</b> is referring to <b>the poor.</b>

Paragraph 234

<b>234. “For on the side of the male, etc.”</b><br><b>On the side of the male</b> they are <b>the wealthy, whereas on the side of the female</b> they are <b>the poor. Just as they are in one partnership, have mercy upon one another, give to one another and perform kindness with him, so too must a person be below: The rich and the poor in one partnership, giving to each other, and performing kindness with one another.</b>

Paragraph 235

<b>235. “And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, etc.”</b><br><b>“And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea”</b> [Genesis 1:26]. <b>We have seen this secret in the book of King Solomon, that whoever has mercy upon the poor with a willing heart, his form never changes from the form of Adam the first</b> [man]. <b>Once the form of Adam is imprinted upon him, he rules over all the creatures of the world through that form. This is</b> [the meaning of] <b>the verse: “And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth</b> etc.” [Genesis 9:2]. <b>They all tremble and are scared of that form which was imprinted upon him. Since this commandment,</b> to be gracious to the poor, <b>is a finer commandment than all other commandments for elevating man in the form of Adam the first</b> [man].

Paragraph 236

<b>236. “From where do we know this? From Nebuchadnezzar, etc.”</b><br><b>From where do we know this? From Nebuchadnezzar. Even though he dreamed that dream, as long as he was gracious towards the poor, the dream was not fulfilled for him. Once he cast an evil eye to not be gracious towards the poor, what is written? “While the word was in the king’s mouth</b> [there fell a voice from heaven…And you shall be driven from men and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field,” Daniel 4:28-29]. <b>Immediately, his form changed and he was driven from men. For this reason</b> it is stated: <b>“Let us make man”</b> [Genesis 1:26]. <b>Here it is written “making,” and there it is stated: “The man’s name with whom I made today is Boaz”</b> [Ruth 2:19], where “making” means charity. Here too, “making” means charity.
Explanation: This requires explanation. While Scripture delineates the creation of <b>male and female,</b> i. e., <b>the wealthy and the poor,</b> there is no hint here at all that <b>the wealthy</b> should have mercy upon <b>the poor</b> and sustain them, which [would justify] his saying that this verse is <b>a commandment to be gracious to the poor</b> etc. [section #233#]. Rather, there is a very great profundity here, for this utterance differs from all the previous ones. In all of them the utterance is separate from the [action of] making, e. g., <b>“And God said, Let there be light. And there was light”</b> [Genesis 1:3]; <b>“And God said: Let there be a firmament</b>... <b>And God made the firmament”</b> [Genesis 1:6–7]; <b>“And God said: Let the waters be gathered</b>… <b>And it was so”</b> [Genesis 1:9].
The same applies to all of them; you will not find that the making is mixed with the utterance. The reason (as the Zohar explains below) is that creation emerged in the mystical meaning of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (father and mother), with <i>Abba</i> speaking and <i>Imma</i> making. <i>Abba</i> transmitted the <i>shefa</i> to <i>Imma</i>, and after the <i>shefa</i> was imprinted with the boundaries of <i>Imma</i>, the <i>shefa</i> was actualized. This resembles potential and actualization, since from the aspect of <i>Abba</i> alone no creation could be actualized, because there is no boundary [in <i>Abba</i>] to define the actualization in any form, as is known. Therefore, there is an utterance from <i>Abba</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the transmission [of <i>shefa</i>] to <i>Imma</i>. Since [the entity referenced in the utterance] is still in a state of <b>potential,</b> [the text] cannot use an expression of <b>making,</b> but rather [a language of utterance like]: <b>“Let there be.”</b> However, in the utterance of the creation of man, the phrase <b>“making”</b> is written in the utterance itself, as it is stated: <b>“And God said: Let us make man”</b> [Genesis 1:26]. There is another significant change here, for it is written, <b>“Let us make,”</b> in the plural, and not <b>“I will make man.”</b>
The idea is that before the creation of the world of <i>tikkun</i> (rectification), the breaking of the vessels occurred in the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of the world of <i>Nekudim</i>, as the Sages, of blessed memory, taught: “He created worlds and destroyed them, until He created this world and said: This one gives Me pleasure” (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 3:7). Now, by means of the breaking of the vessels in the seven <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Nekudim</i>, the holiness mingled with the <i>kelippot</i>. Subsequently, the name <b><i>Ma</i></b> was revealed and produced the four worlds <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i>, on the path of rectification. This is the mystical meaning of His statement: “This one gives Me pleasure,” because [this process] distilled the holy sparks from the <i>kelippot</i>, and the worlds and everything in them were created in accordance with the distillation of the holiness.
This is the mystical meaning of the separation and distillation that can be found in every act of creation, such as “And God divided the light from the darkness” [Genesis 1:4], and “[Let it divide] the waters from the waters” [Genesis 1:6], and similarly [the division] between water and land [see Genesis 1:9–10], and the [phrase] “after its kind” stated in [the verse]: “Let the land put forth grass etc.” [Genesis 1:11], and “Between the ruling of the day and the ruling of the night” [see Genesis 1:16–18], as well as the emergence of living creatures from the water and from the earth.
All of this reflects the concept of distillation of the holiness from the <i>kelippot</i>, and the good from the evil. Anything that is distilled becomes an existing reality, as is appropriate for it in holiness. This is the mystical meaning of [the statement that] the entire act of creation is incorporated in the first day, in the utterance of <b>“Let there be light.”</b> It is there that the complete separation between the light and the darkness took place and in general terms, holiness is called <b>“light”</b> and the <i>kelippot</i> <b>“darkness,”</b> since all the other labels of holiness and <i>kelippot</i> are nothing more than particulars and branches of <b>light</b> and <b>darkness.</b>
Now, from the perspective of this distinction between light and darkness, by which all the creations in Genesis were distilled, the rectification is still incomplete. [The reason is] that from this perspective all the evil and the darkness remained as something for which there was no need, and that is completely incompatible with God’s wholeness. The rectification is completed only through the mystical meaning of the verse: “Even the darkness is not too dark for You…the darkness is like the light” [Psalms 139:12]. In order to rectify this, <b>man</b> was created, who incorporates everything, from absolute evil to absolute good. Through him, the completion of the rectification will occur in the desired fullness, i. e., the evil will be transformed into good, bitter into sweetness, darkness will be like light, He will eliminate death forever [Isaiah 25:8], and the Lord shall be king over all the earth [Zechariah 14:9].
Therefore, this utterance of the creation of man came out significantly different from the other utterances involving the rest of the creations of Genesis, as here the making is mingled with the utterance itself. The reason [for this difference] is that this utterance is from <i>Imma</i> rather than <i>Abba</i>. She said: <b>“Let us make man,”</b> which is language of partnership, because [<i>Imma</i>] partnered with <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> to create man. That is, <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> incorporates everything, in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And His kingdom rules over all” [Psalms 103:19]. [This <i>Malkhut</i>] sustains and grants existence to the evil forces as well, since otherwise the evil would have no power to exist. This is the mystical meaning of: “Her feet go down to death” [Proverbs 5:5], for the <i>kelippot</i> receive from [this <i>Malkhut</i>] a thin luminescence, enough for their existence. This is the mystical meaning of [the fact] that <i>Malkhut</i> is called <i>Asiya</i> [making; action], since she spreads out and rules over the whole of <i>Asiya</i>. [The <i>Malkhut</i>] is also called “darkness,” because she illuminates a thin luminescence to sustain the darkness and the evil, as stated.
You can now understand that when <i>Imma</i> herself was incorporated in <i>Malkhut</i> in a unified partnership, the aspect of making and darkness became mingled in [<i>Imma</i>] herself. This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.”</b> The <b>light</b> is called an <b>“image,”</b> while the <b>darkness</b> is called a <b>“likeness”</b> (as the <i>Zohar</i> states below). Once <i>Imma</i> partnered with <i>Malkhut</i>, the two forces, <b>image and likeness,</b> were made in [<i>Imma</i>] herself. Based on them, [<i>Imma</i>] created man such that he would also incorporate the two forces of image and likeness. This is why she said: <b>“In our image, after our likeness.”</b> Now that you know all this, the next parts of the <i>Zohar</i> will be clearly understood.
This is the meaning of: <b>“Let us make man, in partnership.”</b> In other words, the phrase “let us make” implies a partnership. “For he <b>consists of male and female,”</b> indicates that <i>Imma</i> herself is comprised of male and female. Although <i>Imma</i> is an aspect of the male world and she has no aspect of <i>Nukba</i> [the female] at all, she now partnered with the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is <i>Nukba</i>, as stated. <b>“‘In our image’</b> means [the] <b>wealthy; ‘after our likeness’</b> is referring to <b>the poor. For on the side of the male</b> they are <b>the wealthy, whereas on the side of the female</b> they are <b>the poor”</b> [sections #233#–#234#], because the male is the mystical meaning of light and wealth, while the female is the mystical meaning of darkness and poverty.
Since [<i>Imma</i>] said, “In our image, after our likeness,” [it can be seen that] darkness and poverty are found in [<i>Imma</i>] herself, on account of her partnership with <i>Malkhut</i> for the purpose of creation of man. Thus, man emerged as comprised of <b>the wealthy and the poor,</b> i. e., light and darkness. The entire rectification will thereby be completed through him, and the <i>Malkhut</i> will spread in her holiness over the whole earth, <b>and the Lord will be one, and His name one</b> [see Zechariah 14:9]. Then the darkness in <i>Malkhut</i> will be transformed into complete light, like the male, which is <i>Havaya</i>, and He will be one and His name one. Then the [promise]: <b>“However, there will be no needy among you”</b> [Deuteronomy 15:4] will be fulfilled.
Thus [the <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“Just as they are in one partnership, have mercy upon one another, give to one another and perform kindness with him, so too must a person be below: The rich and the poor in one partnership, giving to each other, and performing kindness with one another”</b> [section #234#]. The image and likeness that are incorporated in <i>Imma</i> are in <b>one partnership,</b> because <i>Imma</i> has compassion upon the likeness, <i>Malkhut</i>, in order to rectify the entire aspect of darkness in [<i>Malkhut</i>]. The supernal <i>Imma</i> diminished herself and gave from her share to the <i>Malkhut</i>, which is poor, and <b>performed kindness with her.</b> Similarly, man, who was created by [<i>Imma</i>] in an image and likeness, must have mercy upon <b>the poor,</b> which are the aspect of likeness within [man]. [Man is meant] to be in one bond with them, provide for them all that they lack, and perform kindness with them. By fulfilling this commandment, he will draw upon himself the image and likeness of <i>Imma</i> with which he was created. This is the mystical meaning of all the supernal brains that Adam the first [man] was awarded when he was created with that image and likeness.
Then: <b>“And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea”... “that whoever has mercy upon the poor with a willing heart, his form never changes from the form of Adam the first</b> [man]. <b>Since the form of Adam is imprinted upon him, he rules over all the creatures of the world through that form”</b> [section #235#]. By virtue of this commandment [the person] merits that image and likeness of Adam, i. e., all those brains and supernal brightness of <i>Atzilut</i> with which Adam the first [man] was rewarded, by whose power he ruled <b>over all the creatures of the world,</b> meaning that there was no power of the powers of the evil that did not submit to him: <b>“They all tremble and are scared of that form,</b> that image, <b>which was imprinted upon him.”</b> He nullified all the forces of evil and darkness, and they could not stand before him at all, since the name of the Lord was called upon him, which is the mystical meaning of <b>the image of God,</b> as stated.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] then cites a proof <b>“from Nebuchadnezzar,”</b> who did not have any commandments [accomplished], and yet after the decree was imposed upon him, in the dream and Daniel’s interpretation, Daniel instructed him: <b>“Break off your sins by almsgiving”</b> [Daniel 4:24], and he did so. <b>“As long as he was gracious towards the poor the dream was not fulfilled for him. Once he cast an evil eye, to not be gracious towards the poor, what is written? ‘While the word was in the king’s mouth</b> etc. ’ <b>Immediately, his form changed and he was driven from men.”</b> Thus, this commandment is greater than all the [other] commandments in the Torah, for by itself it can nullify from a person all sorts of evil decrees that have been decreed upon him.
[Thus the <i>Zohar</i>] states (in section #236#): <b>“Here it is written making,”</b> deriving a verbal analogy: Just as [the phrase] “I made” with respect to Boaz refers to charity, so too the [phrase] “let us make” here means charity. That is, the language of <b>“let us make,”</b> which is stated regarding the creation of man, indicates the commandment of charity, because <i>Imma</i> performed charity with <i>Malkhut</i> and was incorporated in her, as stated. [The <i>Zohar</i>] brings a proof from <b>Ruth,</b> who said: <b>“The man’s name with whom I made.”</b> This statement apparently defies explanation, since what does it mean that “she made with him,” seeing that she merely received from him? However, in light of the above explanation that “making” refers to the bonding of <b>the wealthy and the poor,</b> the term “making” in the case of <b>Boaz</b> is justified, since they partnered together in a single bonding through the [act of] charity.

Paragraph 237

<b>237. “The tenth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The tenth commandment is to don <i>tefillin</i> and to complete oneself in the supernal form, as it is stated: “And God created man in His own image”</b> [Genesis 1:27]. <b>He opened</b> [his discourse] <b>and said: “Your head upon you is like Carmel”</b> [Song of Songs 7:6]. <b>We established</b> [the meaning of] <b>this verse, and it was taught: But “Your head upon you is like Carmel,” this is the supernal head, the <i>tefillin</i> of the head, of the supernal, holy ‎King, <i>Havaya</i>, with inscribed letters. Each letter</b> in the name <i>Havaya</i> <b>is one chapter</b> in the ‎<i>tefillin</i>. In this way, <b>the holy name is inscribed</b> in the chapters of the <i>tefillin</i>, <b>in the order of the ‎letters, as is fitting. And we learned: “That the name of the Lord is called upon you and they will be afraid of you”</b> [Deuteronomy 28:10] – <b>these are the <i>tefillin</i> of the head</b> [<i>Berakhot</i> 57a], <b>which are ‎the holy name, in the order of the letters. ‎</b>
Explanation: The aforementioned <b>commandment to be gracious towards the poor</b> was only the beginning [step] for drawing forth <b>the ‎supernal form,</b> which is the mystical meaning of <b>the image of God.</b> This is as stated above, that by means of the commandment to be gracious towards the poor, <i>Imma</i> (mother) was ‎incorporated in <i>Malkhut</i>, in the mystical meaning of: <b>“Let us make man in our image, after our likeness”</b> [Genesis 1:26]. Know that this is ‎the mystical meaning of <b>“the mother</b> [<i>Imma</i>] <b>lends her garments to the daughter”</b> (section #17#, above): Through the incorporation of <i>Malkhut</i> ‎in <i>Imma</i>, the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>] fell to the place of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and only the letters <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> [<i>mi</i>] remained in <i>Imma</i>. It is ‎discerned that the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> descended to the aspect of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, namely, the aspect of <i>Abba</i> [in those descending letters] took on the aspect of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and the aspect of <i>Imma</i> took on the aspect of <i>Nukba</i>, ‎and the [letters] truly became of the aspect of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, because an upper [level] that descends to a lower [level] becomes like [that lower level]. ‎
Through [the descending aspects], [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> attained the aspect of immaturity of <b>the image</b> [<i>tzelem,</i> spelled <i>tzadi-lamed-heh</i>] <b>of God,</b> namely, six extremities without a ‎head, because the <i>Imma</i> herself also lost the aspect of her first three [<i>sefirot</i>] through this partnership [with <i>Malkhut</i>]. The three vessels <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> which are <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> from her ten <i>sefirot</i>, ‎fell from her, leaving in <i>Imma</i> only the letters <b><i>mem-yod</i></b> [<i>Mi</i>], which are <i>Keter</i> and <i>Ḥokhma</i> of her ten <i>sefirot</i>. As is known, when the three lower vessels are missing, ‎the first three of the lights are missing, and [thus] only the lights of <i>ruaḥ</i> [and] <i>nefesh</i> remained in her vessels of <b><i>Mi</i></b>: The ‎light of <i>ruaḥ</i> in the vessel of <i>Keter</i>, and the light of <i>nefesh</i> in the vessel of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. ‎
Consequently, [the <i>Imma</i>] could only give [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> [the aspect of] six extremities without a ‎head. Given this, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> were not yet completed in <b>the lofty form,</b> which are the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], called <b>the image of God.</b> ‎This is the meaning of: <b>“To don <i>tefillin</i> and to complete oneself in the lofty form,”</b> that by means of <b>the commandment of <i>tefillin</i></b> the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] are drawn to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, [and those <i>sefirot</i>] are the ‎completion of the lofty image. ‎
You might raise the following difficulty: Since this referring to the lower man, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> must have been completed already, since they would not be able to produce <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> for the lower man before they themselves had ascended to the place ‎of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and matured in their brains like <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma.</i> If so, why do we say that even <i>Imma</i> is still in [a state of] ‎immaturity [given that <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> possess mature brains]?‎
You should know that when the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> attain the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, they enclothe <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and they are ‎properly like [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, since a lower entity that ascends to [the level] of a higher one becomes truly like [that higher] one. Therefore, everything we now discern [and discuss in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> is intended to [refer to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that [have now] become <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> All the pathways that are operative in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> to ‎produce brains of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> operate in precisely the same manner in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that became <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma.</i> They ‎produce the brains, which are the <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i>, for the lower man, without any difference whatsoever [from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] Accordingly, there ‎is no need to change the names at all, and we now call [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> with the names of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, while the <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> of the lower ‎man are named <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>. Remember this below, for all of what comes later. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“As it is stated: And God created man in His own image.”</b> The mystical meaning of <b><i>tzelem</i></b> [image] is a very complex matter, but I will explain it here only as much as necessary to understand the matter at hand. You need to have in mind all that was explained earlier in <i>Marot HaSulam</i> (sections #2#–#4#) regarding the number thirteen as it applies to the <i>sefirot</i>; see there carefully, for ideas should not be repeated without good reason.
You will see there that <i>yeḥida</i> [and] <i>ḥaya</i> have no vessels. Only <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> have the ‎vessels <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. Even when we explicitly state “vessel of <i>Keter</i>,” the reference is to <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Keter</i>. Now, the <i>Bina</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> are divided into ten <i>sefirot</i> through the rectification of lines: ‎The three lines of <i>Bina</i> are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>; [the three lines] of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>; and [the three lines] of <i>Nukba</i> ‎are <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>. This number applies to the light of giving. However, with regards to the transmitting of the illumination of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i> divides into two [<i>partzufim</i>]: [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which [together] are ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>; <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i>. Together with the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] ‎of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, these make thirteen <i>sefirot</i>. This is the mystical meaning of the numerical value of <b><i>eḥad</i></b> [“one,” the letters <i>alef-ḥet-dalet</i>], ‎which alludes to the full name. ‎
The root of the matter is that <i>Keter</i> and ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> were sealed off in the sealed ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> of ‎<i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and only the <i>Bina</i> [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] illuminates ‎all the brains of <i>Atzilut</i>, dividing into [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. The first three [<i>sefirot</i> of <i>Bina</i>] illuminate in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and the six extremities [of <i>Bina</i> illuminate] in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. These two aspects of the <i>Bina</i> are termed [the letters] <b><i>mem</i></b> and <b><i>lamed</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>.</b> [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are called <b><i>mem</i></b> in the mystical meaning of “a pure ring,” because the ‎<b><i>mem</i></b> [that appears at the end of a word] is [shaped] like a closed ring, enclosing the brains all around. <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are called [the letter] <b><i>lamed</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> because the <b><i>lamed</i></b> raises her head up high, like a tower. This head alludes to the brains of ‎the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], and this is the mystical meaning of the verse: “The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runs in it and is set ‎up on high” [Proverbs 18:10]. <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is the mystical meaning of a tower, and <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called the righteous who runs in that ‎tower and is set up very high. ‎
[<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are the mystical meaning of a ring that encloses the brains. The light of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> will not be revealed in them, due to their great height, because the light of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> in them is of the aspect of the sealed ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> itself, which disappeared from all the ‎<i>partzufim</i> of ‎<i>Atzilut</i>. Consequently, [the light of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>] is not revealed in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and they contain only the light of giving, which is called “pure air,” since air is the mystical meaning the light ‎of <i>ruaḥ</i>. It is also called “sealed air,” because the [letter] <b><i>yod</i></b> never departed from their air [<i>avir</i>]. ‎
However, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, as they are only the aspect of the lower seven [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Bina</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that are incorporated in <i>Bina</i>, are not called ‎‎“sealed air.” During the phase of the transmission of the brains of maturity to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, the <b><i>yod</i></b> departs from their ‎<i>avir</i> [air] and they become <i>or</i> [light], meaning ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> and brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. For this reason, ‎<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> is called “a tower [<i>migdal</i>] that flies in the air [<i>avir</i>].” <i>Migdal</i> means maturity [<i>gadlut</i>] of ‎ the first three [<i>sefirot</i>]. Because these brains are not permanently fixed in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, it follows that the phase of immaturity within [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> is the result of ‎the <b><i>yod</i></b> entering the <i>or</i> [light] and making it into <i>avir</i> [air]. In the phase of maturity, the <b><i>yod</i></b> reverts and exits from the <i>avir</i>, which then becomes <i>or</i>. [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] is therefore regarded as a flying tower, on account of the ‎rectification within it, in the mystical meaning of <i>avir</i>. [Lastly, ] the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is called [the letter] <b><i>tzadi</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> because it is the ‎righteous [<i>tzadik</i>] who runs in the tower that is set up on high, as stated.
We have thus thoroughly explained the three letters of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> in the mystical meaning that <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is <b><i>tzadi</i></b>; <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are <b><i>lamed</i></b>; and [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] ‎are <b><i>mem</i>.</b> ‎They are also the mystical meaning of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>: [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] ‎are ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, enclosed in a pure ring, since they are of the aspect of the sealed‎ <i>Ḥokhma</i> [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>]. <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are ‎<i>Bina</i>, but when [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] ascends to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the <b><i>yod</i></b> comes out of the <i>avir</i> and gives <i>Ḥokhma</i>, in the mystical meaning of ‎a tower that flies in the air. <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is that which runs in that tower, namely, he receives those brains, and is the mystical meaning of <i>Da’at</i>. Remember all of this well, for these ideas are at the roots of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and no change will ever transpire in these paths, which is why the ‎brains are always called by the name <b><i>tzelem</i>.</b>
When we said that ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i> are the three letters <b><i>mem</i>, <i>lamed</i>,</b> [and] <b><i>tzadi</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> they must not be confused ‎with the three lines in the ‎brains, which are [also] called ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>. The ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i> of <b><i>tzelem</i></b> ‎are not of the aspect of [the concept of] three lines, but rather they are three complete <i>partzufim</i> enclothed within one another. ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is the <b><i>mem</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> is the mystical meaning of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] which are enclothed from the chest and below inside the [lower aspect of] <i>Bina</i>, which is <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and the <b><i>lamed</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>.</b> The <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are enclothed from the chest and below inside the <i>Da’at</i>, which is ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, ‎the <b><i>tzadi</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>. ‎</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“And to complete oneself in the lofty form, as it is stated: And God created man in His own image.”</b> By virtue of the <b><i>tefillin</i>,</b> ‎brains ‎of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] are drawn forth in the order of the letters <b><i>tzadi-lamed-mem</i>,</b> which appear in the verse: “And God ‎created man in His own image.” This is the mystical meaning of <b>the supernal brightness</b> of ‎<i>Atzilut</i> that Adam the first [man] ‎received when he was created. We draw the [letters] first to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, from where these ‎brains ‎transmit to us [below] as well. ‎ The order of the letters <b><i>tzadi-lamed-mem</i></b> is clarified in the four chapters of the <b><i>Tefillin</i>,</b> as set out below.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“The <i>tefillin</i> of the head, the name of the supernal, holy ‎King, <i>Havaya</i>, in inscribed letters.”</b> The <i>tefillin</i> are called <b>Carmel,</b> because <b>Carmel</b> means <b><i>car malei</i></b> [a pasture filled] with all goodness. This is the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“Your head upon you is like Carmel.”</b> That is, when the supernal head of ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, as well as ‎that of the ‎<i>Nukba</i>, are enclothed in <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of the head,</b> which are the supernal ‎brains of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> they are <b>like</b> ‎<b>Carmel, like a pasture filled</b> with all goodness. These ‎brains are called <b>“the name of the supernal, ‎holy King,”</b> namely, the four letters of <b><i>Havaya</i>,</b> in accordance with the order of the letters: <b><i>Yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>. ‎</b> The reason why [the <i>Zohar</i>] emphasizes <b>“<i>Havaya</i> in inscribed letters”</b> is that each and every letter is inscribed in ‎a separate ‎<i>partzuf</i>, since there are the four letters of <b><i>Havaya</i></b> which are ten ‎<i>sefirot</i> in every ‎<i>partzuf</i>. [The <i>Zohar</i>] therefore specifies that the reference [here] is to <b>inscribed letters,</b> namely, that each [letter] is [also] a complete ‎<i>partzuf</i> in itself. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Each and every letter</b> of the name <i>Havaya</i> <b>is one chapter</b> of the four chapters in ‎<i>tefillin</i>. <b>The holy name is inscribed</b> in them, <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the order of the ‎letters, as is fitting.”</b> A “chapter” means a complete ‎<i>partzuf</i> in and ‎of itself. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that each and every letter of the name <b><i>Havaya</i></b> becomes, in the mystical meaning of the ‎brains, a complete, distinct ‎<i>partzuf</i>. They are arranged in the [<i>tefillin</i>] boxes <b>“in the order of the ‎letters, as is fitting,”</b> that is, in the order <b><i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>.</b> This is the mystical meaning of <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of Rashi,</b> since <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of Rabbeinu Tam</b> are arranged in the boxes in the order of the acronym from the verse: “But let he who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows [<b><i>y</i></b><i>ithalel <b>h</b>amithalel <b>h</b>askel <b>v</b>e-yado’a<b></b></i>] Me” [Jeremiah 9:23], namely, <b><i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>,</b> as is known. ‎

Paragraph 238

<b>238. “The first chapter is Sanctify, etc.”</b><br><b>The first chapter</b> in the <i>tefillin</i> <b>is “Sanctify to Me every firstborn.” This is</b> [the letter] <b><i>yod</i></b> of ‎<i>Havaya</i>, <b>which is “sanctify,”</b> namely, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, the <b>firstborn of all the lofty, sanctified ones.</b> It is <b>“who opens every womb”</b> [Exodus 13:2], <b>through that delicate trail that descends from</b> the <b><i>yod</i>, which opens the ‎womb to bear fruits and offspring, as is fitting. This is the lofty, sanctified one. ‎</b>
Explanation: This is referring to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, who are alluded to in the letter <b><i>yod</i></b> of the name <b><i>Havaya</i></b><b>,</b> as the <b><i>yod</i></b> alludes to <i>Abba</i>, and the filling in [of the other letters] of [the spelled-out] <i>yod</i>, ‎which are <i>vav-dalet</i>, alludes to <i>Imma</i>. The <i>partzuf</i> of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] is called <b>“sanctify,”</b> and it is [also] termed <b>“firstborn”</b> because no <i>partzuf</i> from <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> are called <b>“sanctify”</b> unless they receive the sanctity from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Firstborn of all the lofty sanctified ones,”</b> namely, [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> are] <b>the firstborn</b> ‎of all the holy <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, for the sanctity of the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is drawn from [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>]. The reason is that the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> is called “sanctify,” and, as has already been explained, [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are [the letter] <b><i>mem</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>.</b> They are <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎ of <i>Atzilut</i> because the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i> [from <i>Arikh Anpin</i>]‎ is enclothed and concealed in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>].
Despite this [lofty status in <i>Atzilut</i>], [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] themselves are considered only “pure air,” namely, the light of giving, since this [sealed] <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎ was sealed [away] in the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. ‎ The <i>partzufim</i> [of <i>Atzilut</i>] can receive <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎ only from <i>Bina</i> [when <i>Bina</i>] returns to be <i>Ḥokhma</i> [which transpires]‎ when [<i>Bina</i>] ‎ascends to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and unites there with the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎, by means of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>]. Then the <i>Bina</i> is also called <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎, and this <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎ is called <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎ of the thirty-two paths. Thus, even the <i>Bina</i> that returns ‎to being <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎ is called <b>“sanctify”</b> only because [<i>Bina</i>] receives from the sealed <i>Ḥokhma</i> that is in <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> as a result of the ‎ascent [of <i>Bina</i>] to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>. This is all the more the case [with respect to] the rest of the <i>partzufim</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which receive only ‎from this <i>Bina</i> that returned to be <i>Ḥokhma</i>‎. ‎ This will be clarified further below.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] states that “with <b>that delicate trail that descends from</b> the <b><i>yod</i>, which opens the ‎womb to bear fruits and offspring.”</b> The meaning is as follows: There are three components to the <b><i>yod</i>: Head, torso, and trail.</b> Its upper tip is called <b>head,</b> which alludes to the expression of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> that ‎is hidden and enclothed in [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] (as mentioned in the preceding section). The body of the <b><i>yod</i></b> is called <b>“torso,”</b> which alludes to the <i>partzuf</i> of ‎[<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] themselves. [Finally, ] the bottom tip of the <b><i>yod</i></b> is called <b>“trail,”</b> alluding to the [bottom] foundations of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] at the endpoint of their <i>partzuf</i>, and this is called <b>“a delicate trail.”‎</b>
However, the name <b>“trail”</b> refers primarily to <i>Yesod</i> of the ‎<i>Abba</i> [component of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], since <i>Yesod</i> of ‎the <i>Imma</i> [component] is called <b>‎‎“path,”</b> in the mystical meaning of “this trail is positioned on this path,” and in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And Your path in the mighty waters” [Psalms 77:20]. The [lights of the light of giving], when the ‎<i>shefa</i> in them is great, are called “mighty waters,” since by means of this pairing of ‎<b>trail and path,</b> which is a fusion that never stops, mighty waters are ceaselessly transmitted to the worlds. Before the ‎<i>partzuf</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> as established with the connection of <b>trail and path,</b> no <i>shefa</i> was transmitted to ‎the worlds. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Who opens every womb, through that delicate trail that descends from</b> the <b><i>yod</i>.”</b> The path of ‎the <i>Imma</i> [component of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>] is called <b>“a womb,”</b> because all the [aspects of] mercy are given from there. Before [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] were established in the joining of trail and path, there was a blockage, and it opened only through <b>the ‎delicate trail</b> of the ‎<i>Abba</i> [component]. Accordingly, the delicate trail is called <b>“‘who opens</b> [<i>petter</i>] <b>every womb, ’ which opens the ‎womb to bear fruits and offspring,”</b> for <b><i>petter</i></b> means “opens.” When the delicate trail of ‎the <i>Abba</i> [component] connected to [the <i>Imma</i>], ‎<i>Imma</i> gives <b>fruits and offspring</b> in great abundance, <b>“as is fitting,”</b> in the mystical meaning of the verse: “And Your path in the mighty waters.”

Paragraph 239

<b>239. “The second chapter is, and it shall be, etc.”</b><br><b>The second chapter is: “And it shall be when</b> [the Lord] <b>shall bring you”</b> [Exodus 13:5]. <b>It is</b> [the letter] <b><i>heh</i></b> of ‎<i>Havaya</i>, which is <i>Bina</i>. This is the <b>palace whose womb opens by means of the <i>yod</i> in fifty hidden openings, ‎corridors, and rooms that are within it.</b> [The purpose of] <b>that opening, which the <i>yod</i> made in this palace, is in order to hear in it the ‎sound that emerges from this <i>shofar</i>,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>. <b>This <i>shofar</i> is sealed on ‎all sides, and the <i>yod</i> comes and opens it, to produce the sound from it. Once she opens it, ‎she blows it and produces a sound from it, to deliver slaves to freedom. ‎</b>
Explanation: The <b><i>heh</i></b> of the name <b><i>Havaya</i></b> alludes to the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is the mystical meaning of [the letter] <b><i>lamed</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> called “a ‎tower that flies in the air.” This is “the <b>palace, whose [womb] opens... in fifty [hidden] ‎openings.”</b> [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] are considered sealed air that does not open, in the mystical meaning of the <b><i>mem</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> which alludes to a ring that surrounds their ‎brains. The <b><i>yod</i></b> does not emerge from their <i>avir</i> [air] in such a way that [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] would transmit the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. Therefore, they give out only pure air, which [means] the light of giving, as stated above. In contrast, <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is the mystical meaning of <b><i>lamed</i></b> of <b><i>tzelem</i></b> and an aspect of <i>Bina</i>, are considered a <b>“palace, whose [womb] opens... in fifty [hidden] ‎openings,”</b> transmitting ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> through the ascent [of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] to the head of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, where the <i>Bina</i> is transformed into <i>Ḥokhma</i>, as stated. ‎
This <i>Bina</i> is called <b>“fifty</b> gates of <i>Bina</i>,” because it contains the five <i>sefirot</i>: <i>Keter</i>, <i>Ḥokhma</i>, and <i>Bina</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, in each of which there are ten ‎<i>sefirot</i>, which makes fifty. Each of the fifty <i>sefirot</i> divides into <b>rooms and corridors.</b> The aspect of <i>Ḥesed</i>, <i>Gevura</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> in a <i>sefira</i> are ‎called <b>“rooms,”</b> and the aspect of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> in [a <i>sefira</i>] are called <b>“corridors,”</b> indicating that this [aspect of <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>] is not a vessel of receiving for itself, but rather only [serves as] the aspect of exiting and entering the rooms (as stated in section #229#, above).
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“And it shall be when</b> [the Lord] <b>shall bring you” is</b> [the letter] <b><i>heh</i>,</b> [the] <b>palace whose womb opens.”</b> The second chapter of the <i>tefillin</i>, which is <b>“And it shall be when</b> [the Lord] <b>shall bring you,”</b> alludes to the <b><i>heh</i></b> of ‎the name <b><i>Havaya</i>,</b> which is the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, <b>whose womb</b> opens to transmit <i>Ḥokhma</i> to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, as stated. The phrase <b>“by means of the <i>yod</i>”</b> will be explained presently.
This is the meaning of <b>“in order to hear in it the ‎sound</b> etc.” [This is referring to] that opening which the <b><i>yod</i></b> made in that palace, in order to hear through [the opening] the sound that emerges from this <i>shofar</i>, because this <i>shofar</i> is sealed on all sides. Explanation: As has already been explained above, when <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which is ‎<i>Bina</i>, partnered with <i>Malkhut</i>, the three <i>sefirot</i> [represented by the letters of] <b><i>eleh</i></b> [<i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>], which are ‎<i>Bina</i>, and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, of the body of ‎<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, descended to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, such that only the two letters <b><i>mi</i></b> [<i>mem-yod</i>] remained in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. ‎Subsequently, by raising feminine waters, the bottom <i>heh</i> [which is the <i>Malkhut</i> that ascended to partner with <i>Bina</i>] once again descended from the apertures of the eyes [which is <i>Bina</i> of the head] to the place of the mouth [which is <i>Malkhut</i> of the head], as [the <i>Malkhut</i>] was ‎before the partnership. Then the three letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> [<i>eleh</i>] ascend back to [<i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>], and the name ‎<b><i>Elohim</i> is completed</b> again (as stated in section #14# above; see there in detail). ‎
Together with these <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> that ascend back to the ‎<i>Bina</i>, the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> also ascend (as stated above, in section #17#, 3rd paragraph; see there in detail). It has also been explained (section #14# above, 5th paragraph) that although the three letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> have already‎ ascended and connected to the ‎<i>Bina</i>, <b>and the name <i>Elohim</i> has been completed,</b> it is still considered that ‎the name Elokim <b>is deep and sealed in the name</b> [section #14#]. This is because there is only light of <i>Ḥokhma</i> there, and the illumination ‎of <i>Ḥokhma</i> cannot be received in <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> except through the enclothing of the light of giving; see there in detail. Therefore, it is ‎considered that these letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> are the aspect of <b><i>shofar</i>,</b> in which there are enclothed the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that ascended with ‎them to the ‎<i>Bina</i>, which are considered [the aspect of] the voice [of the shofar]. The reason [for this ascent and enclothing of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] is that [the <i>alef-lamed-heh</i>] are the ones that raise the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> with them to ‎<i>Bina</i>, by virtue of the fact that [the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i>] are incorporated in [the <i>alef-lamed-heh</i>] in the phase of immaturity. Thus [the <i>alef-lamed-heh</i>] carry the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> within them, as stated there.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“That opening, which the <i>yod</i> made in this palace, in order to hear in it the ‎sound that emerges from this <i>shofar</i>.”</b> The <b><i>yod</i>,</b> which is <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>, are the ones who transmit supernal illumination to lower the bottom <i>heh</i> [which is <i>Malkhut</i>] ‎from the apertures of the eyes [which is <i>Bina</i>] of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> back to the mouth [of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. This [process] also raises the three letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> that were in the level of the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, ‎reconnecting them to the ‎<i>Bina</i>, as they were before the partnering with the <i>Malkhut</i>. Thus, [this illustrates that] the <b><i>yod</i></b> opened the palace of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> in order to bestow ‎brains to ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> from <b>the <i>shofar</i>, ‎</b>which are the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> that were raised. [This bestowal of brains to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>Nukba</i> happens] because the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> also ascend‎ with the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> to the ‎<i>Bina</i>, where they receive [the brains of the light of] ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>. ‎
This is the meaning of <b>“in order to hear in it the ‎sound,”</b> namely, to emanate the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> with the ‎‎brains of maturity, called a <b>“sound,”</b> and whose emanation is considered as the making of <b>a sound. “For this <i>shofar</i> is sealed on ‎all sides,”</b> that is, from both the light of giving and [the light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i>. [This is] because the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>,</b> ‎which are called <b><i>shofar</i>,</b> fall [down to] the place of [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> and there they are sealed off from both the [light of the] first three [<i>sefirot</i>] and the light of giving. Therefore, they require two rectifications: 1) To be elevated and connected to ‎<i>Bina</i>, so that they attain ‎the aspect of their first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which is the light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>; 2) to transmit the light of giving to them which will serve as an enclothing for [the light of] ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And the <i>yod</i> comes and opens it, to produce the sound from it.”</b> This is the first rectification, that the <i>yod</i> ‎draws forth the supernal illumination to the <i>heh</i>, which is the palace of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. This lowers the bottom ‎<i>heh</i> [which is <i>Malkhut</i>] to its place and raises the three letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> with the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> that is within them and connects them to the ‎<i>Bina</i>. The [letters] thereby attain the illumination of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, which also serves as ‎brains for the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> that ascended with the letters ‎ <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>.</b> However, the illumination of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i> remains sealed and does not illuminate, due to absence ‎of the light of giving, as stated. Therefore, it is considered that the <b>sound</b> has not yet emerged, meaning that the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> has not ‎been born. This is the meaning of <b>“to</b> subsequently <b>produce the sound from it,”</b> by means of the second rectification. Now, however, [before the second rectification, ] it has not yet emerged. ‎
<b>“Once she</b> then <b>opens it, ‎she blows it and produces a sound from it, to deliver slaves to freedom.”</b> ‎This is the aforementioned second rectification. After opening the palace, namely, connecting the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> ‎with [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> back to ‎<i>Bina</i>, where they attain the light of ‎<i>Ḥokhma</i>, she <b>“blows it,”</b> namely, the ‎<b><i>yod</i></b> blows air into the <b><i>shofar</i>,</b> as “air [<i>avir</i>]” means the light of giving. Since the <b><i>shofar</i>,</b> which is the letters ‎<b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b>, also received <i>avir</i>, meaning the light of giving, it <b>“produces a sound from it”</b> meaning it gives birth to the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is called a <b>"sound”</b> and brings the completed [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] to its place. By means of the enclothing of the light of giving which the <b><i>yod</i></b> blew, the ‎[light of] <i>Ḥokhma</i> could be enclothed ‎in that [light of giving] and be received into the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Hence, these brains that the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> attained, called <b>“sound,”</b> delivers slaves ‎to freedom. In other words, the ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> transmits its illumination to the worlds [below], and then the children of Israel merit the brains of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>], which are called “freedom.”‎

Paragraph 240

<b>240. “And with the blowing of this shofar, etc.”</b><br><b>And with the blowing of this <i>shofar</i>, Israel came out of Egypt. So it will be in the future,</b> that the <i>shofar</i> will be blown <b>on a different occasion, at ‎the end of days. Every redemption comes from this <i>shofar</i>,</b> which is <i>Bina</i>. <b>For this reason it is in this chapter, the exodus from Egypt, since it came from this <i>shofar</i>, through the strength of the <i>yod</i> that opened ‎her womb and produced its sound for the redemption of the slaves. This is <i>heh</i>, the ‎second letter of the holy name. ‎</b>
Explanation: All the brains that are transmitted to [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> come from <b>this <i>shofar</i>,</b> namely the aforementioned ‎letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i>.</b> Those great brains that ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> received to bring Israel out of Egypt, were also from ‎<b>this <i>shofar</i></b> in the same manner, and the brains that will be revealed at the end of days for the complete redemption will likewise be from <b>this <i>shofar</i></b> in the same manner.
<b>“For this reason it is in this chapter, the exodus from Egypt,”</b> namely, the chapter: <b>“And it shall be when</b> [the Lord] <b>shall bring you”</b> [Exodus 13:5], in the <i>tefillin</i>. <b>“Since it came from this <i>shofar</i>”:</b> The brains that were revealed for the exodus from Egypt came from this <b><i>shofar</i></b> that is in <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. That is, <b>“through the strength of the <i>yod</i> that opened ‎her womb,”</b> by means of the power of ‎[<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], called the <b><i>yod</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>. This [power] opened the womb of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, which are the letters <b><i>alef</i>-<i>lamed-heh</i></b> that were discussed above.
<b>“And produced its sound:”</b> This is ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called <b>“sound,”</b> through the attainment of these brains <b>“for the redemption of the slaves,”</b> ‎which suffice to bring Israel out from enslavement to freedom. Know that ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and ‎<i>Nukba</i> are called <b>‎‎“sound” and “speech”</b> only upon the attainment of brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, but not at the other levels below the level of <i>ḥaya</i>. All the redemptions come from the ‎brains of <i>ḥaya</i>, as explained. ‎

Paragraph 241

<b>241. “The third chapter is the secret, etc.”</b><br><b>The third chapter is the secret of the unification of “Hear O Israel”</b> [Deuteronomy 6:4]. <b>It is</b> [the letter] <b><i>vav</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, <b>‎incorporating everything,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and in whom there is the unification of everything, for they ‎unite in him and he takes everything. The fourth chapter is: “And it shall come to pass, if ‎you listen”</b> [Deuteronomy 11:13], <b>which incorporates the two sides,</b> <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i>, <b>in which the Assembly of Israel, which is the <i>Gevura</i> ‎below,</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>unites through them. This is the last <i>heh</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, <b>which takes them and is incorporated ‎from them. ‎</b>
Explanation: The third chapter in <i>tefillin</i>, <b>“Hear O Israel,”</b> is the <i>partzuf</i> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called <b><i>vav</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, <b>“incorporating everything,”</b> since it includes all these four ‎chapters in the <i>tefillin</i>. Although the first two chapters, <b>“Sanctify”</b> and ‎‎<b>“And it shall be when</b> [the Lord] <b>shall bring you,”</b> are [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>, called <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, this does not mean that they themselves are [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] ‎and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>. Rather, they are [the aspects of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> that are enclothed in the head of [‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, in the mystical meaning of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> in the brains of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which are called <b><i>mem-lamed</i></b> of <i>tzelem</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. ‎
Likewise, regarding the fourth chapter, <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you listen,”</b> [the <i>Zohar</i>] says below that this is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, this does ‎not mean the <i>Nukba</i> itself, but only the aspect of the <i>Nukba</i> that is incorporated in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [This aspect] in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] is called by the name ‎‎“the brain of the <i>Gevura</i>” of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. There are three brains in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, and <i>Da’at</i>, and these are called <b><i>mem-lamed-tzadi</i></b> of <i>tzelem</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. These are <i>Ḥokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i> that are in the brains of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. In <i>Da’at</i>, which is <b><i>tzadi</i>,</b> ‎there are [the <i>sefirot</i> of] <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i>; the <i>Ḥesed</i> in <i>Da’at</i> is regarded as the aspect of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> itself, while the <i>Gevura</i> in <i>Da’at</i> is regarded ‎as an integration of the <i>Nukba</i>. These are the four chapters in the <i>Tefillin</i>. ‎
Thus, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, which is <b><i>vav</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, <b>incorporates everything,</b> all four chapters. <b>“In whom there is the unification of everything,”</b> for all the unifications that are applied to [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>] and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> are only in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, namely, solely for the needs ‎of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. [In fact, ] the <i>partzufim</i> [of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i> and <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>] that precede <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> are always in a state of unification and do not require feminine waters from ‎the lower [beings] in order to unify them. All the unifications that we perform in the higher <i>partzufim</i> ‎through feminine waters are not for themselves at all, but only for the sake of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>.
<b>“For they ‎unite in him.”</b> There is no unification of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> for the [sake of the] lower ones, in which <i>Bina</i> returns to be <i>Ḥokhma</i>, except ‎through the ascent of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> to them as feminine waters. In the phase when the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ascends to the <i>Bina</i> as feminine waters, the <i>Bina</i> then ascends to the head ‎of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> and receives <i>Ḥokhma</i> to transmit to <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, but not for [<i>Bina</i>] itself. [This is because] the nature [of <i>Bina</i>] in its ten ‎<i>sefirot</i> of direct light, is only the light of giving, in the mystical meaning of the verse: because He delights in <i>ḥesed</i>” [“mercy”; Micah 7:18]. ‎[The <i>Bina</i>] has no [inherent] reason to ascend to the head ‎of <i>Arikh Anpin</i> to fuse with <i>Ḥokhma</i> there. Rather, the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> that ascends to the <i>Bina</i> awakens [the <i>Bina</i>] to transmit <i>Ḥokhma</i> on behalf [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>]. ‎
Thus, the <i>Bina</i> unifies with the <i>Ḥokhma</i> only because of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and for the sake of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. This is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“For they ‎unite in him and he,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>takes everything.”</b> Even the light of the <i>Ḥokhma</i> that the <i>Bina</i> takes on behalf of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is not revealed in the ‎level of the <i>Bina</i> at all, but only in the level of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, from the chest [of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>] and below, as stated in the appropriate place. Accordingly, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> takes all these ‎brains, not those who are above him. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“And it shall come to pass, if ‎you listen” which incorporates the two sides in which the Assembly of Israel, the <i>Gevura</i> of ‎below, unites.”</b> The chapter <b>“Hear”</b> is the mystical meaning of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b><i>vav</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the <b>supernal ‎unification</b> (mentioned in section #207# above, with regard to the third commandment) in which the secret of the love is revealed only on the side of mercy (as stated in section #205#; see there). This is the chapter: “And you shall ‎love” [Deuteronomy 6:5], a chapter that is all love without any aspect of judgment in it at all. ‎
However, the fourth chapter, <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you listen,”</b> is an aspect of <b>the lower <i>heh</i></b> of ‎<i>Havaya</i>, which is the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> that is incorporated in [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>], as stated previously, [and] which is <i>Gevura</i> in the <i>Da’at</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Through this [<i>Nukba</i>], the love is revealed on two ‎sides: <b>Both on the side of mercy and on the side of harsh judgment</b> (as stated in section #206#, 4th paragraph; see there in detail). Consequently, the chapter <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you listen”</b> contains <b>love both on the side of mercy,</b> until the verse <b>“take heed to yourselves”</b> [Deuteronomy 11:13], <b>and on the side of harsh judgment,</b> from “take heed to yourselves” and onwards.
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“And it shall come to pass, if ‎you listen, which incorporates the two sides,”</b> for it has both the side of mercy and the side of harsh judgment, [the two sides] <b>“in which the Assembly of Israel</b> […] <b>unites.”</b> This is <b>the lower unification of “Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever,”</b> through which the <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, called ‎‎“the Assembly of Israel,” unites (as stated in the aforementioned source, section #206#, 4th paragraph).
<b>“The <i>Gevura</i> ‎below.”</b> In other words, this is not the actual <i>Nukba</i> herself, but the <i>Gevura</i> below, in the brain of the <i>Da’at</i>, as explained above. It is <b>“the last <i>heh</i></b> of <i>Havaya</i>, <b>which takes them and is incorporated ‎from them,”</b> because the <i>Gevura</i> in <i>Da’at</i>, is the lower <b><i>heh</i></b> of the name <i>Havaya</i>, which takes all the brains in <b>the upper unification of “Hear O Israel,”</b> and is incorporated from ‎them. It is only through [that lower <i>heh</i>] that the brains are completed, since there is room in it to ‎reveal <b>the love on both sides,</b> because the [side of the love that is] harsh judgment that completes the love is not located above [that <i>heh</i>], as stated. ‎
<b>“Therefore,</b> it is stated: <b>‘Your head upon you is like Carmel’</b> [Song of Songs 7:6]. <b>This is</b> an allusion to <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of the head”</b> [see next section]. After the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ‎is enclothed in all four brains that are alluded to in the four chapters, which are the three letters <b><i>tzadi-lamed-mem</i></b> [<i>tzelem</i>], as stated, the head [of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] is considered like <b>Carmel,</b> which is an abbreviated form of <b><i>car malei</i></b> [a pasture filled] with all goodness [see section #237#, above]. ‎

Paragraph 242

<b>242. “The <i>Tefillin</i> are the letters of the holy name, etc.”</b><br><b>The <i>tefillin</i> are the letters of the holy name. Therefore, it is stated: “Your head upon you ‎is like the Carmel.” This is</b> an allusion to <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of the head. “And the hair</b> [<i>dalat</i>] <b>of your head”</b> [Song of Songs 7:6] <b>is that <i>tefillin</i> of the hand, ‎</b> which is <i>Malkhut</i>, <b>who is a pauper</b> [<i>dal</i> means “poor”] <b>facing upward,</b> <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. <b>She also has a completeness similar to above. ‎</b>
Explanation: The <i>Malkhut</i> is the mystical meaning of the <i>tefillin</i> of the hand, and [this <i>Malkhut</i>] is <b>“a pauper facing upward,”</b> [relative to] the world above. The higher world, <i>Bina</i>, partners with [the <i>Malkhut</i>] (as stated above with regard to the ninth commandment), in order to complete [the <i>Malkhut</i>], [such that <b>“She, too, has a completeness similar to above,”</b> as now [that <i>Malkhut</i>] receives the complete wholeness of the higher world, ‎<i>Bina</i>. This occurs through the lower unification of “Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever,” as clarified above in the fourth chapter [about] <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. Since [this <i>Malkhut</i>] is not the <i>Nukba</i> in the body of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, but the ‎separated <i>Nukba</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, [this separated <i>Malkhut</i>] thus takes all four chapters from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>], which are <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, because [this <i>Malkhut</i>] is ‎a separate and complete <i>partzuf</i>. However, these [chapters] are in a single container rather than in four separate containers ‎like in the <i>tefillin</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>. ‎
The reason is that a chapter is the mystical meaning of the light, while its box is the mystical meaning of the vessel. It is known that from every [fusion through collision] a light and vessel are drawn forth. Consequently, ‎the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, whose four chapters – which are his four brains: <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i> – are drawn to him in four ‎fusions, likewise has four boxes [which are vessels], a specific box for each chapter. By contrast, [in the case of] the <i>Nukba</i>, ‎there is no fusion in [this <i>Nukba</i>] itself. Rather [the <i>Nukba</i>] receives all four brains, which are the four chapters, ‎in a single fusion from <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and therefore it has only one box for all four chapters. ‎

Paragraph 243

<b>243. “The Tefillin are the letters of the holy name, etc.”</b><br><b>“The king is held captive in the tresses”</b> [Song of Songs 7:6], namely, <b>he is tied and held in those boxes</b> of the <i>tefillin</i>, in order <b>to be ‎unified in that holy name appropriately. Therefore, one who is rectified in them is in the image of God. Just as the ‎holy name is unified in <i>Elohim</i>, the holy name is appropriately unified in him as well. “Male and female He created them”</b> [Genesis 1:27], that is, <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of the head and the <i>tefillin</i> of the hand, and it is all one. ‎</b>
<b>“The king is held captive in the tresses.”</b> This means that the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is tied and unified in these boxes. That is, the boxes in ‎which the chapters are placed are called <b>“tresses</b> [<i>rehatim</i>].” <b><i>Rehatim</i></b> are troughs of water from which the sheep ‎drink [see e. g., Exodus 2:16]. Similarly, the brains, which are the waters of <i>Ḥokhma</i> and the waters of [the light of giving], are tied ‎and concealed in their vessels, the boxes. This is why the boxes are called “tresses.”‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“He is tied and held in those boxes, to ‎be unified in that holy name appropriately.”</b> The mystical meaning of the boxes is the aspect of ‎<i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzaḥ</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>, of <i>Tevuna</i>, [the female component of <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i>]. This is called “the large <b><i>dalet</i></b> of [the word] <b><i>eḥad</i></b> [one],” about which it is stated: <b>“Let the dry land appear”</b> [Genesis 1:9] (as mentioned above, in the third commandment). It was explained there that by means of the appearance of this dry land in <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] can subsequently give the ‎brains to the <i>Nukba</i>, in the mystical meaning of <b>“that which was dry land becomes a land for bearing fruits and offspring, and for planting trees”</b> [section #206#]. Thus, were it not for his boxes, which are from the aspect of this dry land, <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> would have been ‎unable to transmit the brains to his <i>Nukba</i>. ‎
This is the meaning of: <b>“He is tied and held in those boxes,”</b> that the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> is tied and held in the boxes of the chapters that come from “the dry land.” <b>“To ‎unify in that holy name appropriately,”</b> so that [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] can unite and transmit to the holy name, which is the <i>Nukba</i>, appropriately, in ‎the mystical meaning of the revelation of <b>“that which was dry land becomes a land for bearing fruits</b> etc.”; see there in detail. This is the mystical meaning of: <b>“The king is held captive in the tresses.”</b> ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Therefore, one who is rectified in them is in the image of God.”</b> That is, the lower man ‎who dons <i>tefillin</i> draws forth the brains: <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i>, which are called <b><i>tzelem</i></b> [<i>tzadi-lamed-mem</i>], from [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>. <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i> are ‎called <b><i>mem-lamed</i>,</b> and <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i> are called <b><i>tzadi</i></b>. This is the mystical meaning of the image of God. <b>“Just as the ‎holy name,</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i>, <b>is unified in <i>Elohim</i>,</b> which is the <i>Bina</i>, <b>the holy name is appropriately unified in the person as well,”</b> as stated above. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Male and female He created them,”</b> referring to <b>the <i>tefillin</i> of the head and <i>tefillin</i> of the hand, and it is all one.”</b> That is, [the verse] “And God created man in His own image” [Genesis 1:27] is the brains: <i>Ḥokhma</i> and <i>Bina</i>, <i>Ḥesed</i> and <i>Gevura</i>, which are called <b><i>tzelem</i>,</b> as stated. They consist of male and ‎female, namely <i>tzelem</i> of <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> and <i>tzelem</i> of <i>Nukba</i>, which are called the <i>tefillin</i> of the head and the <i>tefillin</i> of the hand. ‎

Paragraph 244

<b>244. “The eleventh commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The eleventh commandment</b> is <b>to tithe the tithe of the land. ‎There are two commandments here: One is to give the tithe of the land, and</b> [the other] <b>one is to bring the first fruits of ‎the tree, as it is stated: “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth”</b> [Genesis 1:29]. <b>It is written here “Behold, I have given,” and it is written there: “And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel”</b> [Numbers 18:21], <b>and it is stated: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s”</b> [Leviticus 27:30].
Explanation: [The <i>Zohar</i>] is expounding the verse: <b>“Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed,”</b> as referring to <b>the tithe of the land,</b> which was permitted to Adam the first [man], and the [continuation of that] verse: <b>“And every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed,”</b> as referring to <b>the first fruits of ‎the tree,</b> which were [also] permitted to Adam the first [man] (see the twelfth commandment, below). If so, we need to understand how these verses ‎obligate us to give the tithe and the first fruit, to separate them for God and to not eat them, which is ‎the opposite of the [apparent] meaning. ‎
Indeed, there is a profound matter here. The concept of eating is the mystical meaning of the distillation of the holy sparks from the <i>kelippot</i>. Through eating, the holy sparks in the food ‎combine with the soul of man, as flesh of his flesh, and the waste in the food comes out of his body. ‎Thus, over the course of one’s life [a person] gradually collects all the holy sparks that are relevant for the completion of man’s soul, ‎without which his wholeness would be deficient. The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Lekh Lekha</i>, page 101, section 300) states that Adam the first [man] was not permitted to eat meat, as it is stated: <b>“Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed</b> etc. <b>to you it shall be for food,”</b> which [the <i>Zohar</i>] expounds: And no more than that, namely, and‎ not meat. However, <b>“</b>‎<b>once he sinned and the evil inclination was absorbed in his body,”</b> Noah was told: <b>“As the green herb have I given you all”</b> [Genesis 9:3], namely, even meat; see there.
The meaning is as follows: Adam the first [man] was born in a great state of completeness. All the ‎appropriate wholeness was already distilled in him, in regards to the animal aspect, as it is stated: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field... and whatever the man would call every living creature, that was to be its name” [Genesis 2:19]. ‎ The meaning of this [naming] is that he grasped each and every one of the animals’ names in its [complete] structure, because they were already wholly distilled for ‎him (as stated in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>, <i>Tikkun</i> 57; see there). Therefore, he was not given animals for distillation through eating, for they had already been‎ distilled for him by the Emanator. Only the mineral and the vegetable kingdoms lacked distillation, and accordingly ‎he was only allowed to eat and to distill the produce of the land, to collect from them those holy sparks that were needed to complete him. ‎ However, after the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, all the distillations reverted and became corrupted. Just as ‎the limbs of his soul dropped and fell into the <i>kelippot</i>, so too all the animals were corrupted with him and require distillation anew. Consequently, Noah was also given animals to eat and distill, and the same applies to the generations that came after him. ‎
Now, Adam the first [man] was created in <b>the image of God,</b> which are those aforementioned brains (which were clarified in the tenth commandment), in the mystical meaning of <b>the four chapters of the <i>tefillin</i>,</b> and they are his <i>neshama</i> (soul). However, after he was born with the aspect of this holy <i>neshama</i>, he merited ‎through good deeds to distill and raise feminine waters and achieve the aspect of <i>ḥaya</i>, and afterwards, on Shabbat, the aspect of <i>yeḥida</i> as well (as the supernal brightness was lost only ‎after Shabbat, as is known). Therefore, he was permitted <b>the tithe and the first fruit.</b> In fact, by ‎eating <b>the tithe and the first fruit</b> [himself]<b>,</b> he merited ‎ to distill and raise feminine waters until he ‎merited <i>ḥaya</i> and <i>yeḥida</i>. ‎
However, after the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, when all the distillations reverted and became corrupted and the evil inclination was absorbed in the body, <b>the tithe and the first fruit</b> were ‎forbidden to us, on account of the evil inclination within us, due to the concern that we might impair the supernal ‎holiness they contain. Instead, we are obligated to give them to the priests and the Levites. When we at least fulfill these ‎mitzvot of <b>the tithe and the first fruit</b> as we have been commanded, we will have the strength to ‎raise feminine waters and to draw down the aspect of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> <b>on Shabbat,</b> in the manner that Adam the first [man] drew forth [those brains] through his own eating of ‎<b>the tithe and the first fruit</b>. ‎
Thus the [<i>Zohar</i>] states: <b>“The eleventh commandment is to tithe the tithe of the land,”</b> since once we have drawn ‎the light of <i>neshama</i> by donning <b><i>tefillin</i>,</b> we must raise feminine waters by virtue of the two commandments ‎of <b>the tithe and the first fruit,</b> in order to draw the brains of <i>ḥaya</i>. It has thus been clarified that Adam the first [man] drew forth the ‎brains of <i>ḥaya</i> through his consumption of <b>the tithe and the first fruit</b> himself, but we, who are not ‎permitted to eat them, due to the evil inclination in our bodies, were instead given the commandment of ‎giving them to the priests and the Levites. We were thereby also provided with the capacity to ‎draw those brains. [The <i>Zohar</i>] then cites proof that the verse speaks specifically of <b>the tithe and the first fruit,</b> that <b>it is written here “Behold, I have given...</b>” and it is stated: <b>“And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given.”</b> Just as there it is referring to the tithe, so too here, with respect to Adam the first [man], it is referring to the tithe. [The <i>Zohar</i>] likewise derives [this] <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“Of the fruit ‎of the tree, is the Lord’s.”</b>

Paragraph 245

<b>245. “The twelfth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The twelfth commandment is to bring the first fruit of the tree, as it is stated: “And every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed.” Everything that is suitable for Me is prohibited for you to eat. He permitted to them and gave them all of His tithes and the first fruit of the tree, as it is stated: “I have given you”</b> [Genesis 1:29, which means] <b>to you and not to the generations that come after you.</b>
Explanation: This is referring to the verse with which He ended the eleventh commandment, in which it is stated: <b>“And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s”</b> [Leviticus 27:30]. [The <i>Zohar</i>] is saying that [since] here it is stated: <b>“And every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed,”</b> a verbal analogy can be derived from there: Just as there [the verse is speaking of] <b>the first fruit,</b> so too here [it means] <b>the first fruit.</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] says: <b>“Everything that is suitable for Me is prohibited for you to eat,”</b> namely, not [only] specifically the <b>tithe,</b> but also the first fruit, [as derived] from this verse: <b>“Of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s.”</b> “The Lord’s” implies <b>that</b> which is <b>suitable for Me,</b> including the <b>first fruit of the tree.</b> This is the basis for the verbal analogy that the verse here, <b>“and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed,”</b> is also referring to <b>the first fruit.</b> Accordingly, [the <i>Zohar</i>] says that <b>“He permitted to them and gave them all of His tithes and the first fruit of the tree,”</b> for [the <i>Zohar</i>] derived by verbal analogy that the verses are referring only to <b>the tithe and the first fruit,</b> as explained.
Do not be puzzled that the verse: “Of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s,” is stated in the eleventh commandment rather than this commandment. In fact the <i>Zohar</i> mixes them together right at the start of the eleventh commandment, where it states: <b>“There are two commandments here.”</b> However, the printer divided them into two, and he thereby cut them in the middle and left the verse about <b>the first fruit</b> in the eleventh commandment. This is clear.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] also inferred that the verse is referring to <b>the tithe and the first fruit</b> from the fact that it is stated: “<b>I have given you,”</b> which implies: <b>“And not to the generations that come after you.”</b> Only to you have I given [the tithe and the first fruit] to eat, and not to the generations after you. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the verse is speaking of the regular produce of the land, [as that is produce] which we too are permitted to eat. Rather, it is referring only to the produce of the land that we are prohibited to eat, which is necessarily <b>the tithe</b> and the <b>first fruit.</b>

Paragraph 246

<b>246. “The thirteenth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The thirteenth commandment is to perform a redemption for one’s son, to tie him to life. There are two officials, one over life and the other over death, and they stand over a person. When a person redeems his son, he redeems him from the hand of the one</b> appointed over <b>death, and</b> [that official] <b>is unable to rule over him. This is the mystical meaning of: “And God saw everything that He had made</b> [and behold, it was very good,” Genesis 1:31], <b>as a whole. “And behold</b> […] <b>good” is the angel of life. “Very” is the angel of death. Therefore, in that redemption that</b> angel of <b>life is sustained, while that angel</b> of death <b>is weakened. With this redemption he acquires life for him, as stated, and that evil side leaves him and does not grip hold of him.</b>
Explanation: [The <i>Zohar</i>] derives from the verse: <b>“And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good,”</b> that <b>“And behold</b> […] <b>good” is the angel of life,</b> [whereas] <b>“very” is the angel of death.</b> [It was] then, on the sixth day of the act of creation, in the mystical meaning of [the letter] <b><i>heh</i></b> in [the word] <b><i>ha-</i></b><i>shishi<b></b></i> [“the sixth”], that the worlds were greatly elevated. The <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ascended to the place of <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, and the <i>Nukba</i> to the place of [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and Adam the first [man] then attained the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> in full, by means of which the power of the angel of death was nullified. What is more, [Adam] was tempered with the aspect of <b>“very,”</b> as he will be upon the completion of the rectification, at the time of “He will eliminate death forever” [Isaiah 25:8]. It is [in allusion] to this [future] that the verse hints: <b>“And behold</b> […] <b>good” is the angel of life; “very” is the angel of death.</b>
Now, however, after the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, the worlds do not ascend as much on the fifth hour of [the day preceding] the eve of Shabbat, in the mystical meaning of <b><i>heh</i></b> of <b><i>ha</i></b><i>-shishi<b></b></i>. Consequently, we require a special commandment to draw for us [enough] preparation and strength to at least receive the light of <i>ḥaya</i> on the day of Shabbat. This is the commandment of redeeming the firstborn of man. <b>“With this redemption he acquires life for him</b> […] <b>and that evil side leaves him and does not grip hold of him.,”</b> [meaning that] with this redemption, the angel of life is strengthened and the angel of death is weakened. That is, similar to that which took place with Adam the first [man] at the time, through the Emanator Himself in the mystical meaning of <b><i>heh</i></b> of <b><i>ha</i></b><i>-shishi<b></b></i>, when the angel of death became “very good,” so too is the special quality of this commandment of redeeming the firstborn.
And yet it is not completely as it was then, for the angel of death had no power at that stage, whereas now [the angel of death] can only be weakened through the commandment of redeeming the firstborn, but not removed entirely. <b>“With this redemption he acquires life for him, as stated, and that evil side leaves him and does not grip hold of him.”</b> [This means that] with this redemption, [the person] acquires life, as was said [above], and the force of evil leaves him and he is not gripped by it further. In other words, once [the person] is completely purified by virtue of this commandment, the evil forces have no more purchase on him at all. Then [the person] can acquire life for [the son] which is the mystical meaning of the brains of <i>ḥaya</i> of the Shabbat day, because he is already completely purified from the evil side that was absorbed in the body due to the sin of the Tree of Knowledge. Accordingly, [the person] has [the necessary] preparation to receive the brains of the Shabbat day.

Paragraph 247

<b>247. “The fourteenth commandment, etc.”</b><br><b>The fourteenth commandment is to preserve the Shabbat day, which is the day of rest from ‎the whole act of creation. Two commandments are included here. One is to preserve the Shabbat day ‎and the other is to tie that day to its holiness,</b> meaning to draw forth the brains of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, called ‎‎“holiness.” <b>“To preserve the Shabbat day,”</b> namely, <b>as I mentioned and commented about it, that it is the day of rest for the worlds, ‎and all deeds are perfected in it, and they are performed before the day is sanctified</b> [namely, begins]. <b>‎</b>
Explanation: On the Shabbat day the <i>Ze’er Anpin</i> ascends to <i>Arikh Anpin</i>, the <i>Nukba</i> to [<i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma Ila’in</i>], and [the worlds of] <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i>, and <i>Asiya</i> ascend to <i>Yisrael Sabba</i> and <i>Tevuna</i> and [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> of ‎<i>Atzilut</i>. As a result, <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i> of man ascend with them to ‎<i>Atzilut</i>, where they receive the light of <i>ḥaya</i>. Accordingly, there ‎are <b>“two commandments, one to preserve the Shabbat day,”</b> namely, that one does not stumble by performing creative acts and carrying from ‎domain to domain and the like. [This is because] once the worlds have completely separated from the ‎<i>kelippot</i> [as they do on Shabbat], we must be ‎careful not to give the ‎<i>kelippot</i> enough strength to return and mingle with that day, and one who performs creative acts [on Shabbat] causes the ‎<i>kelippot</i> to become mingled again with the holiness. The second commandment is‎ <b>“to tie that day to its holiness”</b> in the proper manner. That is, by virtue of [our] enjoyment of the Shabbat we draw in ‎the light of ‎<i>Atzilut</i> to our <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruaḥ</i>, and <i>neshama</i>. The light of ‎<i>Atzilut</i> is light of <i>Ḥokhma</i>, which is called <b>“holiness,”</b> ‎and we are sanctified through it. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“To preserve the Shabbat day</b> etc.” This is referring to all the toils and labors alluded to in the struggles and wars with ‎the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, which separate us from cleaving to God. The general rule is that where there ‎is toil, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> is there. By means of the wars and toils we distill the holy sparks that are ‎absorbed within the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and each and every distillation is considered a distinct labor. Initially, all those distillations were performed by the Emanator Himself, as these are all the creative acts of the ‎Creator that are described in the six days of creation. When all these distillations were completed, they were consideredto have been perfected and to have achieved their purpose. Then the Shabbat was sanctified, [namely, it was the start of Shabbat, ] which is the ‎day of rest, for the labor had been completed and there was nothing more to rectify. Understand this (see the <i>Zohar</i>‎ <i>Ḥadash</i>, <i>Yitro</i>, p. 25, 97–98).
Thus, the mystical meaning of <b>the Shabbat day</b> is that it is <b>the day of rest</b> for all the worlds, because each Shabbat that ‎wholeness of the first Shabbat comes back once again, in the mystical meaning of the day of rest, in which all the ‎<i>kelippot</i> were ‎separated and stuck in the great deep. The worlds ascend to ‎<i>Atzilut</i>, which is the mystical meaning of the ‎total unification. We must draw forth that holiness, and it is drawn forth to us through the two ‎commandments of <b>remembering and preserving</b> [the Shabbat]<b>. ‎</b>

Paragraph 248

<b>248. “Once the day was sanctified, etc.”</b><br><b>Once the day was sanctified</b> [namely, began], <b>there remained the creation of spirits for which no body had been ‎created.</b> He asks: <b>Did the Holy One, blessed be He, not know to delay the sanctification of the day until bodies were created ‎for those spirits?</b> He responds: <b>Rather, the tree of knowledge of good and evil was awakening the evil side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>‎and it sought to triumph in the world. Many spirits separated and emerged with numerous weapons ‎to be strengthened and</b> clothed <b>in bodies in the world. ‎</b>
Explanation: Once the day [of Shabbat] was sanctified, [namely, began, ] there remained the creation of the spirits for which no bodies had yet been ‎created. In other words, the day commenced before the Holy One, blessed be He, managed to create bodies for those ‎spirits. This is the mystical meaning of: “<b>Which God had created, to make”</b> [Genesis 2:3], which refers to Shabbat. [The Torah] states: <b>“For on it He rested from all His work which God had created, to make,”</b> which is apparently inexplicable: If He had really completed all His acts of creation with the desired aim, [this implies] He created nothing for us <b>“to make,”</b> ‎because He had made and completed everything Himself.
Rather, the mystical meaning is that the Lord made all the ‎distillations and completed all the works, in such a way that we would have the opportunity <b>“to make,”</b> meaning ‎that we could make and complete them through our labor in the Torah and commandments. ‎The concept of resting [in the story of Creation] is stated only with regard to the works of the Emanator, and the verse is teaching us that God has already <b>“rested from all His work,”</b> indicating that nothing is missing on His part. All of ‎this, <b>“which God had created”</b> and completed, allows us <b>“to make”</b> and complete them from our part ‎as well. ‎
This is the meaning of [the <i>Zohar</i>’s] statement that <b>“there remained the creation of spirits for which no body had been ‎created,”</b> for God did not manage to make bodies for certain spirits ‎before He sanctified the Shabbat, and there remained <b>bare, bodiless spirits.</b> These bodiless spirits are ‎the ‎<i>kelippot</i> and harmful spirits that lead man to sin, as explained below. He left them deliberately, for we ‎were thereby granted the power of choice and a place to labor in the Torah and commandments.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] raises the difficulty: Did the Holy One, blessed be He, not know how to delay the sanctification of the day until after bodies had been created for those spirits? [The <i>Zohar</i>] answers: <b>“Rather, the tree of knowledge of good and evil was awakening the evil side,</b> that <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> of the evil, <b>‎and it sought to triumph in the world.”</b> The meaning is as follows: the <i>Malkhut</i> is called the tree of knowledge of ‎good and evil (as stated in section #123#): <b>“If</b> [a person] <b>merits, it is good; if he does not merit, it is evil”;</b> see there for the explanation. When Adam ‎[the first man] sinned with the Tree of Knowledge and he became one who “does not merit,” the aspect of evil in ‎the tree of knowledge of good and evil was awakened and the evil wished to intensify in the ‎world, namely, it sought to triumph over the good and cling to the world in such a manner that the good would never be able ‎to defeat it.
Then <b>“many spirits emerged with numerous weapons ‎to be strengthened and</b> clothed <b>in bodies in the world.”</b> Explanation: two points conjoined in <i>Malkhut</i>. One [of these points] is tempered with the aspect of <i>Bina</i>, the attribute of mercy. The second [point] is the ‎ attribute of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> itself. When <i>Malkhut</i> is properly rectified in holiness, the ‎point of the attribute of judgment is concealed and hidden, and the point of the attribute of ‎mercy is <b>“in a revealed state”</b> (as stated in section #122#, and in the <i>Sulam</i>; see there). Then “a person merits, <b>and it is good.”</b> But if a person sins and impairs [the <i>Malkhut</i>], the attribute of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i> is revealed, and the power is given to masters of harm and destruction to ‎rule over him, <b>“and it is evil.”</b>
If one merits and the point of mercy rules in a revealed state, [the person] merits to raise ‎<i>Malkhut</i> to the supernal <i>Bina</i> through his actions, and the supernal mercy and brains are revealed upon ‎him. If he does not merit and reveals the attribute of judgment within [<i>Malkhut</i>], not only does he ‎impair <i>Malkhut</i>, but he also impairs the point of <i>Bina</i> that conjoined with the <i>Malkhut</i>, as [that point] is transformed from mercy into judgment due to the revelation of judgment in <i>Malkhut</i>, for every revealed [attribute] is the one that rules. ‎
Thus, after the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, the power of judgment in ‎<i>Malkhut</i> was revealed. This also impaired the point of <i>Bina</i> in [<i>Malkhut</i>], which was transformed into the attribute of judgment. This point ‎of <i>Bina</i> is the entire possibility for rectification in ‎<i>Malkhut</i>, as through this point, [the <i>Malkhut</i>] is called <b>‎‎“good”</b> when the point of <i>Bina</i> is in a revealed state, as explained. But now that the point of <i>Bina</i> has also been impaired and transformed ‎into judgment, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> thought that its time had arrived to triumph in the world ‎and be clothed in people’s bodies, namely, those of Adam the first [man] and his sons. ‎ That is, the body of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> would inherit the place of the body of Adam the first [man], and [thus] no aspect of rectification of ‎‎<i>Malkhut</i> would be conceivable there any more from the side of the good. [The <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] saw that the point of <i>Bina</i> in ‎‎<i>Malkhut</i> had also been transformed and become the attribute of judgment, and no rectification was conceivable any more. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“Many spirits separated and emerged</b> to attack the world <b>with numerous weapons,</b> namely, forces of destruction, <b>‎to be strengthened and</b> enclothed <b>in</b> human <b>bodies in</b> this <b>world.”</b> They wished to rule here permanently, because they thought that no one could save [people] from their hands [see Deuteronomy 32:39], on account of the impairment that ‎Adam had inflicted with his sin, in the point of mercy in ‎‎<i>Malkhut</i>, as stated. ‎

Paragraph 249

<b>249. “When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw, etc.”</b><br><b>When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw this, He awakened the blowing of the wind from the tree of life,</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, <b>and ‎struck upon another tree,</b> the <i>Malkhut</i>. <b>Then the other, good side awakened and the day ‎was sanctified. The creation of the bodies and the awakening of the spirits on this ‎night,</b> of Shabbat, <b>are on the good side, and not on the other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>]. <b>‎</b>
Explanation: When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that the letter of the law was with the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and they had the power to be ‎clothed in bodies in the world, which would completely prevent any further aspect of rectification, <b>“He awakened the blowing of the wind from the tree of life and struck upon,”</b> namely, performed a pairing with the other tree, the ‎<i>Malkhut</i>, giving it the breath of the spirit of life. The <b>“other, good side awakened”</b> in <i>Malkhut</i> again, as was the case before the sin of Adam the first [man], in the mystical meaning of <b>“if one merits, it is good”</b> [see previous section]. <b>“And the day ‎was sanctified”;</b> Shabbat began, and its sanctity was extended to the world. ‎
In other words, although strictly speaking the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> would have the power to clothe itself ‎in bodies, the Holy One, blessed be He, went beyond the letter of the law and took no notice at all of the impairment that Adam the first [man] had caused. The [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i>, which are <b>the tree of life and the ‎tree of knowledge of good,</b> were paired together as [they had been] before the sin, and drew the sanctity of the brains ‎of the Shabbat day into the world. ‎ This is the mystical meaning of the statement (<i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> II, page 95, section 148) that <b>“the light which operated in the six days of creation was concealed ‎only after the Shabbat.”</b> By means of this action, that the [brains of the] Shabbat day was drawn into the ‎world, the scheme of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> to be clothed in bodies of people in this world was thwarted, and ‎they remained bodiless spirits. Consequently, Adam [the first man] was able to repent. ‎
The creation of the bodies and the awakening of the spirits on this night [of the Shabbat] is ‎from the good side, rather than from the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. This is because an action of the Holy One, blessed be He, lasts forever. Just as on ‎the first Shabbat He took no notice at all of the fact that Adam had already been ‎impaired by the sin of the tree of knowledge, and [despite this impairment] the [<i>Ze’er Anpin</i>] and <i>Nukba</i> paired together, and He sanctified the day as before the sin – since He nullified the entire rule of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> even though they had the ‎power to rule – the same applies to all the <i>Shabbatot</i> of the six thousand years: Although man is still full of the contamination of the serpent, as he has ‎still not rectified the sin of the tree of knowledge, nevertheless, when he couples [with his wife] on <b>Shabbat eve</b> the ‎forces of evil have no control over him whatsoever. He draws forth the body and spirit ‎of the newborn through his coupling, as though there were no flaw in him from the tree of knowledge at all, namely, as though he ‎had already rectified the sin of the tree of knowledge himself. ‎
This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“For the creation of the bodies and the awakening of the spirits are on the good side, on this ‎night.”</b> Although the individual himself has not yet merited it, on this night the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> has no control over him. He can thus draw forth bodies and spirits, through his coupling, from the side of the tree of the knowledge of good, rather than from the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. This is the power of rectification that was performed on <b>the Shabbat of creation,</b> when the Holy One, blessed be He, took no notice at all of the evil that Adam the first [man] had drawn upon himself, as stated.

Paragraph 250

<b>250. “If he had given precedence, etc.”</b><br><b>If He had given precedence to the other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>on that night, before giving precedence to ‎the good side, the world would not be able to stand before them for even a moment. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, had made the remedy precede</b> [the blow], <b>for He had the sanctification of the day skip before Him, and precede to come before the other side, and the world was perpetuated. As for the intention of the other side, to be established and strengthened in the world, the good side was established and ‎strengthened on that night,</b> as <b>holy bodies and spirits were constructed on that night from the good side. ‎For this reason, the time</b> [for marital relations] <b>of wise people, who know this, is from Shabbat to Shabbat,</b> [once a week]. <b>‎</b>

Paragraph 251

<b>251. “For then, when the other side saw it, etc.”</b><br><b>For then, when the other side saw this, that the side of holiness had done what he wished to do, ‎</b>[the other side] <b>goes and roams with several of his armies and parties, and watches all of those who are engaging in intercourse while they are naked, ‎ by candlelight.</b> Therefore, <b>all the children born from this</b> [manner of intercourse] <b>‎suffer from epilepsy</b> [see <i>Pesaḥim</i> 112b], <b>because the spirits from that other side rest upon them. These are the naked ‎spirits of the wicked, which are called harmful spirits, and Lilith presides over them and kills them. ‎</b>

Paragraph 252

<b>252. “When the day is sanctified, etc.”</b><br><b>When the day</b> [of Shabbat] <b>is sanctified</b> [namely, begins], <b>and the holiness rules over the world, that other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>diminishes ‎itself and hides throughout the night of Shabbat and the day of Shabbat, except for ‎Asimon and his entire sect, who walk upon the candles in secret, to see the exposure of the ‎intercourse. Afterwards, they hide in the cavity of the great deep. Once Shabbat is over, ‎several armies and camps fly and roam through the world. Therefore, the psalm of harmful forces,</b> namely, Psalm 91: “O you who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,” <b>was instituted, so that they would have power over the ‎holy nation. ‎</b>
Explanation: Strictly speaking, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> had the ability to clothe themselves in bodies, as stated. Had they managed to do so, the earth would have been given into the control of wickedness. All the ‎bodies and offspring that would have come into the world would all have been from the aspect of evil of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and they ‎would never have had the strength to be rectified with the good side. This is the meaning of the statement: <b>“If He had given precedence to the other side</b> [<i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] <b>on that night, before giving precedence to ‎the good side, the world would not be able to stand before them for even a moment”</b> [section #250#, above]. Their contamination would have ruled over all the offspring in the ‎world and it would have been impossible to cling to the good side even for a moment. ‎
<b>“However, the Holy One, blessed be He, had made the remedy precede”</b> that event, in that <b>“He had the sanctification of the day skip before Him, and precede to come before the other side,”</b> namely, the holiness of Shabbat skipped ahead and preceded the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, and thus the light of ceasing [from work] ‎and rest was revealed in the worlds, which vanquishes and drops the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> and all the <i>kelippot</i> to ‎the cavity of the great deep. <b>“And the world perpetuated,”</b> since this provided the opportunity for the begetting of bodies and spirits <b>from the good side,</b> through the coupling of Shabbat night, and thus the ‎world was perpetuated in the desired manner. ‎
The reason why [the <i>Zohar</i>] states that <b>“He had</b> [the sanctification of the day] <b>skip before Him”</b> is because anything which does not follow ‎the order of the system of the worlds is called “skipping.” Because the holiness of the ‎Shabbat comes solely by means of an awakening from above – because man had not yet undergone any repentance and ‎rectification that would render him worthy of it [from below], but rather the Emanator Himself brought the remedy forward for the rectification of the world – it is therefore called <b>“skipping.”‎</b>
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues (section #250#): <b>“As for the intention</b> [of the other side]<b>...</b>” to be established and strengthened in the world, the ‎good side was established and strengthened on that night. [In actuality, ] that night [followed] after the failure [of man with] ‎the tree of knowledge, and [so that night, ] strictly speaking, should have belonged only to the construction of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> in ‎all of its strength. The <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> thought likewise, but instead the opposite occurred: The holiness ‎took the place [of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>], and <b>“holy bodies and spirits were constructed on that night from the good side.”</b> [This result was] because the ‎preparation was made so that anyone who mates on that night draws forth bodies and spirits from ‎<b>the good side,</b> in which there is no purchase for the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> at all. This is the precise opposite of ‎the scheme of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“For this reason, the time [</b>for marital relations] <b>of wise people, who know this, is from Shabbat to Shabbat,</b> because then the bodies and spirits are constructed from the side of good. T<b>hen, the other side sees that the side of holiness had done what he wished to do</b> etc. [sections #250#–#251#]. [The <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>] had imagined that he would be established and strengthened on that night, but ultimately it was the side of holiness that was built. <b>“He,</b> the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, <b>goes and roams with several of his</b> evil <b>armies and parties, and watches all of those who are engaging in intercourse while they are naked, ‎ by candlelight. All the children born from them ‎suffer from epilepsy, because the spirits from that other side rest upon them,</b> by means of the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>, <b>These are the naked ‎spirits of the wicked, which are called harmful spirits, and Lilith presides over them and kills them.</b>
However, <b>“when the day is sanctified, and the holiness</b> of Shabbat <b>rules over the world, that other side diminishes ‎itself and hides throughout the night of Shabbat and the day of Shabbat.</b> This is why [the Shabbat] is the fixed time for the wise to engage in marital relations. <b>“Except for</b> [the harmful] <b>‎Asimon and his entire sect, who walk with candles in secret, to see the exposure of the ‎intercourse. Afterwards, they hide in the cavity of the great deep.”</b> This Asimon, although he has the power [needed] to see the intercourse ‎by candlelight, even on Shabbat, he does not have the power to harm on the holy day, but rather he must ‎return without delay to the cavity of the great deep. It is only after the Shabbat that he can harm. ‎
The meaning is as follows: Rabbi Shimon sensed a difficulty here with regard to the teaching that <b>the time</b> [for marital relations] <b>of wise people is from Shabbat to Shabbat.</b> After all, every day at midnight the Holy One, blessed be He, strolls with the righteous in the ‎Garden of Eden <b>“and there is coupling for the wise,”</b> not only on Shabbat nights. [Rabbi Shimon] raised this difficulty in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Vayyak’hel</i>, page 65, section 194; see there). To ‎resolve this problem, he elaborates here on the difference between a coupling on Shabbat and a coupling ‎on a weekday, with respect to intercourse by candlelight.
According to the plain meaning of the text, the difference is that on weekday nights the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> has the power to ‎afflict the newborn children with epilepsy, and similarly Lilith has the power to kill them. ‎ On Shabbat nights, by contrast, although the harmful spirit Asimon and his sect are there, and they have the ‎strength to see [those engaging in intercourse] on Shabbat as well, he does not have the power to harm them at that time, but ‎only after the Shabbat. There is a rectification for that as well, in <b>“the <i>havdala</i></b> [“separation” ritual, marking the conclusion of Shabbat] <b>of the</b> [evening] <b>prayer</b> ‎<b>and in the <i>havdala</i> over the cup,”</b> through which the power of this harmful spirit is entirely nullified, as will be explained [in the next section] below. This [illustrates] that ‎there is a significant difference between a coupling on the night of Shabbat and a coupling of ‎a weekday night at midnight. ‎
The mystical meaning is that there are <b>“lights of light,”</b> which is <i>Ze’er Anpin</i>, and that is the mystical meaning of <b>the higher unification.</b> There are [also] <b>“lights of fire,”</b> which is the <i>Nukba</i> of ‎<i>Ze’er Anpin</i> (as stated in sections #209# above; see there), which is the mystical meaning of <b>the lower unification.</b> There are three aspects to <b>“its flame,”</b> [the lights of the <i>Nukba</i>]<b>:</b> The first is <b>“white light”;</b> the second is <b>“azure light,”</b> which is beneath the white light; and the third is <b>“a crude substance,”</b> such as <b>“fat or oil or wick,”</b> to which the ‎azure light clings. This azure light is the mystical meaning of <b>“fire consuming fire that eats and ‎consumes everything that is below it.”</b> This [attribute] is the aspect of judgment within [this light], and therefore it eats and consumes everything below it, in that it eats the fat and the wick to which it clings. <b>“White light”</b> is the mystical meaning of the mercy within it, because white represents mercy. ‎
This is the mystical meaning of [the statement]: <b>“One who engages in marital relations by candlelight will have epileptic children”</b> [<i>Pesaḥim</i> 112b]. Likewise, Lilith can kill them, because the azure light of the candle, which is the attribute of judgment, presides [in that context] and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> has the power to cling to the coupling. [This power comes] because of the exposure of their bodies through the attribute of judgment, that is, the contamination of the serpent [of the Garden of Eden] that is in the bodies of those engaging in intercourse, and “it finds its own type and is awakened” [see e. g., <i>Avoda Zara</i> 73a].
Further, the coupling that was permitted at midnight was specifically [permitted] in the dark, when there is no light, ‎because then it is stated with regard to <i>Malkhut</i>: <b>“She rises while it is yet night”</b> [Proverbs 31:15], and the mercies are revealed. ‎However, if there is candlelight there, this causes the contamination [of the serpent of the Garden of Eden] to be exposed in the bodies and the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> clings to the coupling. [The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states: <b>“And</b> the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> <b>watches all of those who are engaging in intercourse while they are naked, ‎ by candlelight.”</b> By the light of the candle, the <i>Sitra Aḥara</i> sees the exposed contamination in their ‎bodies, accuses them, and clings to their coupling, as explained. ‎
On Shabbat night, however, all the judgments are removed from [the environment], and the azure light also turns into ‎white light. Accordingly, it would have been permitted to engage in intercourse even by ‎candlelight. Moreover, even the contamination in a person’s body completely disappears by virtue of the ‎sanctity of Shabbat, and the fear of exposing the body by the candlelight no longer pertains.
To this [seeming permission to engage in intercourse in the light of the candle on Shabbat] the <i>Zohar</i> states: <b>“Except for ‎Asimon and his entire sect, who walk upon the candles in secret, to see the exposure of the ‎intercourse.”</b> Even on Shabbat, when the azure light turns white and there is no judgment there at all, the light of the candle still needs something crude to which to cling [in order to burn]. This [crude fuel substance] is necessarily of the aspect of judgment, because a crude substance is murky and this alludes to judgments. However, on Shabbat ‎the form of judgment is not apparent in [this substance] and it is regarded as a coin that has no face [stamped upon it]. [The aspect of judgment] is unknown, and therefore this harmful spirit, represented by the crude substance to which the candle clings, is ‎called Asimon, which means a coin without a form [imprinted upon it; see e. g., <i>Berakhot</i> 47b]. ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] thus states that they <b>“walk upon the candles in secret,”</b> for this is the mystical meaning of the crude substance that ‎is drawn in concealment together with the candle, since the candle would not burn without it, as stated. Therefore, [this attribute of judgment] sees ‎the exposure of the coupling, by means of which it can harm the person after the conclusion of Shabbat. Thus, there is no concern on the night of Shabbat [itself] as a result of the exposure of their bodies, because ‎the contamination of the body is not distinguishable on Shabbat. But after Shabbat [this force of judgment] has the power to ‎reveal the form of evil in that individual and harm him (see <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> II, page 150).
As for the statement: <b>“Once Shabbat is over, ‎several armies...</b>” the meaning is as follows: Although Asimon and his sect cannot inflict harm on Shabbat, because at that stage there is still no form of ‎evil in [that aspect of judgment], after Shabbat, however, he and his sect reacquire their form and fly and ascend <b>from the great ‎deep</b> into inhabited areas, and roam through the world and then they can inflict harm. Therefore, <b>“the psalm of harmful forces was instituted...</b>” which is: “O you who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,” for by virtue of this repentance ‎and prayer of “O you who dwell in the shelter,” one is spared from them. ‎

Paragraph 253

<b>253. “To which place do they roam, etc.”</b><br><b>To which place do they roam on that night</b> of the conclusion of Shabbat? <b>When they come out in a ‎rush and think of ruling the world, over the holy nation, they see them standing in ‎prayer and reciting this song,</b> namely, “O you who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,” <b>and first performing‎ the <i>havdala</i> rite in the prayer</b> ‎<b>and</b> then <b>the <i>havdala</i> over the cup,</b> [and upon seeing this] <b>they fly away from there. They ‎go off and roam and arrive in the wilderness; may the Merciful One save us from them and from ‎the evil side. ‎</b>
Explanation: [The <i>Zohar</i>] asks only about [the night of] <b>the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> not all the weekday nights, because at the conclusion ‎of Shabbat there still remains an imprint from the sanctity of Shabbat. [The <i>Zohar</i>] therefore inquires: Since they fly ‎out and ascend from the great deep when Shabbat ends, where do they go? It explains that <b>“when they come out in a ‎rush and think of ruling the world, over the holy nation,”</b> namely, Israel, <b>“they see them standing in ‎prayer and reciting this song”</b> of “O you who dwell in the shelter of the Most High,” <b>“and first performing ‎ the <i>havdala</i> rite in the prayer</b> ‎<b>and</b> then <b>the <i>havdala</i> over the cup</b> of wine,” [therefore] <b>“they</b> leave and fly from them, <b>and go off and roam and arrive in the wilderness,”</b> namely, in an uninhabited region, and people are spared from them. ‎
Thus, there are three aspects of places for the [forces of the] <i>Sitra Aḥara</i>: On Shabbat, they are in the cavity of the great deep and lack the power to harm at all. At the conclusion of Shabbat, by means of prayer and <i>havdala</i>, they are in ‎the wilderness, a place where there are no people. They have the power to inflict harm but are ‎repelled from settled areas. On the rest of the nights they are found in settled areas as well. ‎

Paragraph 254

<b>254. “There are three who inflict, etc.”</b><br><b>There are three who inflict harm upon themselves: One is someone who curses himself. The second is one ‎who throws bread or crumbs that contain an olive-bulk. The third is one who lights the candle upon ‎the conclusion of Shabbat before Israel reach the <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i>,</b> which is in the section beginning: “And You are holy” (Psalms 22:4). <b>For</b> with ‎that fire, <b>he causes the fire of Gehennom to be kindled before their</b> [proper] <b>time</b> [for burning] <b>arrives. ‎</b>

Paragraph 255

<b>255. “For there is a certain place, etc.”</b><br><b>For there is a certain place in Gehennom for those who desecrate <i>Shabbatot</i>. Those who are being punished in ‎Gehennom curse the one who lights the candle before its time arrives, telling him, “Behold, the Lord will hurl you up and down with a man’s throw etc. He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into a large country”</b> [Isaiah 22:17–18]. <b>‎</b>
Explanation: There is a certain harmful spirit called <b>Evil-eye</b> and he loves cursing, in the mystical meaning of the verse: <b>“He loved cursing, and it came to him; and he did not delight in blessing, and it is far from him”</b> [Psalms 109:17]. When a person curses himself, he gives strength to this Evil-eye one, who loves cursing, and [that harmful being] rules over [the person], and [the person] thus inflicts harm upon himself.
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“One ‎who throws bread or crumbs that contain an olive-bulk.”</b> There is nothing in this ‎world that does not have an important root above. This is certainly true of bread, upon which man’s ‎life depends. Thus, it has a very important root above, and consequently one who treats his bread with disdain ‎impairs the root of his life above. This is only obvious to all people during a meal that provides satisfaction, which ‎gives him life. ‎ However, with regard to bread and crumbs that only contain an olive-bulk, some people treat them with disdain ‎and throw them away, because they do not [have a quantity to] satisfy. But since the Sages were stringent and required one to recite Grace after Meals even for [as little as] an olive-bulk, they [too] must be considered like a satisfying meal and it is prohibited to treat them with disdain, and one who does so inflicts harm upon himself. ‎
The idea is as follows: The Sages have taught [<i>Berakhot</i> 20b] that the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, it is written in Your Torah, “[The great, mighty and awesome God] who favors no one and takes no bribe” [Deuteronomy 10:17], and yet You show favor to Israel, as it is stated: “The Lord shall show favor to you” [Numbers 6:26]. He replied to them: But should I not show favor to Israel? For I wrote to them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God” [Deuteronomy 8:10], and they are exacting with themselves [to recite Grace after Meals even for as little as] an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk. This [source teaches] that in merit for [our] scrupulousness over the size of an olive-bulk, to consider it a ‎satisfying meal, we merit that the Lord will show favor to us, ‎even though we are unworthy. It follows that those who treat crumbs the size of an olive-bulk with disdain ‎and do not regard them as a satisfying meal will not merit the Lord’s favor, and ‎they inflict harm upon themselves (see the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Re’aya Mehemna Parashat Pineḥas</i>, p. 231, section 600). ‎
[The <i>Zohar</i>] continues: <b>“one who lights the candle</b> etc.” One who lights the candle upon ‎the conclusion of Shabbat before Israel reach the [prayer of] <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i> causes the fire of Gehennom to be kindled with that flame [of the candle]. [This is because] until that time it ‎is Shabbat, and the sanctity of the Shabbat rules over [Gehennom] (as stated below), and the fire of Gehennom does not yet rule, just as on Shabbat. But <b>one who lights the candle before Israel</b> [recites] <b>the <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i></b> is considered like a Shabbat ‎desecrator, for he lights the fire of Gehennom before its time, and thus he inflicts harm upon himself. ‎ <b>“For there is a certain place in Gehennom for those who desecrate <i>Shabbatot</i>,”</b> since desecration of ‎the Shabbat is the most serious [of sins]. Furthermore, <b>“those who are being punished in ‎Gehennom curse” him</b> for what he has caused ‎through his actions, to light the fire of Gehennom before its time. ‎

Paragraph 256

<b>256. “For it is inappropriate, etc.”</b><br><b>For it is inappropriate to light the candle</b> [immediately] <b>when Shabbat concludes, before Israel perform‎ the <i>havdala</i> rite in the prayer</b> ‎<b>and</b> then <b>the <i>havdala</i> over the cup, because until that time it is Shabbat and the sanctity of the ‎Shabbat rules over us. When one performs the <i>havdala</i> over the cup, all those hosts and all those camps ‎appointed over the weekdays return, each and every one of them, to his place and to his service over which he is ‎appointed.</b>
Explanation: The prohibition lasts primarily until the <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i>, as stated [section #254#]. However, one ‎should be careful not to light a candle until after <i>havdala</i>, because it is ‎still considered Shabbat until then. However, it is certainly permitted to light a candle for the purpose of <b><i>havdala</i></b> and [the blessing of] “who creates the lights of fire,” and this is obvious. ‎

Paragraph 257

<b>257. “When Shabbat begins, etc.”</b><br><b>When Shabbat begins and the day is sanctified, holiness is awakened and rules over the world, ‎and the secular is removed from its governance. Until the time ‎when Shabbat concludes, they do not return to their places. Even when Shabbat concludes, they ‎do not return to their places until the Jews declare, in the land of Israel: “Who separates between ‎holy and secular.” Then the holy departs and the camps appointed over the weekdays ‎awaken and return to their places, each and every one to his appointed watch. ‎</b>

Paragraph 258

<b>258. “And yet, etc.”</b><br><b>And yet they do not rule until there are lights from the secret of the light of the candle. They are all ‎called “the lights of fire,” since they all come from the secret of the pillar of fire and from the foundation ‎of the fire, and they rule over the lower world. All of this occurs when a person lights the candle before Israel ‎complete the <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i>.</b>
Explanation: The <i>Malkhut</i> is called “pillar of fire” (as stated in section #209#, above), and these powers in the ‎light of the candle are judgments (as explained in section #252#, sixth paragraph; see there). Accordingly, they do not have the power to activate the [power of] judgments ‎before the candle is lit. ‎

Paragraph 259

<b>259. “However, if one, etc.”</b><br><b>However, if one waits until the <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i> has been completed, those wicked ones in ‎Gehennom accept upon themselves the judgment of the Holy One, blessed be He, and they fulfill for that person all the blessings that the community recites,</b> namely: <b>“May God give you the dew of the heaven”</b> [Genesis 27:28]; <b>“Blessed shall you be in the city, and ‎blessed shall you be in the field”</b> [Deuteronomy 28:3] <b>etc. ‎</b>
Explanation: By reciting <b>the <i>Kedusha De-Sidra</i></b> [people] draw forth a great illumination, through which they are ‎spared from the judgment of Gehennom. When the wicked in Gehennom see this, they regret their evil ‎deeds and accept upon themselves the judgment of the Holy One, blessed be He, [namely, they accept] that they deserve their ‎punishments. Because that man [who they saw] led them to accept the judgment upon themselves and to sanctify the ‎name of Heaven, all those blessings that are recited by the community at the end of Shabbat, in the verses beginning with: <b>“May God give you...</b>” ‎are fulfilled with respect to that person. ‎

Paragraph 260

<b>260. “Happy is he who considers, etc.”</b><br><b>“Happy is he who considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him on the day of evil”</b> [Psalms 41:2]. <b>It should ‎have said: “on the day of evil</b> [<i>ra</i>]”; <b>what is: “on the day of evil</b> [<i>ra’a</i>]”? He explains that this is referring to <b>the day when that evil one</b> [<i>ra’a</i>] <b>rules, to ‎take his soul. “Happy is he who considers the poor”: This</b> poor <b>is one who is dangerously ill.</b> “He ‎who considers” [means] <b>that he heals him from his sins before the Holy One, blessed be He. An alternative explanation: This is the “day” when the judgment presides over the world,</b> and he considers how <b>to be spared from it, as it is stated: “The Lord will deliver him on the day of evil,”</b> meaning that on <b>the day when the judgment was given to that evil</b> [<i>ra’a</i>], <b>to rule over the ‎world, the Lord will save him. ‎</b>
Explanation: The difficulty he raises is as follows: It should have written: “The Lord will deliver him on the day of evil [<i>ra</i>, in the masculine form].” Why does it say, “on the day of evil [<i>ra’a</i>],” which is in the feminine [form]? Rather, the verse is alluding to the rule of the ‎<i>kelippa</i>, called <i>ra’a</i>, which takes a person’s soul. [The phrase] “he who considers the poor” means that one speaks to the sick that he should repent. Thus, the Holy One, blessed be He, delivers him from the ‎rule of the ‎<i>kelippa</i>, which is called <i>ra’a</i>.
The <i>Zohar</i> mentions this here in relation to its earlier statement that there are three who inflict harm upon themselves [section #254#]. It therefore offers ‎advice in this regard here, that one should <b>consider the poor,</b> namely, speak to the heart of the sick, so that he will repent, and <b>the Lord will heal him.</b> In ‎reward, “the Lord will deliver him on the day of evil,” which he caused to his own soul. ‎ <b>“An alternative explanation: This is the day when the judgment presides over the world,</b> and he considers how <b>to be spared from it.”</b> Even if the day of judgment presides over the world, <b>“the Lord will deliver him”</b> in ‎reward for considering the sick and leading him to repent. For <b>“the day of evil”</b> is <b>“the day when the judgment was given to that evil,</b> called <i>ra’a</i>, <b>to rule over the ‎world.”</b> Yet, regarding that one who ‎considered the sick, to cause him to repent, <b>the Lord will deliver him from that evil. ‎</b> The difference between the two interpretations is that the first refers only to ‎an individual who has inflicted harm upon himself, whereas the second interpretation also applies to that evil that has been decreed upon ‎the entire world. Even then, <b>the Lord will deliver him</b> in merit of that commandment. ‎

Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3

The letter Tav entered and said before Him: "Is it Your will to create the world with me?" The Holy One, Blessed be He, replied: "No, because through you, many righteous people are destined to die." As it is written: "And I will put the mark of the letter Tav on the foreheads of the men" (Ezekiel 9:4). And we were taught that it is written "and from My sanctified ones, it will begin" (Isaiah 10:12), it is not read "from My sanctifiers", but rather "from My sanctified ones", who are the righteous (as stated in Tractate Shabbat, folio 55, etc.). And therefore, the world will not be created with you.

Paragraph 4

The three letters Shim, Kuf, and Reish entered, etc.: The three letters, Shim, Kuf, and Reish, came, each one on its own. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: "Are you not worthy that the world be created with you?" Because you letters are called "falsehood", and falsehood is not fitting to stand before Me, and I have already explained it.

Paragraph 5

And the letters Pe, Alef, Tzadi, etc. ascended: And the letters Pe, Alef, Tzadi, and so on, came, until the letters reached the letter Kaf, because when the letter Kaf descended from the crown, the upper and lower worlds trembled, until everything was established in the letter Bet, which is the sign of blessing, and in it the world was perfected and created. And you will find the explanation of this matter earlier (in the introduction to the book Zohar, folio 25, lines 22 to 39, in HaSulam, etc.).

Paragraph 6

And if you would say that Aleph, etc.: And if you would say that the letter Alef is the head of all the letters, and that the world should have been created with it. And it is answered, so it is, but because it is called "cursed" with it, the world was not created with it. For this reason, despite the fact that the letter Aleph is a superior and secret letter, it was not given a place, that is, power and strength, to the other side, called "cursed". Therefore, the world was not created with it, and the world was perfected with the letter Bet, and with it was created.

Paragraph 7

"You are our father!", because this world, which is the Point of Zeir Anpin, called "you", was perfected and created in this level, namely, in the sign of blessing, as mentioned earlier that the world was created and perfected in the letter Beth, because it is the sign of blessing, and also man was created in it, in the level of the sign of blessing, and came out into the world. Therefore, the Point is considered from this aspect as the root of man, and we say to it: "You are our father!", that is, You are our root! And what is said that man was also created in the sign of blessing, will be explained later (on page 3, under the title "And with this").

Paragraph 8

For Abraham did not know us: because although the world is sustained through him, which is Chesed, as it is written, "The world is built with kindness", he did not strive for us as he strove for Ishmael, when he said: "May Ishmael live before you". And Israel did not recognize us: because all the blessings that he was supposed to give to his sons, he left for this level, which is the Nukva, to bless them all. That is, as it is written, "And this is the blessing that their father gave them", which means that the Nukva, called "this", spoke for them, that is, for their benefit, their father, to bless them. And so too in the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh, he said: "The angel who redeems me from all evil", which is the Nukva, "bless the lads", etc.

Paragraph 9

You, HaShem, are our father: that is, the Point, as mentioned above, for you are always over us, to bless us and take care of us, like a father who takes care of his children in all that they need. You are our redeemer from the world, your name: for you, that is, the Point, are the redeemer, as he is called, the redeeming angel, and this is our redeemer from the world, your name. Your name is true, which is the Point, called YHVH. We learn that there is no interruption between redemption and prayer, that is, between the blessing "Redeemer of Israel" and the prayer of eighteen blessings, just as there is no interruption between the blessing of the prayer of the hand and the blessing of the prayer of the head. And I have already explained this.And it is found that for this reason, Abraham did not know us.
Explanation of the article: Because it was objected to in the scripture, “And Judah came near to him,” which is apparently unnecessary, since it would have been sufficient to say, “And Judah said to him: My lord!” And Rabbi Elazar began to explain this with the scripture, “For you are our father,” etc. And he first proves that man and the Point of Zeir Anpin are on the same level, meaning on the level of the mercies that are revealed in the illumination of wisdom, since man was created with the name “Arech Apim,” meaning he is patient and does not get angry, so that man can receive the three radical letters of the illumination of wisdom. And so also the world, which is the Point of Zeir Anpin, was created with the letter Bet, meaning a point in its palace, which is the sign of blessing, meaning the beginning of the revelation of the intelligences of the three radical letters of the illumination of wisdom. As mentioned above (Genesis 1, folio 129, line 139 and 140), the Aleph letter of Mercy is "Chayot Temirin," meaning mercies covered with wisdom, and the Bet letter of Mercy is "Chayot Deitgaliin," meaning mercies that are revealed in the illumination of wisdom.
And with this, the verse explains that Israel said to the Point of Zeir Anpin, which is called "you," because you are our father, since you, that is, the Point, are the source of our life and our sustenance in everything we need. You are our redeemer from the world, your name, because you are the redeemer, etc.
For Abraham did not know us, since he did not strive for us, as he strived for Ishmael, who said, "May Ishmael live before you," because Ishmael is circumcised but has not revealed his evil inclination, that he does not continue with the good inclination of wisdom, which is called HaShem, and his circumcision is in emptiness, that is, in the emptiness of wisdom.
And because it is necessary for wisdom, because he is from the part of appearance and below, and does not have, therefore he is considered as waste from the right hand.
However, Abraham is mercy from the right hand, who understands that he does not need wisdom, and therefore he is hidden from wisdom, secretly, because he is an object of mercy, and therefore he prayed more for the mercies that are hidden from wisdom , because towards them is all his desire and longing.
And this explains why he said, "May Ishmael live before you," and he did not say this way about Isaac.
And it is found that for this reason, Abraham did not know us.
Because the understanding of him is not revealed to us. And Israel does not know him, because Israel is the middle line that appears and is above Zeir Anpin, where is the secret of the world that is hidden from the illumination of wisdom, and therefore all the blessings that are needed to bless his children, are directed to this level, that is, to the Point, so that he blesses them, because his children are from the part of appearance and below, which is the world that is revealed in the illumination of wisdom.
And since he is only from the part of the hidden mercies, he could not bless them, and therefore he left the blessing of them to the Point, which is the world that is revealed, and which will bless them.
For Israel does not know our needs to fill them. Therefore, they said to the Point: "You, HaShem, are our father," because you are our redeemer from the world, your name, because you are the redeemer, etc., because redemption can only be achieved through the illumination of wisdom .
And therefore, the Point is called "the redeeming angel" in relation to the children of Israel, and also the foundation of Zeir Anpin, called Joseph, is called redeemer in relation to the Point, because he transmits the illumination of wisdom to the Point .
And this explains why there is no interruption between redemption and prayer, that is, between the foundation and the Point, because we need to unite them. And it also explains why there is no interruption between the prayer of the hand, which is the Point, and the prayer of the head, which is Zeir Anpin.
And with this, the explanation of the verse “And Judah came near to him” is opened to us, because Judah is the Point, meaning the prayer, and Joseph is the redemption, as mentioned above. And the verse tells us that they came close to each other to unite, until Joseph could not contain himself any longer and revealed his identity. And he revealed the illumination of wisdom to his brothers.

Paragraph 10

Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Yehudah, etc.: Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Yehudah were sitting one night and studying the Torah. Rabbi Yitzchak said to Rabbi Yehudah: "We have already learned that when the Holy One, Blessed Be He, created the world, He made the lower world similar to the upper world, and made everything correspond, so that every part and detail in the lower world has its corresponding root in the upper world, and it is His honor above and below".

Paragraph 11

Rabbi Yehudah said, etc.: Rabbi Yitzchak, this is certainly so, and He created man above all, because he includes and completes all the details of creation, and this is what is said: "I made the earth and the man upon it I created", "I made the earth", this is certain and does not need to be said. But He tells us, what is the reason I made the earth? Because I created man upon it, because he is the sustainer of the world, and that everything should be a single perfection. In other words, that the purpose of the entire world and its perfection is man.

Paragraph 12

He began and said: "Thus said God, etc.": I have already explained this verse. But "Thus said God, HaShem, Creator of the heavens and who stretches them out". This is the Holy One, Blessed Be He, above and above, that is, the understanding, which is the Creator of the heavens, which is Zeir Anpin, which the understanding always corrects and improves. In other words, that it inspires him and transmits intelligence to him. "The one who makes the earth and its offspring tremble", this is the Holy Land, the treasure of life, that is, the Point. "The one who gives soul to the people upon it", the earth, which is the Point, gives soul.

Paragraph 13

Rabbi Yitzchak said, etc.: Rabbi Yitzchak, all of this is above, that is, in the understanding, and he disagrees with Rabbi Yehudah, who said that "the one who gives soul to the people" refers to the Point, because from there, from the understanding, the living soul comes out to this land, which is the Point. And this land receives the soul in order to give to each one, because the river that flows and comes out, which is Zeir Anpin, receives from the understanding and gives and introduces souls into this land, which is the Point, and it receives and gives to each person who merits it.

Paragraph 1

Y estos son los nombres de los hijos de Israel, etc.: Le fue difícil, que la escritura comienza con Israel y termina con Jacob, y también, ¿cuál es el asunto del exilio en Egipto en la interioridad? Y sobre esto trae la escritura, "Y los que entienden, entenderán", etc., que con la explicación de esta escritura, se aclararán las preguntas mencionadas anteriormente.
Y los que entienden, entenderán como el resplandor del firmamento, etc.: Y los que entienden, son aquellos que se ocupan del secreto de la sabiduría, es decir, aquellos que han alcanzado el secreto de la sabiduría, porque la sabiduría se llama la luz de los ojos, y su comprensión se llama la contemplación. Entenderán, se le dificultó, ¿por qué no está escrito "iluminarán"? Y dice, que su significado es que brillan y resplandecen con el resplandor de la sabiduría superior. Porque ellos no pueden alcanzar la esencia de la sabiduría superior, sino solo desde la Biná que ha vuelto a ser sabiduría, mediante su retorno a la cabeza de Arich Anpin, que se considera solo como el resplandor de la sabiduría superior, que se examina solo como Zohar, y no como la esencia de la luz de la sabiduría. Y por lo tanto, se dice "entenderán", y no se dice "iluminarán". Como el resplandor, su significado es la iluminación y el resplandor del río que sale del Edén, que es la Biná mencionada anteriormente, que salió de la cabeza de Arich Anpin, que es la sabiduría llamada Edén (como se menciona en la Hakdamat HaZohar, folio 15, y el asunto es así), que en su retorno a la cabeza de Arich Anpin se convirtió en sabiduría (como se menciona allí, en el folio 16, y todo el resto), y esta sabiduría que en ella se examina solo como el resplandor de la sabiduría, como se mencionó anteriormente, y por lo tanto, se dice sobre ella "como el resplandor", que es un término de resplandor, como se mencionó anteriormente.
Y ciertamente, esto es un secreto, etc.: Y esto es el secreto del velo llamado firmamento, que es el velo del tzimtzum que saca a Biná afuera de la cabeza de Arich Anpin, mediante su ascenso a su lugar, y también la devuelve a la cabeza de Arich Anpin mediante su retorno abajo al lugar del Malkut de la cabeza de Arich Anpin (como se menciona en la Hakdamat HaZohar, folio 16, y todo el resto). Y así, como el resplandor del firmamento, es decir, las vasijas y las inteligencias que se revelan mediante el firmamento, porque en él se encuentran los planetas, que son las tres líneas de las inteligencias, y los signos del zodíaco, que son las seis direcciones de las inteligencias, el sol, que es Zeir Ainpin, y la luna, que es la Nukva, y todos estos son las luces que iluminan, que son todas las luces en el Bei'a, porque todas las luces en los cuatro mundos de ABiYA salen del velo del tzimtzum llamado firmamento. (Ver arriba, en Bereshit, folio 7, y todo el resto).

Paragraph 2

Zohar de este firmamento, etc.: El resplandor de este firmamento ilumina con su luz sobre el jardín, que es Malkut, y el árbol de la vida, que es Tiferet, se encuentra en el centro del jardín, es decir, en la línea media, y sus ramas, es decir, sus sefirot, cubren todas las formas que son las almas, y los árboles, que son los espíritus, y en los cielos, que son las neshamot, que están en el jardín, en vasijas rectas, es decir, que están rectificadas en las tres líneas, derecha, izquierda y media. Y bajo su sombra se reúnen todos los animales del campo, que son los ángeles externos. Y todos los pájaros del cielo, es decir, los ángeles internos, se sientan bajo sus ramas.

Paragraph 3

Zohar Iba de Ilana, etc.: El resplandor de los frutos del árbol, que son las almas que nacen de él, da vida a todos. Su existencia es para siempre y para siempre jamás. El lado opuesto de la impureza no gobierna en él, es decir, que no hay absolutamente ninguna influencia de la impureza en el árbol de la vida, que es Zeir Ainpin en Gadlut, sino solo el lado de la santidad. Felices son su porción los que prueban de él, que viven para siempre y para siempre jamás. Como se dice, "y tomó también del árbol de la vida y comió y vivió para siempre". Ellos se llaman "mishakilim" (los que entienden), y merecen la vida en este mundo y en el mundo venidero.

Paragraph 4

Zohar Ilana about this, etc.: The radiance of this tree, which is Zeir Ainpin, rises upward to YESHUT and upward to ABA ve IMA. When it rises to YESHUT, which is Bina, its five hundred measures of height are because it receives HGT NH"Y from Bina, whose sefirot are in the secret of the hundred. But it has no foundation, because IMA expands to Hod. And when it rises to ABA ve IMA, which shines with the ancient light, it expands by sixty myriads, because the foundation expands in it and it receives HGT NH"Y from the ancient light, whose sefirot each is one hundred thousand. And therefore, in this tree, there is a light that is Malkut in its body, in which are all the colors, white, red, and green, which are the lights of HGT. These colors rise in direct light and fall in reflected light and are not set anywhere else except on this tree. Because it is the middle line.

Paragraph 5

When they come out of it, etc.: When the lights come out of it, from the tree, to appear in the non-illuminating radiance, which is Malkut which includes, that from the aspect of Mahazeh and below Zeir Ainpin, in which itself there are ZON, which are the small ZON called Yaacov and Rachel. The lights sometimes settle and sometimes do not settle in it, they are found and they are not found, because they are not established anywhere else except in this tree, which is from the aspect of Mahazeh and above Zeir Ainpin, called Israel. From this tree come out the twelve tribes whose boundaries are in it, which are the twelve lights called twelve diagonal boundaries, which are clearly explained above (see folio 8, and in Parashat Vayechi, folio 46, and all the rest). And they descended in this non-illuminating radiance, to the exile in Egypt in various upper camps. This is what is said, “And these are the names,” etc.
For now it is well understood, that the scripture begins with Israel, that is, "And these are the names of the sons of Israel," because it is that the root of the lights of the twelve tribes come from the tree called Israel, that is, from Mahazeh and above Zeir Ainpin. And so also that which ends with Yaacov, which says, "Those who came from Egypt with Yaacov," because they passed from the aspect of Israel to the aspect of Yaacov, which is from Mahazeh and below Zeir Ainpin, where the twelve lights of the tribes cannot be established, as was said above. And this is "Those who came from Egypt," which is a language of narrowness, and therefore the Egyptians dominated over them. (And see further on, folio 148, and all the rest), where the very reason for the necessity of the exile in Egypt is explained.

Paragraph 7



Paragraph 8

What is the reason for “because,” etc.: It is asked, what is the reason? The answer is, because the world stands in His Holy Name. This is what is written, “For in Him was the rock of the worlds created.” Meaning, the Creator of the worlds, for with two letters the worlds were created, this world and the world to come. This world was created with judgment, and it stands, that is, it is sustained, with judgment. As it is written, “In the beginning Elokim created,” where this name refers to judgment. What is the reason? It is so that the sons of men may behave according to judgment, and not stray from the path.

Paragraph 9

Come and see, it is written, etc.: Come and see, it is written, “And Elokim spoke to Moses.” The name Elokim refers to the severity of judgment that is sustained in Him. What is written above?, “And Moses approached HaShem and said, Adonai.” With the name Adonai, which is the name of royalty. Look at the strength of Moses, who from the beginning of his prophecy did not calm down in this place, which is royalty, and said, “Adonai, why have you done evil to this people? Why have you sent me?” and since I came to speak in your name, evil has not ceased, and you have not saved your people. Who can say such a thing, but Moses, who knew that there was a higher level than royalty, which was for him, because he was the vehicle of Zeir Ainpin, who is the husband of the Matronite?

Paragraph 10

Rabbi Yitzchak said, etc.: In the beginning, when he was given the house, which is Malchut, since he was the vehicle of Zeir Ainpin, who is the husband of Malchut, it turned out that he merited the level of Malchut to be his house, as is the house of Zeir Ainpin. Therefore, he took care of it, as a man takes care of his house, and says whatever he wants without fear. Moses also did the same; to his house, which is Malchut, he was not afraid.

Paragraph 11

Another explanation, “And Elokim spoke”: It is the severity of judgment, because the name Elokim is judgment, meaning Malchut, and she said to him, “I am HaShem,” which is another level, meaning Zeir Ainpin, which is mercy, and here all things are united, judgment and mercy together, which is great perfection. This is what is written, “And he said to him, I am HaShem,” which is the measure of mercy. Rabbi Shimon said, if it were written, “And Elokim spoke to Moses, I am HaShem,” it would have said that judgment and mercy are united together for him. But it is not written like that, but rather, “And Elokim spoke to Moses” at the beginning, and then, “And he said to him, I am HaShem,” meaning that they are of a different level than the other, and they are not judgment and mercy united together.

Paragraph 12

And Rabbi Yosi said, etc.: And the Ari, Moses, had he not been the master of the house, as it is written about him, “Prayer of Moses, man of Elokim,” would have been punished for what he said to ADNI, “Why have you done wrong to this people?” etc. But because he was the master of the house, he was not punished. Similar to a man who had a dispute with his wife, who was a king’s daughter, and said things to her that were not appropriate, she began to get angry, and when she began to speak, the king intervened and she became silent and stopped speaking. The king said to her husband, “Did you not know that I am a king and that you should not have spoken like that before?” Something similar happened with Moses, as it is written, “And Moses approached HaShem and said, ADNI, why have you done wrong?” etc. Immediately, "And Elokim spoke to Moses," which is the measure of judgment, because the king's daughter began to get angry, immediately the king intervened and said, "I am HaShem," did you not know that I am a king and that you should not have spoken like that before?

Paragraph 13

And I appeared to Abraham, etc., in El Shadai: It is asked, why did the name change here, from the upper names which are ADNI, HaShem, Elokim, and here it said El Shadai? And it is answered, it is similar to a king who had an unmarried daughter and a friend. When the king wanted to speak to his friend, he would send his daughter to speak to him, and the king would speak to him through his daughter. The time came when his daughter got married. On the day of her wedding, the king said, "Call her METAT honorable." And he said to her, "Until now I have spoken through you to those with whom I have spoken, but from now on, I will tell your husband, and he will tell whomever it may concern." Afterward, her husband spoke controversial words to her before the king, until she began to speak, and the king spoke up, and said to her, "Am I not the king, that to this day no man has spoken to me except through my daughter, and I gave you my daughter, and spoke to you openly, which I have not done with any other man?"

Paragraph 14

Thus, “And I appeared to,” etc., in El Shadai: which is the name of Malchut, before she joined with Zeir Ainpin face to face. And its explanation is, “And I appeared to the patriarchs in El Shadai, which is Malchut, when I was in my house and I was not married, and I did not speak to you face to face as I did with you, and you at the beginning of your speech, you said to my daughter things like that in my presence.” That is why it is written, “And I appeared to Abraham, to Yitzchak, and to Yaakov in El Shadai, and my name HaShem was not known to them,” meaning to speak to them on this level that I spoke to you.

Paragraph 15

Rabbi Yosi opened, etc.: Rabbi Yosi, “A Psalm of David, HaShem is the owner of the earth and its fullness, the world and its inhabitants.” This land is the Holy Land of Israel, which is destined to be watered by Him, by HaShem, and to be blessed by Him from the beginning, and after that, the entire world will be watered by it. “The world and its inhabitants,” this is the rest of the lands, which drink from Him. Where do we get this from? For it is written, “And He will judge the world in righteousness.”

Paragraph 1

And he spoke, etc., and they took for me an offering, etc.: Rabbi Chaya began, for Jacob chose for Himself, HaShem, the jewel of Israel. How beloved are the children of Israel before the Holy One, Blessed be He! Who desired in them and desired to unite with them and connect with them, and made them a unique people in the world, as it is written: "And who is like your people, Israel, a unique nation on earth?" And they desired in Him and connected with Him. This is what is said: "For Jacob chose for Himself HaShem," and it is written: "For HaShem has a portion with them." And He gave to the other nations princes to rule over them, and He took for His portion Israel.

Paragraph 2

Rabbi Shimon began: “Who is this who appears like the dawn, beautiful?” Who is this? It is the secret of the two worlds that unite together, and this is the world and the world. That is, this is what is written: “From the world to the world,” which are Bina and Malchut. “Who is it?” behold, we have established that it is a higher degree, the beginning that remains in the question, and it is called “Who is it?” which is Bina, as it is mentioned: “Lift up your eyes on high and see who created this.” (As mentioned above in the Hakdamat HaZohar, folio 8, in the part of “Leila”) “This” is a lower degree, it is the lower world, which is Malchut. And both are two worlds in one union, in one bond, together. And this is through the elevation of Malchut to Bina, because by this she attained the intelligence of Bina. As it is mentioned there.

Paragraph 3

She who appears, when they unite, etc.: She who appears, meaning when both of them unite as one, Malchut appears like the dawn, meaning when the dawn wants to shine, and then she is beautiful like the moon, Malchut shines like the moon, because the light of the sun, which is Zeir Anpin, shines in her. And then, she shines like the sun, like the light of the sun, when the moon is full, meaning when Malchut is face to face with Zeir Anpin, called the sun. Her beauty is like that of a cloud, because she is strong to protect everything, because then she has perfection and strength to do exploits.

Paragraph 4

And Malchut receives strength from the upper world, etc.: And Malchut receives strength, meaning Mochin, from the upper world, which is Bina, through Yaacov, a perfect man, who united both, because through the elevation of MAN, Malchut rose to Bina, and they united with each other. He united both above, because Bina received the form of Malchut, and this is Leah. And he united both below, because Malchut acquired the form of Bina, and this is Rachel. And from there came the 12 holy tribes, similar to those above. That is, like the 12 perspectives that are in Malchut above. Yaacov, who was perfect, brought love to both worlds, as We have established, because he married the two sisters, Leah and Rachel, who are Bina and Malchut, two worlds. The other sons of Adam who do this, reveal nakedness above and below, and cause hatred in the two worlds, and cause separation between Zeir Anpin and Leah, and between Zeir Anpin and Rachel, because the union above is with Leah, and the union below is with Rachel. This is what is said: "You shall not take a wife together with her sister for rivalry." They became rivals and filled with hatred towards each other.

Paragraph 5

Y si dijeras, ¿y se enojó Raquel con su hermana?: Y si dijeras, ¿cuál es el significado de "y se enojó Raquel con su hermana"? Si la escritura habla de los dos mundos, Leá y Raquel, que son la perspectiva de Biná y Maljut, que están incluidas juntas, ¿qué tipo de celos hay aquí? Y responde, así es ciertamente, porque el mundo inferior, Raquel, todo su deseo no es más que ser como el mundo superior, Leá, que es Biná, y heredar su lugar. En otro lugar, hay celos de los sabios, "aquel que aumenta la sabiduría, aumenta el dolor" (Bava Batra 21a), y aquí también hay celos de los sabios, porque hay un libro y otro libro, que son ABA y IMA, de los cuales se extrae la sabiduría, y por lo tanto, a través de los celos de estos sabios, aumentan la extracción de la sabiduría en ellos.

Paragraph 6

And so it is, even Yaacov, etc.: And despite everything, even Yaacov did not complete them properly, the other children of the world cause hatred and separation, and they reveal the nakedness above and below. For in this secret there is a secret of nakedness, meaning the nakedness of the mother and the daughter, who are Bina and Malchut, and everything, they are two sisters and also mother and daughter, it is one secret, because they are called sisters because they are in sisterhood, love, and union of desire. And they are also called mother and daughter, because Bina is called mother and Malchut her daughter. Whoever reveals their nakedness, meaning the judgments that are in them, has no part in the next world, which is Bina, and has no part in faith, which is Malchut.

Paragraph 7



Paragraph 8

Rabbi Shimon said: Behold, we have learned that when the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world, which is Malchut, He engraved in its engravings the secret of faith, which is Malchut, within the lights that are the secret of the upper ones, meaning that the Holy One, Blessed be He, which is Bina, elevated to Himself the faith, which is Malchut, and engraved with the engravings of faith within the lights of His own upper essence, from which Bina and the TuM of Bina came out and descended to the level below her, and there remained in Bina only the crown and the wisdom of the vessels in the lights of the wind nefesh, that this is examined as an engraving in the lights of Him. And He engraved above, in Bina, and He engraved below, in Malchut, meaning that afterwards Malchut also received that mentioned engraving that was made in Bina. And everything is one secret, because the recording of Malchut was in a single form with the recording of Bina, in the secret of the recordings of the Holy Name, which governs with His letters above and below, meaning in Bina and Malchut, which are HaShem the first and HaShem the last of the Name, which are both one single form, which is HaShem. And in this secret, the worlds were perfected, the upper world, which is Bina, and the lower world, which is Malchut.

Paragraph 9



Paragraph 10

And this light, which is very subtle, closed due to lack of mercy, was maintained and perfected in him by the middle line, the six extensions, which are the six letters of wisdom, which are not known, that is, they are not revealed to illuminate, except when the thin light of ABA and IMA is hidden, because then the very subtle light illuminates with its illumination. Explanation: Because the illumination of wisdom does not illuminate except at the point of the Shuruk at the time of the elevation of the three points, Holam, Shuruk and Hirik, one after the other, (as explained in Shlach, 39, "VeG") and at the moment when it illuminates the point of the Shuruk, the light of mercy of ABA and IMA is closed, (as explained above in Bereshit, 13, "UveTeda", and see in the introduction to the Book of Zohar, folio 17, "Kayema") it is found that the very subtle light illuminates only at the time of the concealment of the thin light.

Paragraph 11



Paragraph 12



Paragraph 13

Los demás hijos del mundo, etc.: Los demás hijos del mundo, excepto Yaacov, no se les dio permiso para ascender así a la comprensión para unirse con YH como Yaacov, sino solo a su característica, que es el lugar que recibe y reúne todo, y esta es la categoría de abajo, es decir, Malchut, y de dentro de Malchut reciben la iluminación de la misericordia de arriba en la comprensión, que es la categoría de Lea, en el cierre de la voluntad. Pero no abiertamente como toma Yaacov, como está escrito "y tomarán para mí una ofrenda". Explicación: porque Yaacov ascendió y se unió con YH mismo y recibe de allí la iluminación de la misericordia que está en la comprensión, que es la unión de Yaacov y Lea. Y por lo tanto, los demás hijos del mundo están prohibidos de tener relaciones con las dos hermanas, porque en ellas hay algo de revelar la desnudez, para ser conductores de la iluminación de la comprensión, que es Lea, en lugar de Malchut que es Raquel. Pero Yaacov, que ascendió a lo alto en el lugar de la comprensión misma, se le permitió esto, incluso en vida de su hermana Raquel. Y como está escrito "y tomarán para mí una ofrenda". Es decir, que todos los demás hijos del mundo tomarán y elevarán a Malchut, y no se casarán con las dos hermanas, porque entonces las profanarían, revelando la desnudez, es decir, los juicios, y es porque ellos mismos son del lugar de Malchut, que es el lugar de los juicios.


Paragraph 14

And they shall take for Me an offering: Rabbi Yehuda began, "What is Your great goodness that You have concealed from those who fear You, and have done for those who take refuge in You?" (Psalms 31:20). This verse they established and learned, but this secret was established by the Holy Light within the secrets of the upper ones.

<b>But the name of Isaiah, etc.:</b> But Isaiah, the name, which are the letters [of] <b><i>yesha Yahu</i> [the Lord will save]</b>, causes salvation and the bringing back of the supernal light to its place, to Kingship [<i>Malkhut</i>], and the building of the Temple, and that all of the lights will return as at the beginning. And therefore, the names of these two prophets stood one against the other; the name of one being<b><i>yarum Yahu</i></b> [the Lord will go away], and the name of the other being the opposite <b><i>yesha Yahu</i></b>. And the combination of these letters and those letters cause an event according to their meaning, whether for the good or for the bad. And based on this secret — being the combination of the letters of holy names, and also the letters on their own — they cause the occurrence of supernal secrets according to the meaning of the name. For the letters themselves cause supernal holy secrets to occur though them.

<b>They hang below Your crown, etc.</b> Below the crown, golden bells hang all around, a golden bell on this side, and a golden bell on that side, and one pomegranate in the middle. That pomegranate has a thousand bells, and each of those bells blazes in red and in white. That pomegranate is divided into four sections and stays open, so that the bells in it are visible. There are 325 bells on this side, and likewise with all of the sides, such that they light up the four sides of the world from the vision of each and every sections. And they are called the pomegranate split open, as it is written (Song of Songs 4:3), "your brow behind your veil [gleams] like a pomegranate split open."
The explanation: Now the aspect of the end of the crown of Kingship (<i>Malkhut</i>) is understood, meaning the aspect of the vessels of its back. And you already know that when Wisdom (<i>Chokhmah</i>) is face to face with the Small Face (<i>Zeir Anpin</i>) it is only revealed by the vessels of its back (as mentioned earlier in the Introduction to the Book of the Zohar, p. 6, s.v. VeIlmaleh). And the aggregate of the vessels of the back is called pomegranate, by way of the secret of what they said about the verse, "your brow (<i>rakatekh</i>) is like a pomegranate split open": That even the empty ones (<i>rekanim</i>) among you - meaning the vessels of the back that are judged to be empty in comparison with the vessels of the front - are filled with commandments like a pomegranate, which is full of lights. And this is at the time that they connect with the vessels of the front and hang from them. For they then also receive the enlightenment of the three columns from the vessels of the front; and then the enlightenment divides into right and left and to the secret of the twelve, called bells. And the aggregate of the bells is called pomegranate, since its enlightenment ascends from the bottom to the top.
