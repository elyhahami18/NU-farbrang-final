Beur HaGra on Sifra DeTzniuta





Chapter 1

Tana, etc... B'mitkala: This is like an introduction, similar to the openings of other works, such as 'The Proverbs of Solomon, etc.' until 'The fear of the Lord' (Proverbs 1:7) — an introduction to the Proverbs, stating what the book is about. And so it is with all books. The five words until 'B'mitkala' correspond to the five chapters of this book, which in turn correspond to the five books of the Torah. These align with the five 'Partzufim' (configurations) that encompass all of the Atzilut (the highest realm of emanation in Kabbalah), the five worlds that encompass all the universes — Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah, Asiyah (ABiYA) and Adam Kadmon. They also correspond to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton (YHVH) with the tip of the Yud (י).
Sifra (Book): A book is the revelation of thought, as thought is concealed within a person and is only revealed through speech or writing. Similarly, the Infinite (Ein Sof) revealed itself and created the world for the purpose of revelation and to be known, as stated in the Zohar. These are also the [spiritual] rectifications, through both of these methods, as explained in the Sefer Yetzirah: He created His world through 'book, scribe, and story' (sefer, sofer, sippur). The distinction between the two (book and story) is as follows: In speech, thought is revealed immediately, in one instance. However, with a book, the revelation occurs in two stages. First, when the person writes, the thought is revealed to the world, but the book itself remains concealed (its content is hidden). Second, when the book is read, its full meaning is revealed. In contrast, speech encompasses both aspects at once — thought is expressed and revealed simultaneously.
