Daf 5b









The tenth level in the fear of God. There is fear and there is fear. Not all presences are the same. There is fear that a person trembles so that the Holy One of Blessing will not hit that person with a leather strap. Of this fear it is said

Daf 6a

"and the earth was uninformed and void" (Gen. 1:2) - [this fear comes] from the side of the tree of good and evil, and this is the empty land, the bad maidservant, similar to the four basic examples of damages, one of which is the pit, similar to the pit [bor] of Yosef, which is the Pit. "And the pit was empty, there is no water in it" (Gen. 37:24). The bad maidservant is the pit, and "the pit" is the male, and we tech regarding this "a boor [bor] cannot fear sin" (Avot 2:5), this is because this boor has no [true] fear of God.
A person who trembles because of Torah, which is Balance, then Torah comes out from that person, one such has a Higher Balance, and because of this not all fears are the same. There is fear of God which comes due to God's Kingship, which includes all the mitzvot of the Torah, because there is fear that comes because of Torah, which is the middle pillar, and this is [the name] Havay"ah. In that way the masters of the Mishnah said: "Torah is great because it leads to action" (cf. Kiddushin 40b), because if a person does not know Torah, and the reward for the mitzvot, and the punishments for the transgressions, and who created Torah and who gave it to Israel, how will that person actually fear and observe the mitzvot? And in that vein David said to Shlomo his son "know the God of your father and serve God." (I Chron. 28:9)
Because if a person does not recognize who is the One who gave Torah to that person, and what the person is supposed to observe, how would the person fear and observe the mitzvot? And regarding this the rabbis said: an ignorant cannot be pious, and a boor cannot fear sin (Avot 2:5).

(Gen. 1:1) <em><b>In the beginning, ELQYM created... etc.</b></em>
<b>It is written</b>: (Dan. 12:3) <em>The wise shall radiate</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>yazhiru</em></i>, <br><em>like the radiance</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>zohar</em></i> <em>of the firmament</em>... <em>etc.</em>
These are Rabbi Shim’on ben Yoḥai and his companions: <br>Rabbi El’azar his son, <br>and Rabbi Abba, <br>and Rabbi Yosse, and Rabbi Ḥiya, and Rabbi Yitzḥaq, <br>and the rest of the companions, <br>who radiate radiance<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="3" data-order="3"></i> [Var. who are radiating] above, <br>... <em>like the radiance of the firmament</em>.
What is meant by ‘<em>like the radiance</em>’? <br>But when they made this composition, <br>it was agreed to on high, <br>and they called it <em>The Book of Radiance</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>Sepher ha-Zohar</em></i>.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="4" data-order="4"></i>
(ibid.) ... <em>and those who bring the many to righteousness</em> – through it, <br>may they be many!
(ibid.) ... <em>like the stars forever</em> – that their light never be darkened, <br>for ever and ever and ever.
At that time, <br>when this composition<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="5" data-order="5"></i> was composed, <br>permission was granted to Elijah to acquiesce with them in it, <br>and to all the Masters of the Academy above and below, <br>and all the forces of the higher angels, and higher souls, <br>to be with them in agreement and friendship as one.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="6" data-order="6"></i>

You are He that has produced ten ‘constructs’<sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>tiqqunin</em></i><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="15" data-order="15"></i> <br>– and we call them ‘the ten <em>sephirot </em>’<sup class="footnote-marker">i</sup><i class="footnote">See <em>Bemidbar Rabbah</em> 14:11 and <em>Sepher Yetzirah</em> 1:2</i><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="16" data-order="16"></i> – <br>with which to direct<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="17" data-order="17"></i> hidden worlds<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="18" data-order="18"></i> that are not revealed, <br>and worlds that are revealed. <br>And in them You are concealed [Var. it is concealed], <br>from humans.
And You are He that binds them, <br>and unites them, <br>and, because You are within <span class="mediumGrey">them</span>, <br>anyone who separates one from its companion, of these ten, <br>is considered as though he had caused separation in You.
And these ten <em>sephirot</em>, <br>they are going according to their order: <br>one long, and one short, and one intermediate.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="19" data-order="19"></i>
And You are He that directs them, <br>and there is none who direct You, <br>– not above, and not below, <br>and not from any side.

It is the watering of the tree, <br>with its arms and its branches, [Var. and its faces] <br>like water, which irrigates a tree, <br>and it grows through that watering.

Daf 17b

And outside of You, there is no uniqueness<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="44" data-order="44"></i> [Var. unity] <br>among the higher and the lower, <br>and You are known <span class="mediumGrey">as</span> ‘Lord over All’.

You are ‘wise’, <br>but not with any specific ‘wisdom’.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="49" data-order="49"></i> <br>You are He that ‘understands’, <br>but not from any specific ‘understanding’. <br>You have no specific ‘place’,<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="50" data-order="50"></i> <br>other than to make known Your strength and Your power <br>to humans, <br>and to show them how the world is governed, <br>– through judgement and through mercy, <br>which are ‘righteousness and justice’ – <br>according to the deeds of people.
‘Judgement’ is Gevurah, <br>Justice is ‘the Middle Pillar’<sup class="footnote-marker">☉</sup><i class="footnote">Tipheret</i>, <br>Righteousness<sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>tzedeq</em></i> is ‘the holy kingdom’<sup class="footnote-marker">☉</sup><i class="footnote">Malkhut</i>, <br>(Lev. 19:36) <em>Scales of righteousness... </em>– ‘two pillars of truth’<sup class="footnote-marker">☉</sup><i class="footnote">Netzaḥ-Hod</i>, <br>... <em>the ‘hin’</em><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="51" data-order="51"></i> <em> of righteousness... </em>– ‘sign of the covenant’<sup class="footnote-marker">☉</sup><i class="footnote">Yesod</i>. <br>All are to show how the world is governed.
But not that You have any specific righteousness – <br>which is ‘judgement’, <br>and no specific justice – <br>which is ‘mercy’. <br>And none of any of these attributes at all.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="52" data-order="52"></i>

As souls act, so does the Shekhinah abide with them: <br>a soul which is habitual in prayer or in Torah, <br>is a permanent place for the Shekhinah to abide therein. <br>But a soul which is not habitual in prayer or in Torah, <br>unless encountered through happenstance, <br>so, She also, abides upon it through happenstance.
And this is: <em>when a bird’s nest happens before you... etc.</em> (Deut. 22:6) <em> <br></em>For surely, the soul [Var. that prayer] is a bird’s nest, <br>[and so, that soul of a person is called ‘a bird’s nest’] <br>and the body is a ‘nest’<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="225" data-order="225"></i> for the soul.

And worthy is he who unites Them in ‘the recitation of the <em>Shm’a</em>’, <br>in fear and love. <br>For when Israel strives, <br>in the Written Torah and in the Oral Torah, <br>in love and fear, <br>it is stated of them: <em>Do not take the mother upon the children</em>. (Deut. 22:6)
But when they are not striving in them, <br>in love and fear, <br>it is stated of them: <em>You shall surely send away the mother... </em> (Deut. 22:7)
When Israel keeps the Sabbath, <br>with <em>Remember</em> and <em>Observe</em>, <br>in fear and love, <br>it is stated of them: (Deut. 22:6) <em>Do not take the mother upon the children... <br></em>And if not, it is written of them: (Deut. 22:7) <em>You shall surely send away... etc. <br></em>– two dismissals.
And when Israel unite the blessed Holy One, <br>through the phylacteries of the hand, <br>and through the phylacteries of the head, <br>in fear and love, <br>it is stated of them: (Deut. 22:6) ... <em>do not take the mother upon the children</em>, <br>and if not, <span class="mediumGrey">then</span> (Deut. 22:7) <em>You shall surely send away...</em>

And this causes exile for the Shekhinah, <br>who is driven from Her place and from Her nesting, <br>which is Jerusalem. It is this that is written: <br>...

And because of this, whoever wants to apprehend the King, <br>does not have permission to apprehend Him, <br>except through the Shekhinah. <br>It is this that is written: (Jer. 9:22–23) <em>Let not boast... etc.</em> <br><em>Except through this</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>zot</em></i> <em>... etc.</em>

And David, <br>because he knew, <br>that all the will and force and might of the King is through Her, <br>said: (Ps. 27:3) <em>If there will encamp... etc. <br>In ‘this’</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>zot</em></i> <em> I trust... <br></em>Upon which it is stated: (Ps. 103:19) <em>... and His Kingdom rules over all</em>. <br>And <span class="mediumGrey">of</span> one who (Ex. 7:23) <em>does not place his heart,</em><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="244" data-order="244"></i> <em> even to ‘this’</em>, <br>it is stated: (Ps. 92:7) <em>... and the fool shall not understand ‘zot’</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote">this</i>.

He said to him: ‘My son, <br>reincarnations are of the mystery of ‘grafting’. <br>Like one who grafts a tree with another tree that is not of its type, <br>like those who graft trees one to another. <br>But the principle of (Lev. 27:33) <em>... and if he shall exchange it at all... <br></em>is that it needs to be ‘holy’ for ‘holy’.
For there is a tree which is from the aspect of impurity, <br>which is evil, and because of that it is stated: <br>(Lev. 27:10) <em>He shall not exchange it, good for bad or bad for good... <br></em>For this is the mystery, <br>of:<sup class="footnote-marker">xxvii</sup><i class="footnote"><em>BT</em> Berakhot 7a</i> ‘the righteous-one for whom it is evil, <br>and the wicked-one for whom it is good.’

And when that soul which is holy, <br>does not find its ‘type’, <br>it is stated of it: (Gen. 8:9) <em>And the dove did not find a resting place, <br>for the sole of her foot...</em>
And so is the mystery of the bird’s nest, <br>of which it is stated: (Deut. 22:7) <em>You shall surely send away the mother... <br></em>and She goes wandering from her nest, <br>(Job 33:29) <em>And behold, all of these does EL do, <br>twice or three times with a man... <br></em>– corresponding to the three ‘missions’<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="305" data-order="305"></i> of the dove. <br>And, when it finds a place in which to abide, <br>it is stated of it: (Gen. 8:12) <em>And she did not continue to return to him anymore</em>, <br>[what is <em>anymore</em>?] – to come yet another time, <br>in ‘grafting’ [reincarnation].

Daf 34a

And he is not worthy of entering the chamber of the King, <br>and about him it is stated: (Deut. 24:11) <em>Outside shall you stand... <br></em>And from outside, they grant him his request, <br>by means of an emissary or appointee.
And if his prayer does not ascend appropriately, <br>they expel him to the outside, and they shut the door in his face. <br>And about that is stated: <br>(Prov. 1:28) <em>Then shall they call me,</em><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="704" data-order="704"></i> <em> but I shall not answer, <br>they will seek me out early, but they will not find me</em>.
And so it is, when each-and-every individual of Israel <br>calls to the blessed Holy One, <br>through the recitation of the <em>Shm’a</em>, or in prayer, <br>or through any precept, <br>if the Shekhinah is not there, <br>then He does not descend there.
It is this that is written:<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="705" data-order="705"></i> <br>(Ex. 20:24) <em>... in every place where I cause mention of My Name, <br>I shall come to you, and I shall bless you</em>. <br>And Onqelos translated <span class="mediumGrey">this to mean</span>: <br>‘in every place that ‘My Presence’<sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>Shekhinti</em></i> resides, there... etc.’
For when a person elevates the Shekhinah, <br>through his <span class="mediumGrey">performance of</span> precepts, <br>towards the blessed Holy One, <br><span class="mediumGrey">then</span> the blessed Holy One descends upon him, for Her sake. <br>And because of this, the prophet said: (Jer. 9:22–23) <em>Let not the boaster... etc. <br>... except in ‘this’</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>zot</em></i><sup class="footnote-marker">☉</sup><i class="footnote">Malkhut</i><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="706" data-order="706"></i> <em>... <br></em>and thus, they have established it.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="707" data-order="707"></i>
[And so it is, when a person elevates the Shekhinah, <br>through his prayer, towards the blessed Holy One, <br><span class="mediumGrey">then</span> the blessed Holy One descends to receive his prayer, <br>and His Shekhinah precedes Him] <br><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="708" data-order="708"></i> [Var. and so also, when a person <br><span class="mediumGrey">causes</span> the blessed Holy One to descend, <br>through his prayer, towards the Shekhinah, <br>then the Shekhinah immediately proceeds] <br>to open for him. It is this that is written: <br>(Gen. 24:15) <em>And it was, before he had finished speaking, <br>and behold Rebecca emerged...</em>
And this is the mystery, <br>that the Masters of the <em>Mishnah</em> established:<sup class="footnote-marker">ci</sup><i class="footnote"><em>BT</em> Berakhot 34b</i> <br>‘If the prayer is fluent in my mouth, then I know that it is accepted, <br>and if not, then I know that it is torn-up’<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="709" data-order="709"></i> <br>– and they tear up his prayer in his face.
And because of this: <em>And it was, before he had finished speaking</em> <br>– and to utter his prayer in the Name of YQV”Q – <br>then immediately, the Shekhinah<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="710" data-order="710"></i> emerged towards him, <br>[Var. to receive him], <br>and because of him, the Shekhinah descended to his feet. <br>It is this that is written: (Ps. 85:14) <em>Righteousness shall go</em><i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="711" data-order="711"></i> <em> before him, <br>and shall place his steps </em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>pe-’amav</em></i> <em> upon the way</em>.

And when a person prays, <br>he needs firstly, to cause the blessed Holy One to descend <br>– Who is YQV”Q – <br>through the recitation of the <em>Shm’a</em>.
And it is to Him, that we say “<em>Hear O Israel</em>” <br>on all Sabbaths and festivals. <br>Because on weekdays, the inner gate of the chamber is shut. <br>It is this that is written: (Ez. 46:1) <em>Thus said Y”Y ELQYM: <br>the gate of the inner court, facing eastward, <br>shall be closed for the six days of work...</em>
And why? <br>Because Metatron rules over it, <br>and on the Sabbath day, when Her Husband arrives, <br>it shall be opened, <br>and similarly, on the ‘day of the new moon’ it shall be opened.
And because of this, when a person causes YQV”Q to descend, <br>through the recitation of the <em>Shm’a,</em> <br>he needs to cause It to descend through ADNY, <br>which is in his mouth.<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="717" data-order="717"></i> <br>And because of this: (Ps. 51:17) <em>ADNY!

For Her support is with two arms <br>– which are Ḥesed and Gevurah. <br>And her standing is with two thighs <br>– which are Netzaḥ and Hod.

For at that time, <br>when the daughter of Pharaoh touched him, <br>the Shekhinah flew away from him, <br>and because of this, <br>when he wanted to approach Her at the bush, <br>She said to him: <br>(Ex. 3:5) <em>... ‘Do not approach here, remove your shoes from your feet’ <br></em>– until he shall divest himself of that body, <br>which the daughter of Pharaoh had touched.

For the soul is His glory, <br>and it is His praise, <br>with which a person praises the blessed Holy One <br>in prayer every day, <br>with many praises and thanksgivings.
And because of this: <em>I am Y”Y, that is My Name, <br>and My glory I will not give to another, <br>nor My praise to idols <br></em>– these are the seventy appointed-ones, <br>to whom the blessed Holy One does not give <br>permission to have dominion over Her, <br>those which are the veins of the liver, <br>which is ‘another god’.

And just as, with His Name, <br>He kills one who transgresses <br>– upon excisions and capital offences of the court of the Torah – <br>thus so He heals and revives through His Name, <br>whoever observes them.
And furthermore: <br>the precept of (Is. 3:14) <em>... the spoil of the poor is in your houses <br></em>– this is the Shekhinah, <br>for one who ‘steals prayer’,<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="560" data-order="560"></i> <br>– which is charity for the Righteous-One, <br>‘the<em> ḥaiy</em><sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote">life-force</i> of the worlds’, comprising 18<sup class="footnote-marker">∞</sup><i class="footnote"><em>ḥaiy</em></i> blessings – <br>is as if he stole His life, <br>which is the Shekhinah, of whom it is stated: <br>(Ecc. 9:9) <em>See life with the woman you love</em>.
And so also, one who detracts from the delight of the Sabbath, <br>it is as if he stole His Shekhinah <br>– who is the Sabbath, the only daughter, <br>and this causes Her to be stolen from Him in exile. <br>It is this that is written: <br>(Is. 50:1) <em>... and in your sins, your mother was sent away</em>.
And ‘repentance’, what is it? <br>(Lev. 5:23) <em>... and he shall return</em>

Daf 60a

<em>the stolen article which he stole <br></em>– he should return the Shekhinah to Her place, <br>...<em> or the funds which he had withheld</em> <br>– this is the blessed Holy One, <br>Who has become separated from Her.
For the Shekhinah is called: <br>‘a positive precept’ from the right<span class="mediumGrey">-hand</span> side, <br>and ‘a negative precept’ from the left<span class="mediumGrey">-hand</span> side, <br>and She is called ‘Torah’ <br>– from the aspect of the Middle Pillar, <br>and anyone who steals or <span class="mediumGrey">unjustly</span> withholds funds in the Torah, <br>whether in a positive or negative precept, <br>is as if he had stolen the Shekhinah, <br>away from the arms of the blessed Holy One.
And similarly, from the aspect of Yesod <br>– the life-force of the worlds – <br>She is called ‘the covenant of circumcision’. <br>One who steals of the covenant, <br>and produces seed from it for an alien domain, <br>is as if he had taken out <span class="mediumGrey">an object</span> from the private domain, <br>to the public domain,<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="561" data-order="561"></i> <br>and caused the Shekhinah to go out from Her place, <br>which is the Land of Israel <br>– the private domain – <br>and has exiled Her between the nations of the world <br>– who are the public domain.
It is this that is written: <br>(Is. 50:1) <em>... and through your sins, your mother was sent away</em>. <br>And because of this: (Ex. 20:7) <em>You shall not take <br>the Name of Y”Y ELoQeYKha in vain... <br></em>What is <em>the Name of Y”Y</em>? <br>It is the Shekhinah. <br>...<em> in vain... </em>– this is ‘idolatry’, <br>to where She is exiled.
And furthermore: <br>She is repentance – the Day of Atonements, <br>comprised of the Ten Days of Repentance, <br>which are Y-H. <br>The Day of Atonements – this is Hei<sup class="footnote-marker">❖</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">ה</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">△</sup><i class="footnote">5</i>, <br>comprised of five prayers,<i data-commentator="Endnotes" data-label="562" data-order="562"></i> <br>the Ten Days of Repentance – this is Yod<sup class="footnote-marker">❖</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">י</span></i><sup class="footnote-marker">△</sup><i class="footnote">10</i>. <br>‘To receive penitents’<sup class="footnote-marker">cxxi</sup><i class="footnote">Liturgical: Penitential Prayer</i> this is V-Q. <br>Anyone who returns in repentance, <br>it is as if he returned V-H to be with Y-H.

<i>Bereishit</i>, there is two [<i>trei</i>] there [included in its letters]; there is fire [<i>esh</i>] there.

It is written, <i>meort</i>, lacking [the letter] <i>vav</i> — that is the written Torah. And what are luminaries? That is the oral Torah. And even though it has been explained that <i>meort</i> that is lacking is Lilith, there are seventy faces [understandings] to the Torah. And because of that, the luminaries in this place is that about which it was stated, <i>For the commandment is a lamp and the Torah is light</i> (Proverbs 6:23); the middle branch, about which it is stated, <i>the greater luminary to dominate the day and the lesser luminary to dominate the night</i> (Genesis 1:16).

Daf 93a




In the beginning [<i>Bereishit</i>], that is the covenant [<i>brit</i>], about which the Tree of Life is mentioned. And behold, this is its explanation. But reversed, it is broken [<i>tavir</i>, which is composed of the same four letters as <i>brit</i>]. For it caused the breaking of Adam the first man, and that is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. That tree was good, that is what is written:<i>And the woman saw that the tree was good for eating and desirable to the eyes</i> (Genesis 3:6), but its fruit was evil. To her, it was like its appearance, the way it appeared on the outside. This is like the mouth; it has words that are beautiful on the outside, but the heart is full of foul words on the inside. So that one did not know that a potion of death was inside of the fruit. That is [the meaning of] what is written: <i>and she took from its fruit and she ate, and she also gave to her husband, etc.</i> — behold, it is the fruit of the tree, since death was there [the first three words of the verse include the letters that spell out death] (inside, which she ate, that caused it). 
And there are husks of fruit that are void and chaos, darkness, and the depths, [such] that these husks are evil, but the mind inside is good. [With] the Tree of Life, its husks are beautiful and its mind is beautiful, and that is [the subject in] <i>Its foliage was beautiful and its fruit plentiful</i> (Daniel 4:9). And there are [also] trees that are completely evil, their minds and their husks are all bitter, and their waters are bitter.  That is [the meaning of] what is written: <i>They came to Marah, but they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter, etc. and the Lord showed him a tree, etc.</i>; and with it, <i>the waters were sweetened </i>(Exodus 15:23-25). That is a sweet tree from which come forth branches and roots about which it is said: <i>sweeter than honey, than drippings of the comb</i> (Psalms 19:11).

Daf 93b

And because of that, there is a tree, the branches of which are sweet, but the wood of its branches are bitter. Likewise, there are sweet waters and bitter waters, since the Holy One, blessed be He, created one corresponding to the other. And there is one that one half of it is sweet and one half of it is bitter, and that is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, just like silver is mixed with lead. And there is a tree, the husks of which are evil on the outside but its mind is sweet inside. Like this, you will find a person who is evil in the words of his mouth (different variant: and exudes evil from his mouth outside), but he is good in his heart inside; and one who has good from his mouth but his heart is evil. That one is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, it is there that the deceptive snake nests.
So too, you will find a person whose body is beautiful and his features are all beautiful, but his soul inside is a guilty spirit; and you will find a person whose body is evil and his features are evil, but his soul inside is beautiful. That one is a righteous one, who has bad befall him [literally, and he has evil]. But one who is good on the outside but evil on the inside, he is an evil one that has good befall him [literally, and he has good], so that he not have a portion in the world to come. One good outside and inside is a righteous one that has good befall him [literally, and he has good]; evil inside and outside is an evil one that has evil befall him [literally, and he has evil]. So behold, it has been explained.

"<i>Bereshit</i>, in the beginning" (Genesis 1:1). This includes two fires ("<i>trei esh</i>"), which are the two flames [referred to in the blessing] "Blessed is the Creator of the lights of fire". And in this regard it is written (Song of Songs 2:5) "Sustain me with cakes (<i>ashishot</i>)", that is, with two fires (<i>eishot</i>). Why is 'sustain me' said in this context? This refers to the eves of the Shabbat, when an additional soul descends in order to support the lower <i>Shechina</i> in exile, of whom it is said (Amos 5:2) "Fallen, not to rise again [is the maiden of Israel.]" When Shabbat reaches its end, this additional soul leaves, of which it is written (Exodus 31:17) "[God was] refreshed (<i>vayinafash</i>)". [This is the meaning of ] <i>vayinafash</i>? As soon as it leaves, woe to the soul! (<i>vay nefesh!</i>), for nobody is left to support her. In such moments, she cries out to Israel "Support me with <i>ashishot</i>", that is, with lights of fires. What are these fires? Two Torahs, carved of fire, which are ELOHIM, the aspect of might. These are known as (Isaiah 54:13) "Teachings of the Lord," two lips of burning flames, or two apples out of which the spirit of the Messiah comes, of which is said (Isaiah 11:2) "The spirit of the Lord shall alight on him."
[This can be compared] to a princess confined in sickness because of her love for her husband. When her husband left she fell to her bed, crying out and saying "Support me with cakes,<i>ashishot</i>)". So too, she [the <i>Shechina</i>] is confined in sickness, and says (Song of Songs 2:5) "Refresh me..." With what? "...with apples," which flourish in the trees of the forest - and these are the fragrant plants.
The third elder rose and said: Rabbi! Rabbi! Behold, we do the <i>Havdalah</i> ceremony with [all sorts of] fragrant plants, even though she specifically spoke about apples. Rather, we use fragrant plants, of which it is said (Song of Songs 7:9) "Your breath is like the fragrance of apples." Moreover, all sorts of fragrant plants are fit for [these Havdalah] blessings. [In fact,] we use myrtle branches, because they have [sets of] three leaves, known as the 'three <i>hadassim</i>', which hint at the three forefathers. The two nostrils [smelling the fragrance], however, represent the two apples, the two true prophets, from whom the holy spirit - the faithful shepherd - is destined to issue. Thus it is written (Song of Songs 2:5) "Refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love."

Daf 144a

On the eve of Shabbat, it is said (Song of Songs 5:5) "I rose to let in my beloved" - on Shabbat! And when Shabbat departs, it is said (Song of Songs 5:6) "My beloved turned and was gone..." At that time, "... I sought, but found him not; I called, but he did not answer." Until I swear that the next time He comes, I will clutch his hand and not let it go, as it says (Song of Songs 3:4) "I held him fast, I would not let him go, until I brought him to my mother's house, to the chamber of she who conceived me" - that is, the third temple.

Daf 144b



Rabbi Shimon rose and said: Enter, holy hosts of above and of below, to witness the adornments of the bride. For the wedding canopy is decorated for Her, and the groom is waiting there for Her. He said: Elijah! Elijah! Descend to us, you and the hosts of souls of the righteous from the schools of  above and of below, in order to adorn the bride. Immediately, Elijah descended, along with many angelic hosts and many souls. 



When the groom, that is, the sun, comes to light up the moon, she decorates her hair with thirteen decorations - twelve constellations and the moon. And He (Psalms 19:6) "is like a groom coming forth from his chamber; like a hero, eager (<i>yasis</i>) to run," - to run his courses in the heavens. He surely peeks (<i>yatsits</i>) at her, as it says (Song of Songs 2:9) "Peeking through the lattice." - looking at her in the heavens. 

Daf 145a

that is [the meaning of] <i>yasis</i>. But what is the meaning of 'hero'? What heroism is in this? Rather, there are twelve windows in the heavens, [filled with] warriors adverse to Him guarding the gates. [Then,] the sun wraps himself in the letters of the tefillin, and dresses himself in might, as it is written (Isaiah 42:13): "The Lord goes forth as a hero." Thus he goes out "eager like a hero running his course", opening up all the windows of the heavens and creating twelve paths - just as Moses did in the [Red] Sea. Surely, He "runs his course", and since at first He took on [His aspect of] might, the [colour of the rising] sun is red. 
After this, He dresses in the aspect of loving-kindness, in white, and thus the anger of the sun is tempered. Green extends out of the central pillar, and when He dresses in loving-kindness, in white light, He [is able to] light up the moon.  And (Psalms 19:7) "His rising-place is at one end of heaven..." - that is the central pillar. One of its ends is [known as] 'the Righteous', and "...his circuit reaches the others..." - the two pillars of truth. In these, "nothing escapes his heat." - this refers to the upper <i>Shechinah</i>, who is the Heat. From there, He is coloured in shades of green, that is, mercy. At this time, the sun and the moon look at each other, "nothing escapes his heat", since she [the upper <i>Shechinah</i>] is the canopy of her [the lower <i>Shechinah</i>].
At that time, She is robed in three colours, flaunting Herself before Him with the three colours of Her eyes: white, red and green. At that time, He will say of Her (Song of Songs 6:5): "Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me!" - they burn me with their flames of your love! [Then Elijah exclaimed:] Sacred Lamp! (Rabbi Shimon), these two eyes are the two precious tablets of Torah, of which it is said (Exodus 31:18): "stone tablets inscribed with the finger of God." They are written on both sides, coloured with twelve shades on this side and twelve shades on the other. These are the twenty-four sides, and it is written (Exodus 32:15) "they were inscribed on one side (<i>zeh</i>) and the other side (<i>zeh</i>)."  <i>Zeh</i> is written twice, [and its numerical value (12) doubled is like] the twenty-four books of the Tanach.
These are the twelve faces and twelve wings of the heavenly beasts, as it is written (Ezekiel 1:8) "Each of the four had the face of a lion on the right" - this is the white of the eye. "Each of the four had the face of an ox on the left" - this is the red of the eye. "Each of them had the face of an eagle" - this is the green of the eye. And it is written, "Each had four faces... and four wings." - this all comes to twenty-four. And these wings are the eyelids, which are referred to as (Exodus 32:15) "they were inscribed on one side (<i>zeh</i>) and the other side (<i>zeh</i>)." [So too,] about the heavenly beasts it is said (Isaiah 6:3) "One (<i>zeh</i>) would call to the other (<i>zeh</i>), Holy! Holy! Holy! The Lord of Hosts! His presence fills the earth." Certainly, they are called "<i>zeh</i> and <i>zeh</i>", just like the two sides of the tablets of Torah, inscribed on one side and the other. These are inscribed tablets of stone, and that stone is the Foundation Stone from which the earth is formed. And this is the pupil of the eye, of which it is written (Zechariah 3:9) "A single stone with seven eyes." These are the seven skins of the eye, of which it is said (Psalms 119:164) "I praise you seven times a day." And this is the Holy Regency, as it is written, (Psalms 118:22) "The stone that the builders rejected will be the chief cornerstone." Who are these 'builders'? They are they masters of the Mishnah who built structures in the world, and the deciders of law (<i>Halachah</i>) who rejected Her in exile. [Therefore,] it is written of Her, "will be the chief cornerstone. For she is Moses' <i>Halachah</i> from Sinai, received by Moses. Although Her pupil was black, through it and from it will the Holy One light up the world, for He will illuminate Her.  
These eyes illuminated by Torah, of which it is written (Psalms 145:15) "The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them food when it is due." Man must, therefore, to delve into them regularly: morning, evening and afternoon, always, the Holy One looking into Her eyes - as it is written (Deuteronomy 11:12) "The eyes of the Lord your God are always looking at her (the land of Israel), from the beginning of the year until its end." And we connect the words [in the two verses], the daily sacrifice (<i>tamid</i>) and "the eyes of the Lord God always (<i>tamid</i>) looking at her". And the (<i>Tamid</i>) sacrifice was [offered] in the morning and the evening, like the recitation of the Shema prayer. From this we learn that one who recites the Shema in the evening and the morning, it is as if one has fulfilled the commandment of continually studying Torah, day and night, as it is written (Joshua 1:8) "Let not this Book of Torah cease from your lips, but recite it day and night."

Daf 145b


The face of the Queen, these are the forty-nine facets of purity (through which the Torah can be interpreted), shining like a rose, white and red, drawing in from the right and from the left. White, from the clarity of humility; Red, from the shame of fear - <i>yar'e boshet</i> (an anagram of <i>Bereshit</i>, "In the beginning"). When [Her face] becomes golden-green, this is the Groom who has risen up to the sun, who is the Supernal Mother. From these three colours of the face emanate the seventy-two facets (of the divine name), whose numerical value equals that of <i>Hesed</i> (Loving-kindness), and which is comprised of two hundred and sixteen letters, the numerical value of which equals that of <i>Gevurah</i> (Might). This is the mystery [hinted at in the words] (Exodus 34:6) <i>Vaya'avor Ado-nai</i>, "And God passed before", which itself is the mystery of  <i>'Ibbur</i> (Impregnation or intercalation. Both <i>Vaya'avor</i> and <i>'Ibbur</i> are comprised of the letters representing 72 and 216). He illuminates the Bride with four faces, as it is written, (Ezekiel 1:6) "Four faces [belonging] to [each] one." The middle column is the <i>Vav</i> [which models the additional month added to] the leap year, comprised of has thirteen months, and alluded to by the initials of <i>Vaho Ani Vaho.</i> Within this <i>Vav</i> is a pregnant woman, the mystery of the impregnation of <i>Yesod</i> (Foundation), containing a drop (of semen) by which impregnation takes place. This is <i>Vav</i>, for without such a drop no impregnation could occur. This is the mind containing wisdom. 
<i>Vav</i> is also the nose adorning the face, of which it is written (Genesis 2:7) "The Lord God created (<i>Vayiitzer</i>)", shining white and red. This nose going on the straight path is the nose of truth, for were it not on the true path it would be not be a seal of the King. Therefore, the image of the Queen has the nose straight on her face, where the two nostrils are the two true prophets. The mouth is the daughter of the Queen, and in it is the tongue of erudition (cf. Isaiah 50:4), which is Righteousness, of which is written (Song of Songs 4:3) "Your lips are a thread of scarlet, Your mouth is lovely -" in Torah. The mouth is the totality of all: it contains sound and speech, which are [the divine letter] <i>Vav</i> and <i>Hei</i>, and it contains breath, which is <i>Hei</i>, and the still, small mouth is <i>Yud</i>. [Therefore, the mouth is] adorned with the divine name, and this is the meaning of "Your lips are a thread of scarlet, Your mouth is lovely."
"Your neck is an ivory tower" (Song of Songs 7:3) - this is Jerusalem, as it is written (4:4) "Like a tower of David is your neck..." - her adornments are the priests, Levites and Israelites; "... built as an armory (<i>talpiot</i>)" - this is the Righteous One who is a hill (<i>tel</i>) towards which everyone faces (<i>ponim</i>), and whose points are the true prophets. For the <i>Shechina</i> is surely Jerusalem, adorned by the three forefathers, bejewelled with the foundations of truth. 
Another reading: "Your neck" - this is the Torah, adorned by her 248 commandments; her jewels and amulets are the 365 prohibitions guarding her. When she rises up, wearing these jewels, towards Her groom, how many good scents rise up in Her! Of this it is written (Song of Songs 3:6) "Who is she rising from the desert" - this is Mount Sinai, the neck of the world; "in clouds of myrrh" - this is the Holy One, of whom it is said (4:6) "I will go to the mount of myrrh"; "and frankincense" - this is the holy moon, of whom it said "and to the hills of frankincense"; "from all the powders of merchants" - this is the Righteous, who is everything united in All.
Another reading: "Your neck" - this is the Oral Torah, <i>Halacha</i> from Moses at Sinai; "In clouds of myrrh" - this is [the phrase] "The master said (<i>amar mar</i>)"; "And frankincense (<i>levonah</i>)" - this is the elucidation <i>libbun</i> of Halacha; "From all the powders of merchants," - this is the Righteous, who holds all kinds, who illuminates the Oral Torah, and when  

Daf 146a

she is adorned in all kinds of jewellery, [she is] as Jerusalem, the neck of the world - the Holy One surrounds her, as it says (Zachariah 2:9) "And I will be - declares the Lord - a wall of fire around it." He embraces her with two arms, as it is written, (Song of Songs 2:6) "His left hand under my head, and his right arm embraced me."
And the hands of the matronita, are all of Her holy. All of them are tracings in (of) the name YHVH, like this: in the palm Y י, in the five fingers H ה, in Her arm V ו and in Her shoulder H ה. In Her palm are formed so many lines, like branches of the Tree of Life . . . That is what’s written: “A tree of life she is for the ones holding her (i.e. the arms) and her supporters are happy” [Pr 3:18].
V is the written Torah, which is given in two arms . . . and with them the two tablets are given, which are “two breasts” [So 4:5]. And these are YY יי, (i.e., two dots, perhaps the areolae or nipples), and in (i.e., between) them is the form of a Zayin, and in (between) them it is narrow/tsar. That is why it’s written: “And [God] formed/Vayyitsar/ VYYTsR [the human]” [Gn 2:7], and they are the virginity-signs/b’tulim of the maiden [which signify] the Torah by mouth (oral Torah).
The praise of the body / sh’vacha d’gufa: “This qomah of yours is likened to a date palm / zo’t qomateikh damtah l’tamar” [So 7:8]. And one that knows the measure of Her stature/body / shi`ur qomah dilah (symbolized by the upright palm) will inherit the world that is coming. . . about which it says: “Israel’s purifying pool / miqveh Yisra’el is YHVH” [Je 17:13]—miqveh/MQVH מקוה , which is Her body/qomah/QVMH קומה , Her shi`ur. Sh`iur qomah – this is the Righteous One /Tsadiq, about whom it says: “Tsadiq like a date palm will bloom” [Ps 92:13]
For it says about her/Her: “And they came Elim-ward, and there [were] twelve springs of water and seventy date palms” [Ex 15:27]. “Twelve springs”—these are twelve joints/sections, which are: six in the arms (right and left shoulder, elbow, and wrist, or upper arm, lower arm, and hand) and six in two legs/shoqin (right and left hip, knee, and ankle, etc.). That is what’s written: “His hands [are] rolls of gold filled in Tarshish (or: with beryl)” [So 5:14]. What is “in Tarshish ( תרשיש )”? “In two, six / t’rey shesh ( תרי שש )”—in two arms [are] six joints; and so [are there] six/shesh others in two legs, [as it says:] “His [two] thighs are pillars of marble/shesh ( שש )” [So 5:15]. These are twelve springs.
