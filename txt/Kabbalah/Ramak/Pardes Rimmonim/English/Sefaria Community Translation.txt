Pardes Rimmonim

Author's Introduction

The young man, Moshe, son of our father, Rabbi Yaakov Cordovero, writes: “Seeing that my childhood days have passed and vanished as I pursued every desire without hope, when I reached my twentieth year, my Creator brought me to awareness, as one awakens a sleeper. I said to myself, ‘How long will you evade, playful one? How long will you remain intoxicated? Remove the wine from within you. How long will thoughts of wrongdoing reside within you, forgetting the Lord, your Maker, and Creator from the womb? Now, rise and call to your God; be diligent at His gates daily and restore the broken altar of the Lord.’
When I heard this inner calling, I said, ‘I will rise and wander through the city, in the markets and streets, to seek rest and comfort.’ And then I heard a voice speaking—a holy man descended from heaven, my teacher and rabbi, the saintly scholar, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz HaLevi, may he be well. He brought me into the halls of his chambers, taught me, and said, ‘My son, let my words support your heart. Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise.’ He stationed me at the gates of wisdom and understanding, which are sweeter than honey and the nectar of the heavens, echoing and resounding in the depths of Torah secrets. His teachings were sweet as honey to my mouth, and I committed myself to his study. I listened to his words and was awakened to learn the ways of the Zohar and the keys to unlocking its gates.
I grew stronger in my study, and I was filled with amazement, saying, ‘How pleasant it is to engage in this study! For many days, I will be a student of this wisdom; in its love, I will immerse myself. Its sustenance will nourish me always, so that I will not forget it.’
When I came to fulfill my vows, I arranged before me all the holy books of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, may peace be upon him, and reflected upon them. My heart felt like a wanderer in the vast sea, lying upon a mast, lost and confused among the depths of numerous teachings. I thought to myself, ‘I will take the writer’s quill at my side and arrange all these teachings, each one by itself, to give my mind clarity, placing order between each teaching and the next.’
When my heart gained strength in one teaching, I would turn to another and saw that my strategy was sound and upright from Heaven. I spread out a scroll before me as a reminder and a guide to its topics and structure. I named it Pardes Rimonim (Orchard of Pomegranates) for known reasons. Firstly, because this wisdom, Kabbalah, is known by the term Pardes (Orchard). Secondly, this scroll would be my solace, to find delight in this world and the next, sustaining me throughout my years. It is an orchard I planted for my enjoyment. It is called Pardes Rimonim (Orchard of Pomegranates) because its chapters are like pomegranate trees with sections, arranged with insights side by side, not one or two but filled like a pomegranate.
We have divided the scroll into thirty-two parts, calling them Gates, as they are gateways into the inner depths and secrets of Torah. We further divided the gates into chapters, some short, some long, according to the nature of the teachings within each chapter. We implore the reader not to enter these gates unless they possess the keys and understand the ways of the gates, for without them, harm rather than benefit may result. Those who have received the keys will find many, many doors opened to them in this wisdom.
Let the reader not expect repeated explanations, for that would prolong the work. They should not leave a chapter until understanding what is essential for their comprehension. Nor should they move from one gate to another until they have fully grasped it, enabling them to proceed safely without fear. However, we will provide references to places where we explained or will explain something more clearly, and these are the names of the gates, each according to its banner and letter.”

Index



Gate 1

First Gate. We named it "Ten and Not Nine", because it explains how there was agreement among our sages, elders, and prophets in the understanding that the Sefirot are ten and not nine or eleven. The Gate comprises 10 chapters. Chapter 1 is the explanation of the Mishna in Sefer Yetzira 1:3 "Ten is the number of the ineffable Sefirot. They number ten, etc."
Chapter 2 is the explanation of the same Mishna (Sefer Yetzira 1:3) with a different approach, and other sections from the Tikkunei Zohar.
Chapter 3 is the explanation of the aforementioned Mishna (Sefer Yetzira 1:3) and the portion of "I've eaten my honey and honeycomb" in Ra'aya Meheimna.
Chapter 4 is the explanation of Tiferet's crucial position between Gevura and Netzach and between Chesed and Hod, according to logic.
Chapter 5 is the explanation of a second Mishna in Sefer Yetzira 1:4 "Ten, and not nine. Ten, and not eleven."
Chapter 6 is the explanation of the section in Ra'aya Meheimna, "Commanded to Give a Half-Shekel" (Zohar 2:187b)
Chapter 7 in order to protect the investigator [student] from error, that they won't think they [the Sefirot] are eleven or more from being too familiar or the like.
Chapter 8 discusses heresy from the power of investigation and text/scripture.
Chapter 9 investigates whether a denier of the Sefirot is considered a heretic or not.
Chapter 10 publicized the ten names that refer to the Sefirot from the scriptures (Genesis 1).

Gate 2

Second Gate. We named it "The Reason [Flavor] for Atzilut", because it explains a reason for why there are ten [Sefirot], no less and no more, and the reason for the reality of Atzilut itself. The Second Gate comprises seven chapters. Chapter 1 explains one reason according to R' Azriel and the understanding of R' Yehuda Chiyiti of this reason, and his criticism.
Chapter 2 explains another reason according to R' Yehuda Chiyiti and R' Menachem Marcanti's reason, followed by our understanding of them two and R' Azriel.
Chapter 3 explains how our Kaballah [understanding of the Sefirot] is ten, which is supported by the Talmud and other imperatives. There we are [actually] dealing with the notion of the Ten Utterances of Creation (Genesis 1:1).
Chapter 4 explains the Ten Utterances in reference to the Ten Sefirot.
Chapter 5 explains the account of "These Ten Kingdoms" in reference to the opinion in Masechet Rosh HaShana.
Chapter 6 explains the reason for Atzlilut and the numeration of Ten [Sefirot].
Chapter 7 discusses whether there can be another Atzilut or not, there we reveal the secret of Atzilut and the cosmic order [of the four supernal worlds].


Gate 3

Third Gate. We named it "Is the Ein Sof [synonymous with] Keter",  because it explains how the Ein Sof (G-d as the unknowable infinite and eternal) is thought to be Keter (Crown, the most supernal Sefira) according to many, and how Keter is excluded as a Sefira [by many], specifically R' Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov and his writings. Chapter 1 explains the notion of those who say the Ein Sof is Keter and the logical counter [to this notion].
Chapter 2 [continues to] counter this notion by means of many places in the Zohar.
Chapter 3 explains the thought of R' Shem Tov ibn Shem tov that Keter is not counted in the Sefirot, and the logical refutation supported by R' Shimon bar Yochai in the Zohar.
Chapter 4 explains and treats the Mishna in Sefer Yetzira that led to the [incorrect] conclusion of R' Shem Tov, and offer another interpretation.
Chapter 5 explains the aforementioned Mishna according to R' Shimon bar Yochai.
Chapter 6 treats the account of haIdra "The Other Forgotten Beam" to understand R' Shem Tov, and we provide an alternate reading.
Chapter 7 explains the above account in greater detail.
Chapter 8 explains the notion, secret, and explanation of the beautiful account of R' Shimon Bar Yochai, peace be upon him, from the Tikkunei Zohar: Genesis 2 "Two Chochma (Wisdom) and Binah (understanding); Three Awe of Hashem is the beginning of Da'at (knowledge)" .

Gate 4

Fourth Gate. We named it "Essence and Vessels", because in it we uncover whether the Ten Sefirot are in-essence the same as G-d (elohut) as many think or are G-d's vessels, like a vessel an artisan uses to create (and aren't part of the artisan himself). There are Ten Chapters. Chapter 1 reviews the thoughts of R' Menachem of Recanti who believes [the Sefirot] are vessels.
Chapter 2 reviews the opinion of R' David (Magen David) who believes [the Sefirot] are in-essance the same as G-d.
Chapter 3 is our understanding of their words whether they are discussing G-d's essence or vessels.
Chapter 4 explains our opinion that the Sefirot are a hybrid of the two (ie higher soul of the vessels).
Chapter 5 explains the proof of our opinion from the Zohar, and an initial explanation of the account from R' Eliyahu "The world is one and not in count" [in unity not quantity] from the Tikkunim (Zohar Chadash Yitro)   .
Chapter 6 explains the remainder of the account, which we split into two due to its length.
Chapter 7 brings another source from the Zohar, "A point [nekuda] does not exist in light [nehura], etc." A section in "Kav HaMida [Measured Line]" (Zohar Chadah V'etchanan).
Chapter 8 brings another source from the Zohar from the book Ra'aya Meheimna, "To whom can you liken me (Isaiah 40:25)".
Chapter 9 explains the unity of the Ein Sof (Endless Light) and the Ten Sefirot, it also explains whether the "creation" of Aztilut [is truly a new creation or not].
Chapter 10 reviews an account from Rashb"i (R' Shimon bar Yochai, peace be upon him), and explains all the angles (lit. corners) that we dealt with until now.

Gate 5

The fifth gate has been referred to as "The Order of Emanation," as it elucidates the concept of emanation, who emanated from whom, and who preceded whom in relation to the emanation. This is due to the proliferation of various opinions on this matter. The chapters within it are six in number.
Chapter One elaborates on the perspective of the Gaonim who assert that their order emanated and is necessitated by the intention derived from scripture and reasoning.
Chapter Two explains a statement from "Patach Eliyahu" by the Rashbi, may his memory be a blessing, from the Tikunim. There, the reason why the foundation sometimes precedes Netzach and Hod is elucidated.
Chapter Three delves into the interpretations of the commentators on the Order of Emanation, aiming to raise objections and insights about them.
Chapter Four elucidates that they cannot manifest through the Crown nor through Wisdom. It expounds on a saying from "Adra D'Nazir Tana," an ancient, primordial thought that they concealed. It is the beginning of Adra, and similarly, a statement preceding the creation of the world existed, solely named and known as itself.
Chapter Five elucidates the Emanation of the first three qualities, as well as several distinctions within Emanation. It explains the frequency of Emanation for each Sefirah apart from others, among the revealed types. Also, it details four configurations of the Sefirot within Chochmah, Binah, Tiferet, and Malchut, and the first statement from the Zohar – all created through Chochmah.
Chapter Six explicates the order of Emanation for the other Sefirot and the rectification of all the concepts.

A Prayer

“He scattered and gave to the needy, for they disperse their springs to satisfy those thirsty to drink from the waters of interpretations. One who truly knows and is well-versed in them serves the Lord with all his heart, as it is said, ‘There is one who scatters and yet increases.’ Indeed, there is a gate that remains closed, which we do not wish to open at all—the gate of Sabbatical and Jubilee years. The reason is our fear of ascending the mountain, even to touch its edge, for studying it touches upon the roots of faith. Moreover, we did not find in the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, peace be upon him, anything to fully satisfy our thirst on this matter. If he, being a master of Kabbalah and the father of secrets, chose to conceal it, who would dare to open the gate of his treasures without his permission? There is also another gate, the gate of reincarnation. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, peace be upon him, touched upon it briefly, revealing a bit but concealing much. Yet in these thirty-two gates, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, peace be upon him, discussed at length the subjects found in the Zohar, Tikkunei Zohar, Ra’aya Meheimna, Yanuka, Saba, Pekudin, and other delightful teachings available to us, as well as in the Sefer HaBahir, Sefer Yetzirah, and writings of other commentators. From the choicest plantings of these gardens, we have planted this orchard.
Let the reader not view it as an adversary, seeking to destroy the garden’s boundaries, for the foundation remains the words of the holy sages. Especially in the majority of the Gate of Attributes and Names, there is not an addition as thin as a garlic peel. In the other gates, nothing has been said without relying on the words of the holy sages. If the reader wishes to challenge anything, he should first reconcile and establish the words of the holy sages, then do as he desires. Our pen is not a tool of iron to engrave in his mind anything he does not wish to accept. For we are not worthy to say, ‘Accept our opinion,’ as he is free to do so or not, to bring truth to light. Let him review our words once, twice, even three times, and examine them favorably. If he does so, he may realize he overlooked some aspect of the teaching in which he stumbled or that was hidden from him. After diligent study, if he finds our words as they were intended, how good and pleasant it will be, for he will reveal hidden wisdom. We acknowledge that each person of our generation is double in understanding compared to us, for we are young in days. Furthermore, we have suffered scorn and bitterness from many of our peers, for the hand of the Lord is upon us, and the lashes of poverty hang upon our walls, as all who enter our gates know. Burdened by the toil and grinding millstone upon our necks, we have been led astray. Yet we do not deny that each has a share in wisdom. If we have overstepped to enter another’s portion, may God forgive us, and may He tell us and crown us with His grace. His words will remain with us, guarding us, so we do not turn from what He commands, neither to the right nor to the left.”





Gate 1



Chapter 1

The First Gate which is called “Ten and not nine”.
It is well-known and eminent that all those who engage in this hidden wisdom unanimously consent that the number of the Sefirot is ten, and there is no disagreement at all in this matter. 
And see, this is one of the matters on which a covenant was made with the wisdom of the Sefirot, and see, among us is the Book of Formation (Sefer Yetzirah) which is attributed to Abraham our father, peace be upon him. But there are some who attribute it to Rabbi Akiva, yet this is not agreed upon.
And see, the words of this book are profound and lofty, and they are hidden from the eyes of the intellect, [from] the glance of those who look carefully. And although there are many different interpretations of it, we still, in all of its parts, need those who explain. And nevertheless we will explain its matters with all that is within the possibility of the limitations of our meagre intellect. And this is what it says: “Ten Sefirot without what(-ness), the number of ten fingers, five opposite five, and the single covenant standing in the middle, in the word of the tongue and in the circumcision of the genitals.” [Sefer Yetzirah 1:3] Until here the citation. 
If it came up in our mind not to explain this verse, because its depths and its secrets are hidden from us, as they are certainly above our intellect, and there is no person who can descend to the depth of its language except Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, peace be upon him, and Rabbi Akiva, peace be upon him, "whose abode is not among the mortals" [Daniel 2:11]. Yet because of the obligation that is upon us, we will interpret it with strenght of hand. And what should be examined more closely? The first is that it says “Ten Sefirot without what(-ness), the number”, which in truth is superfluous, because it would be proper to say: “Ten Sefirot without what(-ness) corresponding to fingers”; why [does it then add] “number”? Secondly: it says “five”, why should it read thus [that is: making the transition from talking about the Sefirot to that of numbers]? The third is: according to its matters there are eleven of them, since they are “five against five” plus the covenant in the middle, which makes [a total of] eleven. The fourth is that its saying “with the word of the tongue and with the covenant of the genitals” seems to show that there are two harmonizers, but why two? The fifth is: what is its intention to elucidate to us whether they correspond to the fingers, because this seems to be unrelated to the topic at hand. The sixth: the moment that it descends to explain by means of [bodily] limbs, it would have been proper to explain all the limbs to which the Sefirot allude, as we will explain in the Gate of the Soul [XXXI], chapter 4, with help of HaShem. And it is said that the author of this book intended to conceal in this chapter the entire wisdom of the Sefirot and to compel it. And he says that they are “Ten Sefirot”, and because of his saying that they are ten [a number], he will draw out a little on the topic of limitation and corporeality. After they have been divided into number he says that they are “without what(-ness) [BeliMah]”, the explanation is [that BeliMah consists actually of] two words: without [Beli] what(-ness) [Mah], and the intention is: without quiddity/essence. Because although the sentence of our mouth has not abstained from saying [that the Sefirot are] ten, the true believe is that they are Beli Mah, without quiddity/essence. And the intention [is] that they do not have an essence that is comprehensible to human beings, because they are are not limited and grasped, as they are without limit or corporeality. And that which does not have corporeality is not grasped except with the heart of the wise among the people of Israel by way of vision as in prophecy. And the reason for the number ten , at the same time them being without what(-ness) will be explained in the Gates that follow, with help of HaShem. And he says “ the number of ten” etc. so that we will not come to say under great pressure, due to the limitedness of our knowledge, that in reality there is nothing but the simple One, therefore he says that they are of the reality of number. And the expression for the Sefirot is an expression of number, as number governs them even if they are without what-ness. And the evidence for this is that their name, “SeFiRot” (ספירות) has the meaning of number (miSPaR, מספר ), as we have explained. And to establish that they are number and that their number is ten, he says: “the number of ten fingers”. And Scripture says: “When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers” (Psalms 8:4).
And see, from scripture it is established that the creation of the heavens and their forces is through the fingers, which are other names for the Sefirot of the Supernal King. 
 And see, there are 10 fingers. And if this is so, the conclusion is that the Sefirot, with whom the worldwas created,  they [are] 10. “Five opposite five”. There is a difficulty to it that Scripture says: “Further, My hand founded the earth, and My right hand measured out the heavens”(Isaiah 48:13). See, we find that the heavens are the work of the hand of G-d, which are five fingers, and they are only five Sefirot and not ten. To this he says: “Five opposite five”, because if the heavens are the work of a hand of G-d, and the earth is the work of a hand of G-d, we see that for sure the two of them together are ten [fingers], and this is “five opposite five”, five from the right hand and five from the left hand, the right hand for making the heavens, the left hand for making the earth. “and the single covenant corresponding in the middle”. There is a problem to it, as from this topic there is no necessity, because we could say that they [= the fingers] are five or that they are twenty. And factually there are twenty fingers, ten on the hands and ten on the feet, their sum [being] twenty. [And thus we could say about the Sefirot also]. What you could say [is] that the ten “fingers” that are on the feet, they are shadow and resemblance of the ten that are on the hands, and there are always only ten Sefirot, but that the allusion is that the ten Sefirot in [the world of] Beriah are shadow and clothing for the ten Sefirot that are in [the world of] Atsilut, as we will explain in the Gate of Atsilut, Beriah, Yetsirah, Asiya [Gate XVI], with help of HaShem. If thus, we might say that they are always only five, and the five left ones are shadow for the five right ones, and the Sefirot they are always only five, or the conclusion is drawn again and we might say that they are twenty. To this [= to avoid these interpretations] it is necesssary that the two of them are in one house, in his saying “and a single covenant” etc. And the general principle of the matters  is, as we found unity and a unifying covenant between five and five, that we will find that the five right ones and the five left ones are one matter and one subject, that their sum is ten Sefirot. Which we did not find between the ten [fingers] of the hand and the ten on the feet, since we have seen that they are two [different] arrangements, each one [an arrangement] of ten, this one shadow and clothing of that one. And the harmonizers between five and five are the tongue - harmonizing between the fingers-, and the covenant of the genitals - between the ten that are on the feet -. And on the Sefirot, on the subject that they are “five opposite five”;  in this matter the commentators have given two explanations. The first one is that the Sefirot are arranged in two arrangements. The first arrangement is: Keter, Chochmah, Binah, Gedolah, Gevurah, these are five, and they say that they are to direct the upper ones. And Tif’eret, Netsach, Hod, Yesod and Malchut, this is the second arrangement, to direct the lower ones. And although there is no subject telling [us] that they are to direct the upper ones nor to direct the lower ones, it is accepted among us. Nevertheless on the subject of the division of the Sefirot, they have aimed rightly, because this is the opinion of Rashbi, of blessed memory, in some places, especially on the subject of the Tefilin, because the four portions [texts in the compartments of the bayit] of the head are Chochmah and Binah, Gedolah and Gevurah, and [of the bayit] on the hand they are Tif’eret, Netsach, Hod and Yesod, thus its explanation in the Zohar (Parashat Vaetchanan, III.264a). And if these matters involve intense meditation, because it is written that the four portions are the four letters [of the Tetragram; see Tikkunei haZohar (Haqdamot) 3a] , if this is so, it [then] follows for us that the Sefirot are divided into two arrangements according to the words of the commentators. And thus on the subject of the chariots in the Sefirot, its explanation in the Tikkunim (Tikkunei haZohar, Haqdamot 3; Tikkunei Zohar Hadash 111) [is] that the face of Adam on the throne is Chochmah(חכמה)  [also spelt as] כח מה, power of What (מה), as the numerical value of Adam (אדם) [מה and אדם both have the numerical value of 45], the eagle [is] Binah, the lion Chesed and the bull Gevurah; this is the chariot up high. And below it is a second chariot , [where] the face of Adam [is] Tif’eret, and Netsach, Hod and Yesod [are] lion, bull and eagle [respectively] this is the second chariot. And upper Keter complements everything above, and Malkut complements everything below. See, this divides the Sefirot in two arrangements as we have mentioned. And besides these there are many [other] indispensable things [to mention], but we will not make it long [here] so as not to stray from what we intend. 
And see, along the line of this explanation we will [now further] explain this Mishna [from Sefer Yetsirah].  Which is that Tif’eret is “a single covenant” which rises very high with the mystery of Da’at,  and is connecting the upper ones to the lower ones by means of its going upwards in the three first Sefirot and its harmonizing the arms, and emanating in the Netsachs [= Netsach and Hod] and in Yesod and Malkut. See that there is “the single covenant … in the word of the tongue and in the circumcision of the genitals” “…corresponding in the middle…”, [its] explanation: in the middle of the ten upper fingers, the harmonizer is Tif’eret who is called “the word of the tongue” as I will explain. And he says: “a single covenant” because the subject of the covenant is the subject of divorcing and cutting, and by means of the cutting of this matter the knot of the covenenant is made, and this is the subject of the covenant. And some read יחוד “union” where some read יחיד  “single”, and all amount to the same thing, although best chosen is יחוד “union”, because by means of the covenant it is the union, which is the knot of the matter, its force and its union. And some want to connect “the word of the tongue” to Binah, but according to our method it will be explained [to refer to] Tif’eret, although “tongue” is [also] another name for Binah, though not for Tif’eret. This being so, he does not say “tongue” but “word of the tongue”, which is the Sound and the Voice that goes out from the tongue, meaning to say: by means of the tongue.
And see, the Sound is the sum of Water, Fire and Air, as is well-known, and these are the three aspects of Tif’eret, as Air is the harmonizer between the Water and Fire of Chesed and Gevurah [respectively]. 
And see, he does not aim at the actual limb which is the tongue, since then it would become problematic as they [the Sefirot] would be eleven with the harmonizer, but the harmonizer is the Voice which is Tif’eret, in the mystsery of its ascent to Binah, which is the tongue which is the Shofar, as from there the Voice goes out, the sum of Water, Fire and Air, and this is the aspect of Tif’eret that rises upwards between the three first ones [Keter, Chochmah and Binah] and harmonizes between Gedolah and Gevurah, indicating the connection of the five upper ones with the five lower ones, and as we will explain in the Gate of the Arrangements of the Special Names [Gate XXI] with help of HaShem. “And the circumcision of the מעור (genitals)”, this is the covenant of the circumsision, and the explanation of מעור just as [in] “as the embracement (מער) of a man and his companion” (1 Kings 7:36), as our Sages, may their memory be a blessing, have explained: “as the embracement (מער), as the union of a man with his wife” [Talmud Bavli, Yoma 54a/b], who is the woman. And the intention is the unity that exists between the ten fingers of the feet by means of the genitals that are unifying them. And this explanation is necessary, as “the word of the tongue“ is the one unifying the ten fingers of the hands, and “the circumcision of the genitals” unifies the ten fingers of the feet, from what he explains in the sixth chapter [of Sefer Yetzirah], and this is what it says: “He cut for him the covenant between the ten fingers of his feet, and between the fingers of his hands, and this is the covenant of the tongue.”, end of citation.
And see, this mishna has [now] been explained in the manner of the explanation which the commentators gave on the subject of “five opposite five”. 

Chapter 2

Further, we will clarify this Mishna through a different explanation which the commentators have given on “five opposite five”, and it is more fitting and accepted, and it is also recognized as such in the words of Rashbi [Rabbi Shimon bar Jochai] of blessed memory in many places. And the subject [is] five from the right and five from the left, the five from the right [being] the five Sefirot whose main inclination is towards the side of Chesed (Mercy) which is the right, and they are Keter, Chochma, Gedolah [here the Sefira Chesed is called Gedolah, as not to confuse it with the side of Chesed], Netsach and Tif’eret. And the five on the left, they are the five Sefirot whose main inclination is towards the side of Din (Judgement) which is the left, and they are Binah, Gevurah, Hod, Yesod and Malkut. And if it so that the essence of Tif’eret is [being] the central axis, if this is so, its essence is [still] Chesed as is known, as it is below, opposite Chesed, and its inclination is to the right. And Binah in its aspect is connected to Din (Judgement), as it is called “Performer of mighty deeds” [Morning Service, the Blessings of the Shema], because judgements are aroused from it, as we will explain in the Gate of Essence and Conduct [Gate VIII] chapter 6. And thus on Hod, it is said “And my splendor (Hod) was turned into destruction” (Daniel 10:8), [and] “all day misery (דוה)” (Lamentations 1:13), [misery has] the characters of Hod (הוד). And Yesod also thus the essence of its inclination is to the side of Gevurah, and thus Rashbi of blessed memory clarified in the Tikkunei haZohar (Tikkun 13, page 29b) on the ninth blessing etc., and this is its citation: “And the Tsaddik [indicating Yesod] receives from the left, and the central pillar [indicating Tif'eret] receives from the right”.  
And he further explains there (in Tikkunei  Zohar Hadash, first Tikkun 28) on this actual subject, and it says: “The righteous one/Tsaddik is he that moves to the left, [and] he is Isaac (יצחק), endpoint (קץ) of life (חי), living (חי) of the worlds/(or: eighteen (חי) worlds), attached to the left etc.”. And although this citation in its context needs a lengthy explanation and appropriate reflection, anyway from the generality of his words it follows for us that for Yesod the essence of its inclination [is] to the left, contrary to Tif’eret. And this subject is possibly the reason for the two harmonizers, apart from other reasons that there are for this matter, as we explain in the Gate of the Harmonizers [Gate IX], chapter 4, with help of HaShem. And for Malkut similarly its essence is Judgement (Din), as its name is well-known in the mouth of all Kabbalists, which is “Degree of Weak Judgement”. And although there are some places that are apparently opposed to this subject, anyhow these words are absolute foundations, as nails inserted, and the rule is rule of truth.  
And see, these Sefirot are as the arrangements of two hands, the right hand: they are Keter, Chochmah, Gedolah, Netsach, Tif’eret; and the five from the left [are] the left hand: Binah, Gevurah, Hod, Yesod, Malkut. 
And see, Tif’eret is “the covenant of the tongue”, because it is the one that harmonizes between Judgement (Din) and Mercy (Chesed), as is known. And it certainly belongs to the [same] species as the ten themselves. And thus “the covenant of the genitals”, even if its essence is in Yesod, see, according to this it will also allude thus to Tif’eret, because “the body [referring to Tif’eret] and the covenant [of circumcision], we consider them as one” as is explained with the words of Rashbi of blessed memory in the Tikkunim [Tikkunei HaZohar] many times. 
And see, according to this it is found that between ten [fingers, in the world of Atsilut] and ten [toes, in the world of Beriah] there is no harmonizing  as there is between five and five, as we have explained above in Chapter 1. 
And see, this mishna has [now] been explained [with] a second explanation by way of what the commentators have explained on “five opposite five”.
We will further explain this mishna [with] a third explanation of “five opposite five” in a way different from what was shown to us [until now]. Let one choose for oneself. And it [the explanation] is that when he says “five opposite five” he does not intend the fingers [which were already] mentioned, because he has moved away from the subject of the ten towards explaining to us the harmonizing between Judgement (Din) and Mercy (Chesed), and [towards] the arrangement of the harmonizing, and [towards] the subject of the need of [this] harmonizing.  And to this he says that they are “five against five” [and] that Tif’eret harmonizes between Chochmah and Binah in the mystery of Da’at when it rises towards Keter, as we will explain in more detail in the Gate of the Harmonizers [Gate IX] with help of HaShem.  See, the two of them are one opposite one: Chochmah opposite Binah, as this one [Chochmah] is the root of Chesed [Gedolah] and this one [Binah] the root of Gevurah. Furthermore Tif’eret harmonizes between Gedolah and Gevurah, as is known, and Rashbi, of blessed memory, explained it in the Tikkunim (Tikkun 30, page 75b) on the verse “and it was evening and it was morning, [one day]” [Genesis 1:6], and this is what it says [there]: ‘“And God called the firmament ‘heavens’” [Genesis 1:8]. “And God called”, this is the Upper Mother, “the firmament ‘heavens’”, this is the Pillar of the Center, which is between right and left, and perfects them both. This is what is written: “and it was evening and it was morning” and these are the evening of Isaac and the morning of Abraham”’ – end of citation.  
And although amidst the plain meaning of the words of the saying there is evidence for our intention, nevertheless ‘now that it has come to our hands, let us say a small word on it’, so that ‘it will’ not ‘depart without staying overnight’ [allusion to Babylonian Talmud, Chullin 91b]. And we need to examine it minutely. Firstly: its saying ‘”and God/Elohim called” this is the Mother’, because hitherto we have not heard this, since all Elohim in the parasha of the Work of Creation refers to Binah. Secondly: what is his intention in saying ‘Mother’ instead of ‘Binah’, which is its better-known name? Thirdly: his saying ‘Pillar of the center which is between right and left’, and as after he said ‘Pillar of the center’ we don’t know the intention that it is in the middle of right and left – which are Gedolah and Gevurah – unless it is required to explain it and to prolong with ‘which is etc.’. Fourthly: that as soon as he gets down to the explanations that ‘it is between right and left’, why not say Tif’eret ‘which is etc.’ and keep silent of ‘the Pillar of the center’, which appears to be double. Fifthly: his saying that ‘it is between right and left and perfects both of them’, it [‘it perfects both of them’] is double, as this is implied by ‘which is between right and left’. Sixthly: his saying ‘this is what is written: “and it was evening and it was morning”’, apparently there is no evidence at all for his intention in the biblical verse. And let us say that Rashbi, peace be on him, found difficulty with the verse “and God/Elohim called the firmament ‘heavens’”, because ‘firmament’ is Tif’eret and ‘heavens’ is also Tif’eret; if this is so, what is the intention of the verse in saying “and God/Elohim called the firmament ‘heavens’”, that ‘firmament’ and ‘heavens’ are not the same thing? And he answers to this and says: ‘God/Elohim, this is the upper Mother’. The explanation: as already saying you know that all Elohim which is [mentioned] in Bereshit [the first parasha of Genesis] is with Binah, and this Elohim [in the mentioned verse] is with Binah on the side of its aspect together with the lower ones, as it is the influencer, in other words: the one causing the emanations to emanate, and therefore it is called Mother, and this is what it says: ‘this is the upper Mother’. ‘[to] the firmament ‘heavens’, this is the Pillar etc.’ Explanation: Tif’eret has two realities. The first one is from the side of Chochmah, and this is a prestigous reality that is approximately somewhat  the mystery of the Line of Compassion/Rachamim, which is what is emanated from Keter and extends itself to Chochmah, as we will explain in the Gate of the Arrangement of Atsilut [Gate V] with help of HaShem. And this is the reality for which Moses our teacher, of blessed memory, is the vehicle, as is explained in the Tikkunim (Tikkunei HaZohar, Tikkun 13, page 29a). And this is what it says: “And Jacob certainly [is] the likeness of the Pillar of the center from the exterior side. And see, Moses was [also] there. But he [is] from the interior side, and that one [= Jacob] from the exterior side (that one [= Jacob] from the body and this one [=Moses] from the soul)” – end of citation.
And see, this reality, which is its aspect in the property of Compassion/Rachamim, without carrying [the sides of] Chesed/Mercy and Din/Judgement with it [thus: not totalizing/mediating the two sides], he will give the name ‘soul’ to this reality [of Tif’eret] that is being regenerated out of the mixing and the carrying. And this soul is called ‘firmament’. And we can say [about firmament, רקיע] by means of Tseruf [that is: re-arranging the letters inside a word] רקע י , “foundation/stretching of Yud”, which is the reality [of Tif’eret] that is stretched and is expanded from Keter by means of Yud which is Chochmah. And this reality he clarified with his citation ‘Pillar of the center’, willing to say: the Pillar and the Middle Line which does not have any totality at all from Chesed/Mercy and Din/Judgement, but it is [only] between the two of them, and this is what he says: ‘which is between right and left’. And by means of Binah [indicated by ‘Elohim’] this ‘firmament’ is arranged, and they have clothed it [in] the totality of Fire (אש) and Water (מים) which is what is called ‘heavens’ (שמים), and this is “[He] establishes the heavens with understanding [תבונה, referring to Binah].”(Proverbs 3:19). And the aspect that is totalizing this reality is Binah, who is called ‘Mother’, which is the reality of the Heh (ה), which is [built up from] three Wavs (ו) [that is: one can see the letter ה as a composition of three ו, one left, one right and one (turned 90 degrees) above them] which are the three lines Chesed/Mercy, Din/Judgement and Rachamim/Compassion, as will be explained in the Gate of Reality [Gate XIV]. And therefore he says: ‘totalizes/perfects both of them’, explanation: from the side of the Mother [it] totalizes the right and the left, which is the garment that clothes and crowns the prestigious reality. And there is to this subject a proof from the book of the Zohar, parasha Yitro [Zohar II.84a]. And this is what it says: ‘In the biblical verse “Go out and gaze, o daughters of Sion […] at the crown with which his mother crowned him” [Song of Songs 3:11]. What is “at the crown”? Rabbi Isaac said: as what is written: “And Saul and his men encircled David” [1 Samuel 23:26]. Because he is crowned with white, red and green, with all colors that are totalized in him and are turned around him. Rabbi Yehuda said: “…at the crown with which his mother crowned him”. What is “the crown”? As is written: “Israel, with you I will glorify myself (פאר)” [Isaiah 49:3], and it is written: “and the house of my splendor (תפארת, Tif’eret) I will glorify (פאר)” [Isaiah 60:7]’ – end of citation. 
And the explanation: King Solomon, with whom there is peace, he is Tif’eret, and Yesod is his peace. And the crown is the reality [of Tif’eret] that is called ‘heavens’, which surrounds his simple reality that is called ‘firmament’ [and] which emanated from Chochmah. And this corresponds to “at the crown with which his mother crowned him”, [his mother] who is the Elohim that was mentioned in our present discussion. And therefore he said earlier [in our text]: ‘which is the mother’, which is Binah, the mother of the children. And “crown” is an expression of surrounding and covering, as the subject: “And Saul and his men were encircling David”, which corresponds to surrounding. And the explanation: as this crowning is with three colors, which are white from the side of Chesed [here the Sefira Chesed/Gedolah] and red from the side of Gevurah, and green composed from both of them, which is the mixture that is mixed by means of the ‘man of the interspaces’ [an allusion to 1 Samuel 17:4] [which is] Tif’eret. And in order that we shall not err, saying that white and red are not in the reality of Tif’eret but only green [is in it], [therefore] he says: ‘and all of them are included in him and are turned around him’. Explanation: King Solomon, who is the spiritual aspect from the side of Chochmah – which is also called King Solomon, as I will clarify in the entries of the special names with help of HaShem – he is surrounded by the three colors, and they are actually turned around him. And he is white in the property of its aspect towards Chesed[/Gedolah], and red in the property of its aspect towards Gevurah, and green in the aspect of both of them in the equilibrium of the mixture. And all of them are surrounding him and are crowning him. And Rabbi Yehuda explained “the crown” with a different explanation that adds to [that of] Rabbi Isaac, and he says that it is not only this [explanation] but “the crown” is the totality of all six extremities [Chesed/Gedolah, Gevurah, Tif’eret, Netsach, Hod and Yesod], as in the property of this aspect is the special name of Tif’eret fitting, which is from the expression ‘ornaments’, as “the ornaments of the headgears” [Exodus 39:28 (the Hebrew text incorrectly refers to Ezekiel here)], and its explanation is: branches, intending to say that it branches out into six extremities, and the six extremities are its [= Tif’eret’s] branches. And this is what he says: “Israel, with you I will glorify myself” [Isaiah 49:3]. And the explanation is: Binah is speaking to Tif’eret who is called Israel that she is ornamenting herself with it and is branching out in branches. 
And he brings further proof from the biblical verse “and the house of my splendor I will glorify” [Isaiah 60:7], as she [Binah] is branching herself out and is ornamenting herself with her branches. And it intends to say: the house of Tif’eret above is Binah, as also there is it’s [= Tif’eret’s] resting place, as he [= Tif’eret] “is extending from one side to the other side” [Exodus 26:28], from the side of the heavens which is Binah to the side of the heavens which is Malkut. And just as Malkut is the house for Tif’eret so also is Binah [the house for Tif’eret], and this is “the house of my splendor I will glorify”. Explanation: she [= Binah; the Hebrew text mistakenly has “he/it”] is branching out with the branches of Tif’eret which are a measure for it [= Tif’eret]. Or it intends [to say] that Malkut is a house for Tif’eret. And Binah says: ‘“the house of my splendor”’ which [= the splendor] is Tif’eret, ‘[is] from my side’, because from the side of Binah it [= Tif’eret] totalizes the ornaments, and similarly for its house that is Malkut, it is possible [for Binah to say that] ‘I will branch out’ in the mystery that she [= Binah] totalizes the six branches from its [Tif’eret’s] side, that it is clothing itself six in six [שש here could also allude to ‘fine linen’, which is used in the construction of the Mishkan, Exodus chapters 25 and further], and this corresponds to “with the crown”, which is this ornament and garment. Until here [the explanation of Rabbi Yehuda]. And this is what was intended in the biblical verse “And God/Elohim called”, as it is the Mother who is crowning “to the firmament” [with] the crown that is called ‘heavens’. And he brings in a proof to this from the biblical verse: “and it was evening and it was morning, one day”. And the explanation: evening [refers] to Isaac and morning to Abraham. In their totality together Tif’eret is becoming a reality and clothes itself, which is called “one day” which corresponds to ‘heavens’. And the totality of ‘heavens (שמים)’ corresponds to ‘day’, as it [consists of] fire (אש) and water (מים) [see earlier in this chapter for the Hebrew word ‘heavens’ thought as consisting of ‘fire’ and ‘water’], evening and morning. And to this he says ‘one day’, being united and uniting the two aspects [of Tif’eret]. And we could say that from there come the twelve hours. [The letter] Wav [ו, referring to Tif’eret] can somewhat be seen in Milluy [filling out its pronunciation in Hebrew characters] [as] ואו, which has the same numerical value as אחד ‘one’ [namely: thirteen]. And its explanation: the two unifying faces/aspects, Wav from the right side [is] one face, Wav from the left side [is] one face, and the Aleph in the middle [thus forming ואו] unifies the two faces together. And this corresponds to ‘one’, and the two Wavs correspond to the twelve hours [of a day; the numerical value of each ו is six], Wav from the rising of morning until mid-day, which is Chesed[/Gedolah], [and] Wav from noon until night, Gevurah, and this [together is] ‘one day’. And it is not necessary to expand [on this]. And it had already been possible to add [further] evidence to the subject of Tif’eret’s harmonizing between Gedolah[/Chesed] and Gevurah, but since it is a simple and agreed-on matter [we have not done so]. And it is only necessary for us to understand this saying in its composition, and it follows for us [now] that Tif’eret harmonizes between Gedolah[/Chesed] and Gevurah, and the two of them are one ‘opposite’ one. 

Chapter 3

Tif’eret further harmonizes between Gedolah[/Chesed] and Hod, and between Gevurah and Netsach, and the reason is that Gedolah and Netsach are the right side [which is] Chesed/Mercy, and Gevurah and Hod they are Din/Judgement, the left, and they need harmonizing. And there is some proof to this in the words of Rashbi of blessed memory in the book of the Faithful Shepherd [Raya Mehemna, Zohar Parasha Pinchas, III.244a], this is what it says: ‘And in the first redaction: “I have gathered my myrrh with my balsam…”[Song of Songs 5:1], right arm with left thigh. “my honeycomb with my honey”[ibidem], Jacob and Rachel. “my wine with my milk” [ibidem], left arm with right thigh. Chesed with Hod, these are the right arm with the left thigh. Jacob and Rachel, the Pillar of the Center with Malkut. Gevurah with Netsach, these are left arm with right thigh. And why are there two of his attributes here? Because it is a secret which he will thus express. David said here: “Your priests will be clothed in righteousness and your devout ones will rejoice [Psalms 132:9]. It is written there, [but] ‘and your Levites will rejoice’ it should have said. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: ‘it is not customary to change my attributes, but after you have invited me, I must do after your wish.’ From this we are taught that the master of the house, when he invites even the king, the king must do after his [= the master of the house’s] wish. And because of this we have been taught: “all what the master of the house will say, do” [Babylonian Talmud, Pesachim 86b]. And this being so, it is a fitting secret, etc.’ End of citation.
And what there is to arouse in this saying is [first] the lengthiness of its expression, and the repetition of the subject in not [very] different words. In his saying ‘right arm with left thigh, Chesed with Hod’ etc., [even] if we, until now, had not heard that the two arms are: Gedolah the right arm, Gevurah the left arm, and [about] the two thighs that they are: Netsach the right thigh, Hod the left thigh, why is there need for this lengthiness in the explanation of the plain matters? Second [note]: Essentially he could have used a short and clear expression in his saying [, such as]: ’“my myrrh with my balsam”, Chesed with Hod. “my honeycomb with my honey”, the pillar of the center with Malkut. “my wine with my milk”, Gevurah with Netsach. And he could have kept quiet about thighs and arms, so that there would have been no need to explain them afterwards. Third [note]: that essentially this saying [is] in parasha Pinchas (Zohar III.241a/b), as thus he said: ‘and in the first recension’, explanation: in the Zohar, because that is the book that precedes this [book/saying]. And there in parasha Pinchas he does not lengthen, nor in whole nor in part, but [gives] only the first part of the saying. And it says thus: ‘“I have mixed my myrrh with my balsam”, right arm with left thigh. “my honeycomb with my honey”, Jacob with Rachel. “my wine with my milk”, left arm with right thigh’ – until here the citation. And although he adds there [that is: in Raya Mehemna, Zohar III.244a] to the subject of harmonizing [that] the special name “my myrrh” is Chesed, and “my balsam” [is] Netsach as we will explain, nevertheless he does not further add to the subject of clarification of the words. And one needs to find out why he does not use this relation here [Zohar III.241a/b]. Fourth [note] on his saying ‘Jacob with Rachel’. And he does not say ‘body [= Tifer’et = Jacob] with the female [= Malkut = Rachel]’, the limbs in the same way and with the same treatment as the limbs which he assigned to the other Sefirot. Fifth [note]: After he goes down to the explanations of his works in what he says: ‘And they are, etc, it would have been fitting to say: ‘right arm with left thigh, Chesed with Hod’, as this is the normal order, and not to let the explanation precede the [original] text [that needs to be explained] by his saying ‘Chesed with Hod, right arm with left thigh etc.’, and similar for them all. Sixth [note]: And what difficulty does he find in: ‘And why are there two of his attributes here’. And what is difficult [is] that sometimes Netsach is suckling from Gevurah and similarly Hod from Chesed, but most of the time Netsach is suckling from Chesed and Hod from Gevurah. But sometimes it occurs, because of the assimilation and influencing that Netsach is suckling from Gevurah, and Hod from Chesed. And therefore each one is composed of them all, so that they all consent to a single action and a single emanation. And therefore is it possible that the two opposites become equalized, even Gevurah with Chesed. And we will explain that Rashbi, of blessed memory, found difficulty in the scriptural verse, because it was proper for it to say: ‘I mixed my myrrh and my balsam, I ate my honeycomb and my honey, I drank my wine and my milk.’ Why [does the verse use the words] “with” [instead of ‘and’], because it [appears to be] superfluous? And to this he answered that there above the verse that is before us (what is printed in parasha Wayikra, page 4b and further) he said: ‘”My myrrh with my balsam”, Chesed with Netsach. “my honeycomb with my honey”, Gevurah with Hod. “my wine with my milk”, body and covenant.’ [I did not find the exact citation but a slightly longer paraphrase in Zohar III.4a]. 
And see, part of our questions is reconciled with this, because he says ‘with’ ‘with’ to unite these attributes in the mentioned manner, but because this answer is not satisfying, when the intention of the biblical verse is only [to teach us] that Chesed is united with Netsach, Gevurah with Hod, and Tif’eret with Yesod, if this is all so [it would be more fitting to] be silent of ‘with’ and ‘with’. And from the matter it is taught that it says that when they are being united their customary ways are in this, as three are uniting themselves with three. To this he says: ‘And in the earlier recension’, its explanation: in the Zohar, in parasha Pinchas, a different and more than extended explanation was given, and this is it: ‘right arm with left thigh’, of which the intention is: Chesed with its being [of] the line of Chesed/Mercy [the right axis], being united with Hod with its being [of] the line of Din/Judgement [the left axis]. And thus Gevurah with its being [of] the line of Din being united with Netsach with its being [of] the line of Chesed. And now there will be no difficulty in why he said ‘with’ ‘with’, which is necessary because it is not their customary way in this. But because it is contrary to their habit and nature, therefore it is necessary to say ‘with’ ’with’, to teach us that this order is contrary. And the reason that he speaks in the Zohar with special names of the limbs (arms, thighs), and [does] not [mention] the attributes by their names. [This is] because it is difficult for him, since after he clarified that the Sefirot are turned over into what [is] not the [normal] order, that [that is: mention the Sefirot by their regular names] would be impossible. Because the [normal] route of suction of Netsach is from the right, and thus it is below Chesed [in] the line of Chesed/Mercy. And the route of suction of Hod is from the left, and thus it is below Gevurah [in] the line of Din/Judgement. How is it [then] possible that they change their function? That would be impossible. And to clarify this subject for us in bold rhetorical language he uses in his expression arms and thighs, to tell you that just as the arms and thighs are adhering together and are connected with the body, and by means of the body it unites the right arm with the left thigh, and similarly the left arm with the right thigh, and the body is the medium that unites them and couples them together. Similarly the subject [functions] above by means of Tif’eret, which is the one that branches out in six extremities, and these extremities are its limbs. Just as the limbs are branches for the body, so are the extremities limbs and branches for Tif’eret. And therefore, by means of this it is possible for these Sefirot to be mixed in this mixture, and this is possible, and not impossible. But [even] if this is so, we have not yet escaped the question ‘why are there two of his attributes here’, as we will explain. 
And see, explained is the reason that he is forced to say ‘arms’ and ‘thighs’ and not the attributes themselves with their names. But Rashbi of blessed memory, in the book of the Faithful Shepherd (Raya Mehemna) [the later recension] intends to bring the citation of the first recension, transferring it to his expression itself, which is ‘“I have mixed my myrrh with my balsam”, right arm with left thigh. “my honeycomb with my honey”, Jacob with Rachel. “my wine with my milk”, left arm with right thigh’, until here the citation of the recension. And he adds in the clarification the rest of the saying. The intention is to clarify to us exactly [with] his fine expression when he says ‘right arm with left thigh’ etc., that the subject on the side of Scripture is [some recensions have אלא  (“except/but”) here instead ofלא  (“not”), which I have followed] on purpose, that Chesed unites itself with Hod, and not that Hod unifies itself with Chesed. He intends to say that the dwelling-place of Chesed will be in Hod and the root is Chesed. And similarly with Gevurah, that its dwelling-place is in Netsach, and the root is (Netsach) [other reading: Gevurah; there is some confusion here and below on what exactly is the ‘root’], and not the inverse. And similarly Tif’eret in Malkut below. For if we would say that the root above are lower ones in the upper ones, the reason of ‘why are there two attributes here?’ would not be established. Because if this would be so, you would find that the bride and her bridesmaids would go up to the house of the bridegroom and his groomsmen. And if this would be the case, it would not be proper for the bride to change any custom of the bridegroom at all, because she is lodging in his house. But here it is what is correct: Chesed in Hod, Gevurah in Netsach, Tif’eret in Malkut. And they are three upper ones in three lower ones. We will find the bridegroom lodging with his groomsmen in the house of the bride with her bridesmaids. And since he is in the house of the bride, it is proper that he will accustom himself to the will of the bride. And it is in her hand to change the custom according to her will as to what is better in her eyes. And with this subject there is an answer to the question ‘why are there two attributes here?’, as we will explain with help of HaShem. And this is what Rashbi of blessed memory intended, to explain to us the fine point of its expression in having the clarification of the word precede the word itself, in his saying: ‘Chesed with Hod, right arm with left thigh’ [in his explanation in Raya Mehemna, Zohar Parasha Pinchas, III.244a], and not the inverse. To awake us to the fine point of its expression, because with intending intention he uses the expression of ‘arms’ and ‘thighs’, and not the expression of the attributes ‘Chesed’ and ‘Hod’ etc. To teach that this mixing is by means of the body. And this he intends when he has the expression of ‘Chesed’ and ‘Hod’ precede that of ‘arm’ and ‘leg’ as if he says: examine carefully! Because it had already been possible to shorten the expression saying ‘Chesed’ and ‘Hod’, the expression of the attributes and not [using] the expression of the limbs. But [he uses the expression of the limbs] “to give you understanding” (Daniel 9:23). Because the mystery of this mixing, which seems to be turned, is [actually] aligned by means of the body which is Tif’eret the middle one, as we have explained. But on the contrary: ‘arm’ and ‘thigh’ [are] clarification of Chesed and Hod, and [it is not so that] Chesed and Hod are clarification of ‘arm’ and ‘thigh’. And to this we will answer that with Jacob and Rachel there was no need to change their names into the name of limbs, because there is no modification in their subject and their unity, but [it is] as customary: Tif’eret on [in the same line of] Malkut, and therefore he does not alter them.
And further we understand that in the expression of the first recension [Zohar III.241a/b] he says: ‘right arm in/with (ב) left thigh’ and similarly ‘left arm in/with (ב) right thigh’, and he does not say ‘with’ (עם), ‘with’ (עם), but [he speaks] in brief. And in this saying [here, Zohar III.244a] in his explanation he clarifies ‘Chesed with (עם) Hod’ etc., and he [now] says ‘with’ ‘with’. ‘And why are two of his attributes here?’ Explanation: it is right if it is this what they are clarifying, as there is only a modification of the attributes concerning the influx and the sucking only, which we would have thought in the explanation ‘right arm in/with (ב) left leg’, that its intention is on the influx only which Chesed influences in Hod, and similarly which Gevurah influences in Netsach, there is no difficulty for us at all that thus [is] the way of the attributes that the ones suck from the others. But according to what he explains in this saying ‘right arm in/with (ב) left thigh’, explanation: ‘with’ (עם) really [they are really together], which is that Chesed unifies itself downwards into Hod, and Gevurah downwards into Netsach. If this is so, it is [still] difficult ‘why the two attributes [are] here’. As according to the way of the real unification, this is not the way of unification of the Sefirot, as Netsach connects itself with Chesed, and Hod with Gevurah, as we will explain in the Gate of the Thigh of Jacob [Gate XVII], with assistance and help of HaShem, in the chapters 3 and 4. And the meaning according to the influx, even if it is that Chesed can influence in/with Hod, yet Hod will perform its [natural] action which is an action of Din/Judgement, even if it will not perform [it] with the strength as it would be when it would suck from Gevurah, and there is in this no [need for] fear, since there is [here] no modification of the attributes [the way the attributes act remains the same, although the intensity may differ]. Truly [however] in real union there is doubt because the activity of Judgement/Din is abolished from everything. Since when Gevurah wishes to act with Judgement/Din, Netsach will conquer that Judgement/Din and will not allow it to act, in the mystery of the unity. And therefore it is difficult ‘why the two attributes [are] thus’, as it is a modification of the attributes and a restraint of Judgement/Din, and this is not convenient. And this is not the natural order, that which was told to David: “On account of David, your servant etc.” [Psalm 132:10] he changed and extended the power of Compassion/Rachamim. As even if the joy [רינה, referring to the previous verse (Psalm 132:9) mentioned in the beginning of the current chapter] is from the side of Judgement/Din as is known, he [= David] wanted that it would be from the side of Chesed/Mercy, and this will be explained further in the Gate of the What-ness and the Conduct [Gate VIII], with help of HaShem, in chapter 6. And thus concerning Tif’eret, since it came to the house of Malkut, as it says: "I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride” [Song of Songs 5:1]. When this is so, it is that it behaves itself according to her [= Malkut’s] will, even with modification of the attributes, to extend the power of Compassion/Rachamim further. And this is what is called ‘Chesed in/with Hod, Gevurah in/with Netsach and Jacob in/with Rachel, because they [are] three upper ones in/with three lower ones by means of Jacob the bridegroom who has come to the house of his bride Rachel as we have explained. But if it would have been so that the bride would go up to the house of the bridegroom, it would not have been convenient to change, as it is not the natural order to change [in those circumstances]. 
And see, we will end the clarification of the saying, and may good taste and knowledge go out for us, as Tif’eret also harmonizes between Gedolah[/Chesed] and Hod, and between Gevurah and Netsach.  

Chapter 4

Being that in the previous chapter we were compelled out of the [Zohar-]saying mentioned in it [to learn] that it is Tif’eret which is harmonizing between Gedolah[/Chesed] and Hod, and between Gevurah and Netsach, and the subject was a bit strange to [our] hearing ear. We said to compel this discourse further and to explain the matters, to show that they are not far from the intellect and not strange, as the matter is very close to us. And the subject [is] in what is well-known, that Tif’eret receives from Gedolah[/Chesed] and Gevurah, and influences Netsach and Hod.And there is no doubt as to that which Tif’eret influences in Hod, that there must in this influx be part of the influx from Gedolah[/Chesed], which Tif’eret received from it, as we have explained, and similarly what Tif’eret influences in Netsach, [that] there must be in this influx part [of the influx] from Gevurah. And there is no doubt that the influx that is being influenced from Tif’eret in Netsach and Hod with its [=Tif’eret’s] mixture, is not really [identical to] what it received from Gedolah and Gevurah. Indeed the middle mixing will be mixed by means of Tif’eret, becoming equal to Gedolah and to Hod, and similarly becoming equal to Netsach and Gevurah, and if this is so, it is found that this harmonizing is to some extent a continuous matter. And at times it happens [concerning] Tif’eret that its root if its receiving needs to be from Judgement/Din of Gevurah, to influence in Netsach for a need in the world for Judgement, for punishment and as what follows in these subjects. Or because it receives the most part from Gevurah, it will influence to Netsach to sweeten Judgement. And similarly at times Tif’eret will receive the most part from the side of Mercy/Chesed, and it will influence to Hod to sweeten Hod. And this intermixture and what follows from it will be explained in the second chapter of the Gate of the Channels [Gate VII], with help of HaShem. And the matters are straightforward for someone who understands and pleasing to the finders of knowledge. We will further add instruction to this matter and we need [to add] the subject on which all learned ones agree concerning the colours of the Sefirot, that the colour of Netsach is red leaning to white, and the colour of Hod is white leaning to red – thus far its statement. 
And see, they explain about Netsach that it is red, inclining to white, explanation: being red from the side of its receiving from the side of strict Judgement of Gevurah by means of Tif’eret the harmonizer, as we have explained, and because of this Judgement it will be red. But from the side of the majority of its sucking from the side of Mercy – as there is its house – its leaning will be towards white, to whiten the redness, to return it to white, and this is “leaning”, as its direction is that its majority is white. And similarly the subject inverted for Hod, because it is white by means of its sucking from Mercy by means of Tif’eret the compromiser and mediator between them. But because the root of its sucking is from the side of Gevurah – because there is the root of its leaning and its [natural] place – it needs to be leaning to white and harmonizing Compassion to the side of Judgement. 
And see, we have found according to this [that] Tif’eret is mediating with its colour, which is whitened and red, between Gedolah and Hod, and between Gevurah and Netsach. 
And the subject of these colors will be explained in the Gate of the Colors [Gate X], with help of HaShem. Praise and thanks to the Bestower of good on the guilty ones, Who has rewarded us with all good. To HaShem, and may He give us light to give force to this matter with three reliable witnesses: with the words of the Rashbi of blessed memory, with the opinion of the Kabbalah, and with the words of the learned ones. The general principle of the matters [is that] the places that need harmonizing are ‘five opposite five’: Chochmah opposite Binah, Gedolah opposite Gevurah, these are two opposite two, Gedolah opposite Hod, Gevurah opposite Netsach, these are two opposite. These are [in total] four opposite four. Furthermore Yesod is harmonizing between Netsach and Hod as will be explained in the Gate of the Harmonizers [Gate IX] in chapter four. This makes ‘five opposite five’. In truth, there are only two harmonizers between five and five, which are Yesod and Tif’eret. How? Yesod [harmonizes] between Netsach and Hod, and Tif’eret between Gedolah and Gevurah, between Gedolah and Hod, between Gevurah and Netsach, and between Chochmah and Binah with the reality hidden in the mystery of Da’at as will be explained in the mentioned Gate [Gate IX]. And with this preamble the mishna [Sefer Yetzirah I.3] will be understood [of] which we [are] in its explanation, which says: ‘five opposite five’, because the truth is that they are five as opposite five and the covenant of unification standing in the middle, as the harmonizers are mediating and directing between the extremities. And the ‘word of the tongue’ is Tif’eret, and it is called ‘word of the tongue’ because it is by means of Binah, which is the tongue, that it rises upwards to harmonize between Chochmah and Binah in the mystery of Da’at, as will be explained in the mentioned Gate [Gate IX]. And similarly by means of it [= Binah] it mediates between Gedolah and Gevurah, as we have explained at the end of Chapter 2 [of the present Gate I]. And the ‘circumcision of the genitals’ is Yesod, the second harmonizer. 
And see, with this matter we will settle the subject further and we will answer exactly that which we asked, which was that they are ‘five opposite five’ and the harmonizer [added makes] them eleven. Because we are not here in [the realm of] the number of the Sefirot, but [in the realm of] the number of the harmonizing, as we have explained, and there is no need to elaborate [on this here]. 
And see, we have explained this mishna in the version that is most often published in books and commentators. Although the Ramban, of blessed memory, appears to have had a different version [of this mishna in his commentary], nevertheless we will not worry but consent to [the version in] the majority of the books. And when the researcher will look into the [different] versions he will find that this version [= our version] is more accurate, and further that we cannot verify that this commentary is [actually] by the Ramban, based on what is seen in it.  

Chapter 5

After we have travelled from the mountain of HaShem, a high and steep mountain, [which is] the previous mishna [of Sefer Yetsirah], and with it we were compelled to [accept] the opinion of the kabbalists [namely that] the number of the Sefirot is ten and not more. We will [now] go to the "mountain of myrrh" [Song of Songs 4:6], the second mishna after it, although it is the fourth one from the start of the chapter. And this is what it says: ‘Ten Sefirot without what[-ness]. Ten and not nine. Ten and not eleven. Understand with wisdom/Chochmah, and become wise with understanding/Binah. Examine with them and investigate from them, and know and think/count of them, and establish the matter completely, and return the Formator to His foundation.’ [Sefer Yetsirah I.4] – End of citation.  
We have agreed not to arouse on this mishna a general principle, its words being by themselves without arrangement, and the citation says: “Explain me!”. And its shallowness does not tolerate a general principle instead of what is raised and given in it, and we will write what God will place in our mouth on the subject. ‘Ten and not nine’, and its explanation. And it is that its intention is to warn us for the mistake, so that we will not say that Keter does not belong to the Sefirot that we can think, as it is En Sof - which it is not -, as it [En Sof] is dwelling above the above. And [it is] not as many think, that En Sof would be among the number of the Sefirot, and that it would be Keter. And this thought we will invalidate in the Gate of Is En Sof Keter? [Gate III], with help and support from HaShem. And ‘may the all-Merciful save us from this opinion!’ [Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 84b]. But verily they are ten besides the Emanator. Because if this was not so, the emanated Sefirot would be found to be nine. And this is not appropriate, but the emanated [Sefirot] are in reality ‘ten and not nine’. Further an explanation that came to warn us so that we would not err to exclude Malkut from the number [of the Sefirot], as there are some who believe in an opinion close to this. And ‘may the all-Merciful save us’ likewise ‘from this opinion!’ But it [= Malkut] is together with them in the Emanation/[the world of Atsilut]. And even though it is not in their harmony, as we will explain in the Gate of the Diminution of the Moon [Gate XVIII] with Heaven’s help. And close to this explanation is the explanation of Rashbi, of blessed memory, in the book of the Faithful Shepherd/Raya Mehemna [Zohar III.277b, parasha Ki Teitzei], and this is what it says: ‘And there are other masters of the secrets of the Torah, masters of the Attributes, who inherit souls from the side of Holy Malkut, which is totalized of ten Sefirot. Because everyone who inherits and merits it [such a soul from the side of Malkut], merits the ten Sefirot without separation, “ten and not nine”, since if they would be inheriting only Malkut, there would be nine [Sefirot] in separation from it, and because there is no separation there, the author of Sefer Yetsirah says: “ten and not nine”. And if you say that it[s number] rises above ten, see, the Explicit Name יו"ד ה"א וא"ו ה"א [the Tetragram in its principal miluy, using the letter א, sign of unity] consists of] ten [letters], יו"ד/Yud [ten] which is united with it [= Malkut] does not rise above ten, and because of this “ten and not eleven”’. End of citation. 
The intention of this saying, that he says: ‘and there are others’ [is] that higher than this subject he said [that] there are among the people of action those who have a soul which is a Mother from the side of [the world of] Beriah/Creation, and this subject will be explained in the Gate of the Soul [Gate XXXI] with help of HaShem. And now he says that there are ‘other masters of the secrets of the Torah’, which are those who are occupied with the divine Torah and its secrets. And because it is possible to say that one calls ‘masters of the secrets of the Torah’ those who are occupied with the secrets of halachot, exegeses, aggadot, rules, judgements and punishments, according to only the simple meaning [Peshat] of their words. And hereto he says that if the salary of these is double and [again] doubled and this [salary] is [then] the representative degree. Nevertheless they are not worthy of the height of this soul until they arrive at the secrets of the Sefirot which are the mystery of Divinity. And these [last ones] are called ‘masters of attributes’. And they are called thus by reason of [the fact that] all occupation of the sages in Kabbalah is in the attributes and their subjects. And he says that these inherit a soul from the side of Malkut itself, not from the side of Metatron [the] servant [of the Master]. And not from the side of the Mother as has been mentioned there. And he says that he inherits a soul totalized out of ten. And [he says this] because there is [apparently] a difficulty for him: perhaps the other soul also might be thus totalized out of ten, or perhaps this soul [from Malkut] might not be totalized out of ten? And from where do we have the ability to divide between one soul and the other, even when this soul will be more important than that one? And to this he will force, as with Malkut he intended to say that it is ‘from the side of […] Malkut’ [and that] it [= the soul] is [then] by necessity totalized out of ten. By reason that the Sefirot will not be separated and they are connected and united, and when we mention Malkut, the remaining Sefirot are necessarily attached to it. What is not the case with the soul from the side of Metatron or Mother as they  are from the world of division [from lower worlds: Mother is in the world of Beriah/Creation, and Metatron in the world of Yetzirah/Formation], since they descend from [the world of] Atsilut/Emanation. And it is not obliged by this obligation except in [the world of] Atsilut, but not in them [= the other worlds]. And because of this a soul will not be totalized out of ten unless [it is] from the side of Malkut. And when we say that the soul [is] from the side of Metatron or Mother, [and that] it is not totalized out of ten, it is not the intention that in it [= the soul] are not totalized ten according to its meaning, as it is not possible that a proceeding action from above is not totalized out of all ten. Because if [this would be] so, one would see [the world of] division. And this is exactly the reason [concerning] those who have defects, such as those lacking hands, and it seems as if they are defective and reveal the vice of their actions, that they have made a holy place unfit and have separated [it] and therefore their soul does not extend in the body into these limbs, and this is its defect and its lack, and everything [follows the principle of] according to the place of their violation, similarly so their defect. And the defect, that [starts] from the beginning of [the world of] Creation/Beriah [downward], shows its deficiency in the turn of the Gilgul/cycle of souls, as we will explain the subject of the limbs in the Gate of the Soul [Gate XXXI] in chapter 7 with help of HaShem. And never in the world it is possible [that there is] a soul or an activity in which not all ten Sefirot are totalized. And even when it is decided saying [that] a soul is from the side of Metatron, or from the side of Mother, its intention is not [to say] that they are not from above, God forbid. Because all the souls are proceeding from above. And the subject [is] as we will explain in the mentioned Gate [of the Soul, Gate XXXI] in chapter two, with help and support of HaShem. And always it is totalized out of ten, and they are never separated, as we have explained. And what is [the difference] between souls from Malkut and the other souls? It is that the other souls are [also] totalized out of ten, [yet] that the ten does not show itself concretely in these, but the intention is that they are totalized in it, and it is in itself totalized out of ten. But the soul from the side of Malkut is being emanated from the ten Sefirot which are in Malkut, with Malkut showing in it [the soul] all ten Sefirot and unites itself with them. 
And this subject will be clarified further in the Gates that will follow with help of HaShem. And this subject [is] on the Sefirot themselves as there is a big difference between our saying that ‘Malkut is totalized out of ten’ [on the one hand], and [on the other hand] when we say that it is in unity with the essence of the other Sefirot, because it is not the same matter. Because the advantage of the Sefira when it is totalized is not [the same] as when it is being improved by uniting itself with the essence of the Sefirot, as this [last] is when [the] Sefirot will reveal themselves in it in reality, and this is being explained. And this is when in his saying [it says] ‘totalized out of ten Sefirot’. And the explanation: as the intention in his saying ‘totalized’ is not just [being] totalized according to the nature of the Sefirot but ‘as … who inherits it … merits the ten Sefirot without separation’. Explanation: he is himself worthy of the ten Sefirot in their reality by means of the ten Sefirot revealing themselves actually in it, as we have explained.
And [on] the subject of his saying ‘who inherits it and merits it’. Explanation: that there are two matters which are needed in order to merit this important soul. The first one from the side of his preparation from the side of his father at the moment of procreation at the moment of conception, as our Sages of blessed memory have said: ‘… he who sanctifies himself at the moment of sexual intercourse etc.’[Babylonian Talmud, Shevuot 18b], and after his father has sanctified himself herewith, when this his very good intention will go up, he will merit a holy soul from a lofty place, and according to the measure of his holiness thus his conduction will rise up. And this is well-known in the Zohar and in the Talmud many times in many places.And [in] their saying: meriting worthy sons, the intention is that he does extend to his sons a soul from a high place regarding that they will be worthy. And this is called an inheritance from his father, and this he intends in his saying ‘and he inherits (it)’. Further secondly he needs in himself worthy deeds pleasant in the eye of his Creator, so that this soul will not depart from him, and this will be explained further in the Gate of the Soul [Gate XXXI] chapter 3, with help of HaShem.And on this second [matter] he says: ‘and he merits it’, explanation: he that merits with his deeds this holy soul. ‘he merits the ten Sefirot without separation’. Explanation: as we have explained that as the soul [is] from the substance of Malkut, see it necessarily follows that this soul is ‘totalized out of the Sefirot’, explanation: from the substance of the ten Sefirot that are in it [=Malkut], because it unifies itself with the ten Sefirot and it is in no way separated from them. And this is what he says: ‘merits the ten Sefirot without separation’, he intends to say: [these are] unified in Malkut without being separated from it. And this necessarily follows from the words of Sefer Yetzirah which says ‘ten and not nine’. And when it would have been possible to say that the soul, which is necessarily a part from Malkut, could be separated, as its expression: “and blew into his mouth” (Genesis 2:7), everyone who blows, is blowing from his substance, and if this is so, the way of the part will be precious to the whole, because as the soul that is being emanated out of it [= Malkut] is being separated from the other parts of the Sefirot, similarly Malkut is being separated, God forbid, from the other Sefirot. And this is not possible, because if it would be so, the left over Sefirot would be nine, to this it [Sefer Yetzirah] said: ‘ten and not nine’, that there will never be less than ten, and therefore it is necesssary that the soul is being totalized out of ten, ánd that the Sefirot are totalized in it [= the soul] substantially, just as it is [the case with] Malkut itself, as everything that is in the part, is [also] in the whole. ‘And if you say that it rises above etc.’ Explanation: there is a difficulty for him [in] that it is said that they are ten besides Malkut, and according to this it was already possible to say that Malkut is being separated from the rest, and nevertheless they [all] are ten. And to this he brings in: ‘the explicit name etc.’ Explanation: the Explicit Name is a name of four [letters], as we will explain in the Gate of the Four-letter Name [Gate XIX], and this name is in the attribute of Tif’eret, and it [= the name] is the masculine uniting itself with Malkut, who is the feminine, and it [= Tif’eret] is uniting itself with her [= Malkut]. And this name teaches with its full form (miluy) that is the Domain of the Unique [indicated by the letter א, thus applying the miluy form with א], [that] its height [is] ten and its width four, which is יהו"ה and this is its width, and its height is ten: יו"ד ה"א וא"ו ה"א , see [there are] ten [letters], as it never rises above ten. And if it would be that there were ten besides Malkut, see, when the name has united itself with Malkut, there will be eleven: ten above, and one uniting itself with the feminine [and this is not possible] To this it says in Sefer Yetzirah: ‘ten and not eleven’. 
And see, we have completed the explanation of the passage [from the Zohar], and we have written intentionally an explanation of the mishna ‘ten and not nine, ten and not eleven’. We will further be able to explain ‘ten and not eleven’, [so as that] it intends to warn us against bringing into the number of the emanated entities [= the ten Sefirot] the throne that is designated to the [world of] Beriah/Creation as will be explained in the Gate of the Four Worlds [Gate XVI] with help of HaShem. And similarly it intends to warn us against bringing into the number of the emanated entities the king, prince of faces, Metatron, as although his name is as the name of his Master, he is only [of the world of] Yetzirah and not [of that of] Atsilut, as we will explain in the aforementioned Gate with help of HaShem. And all these explanations are in the explanation of the mishna, since it speaks in terms of affirmation and negation: ‘ten’, see [it is] an affirmation, ‘and not nine’, see [it is] a negation, and similarly ‘ten and not eleven’. And its intention is to necessitate this number, that it is ten, and to negate all that is of the side of error, which would add to the [number] ten or would diminish it.  

Chapter 6

They have given us another explanation of this mishna [from Sefer Yetzirah] in the book of the Faithful Shepherd [Raya Mehemna] [Parasha Ki Tisa, Zohar II.187b], and this is what it says: ‘The commandment to give “a half- shekel with the holy shekel” [Exodus 30:13]. The Faithful Shepherd said: ‘What is a half-shekel [a biblical weight-measure]? It is similar to a half-hin [a biblical liquid measure]. And this is Wav exactly placed between two He’s [reading the Hebrew consonants “hin” as “He’s”]. The stone to weigh with, it is a Yud [with the numerical value of 10, twenty gerah [another biblical weight-measure] [is] a shekel, it is Yud Wav Daleth (יוד) [this is the name of the letterי  (Yud) spelled out in Hebrew characters, which has the numerical value of 20]. “And the wealthy one shall not increase” [Exodus 30:15], this is Central Pillar [= Tif’eret], it will not increase on ten (י). As thus it is said in Sefer Yetzirah ‘Ten Sefirot without what-ness, ten and not eleven.’ “and the poor one shall not decrease” [Exodus 30:15], this is the Righteous One [= Yesod], he will not decrease from ten, as it is said: ‘ten and not nine’, and a half-shekel, it is ten’. End of citation.
And it is necessary to examine this citation minutely. Firstly his saying ‘What is a half-shekel? It is similar to a half-[hin] etc.’. Explanation ‘a half-hin’ is Tif’eret [the Wav] which is ‘exactly placed between two He’s.’ Truly with ‘a half-shekel’ it does not fit to explain thus ‘exactly placed between’, as we do not know between what [the half-shekel is placed]. Secondly his saying ‘the stone to weigh with, it is a Yud etc.’. See, according to the meaning [it follows] that Yud Wav Daleth (יוד) is twenty. And how does he say that one should not subtract from nor add to the ten, is it not that יוד [with value twenty], with its half being ten, and see: ten has been added to ten and that makes twenty! And according to his explanation one should not add to the ten [Sefirot] any Sefirah, not even Tif’eret nor Tsaddik [= Yesod], but he mentioned these which are "wealthy and poor" [Proverbs 28:11], and the more so [concerning] all the others. Thirdly his saying ‘the stone to weigh with, it is a Yud’, and how do they weigh with this stone, whereas it is twenty gerah and the weight needs to be ten, which is only a half-shekel. And if we say that his intention is to say as if it were to weigh with this stone and it is a complete stone, if this is so it is a lengthy expression, and he could have said ‘the stone to weigh with, it is a Yud Wav Daleth, and it is twenty gerah’. Why does he say ‘the stone to weigh with, it is a Yud, twenty gerah [is] a shekel, it is Yud Wav Daleth’, which is repetition and lengthening. Fourthly his saying ‘and a half-shekel, it is ten’, as there appears to be no link with it [what is said previously in the citation].  
And further that it is contrary to what we have explained, as above he spoke the explanation: ‘a half-shekel’ which is ‘exactly placed between’ [= the Wav] and now he says ‘a half-shekel it is Yud’, which is that the meaning of ‘half-’[the Aramaic word] has half of a shekel as its meaning. 
And see, to comprehend this saying we need to introduce the subject that the Sefirot are ten from above towards below, ánd ten from below towards above, is as the resemblance of a spark of the sun coming and reaching a polished mirror, and the light turns and returns towards its source, similar the subject with the Sefirot, as they come from above downwards until Malkut, and there is the station of the light, and it returns to its source by way of journeys [= in stages], as just as they are ten from above downward, similarly then are ten from below upward, and we will this discourse in more length in its own Gate [Gate 15], with help of HaShem.  
And see, this mystery is explained within the form of the [letter] א (Aleph), which is י (Yud) above, [and] י (Yud) below, to reveal the source of the light from above downward, and from below upward, and they [= the two Yud] are the upper waters and the lower waters, as we will explain in the Gate on the entries of the special names [Gate XXIII] in the entry ‘water’.
And see, the ו (Wav) that is between the two י (Yud) is Tif’eret, the one who unites the upper waters and the lower waters, and this is ‘the half-shekel’ which is situated exactly between the shekel which is the complete measure, the measure of Atsilut/Emanation: ten from above downwards and ten from below upwards, and it [the Wav/Tif’eret] is situated exactly between and the medium between the two Yud which are ‘twenty gerah’, the ‘shekel’. And now the meaning of the half-hin [the two “He’s”] and the meaning of the half-shekel are all one [and the same] matter. And [thus] the first contradiction is solved [the Wav is placed between two Yud]. ‘The stone to weigh with, it is a Yud’. Explanation: this stone has always the shape of י (Yud), which is called ‘stone’, and all ‘stone’ refers to the essence of Yud as we will explain in the Gate on the entries of the special names [Gate XXIII] in the entry ‘stone’, with help of HaShem. 
And see, this stone to weigh the half-shekel with, as the half-shekel is ten as we have explained, and therefore the stone with which one weighs it is the form of a י (Yud) which is ten. ‘twenty gerah, the shekel it is Yud Wav Daleth’. Explanation: when he says: ‘twenty gerah, the shekel it is Yud Wav Daleth’ in its fulness [the name Yud spelled out in Hebrew characters], he directs to twenty [its numerical value is twenty] which are the two Yud: Yud [10 Sefirot] from above downwards and Yud  [10 Sefirot] from below upwards. 
And see, its half [of twenty], which is Yud/ten, in its plain meaning it is the stone to weigh [with]. And when it is [spelled out in] full it is the complete shekel which is twenty gerah, ten from above downwards and ten from below upwards, as we have explained.  ‘“And the wealthy one shall not increase”, this is the Central Pillar, it will not increase on ten etc.’. Explanation: needless to say [that this holds for] the rest of the Sefirot but even the “wealthy one” [Tif’eret], which is more wealthy in emanation and in totality than the rest of the Sefirot, nevertheless it must not increase [this] totality above ten Sefirot because they are ten and not eleven. And therefore it must not increase totality above ten because of its wealth, but its wealth will be in the increase of emanation/influx and light, or that it being totalized out of ten [by] many totalizations, but it never increases on the sum of the ten. ‘“And the poor one shall not decrease”, this is the Righteous One, he will not decrease from ten, etc.’ Explanation: Yesod, even if it so that it is being called ‘needy one’ because of its poverty (in the time of exile indicating that it is not its nature]) as its saying (Isaiah 57:1) “The righteous one perishes etc.”. And it is needy and poor. And he says that even if it is poor, its poverty cannot decrease from ten Sefirot, the general rule [being] that one is not to decrease from them, according to the subject ‘ten and not nine’, but its poverty is in the diminution of its emanation/influx, or [in] the diminution of its totalization out of the ten, yet not that it decreases from them [= the ten Sefirot], but that it does not add many totalizations out of ten [out of ten. Truly one is not to decrease from the aforementioned ten, in order that it will not be less than ten. As it is impossible to say that there is a place being removed [from the ten] because of one of them [lacking], but they [the Sefirot] are always ten. ‘And a half-shekel, it is ten’. Explanation: now, according to when we have explained that the wealthy one, which is the Central Pillar which is actually a half-shekel in the middle between the two Yuds, which are ‘a shekel [it is] twenty gerah’, if this is so, ‘a half-shekel’ is ten, and ten is ‘a half-shekel’. And if this is so, since Scripture has come to teach us that ‘the wealthy one’, which is Tif’eret, is not worthy to increase on ten, if this is so, how does he say ‘the wealthy one shall not increase … from a half-shekel’, and it [= the wealthy one] is itself a half-shekel, and how has he given proportion to the wealthy one who is Tif’eret with the half-shekel which is Tif’eret in reality, to this [=to clarify this] he says: ‘and a half-shekel, it is ten’. Explanation: Despite of what we have explained above, that Tif’eret is the one that is called ‘a half-shekel’ because of it being medium/in the middle, nevertheless “Scripture does not depart from its literal meaning” [Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 63a], that it [= Tif’eret] is called thus in its aspect [of being] between the shekel, and cutting it in two, and a half-shekel is ten. And now he says; ‘the wealthy one shall not increase’ never in its essence which is ‘a half-shekel’ which is that it is cutting the shekel in two and making each one out of ten. Thus far the explanation of the saying. And learning from it we have found the explanation of the mishna ‘ten and not nine, ten and not eleven, which has come to teach us on the subject of the general rules of what is totalized, that one is not to ‘increase… from the ten’, as we have explained.

... If a person looks at the flow of much water with his eyes, a white liquid is stimulated, etc. So too is this matter. When the spring flows in his mind, he will find ten levels in this thing. As from the colors that appear to our eyes or in our physical mind's eye, this impacts on the [level of the] spiritual; the essence is stimulated by the spirit; and the soul by the essence. And from the soul, it goes from one state to another, until it rises to the place of its nourishment. So it is aroused according to the state of the [original] form.

The second one is the division of times with what they hint to. And we can say that time is divided into seven divisions, and they are 1) Jubilees, 2) Sabbatical cycles, 3) years, 4) months, 5) Shabbat cycles, 6) days, and 7) hours. And we will explain their content: The Jubilee is the grouping of seven Sabbatical cycles; the Sabbatical cycle is the grouping of seven years; the year is the grouping of twelve months; the month is the grouping of four Shabbat cycles; the Shabbat cycle is the grouping of seven days and the day is the grouping of 24 hours. And the idea is that a plain hour is in Kingship (<i>Malkhut</i>) and it acts and impacts on the change of time as it is impacted. And the order of time consists of the seven <i>sefirot</i> from Kindness (<i>Chesed</i>) downwards. But the order of time is powered by Understanding (<i>Binah</i>), which flows upon them like 'a mother upon children.' So it comes out that the trunk of the tree is Understanding, and it is the root of the tree, as its roots spread without end. And likewise did they call her, the root of the tree in the Tikkunim, as we will explain [this] expression in Section 15, Chapter 2. And that is the Jubilee, and it has seven branches, and its seven branches are the seven Sabbatical cycles, which are the seven <i>sefirot</i>. And each of these seven branches has seven branches, and they are the seven years. And we are not denying that the name, Shemittah, relates to all of the <i>sefirot</i> and even to Kingship. This notwithstanding, they would not rise to the content of the Shemittah were it not for the power of Understanding which flows upon then. And likewise did they explain in the commentary on the Tikkunim. For from the side of Wisdom (<i>Chochmah</i>), the <i>sefirot</i> include ten; but from the side of Understanding, they include seven.

Regarding the Name of 72, which is associated with Chesed (Kindness), as explained by the holy Rabbi Nechunya, as we will clarify with God's help. Here it is in its entirety:
Wehu	Yeli	Seyat	‘Alam	Mehaš	Lelah	Aka	Kehat Hazay	Alad	Le’u	Heha‘	Yezal	Mebah	Heray	Heqa Le’u	Keli	Lewu	Pehal	Nalak	Yeyay	Melah	KhahuNetah	Ha’i’a	Yerat	Še’ah	Reyay	’Awam	Lekab	WešarYehkhu	Lehakh	Kewaq	Menad	Ani	Kha‘am	Reha‘	YeyazHahah	Miyak	Wewal	Yelah 	Se’al	‘Ari	‘Ešal	MeyahWehu	Dani	Hahaš	‘Amam	Nena’	Neyat	Mebah	PewiNemamYeyal	Harakh	Metzar	Wumab Yehah	‘Anu	Mekhi Demab	Menaq	Aya‘	Khabu	Re’eh	Yebam	Hayay	Mum. 
It is called the Name of 72 because it contains 72 words. Some call it "Aryeh" because its letters correspond to the numerical value of 216, which is the same as the value of "Aryeh" (lion). Rabbi Nechunya attributed this name to Chesed and vocalized it as indicated. However, in the book "Midbar" according to a Magid (an angelic teacher), it is said that its vocalization is according to the Name "Ehyeh" in the pattern of Segol, Sheva, Segol, and the last He has no vowel point. With these vowel points, this great Name acts powerfully. The secret of the Segol is the secret of all spirituality, the secret of the white fire, and it has three points to hint at this secret. The secret of the Sheva is the secret of the attribute of judgment, and to act strongly, it is mixed with the Segol because the Sheva is pure judgment, and the Segol is complete mercy. This is the secret of "Ehyeh" in its vocalization and combination and in its simple form.
Rabbi Nechunya also wrote that this Name pertains to Chesed, divided into 72 bridges, each bridge having one of these names. He called them bridges as a metaphor for crossing the waters of Chesed. This Name is derived from the verses: "And He journeyed, and He came, and He stretched out" (Exodus 14:19-21), with the first verse in order, the second in reverse, and the third in order again. How? "And He journeyed" represents the secret of Chesed straightforwardly, "And He came" in reverse represents the secret of Gevurah, and "And He stretched out" straightforwardly represents Tiferet. This is explained in the Zohar. The Zohar states in Parashat Beshalach (51b): "The arrangement of these letters, the first letters are written in order in a straight path. Because all the first letters are found in Chesed to go straightforwardly in a correct arrangement. The second letters are written in reverse order. Because all the second letters are found in Gevurah to reveal judgments and weapons coming from the left side. The third letters are written in order to show the beauty to be adorned in the Holy King. And all are connected and bound together, and He is adorned with His crowns in a straight path, inscribed on both sides like a king adorned with all. Here the Holy Name is inscribed in 72 letters crowned with the Patriarchs in a supreme holy array. If you ask why the third letters are not all written straightforwardly or in reverse, it is to balance both sides, for it is said, 'You have established upright paths' (Isaiah 26:7), the Holy One makes paths for both sides, and it is written, 'And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end' (Exodus 26:28), which is the Holy One. Rabbi Yitzchak said, 'This is Jacob, and all is one.' Therefore, the King, who is complete in all, His mind is complete in all. What is the way of this King? His face shines like the sun always because He is complete. And when He judges, He judges favorably and unfavorably. Therefore, one must be cautious of Him. A fool sees the King’s face shining and smiling and does not guard himself from Him. A wise person sees the King’s face shining and says, 'Indeed, the King is complete, complete in all, His mind is complete. I see that within this brightness, judgment is seated and concealed, even though it is not visible, for if it were not so, He would not be a complete King. Therefore, one must be cautious of Him.' Thus, the Holy One is always complete in this way and in that way, but is not visible except in the brightness of His face. Therefore, the fools are punished by Him, but the wise are cautious, saying, 'Indeed, the King is complete, although His face appears bright, judgment is concealed within Him.'". Rabbi Yehuda said, "From here it is understood that 'I am YHVH, I do not change' (Malachi 3:6), does not switch to another place. In Me, all is included. These two aspects are included in Me, therefore, all appears straightforward." Even though the letters are held to one side and the other, they are written in order. 
These words are sweeter than honey and the honeycomb, explained and clarified. It is evident from this text that the verse "And He stretched out" pertains to Tiferet, as indicated by the context there. The combination of the Name from the verse "And He came" pertains to Gevurah. In the Tikunim (Tikun 48, 112b), it is the opposite: "Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, etc., and made the sea into dry land by the strength of Gabriel, the emissary of Gevurah who is appointed over dryness, and therefore it is said 'and made the sea into dry land.' On the side of Uriel, the emissary of the middle pillar, who separates between water and fire, it is said, 'and came between the camp of Egypt, which is foreign fire, and the camp of Israel.'" 
This shows that the verse "And He stretched out" is in Gevurah, and the verse "And He came" in Tiferet, contrary to the combination of the Name because the verse "And He came" is reversed, which is the judgment of Gevurah, and the verse "And He stretched out" straightforwardly from the side of the mercy of Tiferet. It is challenging, but it can be explained that when we examine his language carefully, he said "on the side of Uriel" and "in the strength of Gabriel," indicating that "and made the sea into dry land" was always in Tiferet through Uriel, his angel. However, it was in the strength of Gabriel because the dryness (meaning the power to dry) is from the side of Gevurah, thus performed by the power of his angel, even though it is an action influenced by Tiferet. Similarly, he said "on the side of Uriel, he separates, etc.," meaning even though the action was performed by the power of Gevurah. Since the one standing between water and fire is Tiferet, it had to be in Gevurah from its aspect with Tiferet. Therefore, he said, "on the side of Uriel, etc.," and he precisely said "the middle pillar" because he is the intermediary. This explanation is suitable for the time being, and in our commentary "Ohr Yakar," the matter is extended with God's help. Even though these three verses hint at the three Patriarchs, the overall Name is in Chesed as hinted at in the prayer of Rabbi Nehunya, and so Chesed is 72. The words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in many places are beyond measure. There is no wonder in this, as it is known that the nature of the part is not like the whole because each one has its own existence as we elaborated in the Gate of Existences.

1. The intention now is to explain the Name of 42 letters, and it is called so for it consists of 42 letters, as we will explain. This is the name with its vocalization:
2. Abgayitatz Qera'Shetan Negad Yekash Betar Tzetag Khaqbatna' Yegalpzaq Shequtzit
3. Therefore, as we have vocalized it, so do we find it in the prayer of Rabbi Nehunya. According to the words of a Kabbalist based on those revealed by angel, it is written as follows: "אבגיתץ" is vocalized with a patach and sheva, with the aleph, bet, and gimel vocalized with patach, and the yod with sheva, and the tav with patach and dagesh. "קרע שטן" the Qof with sheva, the resh with patach, the shin with sheva, and the tet with kamatz. "נגד יכש" in this way: the nun with sheva, the gimel with patach, the dalet with sheva, the yod with patach, and the kaf also with patach. "בטר צתג" the bet with sheva, the tet with patach, the tzadi with sheva, and the tav with patach. "חקבטנע" the chet with patach, the kuf with sheva, the bet with patach and dagesh, the tet with sheva and dagesh, the nun with patach, and the ayin without vocalization. "יגל פזק" the yod with sheva and dagesh, the gimel with patach without dagesh, the peh with dagesh and sheva, the zayin with patach, and the kuf without any vocalization. "שקוצית" is vocalized in this way: the shin with kamatz, the kuf with sheva, the vav with kamatz, and the tzadi with chiriq. This is its vocalization. It is known that the secret of the patach is a great secret to open from above the gates of complete mercies because it is complete mercies. And the secret of the kamatz (Psalms 87:10) "Kafatz (jump) with anger, his mercies," meaning if you vocalize it with kamatz, it jumps with anger, and be careful not to vocalize it with kamatz except to exact vengeance. In place of the sheva, use chiriq, and with it, you will achieve wondrous wonders. With patach, you will achieve the actions of mercies and open blessings until there is no more, as it is written (Malachi 3) "If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out..." This is in relation to our matter. And now let us return to the explanation of the name, which is hinted at in the Sefirah of Gevurah, and its source is from the verse "In the beginning, God created" until the "bet" of "and the earth" (Genesis 1:1-2). Thus, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai explained in the Tikunim, in Tikun 4, as follows: Rabbi Shimon stood on his feet and said, "Master of the Worlds, open my eyes to see them above. I will come in the Name of 42 letters, the name explained to know each letter and its arrangement. And they are 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was formless and void.'" "בראשית ברא אלה ימאת הש מימואת הארצוה ארצהית התהווב." And they are: אבגיתץ קרע שטן נגדיכש בטרצתג חקבטנע יגלפזק שקוצית. Each letter has a saying, and each has a path. Ten sayings are they, and 32 paths, and all depend on "IYH," and this is "Ab" with 42 letters, acknowledging "YH," "IYH," in the calculation acknowledging "YH" ("YH" is Wisdom and Understanding, "A" is the higher Crown). And these are the seven Sefirot included in the seven names, and all are included in the seventh. 
4. The measure of the verse is "Open to me the gates of righteousness," which is the Shechinah when it is called "Bat Sheva" for it is included from these seven names which are the seven Sefirot. Then it is called righteousness, from the other side of the paths and sayings. After that, I will come in the name of 42 letters, which are ten sayings and 32 paths, and each letter has a power from the sayings or the paths. "Acknowledge YH" are the first three remaining.
5. Therefore, the explanation of this name's source is from the verse "In the beginning, God created" until the "bet" of "and the earth," and there is some confusion as we will write. There are those who divided these letters into three parts, which are three hands: the right hand, the high hand, and the strong hand. And this is its arrangement with its vocalization: בראשית ברא אלה ימ - This is the great right hand. אתהש מימואתהא רצ - This is the high hand of mercies. והארצה יתהתהו וב - This is the strong hand.
6. And it is also written that these 42 letters are at the end of the Torah, in the verse "And all the mighty hand and all the great terror" (Deuteronomy 34:12). There also are three hands, and they are these: "And all the mighty hand" until "the end" - this is the first hand. "All the great terror which" until "the end" - this is the second hand. "Moses performed before the eyes of all" until "the end" - this is the third hand. Thus I found. And it is possible that these points (vocalizations) are like the points (vocalizations) of the letters in the Name from "In the beginning" as we hinted above. And we have heard it said that these are the words of the pious and wise Rabbi Shlomo Molcho, of blessed memory. In this Name, we found in the book "HaKanah" names whose initial letters form the 42-letter Name, and it appears that these are a garment for this Name. These are the names as he wrote in his book:
7. Adiriron, Bihariron, Gebiriron, Yagbihayah, Telamyah, Tzetanya', Qedamiyah, Regaryah, `Ariryah, Shega`ayah, Telatyah, Naharyah, Nishmaryah, Ge'aryah, Deharyah, Ye`alyah, Kasyah, Shinyonyah, Bo'alyah, Todaryah, Ramyah, Tzatzitzyah, Tehabehyah, Galgalyah, Chinanyah, Qataqayah, Behabehabyah, Tawhawayah, Nitanyah, `Amamayah, Yehalsharyah, Gudarayah, Lemimaryah, Peqorqaryah, Zahrayah, Qemalyah, Shatahodrayah, Qadoshyah, Weha'el'elyah, Tze'adyah, Yetahadaryah, Tamtelyah
8. The intention is that the 42 letters of the Name are 42 luminous lights, spiritual forms, and each one's name as mentioned above, indicating the letter of the Name, which is its source. It comes at the beginning of its name as a sign of the letter to indicate that the branch is rooted in the source and the source in the branch, and to show that it is an emanation emanated from that source.I also found in the wise men's repository a method of two 42 (angelic) names whose initials are the holy name, and these are they: Urpaniel, Boel, Gabriel, Yofiel, Tumiel, Tzadqiel, Qabtziel, Rebahiel, 'Aziziel, Shamshiel, Tupiel, Nuriel, Nahliel, Geburiel, Daniel, Yehudiel, Kabshiel, Sha'ariel, Berakiel, Taftafiel, Rahmiel, Tzafuniel, Terumiel, Gedudiel, Hazael, Qumiel, Baraqiel, Tahariel, Nuriel, Amiel, Yishrael, Gadiel, Lehabiel, Panuel, Zakriel, Qadoshiel, Shelgiel, Qarbiel, Wawiel, Tzuriel, Yalpiel, Tabriel.There is no doubt that the ancient names surpass these in their hidden and exalted nature. And there is yet a third method found in the books of the ancients.

The sages, may their memory be blessed, also said, "The forefathers are the chariot themselves." And they did not say that each one of the forefathers was the chariot, but rather that the forefathers are the chariot themselves. How is that? Our father Abraham took the right side in purity and inherited the right side above which is the trait of Kindness [<i>Chesed</i>]. And about this is it stated: <i>Then Abram journeyed by stages toward the South</i> (Genesis 31:9). And Isaac took the trait of the left side in purity, which is Fear. And about this is it stated: <i>and Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac</i> (Genesis 31:53). And Jacob took the middle line in purity. And about this is it stated: <i>and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents, etc.</i> (Genesis 25:27). It comes out that the three forefathers were the chariot. And the words of a sage are a charm [<i>chen, which is also an abbreviation for hidden wisdom, meaning kabbalah]. And that is even though there is a small difference between our path and the path of [the author]. And now we would like to write one more preface about the subject of appellations. </i>

את. All commentators have agreed that this word is in Malkut because it is female. Verily the Rashbi (Zohar Chadash, page 77) explained: א is male, ת is female [as ת is a suffix that can indicate feminine words]. And he said that Malkut is called thus when the power of the male, which she received on her earlier, is being drawn in it. And earlier we have explained this expression itself in the Gate of the Names [Gate XX], chapter 6. And thus he explained at another place: the Torah is composed from א to ת, as by means of the receiving of the male the letters are engraved in her (= the Torah], as will be explained in the Gate of the Letters [Gate XXVII]. Further [we find] its explanation in the Zohar, Parashah Wayechi (page 247a), that when the 32 paths [of Chochmah/Wisdom] are being emanated to Tif’eret from the Upper Torah, ‘an attenuated form of the Chochmah/Wisdom of above [is] Torah’ [Genesis Rabbah 17.5] [comes into being], and Tif’eret does influence to Malkut the just-mentioned 32. Then Malkut is called את. Because as  את shows its being composed with 22 letters [את indicates the first and the last, thus all 22 letters]. And the 32 paths are the 22 letters and the 10 utterances [mentionings of ויאמר in the account of creation in Genesis]. It is found according to this that את is Malkut and points to the totality of this 32 by means of Tif’eret which is the unity of א, male, with ת, female, by means of Chochmah which does emanate the 32 paths in Tif’eret as we have explained. And in Tikkunim [Tikkunei Zohar] its explanation [is]: Yesod is called את. And [here] its explanation is from the word אות, which is as we have explained above at its entry.

הוי. Rashbi, peace be on him, explained [in] parasha “After the death” [Zohar III.74b] that in the departure of Tif’eret which is ו (Wav), with the drawing of the Wav of which the top is the small Wav that is with Yesod which is י (Yud),וי (Wav-Yud) is formed. And when it will depart further to Binah, and the emanation downward is not emanated from her, and the blessings are being hindered there, and the conduit, which is Tif’eret, causing emanation to the whole [world of] Atsilut/Emanation, departs, then it is there called הוי (Hoy). And there is a difference between אוי (Oy) and הוי (Hoy), as in the place that is called אוי (Oy) the cut cannot be annulled by repentance, because there is no ה (Heh) which is repentance; and when it is called הוי (Hoy), the matter still depends on repentance, and repentance annuls [the cut]. And we have [earlier] extended [on this] in the entry אוי (Oy).

<i>Zevul:</i> In Sefer Hashem in the trait of Understanding [<i>Binah</i>], Rabbi Moshe explained, and these are his [words]: <i>Zevul</i> is an expression of grouping, residence and connection. And Scripture states: <i>This time my husband will exalt me [<i>yizbeleini</i>], for I have borne him six sons [...] And then she bore a daughter</i> (Genesis 30:20-21). And my husband is very wise. To here are his [words]. And his intention is that Leah is the hint for Understanding, and she give birth to six sons, which are [the sefirot] from Wisdom [<i>Chockmah</i>] to Foundation [<i>Yesod</i>]. And the daughter is Kinghood [<i>Malkhut</i>]. And the intention of her saying, <i>This time my husband will exalt me</i>, is about the unification of Wisdom and Understanding. And <i>my husband</i> is Wisdom. And so, according to this, Understanding is called <i>Zevul</i> by way of Wisdom's unification with it. And he also wrote in the trait of Splendor [<i>Tiferet</i>], and these are his words: <i>Zevul</i> is an expression [of the usage], <i>This time my husband will exalt me [<i>yizbeleini</i>]</i>. And he is the connector and the one that houses with him the entire building, a man and his household — and they are six. But Solomon said, <i>I have surely built a house of dwelling [<i>zevul</i>] for You</i> (I Kings 8:13), and that is one of the seven firmaments. So this <i>Zevul</i> is not like the <i>Zevul</i> of Understanding. To here are his [words]. And the general principle that comes out of his words is that Splendor is called <i>Zevul</i> when it connects with the six edges [outer sefirot], such that <i>Zevul</i> is an expression of connections, as we explained.

יובל (Yovel/Yuval) is Binah (Understanding). And she is called this way because she completes the fiftieth year in the secret of the Fifty Gates [of Understanding], and she is the fiftieth year, which is the gate that is more marvellous than Moses our teacher, may he rest in peace, as you say (Psalms 8:6): “You have made him a little less [מעט] than divine” [in the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah 21b this verse is applied to Moses]. You should not say מעט but מ"ט [which has the numerical value of 49, thus one less than 50] etc. And this degree [Binah] is called by this name [יובל] when she flows into the fifty gates and gives an influx of abundance and good. And this is the meaning of Yuval, as “and towards a stream [יובל, Yuval] it will extend its roots” (Jeremiah 17:8). And as it will revolve until it has reached the fiftieth gate then in/through it [the fiftieth gate] it will cling to Chochmah (Wisdom). And on this it is said to Moses: “Be silent, thus [כך] it has come up in thought” [Babylonian Talmud, tractate Menachot 29b]. כך is in Gematria 40 [the text reads נ', 50, which is probably a mistake for מ', 40], while silence is in Chochmah which is Yod [י', 10]. And it has come up in thought which is Chochmah. [thus the verse “Be silent, thus it has come up in thought” refers to the fiftieth Gate of Understanding as it counts 10 (Be silent) + 40 (thus) = 50, ascending to Chochmah]. And because of this he [Moses] did not grasp the subject of the death of Rabbi Aqiva [as Moses had attained to only the fourty-ninth Gate of Understanding], because his death was on the side of the judgement, in the secret of the ascent, as will be explained in the Gate of the Soul [Gate 31 of the Pardes Rimonim], chapter 5. And we will return to our subject that in the cleaving of this gate to Chochmah, then it [this gate] is Yuval and then the whole world is mercy and great abundance, liberty and deliverance, and then we will call this degree [Binah] Yovel/Yuval. 

Chapter 11





















<i>Knesset Yisrael</i> (The Assembly of Israel): <i>Shekhina</i> (divine indwelling), <i>Malkhut</i> (divine attribute of kingship) is called <i>Knesset Yisrael</i> (the Assembly of Israel). The reason is explained in the Zohar (see Zohar, Balak 17:224-227 III:197a) with two interpretations in one place. The first interpretation is that this is a term for congregating, so it means a mass gathering, and that name is used because She gathers all the heavenly camps within Her. The second interpretation, “assembly” because the divine abundance is assembled or pooled (<i>kanus</i>) within Her, and She only gives it little by little, and the reason is because of Her great beauty, all is bound to her, and for the lack of merit below, she only pours out the abundance little by little, and it all pools in Her.

We are now obliged to clarify the usefulness of this Shell and its interests in the world, because to say that it is to punish or etc. will not suffice. For the whole object of punishment is asked, it is the evil inclination and the Shell, there will be no Shell and there will be no evil inclination. And it is said that the reason for their creation. in the will of the Creator, is to be that the world and its creatures needed to receive their sustenance and livelihood by the power of law and justice and righteousness, and if they were all non-elective angels in their actions, the world would not benefit from their actions, because they are forced act as angels. And for this reason, man must have a choice, and be inhabited by the evil inclination and the good inclination, that if he, by his own nature, would want to incline towards good, his evil inclination, Samael, would incline him to evil on his left; and when he wants to incline towards evil, on his right will be his good inclination to guilt him, and remind him of the words of his Creator in such a way that he will be rewarded for the inclination, good or bad. And to judge a man according to his deeds, it is necessary that he have aspects which are unclean – as like a slave who rebels against his master – to torment the wicked, so that his wickedness and evils in their numbers will cling to wickedness on its proper side, and so he will receive punishment. This matter is clarified well in the Zohar. All of what the Holy One, Blessed be He, caused Himself to go down in order to show all honorable rituals. (stopped at וכי מאן חמי עבדא)

And see, R. Shimon [bar Jochai] started praising the Book of Concealment (ספרא דצניעותא), which consists of five chapters with in it  the sum/principle of all wisdom of the Kabbalah. And that is why R. Yehudah said that if this is so, it follows that man needs to study only this book. And R. Shimon replied that this is true for one who has entered the Idra and came out. He says "and came out" since ten [companions] entered [the Idra Rabba] and only seven came out, because three [of them] died as is described at the end of the Idra [Rabba; Zohar III:127b-145]. But one who does not enter and does not know the preambles that are revealed there, will not be able to profit from the mysteries of this concealed book. And he [= R. Shimon] makes a comparison with a villager etc. [the mashal just prior to the beginning of the ספרא דצניעותא, Zohar III.176a]. And this for sure applies to one who studies [only] the Written Torah and says that everything is contained in it, as he will remain ignorant of everything; what happened to the villager [of the mashal] will also happen to him. And therefore the essence/main ingredient of the perfection of knowledge of the Written Torah is the Oral Torah, as we have explained.
