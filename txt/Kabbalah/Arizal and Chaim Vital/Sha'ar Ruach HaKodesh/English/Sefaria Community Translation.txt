The unification of the letter Waw according to Rabbi Elazar di Vidash, may his memory be blessed, is based on the name 'Atniq.' The name 'Atniq' is derived from the verse 'and she bore Cain' (Genesis 4:1), and it draws from the name 'Anaktam' because the Yod in the name 'Atniq' is replaced by the Mem in 'Anaqtam' through the cipher of Atbash. The secret of the name 'Anaqtam' as mentioned, has the numerical value of 560, which corresponds to the total of the five letters of the final forms (Mantzepach) that represent judgments.
Now, the two occurrences of Mantzepach together have the numerical value of 560, which represents five upper judgments and five lower judgments, and this is the secret of 'Qiset HaSofer' (the scribe's seat) mentioned with Gabriel in the Book of Ezekiel. Therefore, it is necessary to connect and combine the name Gabriel with the name 'Anaqtam' in this way: AGNBQDTYMAL (AGNBQRTYMAL ).' The vocalization of these three names is as follows: The first is ANQTM, which is vocalized from the verse 'And God heard their groaning (na'aqatam)' (Exodus 2:24), whose letters are 'ANQTM' and 'Gabriel' is vocalized from the verse 'And the man Gabriel' (Daniel 9:21), and 'Atniq' is vocalized from the word 'HaSofer.'
The explanation of these three names is as follows: The first three letters are AAG, which have the numerical value of 5. The second set of letters is 'Netav,' and with the first three letters and the 'kolel' (the inclusive one), their value is 458 (Tanakh), which is the secret of the three names of Ehyeh in their full forms (Aleph-Heh-Yod-Heh) with the Yods, Alephs, and Hé's, which total 455, and with the three names, we have 458.
The third set of letters is 'QND,' which equals 154, the numerical value of 'Shemayim' (Heaven), which is also the numerical value of 184, corresponding to the two forms of the divine names YHVH in 72 and 63. The fourth set of letters is 'Tii,' which has the value of the three full forms of Ehyeh mentioned above, which total 492, and with the 28 letters of the full expansion of the name YHVH, the total is 420. The fifth and final set of letters is 'MQLA' and 'MQAL,' which have the numerical value of 161, which is the full form of Ehyeh (in its din form), which equals 161, and with the ten letters, the total is 171.

The unification of the letter Chet, according to the aforementioned, is based on the name 'Nubub.' This name has a numerical value of 60 (samekh), which is the secret of the sixty warriors surrounding her, and the secret of sixty refers to the sefirah of Malkut. Within it is hinted the Tetragrammaton (YHVH) of the name Ban (associated with the final Heh's), and what remains are the letters Bet and Vav. With their 'kolel' (inclusive one), they total nine, corresponding to the nine letters of the Tetragrammaton of Ban.
Its vocalization comes from the verse 'hollow tablets' (Exodus 34:1), as the Sheva (a type of vowel) corresponds to the last letter Tav, which is shortened (i.e., abbreviated). Keep this rule in mind: whenever the final letter of a word is unvocalized in the scripture, it must be vocalized with a Sheva. Now, this name must also be exchanged through the Atbash cipher to 'ṬŠPŠ,' which has the numerical value of 233, corresponding to the four Tetragrammatons (YHWH) of 72, 63, 45, and 52, which together equal 233 with the kolel. Additionally, there are three names 'Ehyeh' in their full spellings with Yods, Alephs, and Hehs, which equal 455 and 70. 455 and 233 together total 689, which is the same numerical value as 'ṬŠPŠ' mentioned earlier
