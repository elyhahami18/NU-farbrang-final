Sha'ar HaPesukim

Parashat Bereshit

















(From someone else:) Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to the land that it should bring out fruit trees that make fruit, such that its tree [wood] and its fruit be the same [edible], but the land transgressed His command, may He be blessed, and brought out trees that make fruit, so that its tree and its fruit were not the same. But behold, its thought about this was for the good of Adam the first man, so that he should not err later in understanding His command, may He be blessed, when He said to him, <i>But from the Tree […] you shall not eat from it</i> (Genesis 2:17). And behold, the tree and the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge were the same. So Adam could have erred and said, “I was commanded about the tree and not about its fruit, and I only ate from its fruit.” And that was exactly the deceit of the snake, when it stated, <i>Now the serpent was more cunning, etc. and it said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden?’”</i> (Genesis 3:1). Meaning from the tree was forbidden, but not from the fruit. But Eve answered him that also from the fruit was forbidden. And that is its saying, <i>It is only about fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden</i> (Genesis 3:3). But afterward, she went back and conceded to the words of the snake, [as demonstrated] by its saying, <i>And the woman saw that the tree was good, etc.</i> (Genesis 3:6). Meaning, if she had seen that the wood of the [Tree of] Knowledge was not good for food, but rather [only] its fruit, she would have said, “If so, when the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us, <i>But from the Tree of Knowledge, you shall not eat from it</i>, His intention was not about the tree itself, since it is inedible. Indeed, the understanding of His words is that they not eat its actual fruit.” However, now that she saw that the tree itself was good for food, she then said, “If so, when God, may He be blessed, commanded us, <i>But from the Tree of Knowledge, you shall not eat from it</i>, it was about the tree itself that He commanded us, and not about the fruit.” Then, <i> she took from its fruit and ate</i>. For she thought they were not commanded about the fruit, but about the tree, since it was also edible, as its tree and its fruit were the same. And that is why it began [this verse] by saying, <i>that the tree was good for eating</i>, and it did not mention the fruit. But afterward, with the eating, the fruit is mentioned, not the tree. And that is why the land brought out a tree that makes fruit, and not a fruit tree, to indicate to Adam that the intention of His saying, <i>But from the Tree of Knowledge, you shall not eat from it</i>, was about the fruit. (To here is from someone else.)

We must explain the idea of the exile in Egypt here; and through it, many verses scattered here and there will be understood. What the idea is of the cause for the exile of the Jewish people being exiled among the nations has already been explained in Parashat Re'eh, concerning the rememberace of the exile from Egypt. And we said that Adam the first man included all of the souls. But when he sinned, all of those souls fell from him into the husks distributed among the seventy nations. So the Jewish people has to be exiled there, to each and every nation, to collect the holy flowers of souls that were scattered among those thorns. And it is like the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesachim 87b), "Why are the Jewish people exiled among the peoples? In order that converts will add themselves to them, etc." And understand this well.

You should know that Zelophehad is the root of the judgments [<i>gevurot</i>]. And that is why he has the letters <i>tzadi, lamed peh, chet, dalet</i> [which spells <i>tzel pachad</i>, the shadow of fear]. And his five daughters are the five judgments. And these are the same five judgments that remained in the Foundation [<i>Yesod</i>] of the Small Face [<i>Zeir Anpin</i>], and do not go to Kinghood [<i>Malkhut</i>]. Rather, other new judgments come, and are given to Kinghood, as is known. And that is why our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, was in doubt whether they had a portion and inheritance in the land, which is Kinghood. And the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him that since they shine upon Kinghood, they are fitting to take a portion in the land. So behold, of these five judgments, three are sweetened by the kindnesses [<i>chassadim</i>], whereas the other two are not sweetened, as is known. And behold, the three that are sweetened are Choglah, Milkhah, and Tirtzah. And the understanding of Choglah is <i>chag lah</i> [she has a festival], since she is sweet. Milkah's name [related to queen] is also an indication about her. Tirtzah, as well, is an expression of wanting [<i>ratzon</i>] and kindness. And the two that are not sweetened are Machlah and Noa. Machlah is <i>mach lah</i>, which is derived from the usage, <i>And He blotted out [Vayimach] all existence</i> (Genesis 7:23). And Noa is derived from the usage, <i> The earth shall reel [noa] to and fro</i> (Isaiah 24:20).

<b>Section 65:</b>
<i>Silence is praise to You, O God in Zion, and to You a vow is paid.</i> (Psalms 65:2).
He said, behold You know everything that is in my heart, so I would not need to thank, praise and pray before You, but rather to be silent. And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, <i> Silence is praise to You</i>. Also for this reason, one should not have vowed an oath to You at a time of distress, but rather to think [it] in the heart. And afterward, <i> and to You a vow is paid</i>, when You rescue me, even if I do not vow orally. And likewise [should I] give charity without a vow. And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, <i>to You</i>. It means to say, that the vow be to You: Since You know my thoughts, it would have been enough to pay the vow and not to make it orally. However, what we see is that You desire to be <i>The One who hears prayer</i> (Psalms 65:3). So You have warned us with a positive commandment to pray to You. And the reason for it is in order that <i>to You all flesh shall come</i>. For the righteous ones who know Your greatness, whose thoughts are revealed before You, were the only ones to pray to You in thought. Whereas other people would not pray at all in thought. Yet now, when they show others that they pray [silently], we learn their ways and all people of flesh pray [silently]. And since this is so, it comes out that <i>The words of my iniquities</i> (Psalms 65:4) – meaning the recounting that I recount and organize the confession before you of the words of my iniquities; these words of confession <i>have multiplied</i> needlessly, since they are revealed before You. And [even] without this, <i>our transgressions, You purge them away</i>. Even if I did not confess, the words of my iniquities and my transgressions are before You.
