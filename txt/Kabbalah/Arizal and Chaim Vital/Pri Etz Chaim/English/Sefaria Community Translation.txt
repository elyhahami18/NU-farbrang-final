Chapter 1




















However the last kaddish is not included in these, since all of the worlds already ascended. Indeed, this kaddish is called the orphan's kaddish. The explanation is that the secret of this kaddish is that it is in order to raise up all the dead souls, with the secret of the revival of the dead. And that is why orphans, whose fathers and mothers have died, say it. And the idea is that it has [God's] name of 42 [letters] in a different way, and it is hinted at in the washing of the hands. And you should know that through the name, <i>bet, mem, vav, kaf, samech, zayin</i> [letters spelling out, our God, in a letter substitution scheme], there is revival, through the secret of: <i>I kill and I bring to life</i> (Deuteronomy 32:39). As this name is in <i>Gevurah</i> [Might]; and with that which the Holy One, blessed be He, kills, with that same thing He brings to life. That is why before this name, there is the name, <i>kaf, vav, zayin, vav</i> [letters spelling the tetragrammaton according to the same scheme]. As its numerical count is <i>tal</i> [dew], with which the dead will be revived. But you should know that the addition of Shabbat extends throughout the Shabbat day. However on mundane days, the additional holiness is only at the time of prayer. That is why there is only an addition to the soul exclusively on Shabbat. But nevertheless, for those that fear the Lord and for those who esteem His name (alluding to Malachi 3:16), there is a little enlightenment during the time of prayer even on mundane days. And understand this. There is another distinction, that the addition of holiness on Shabbat comes by itself from all of that which we do on mundane days through our prayers. There is yet another distinction, that on Shabbat all of the worlds ascend; whereas during mundane days, it is only the existence of the souls that ascend together with the divine presence through the secret of the feminine waters.

[Regarding] the matter of <i>al hanissim</i>, you have already known what is written in the [Tikkunei Zohar] — that <i>Netzach</i> [Victory] and <i>Hod</i> [Majesty] are the two remembrances, about which it is said, <i>I surely remembered</i> (Exodus 3:16). And they are Chanukah and Purim, through which the lights of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> are revealed. So behold [God's] actual name is in <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Adonai</i> is in <i>Hod</i>, [as] mentioned in the [Tikkunei Zohar]. And that is <i>Mah</i> [an aspect of God with a numerical equivalent of 45] and  <i>Adonai</i>, the numerical equivalent of which is <i>nes</i> [the numerical equivalent being (the sum of) 50 and 60]. And <i>Yesod</i> [Foundation], which includes 50 gates, is included in them, the numerical equivalent of which is that of <i>yod-mem</i> [10 and 40]. That is why <i>al ha nissim</i>, [<i>nissim</i>, miracles, is] is called<i>nun-samech yod-mem</i> [50 and 60, 10 and 40]. So behold, it comes out that <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> are called <i>nissim</i>. That is why we recite <i>al hanissim</i> on Chanukah and Purim. His lofty honor: All of the earlier redemptions were through the secret of <i>Hod</i>, and that is why all the songs are in the feminine form, as [the feminine] is in <i>Hod</i>. And even the exodus from Egypt was through Bityah, the daughter of Pharaoh. And that is why it is written: <i>And you shall give from your majesty <i>hod</i> to him</i> (Numbers 27:20). And likewise, the redemption [from] Sisera, was through Deborah and with the woman, Yael. Likewise, the redemption [from] Greece, too, was through the daughter of Mattathias. And that was then with the rectification of <i>Hod</i>. That is why there are eight days of Chanukah, since <i>Hod</i> is the eighth <i>sefirah</i>. And Purim was through Esther. But in the future to come, the redemption will be from the side of <i>Netzach</i>. And that is why the redemption will be permanent <i>nitzchit</i> and enduring, as it is written: <i>And also the Eternal One of Israel does not speak falsely</i> (I Samuel 15:29). And this is [the occasion of Esau's] force [<i>netzach</i>] being splattered on their clothes [referring to Isaiah 63:4], in the secret of, also this corresponding to that, etc.

Chapter 5














So behold, the evil Haman was a great sorcerer, his wife Zeresh was a great sorceress and his ten sons were the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the husk. And he saw tremendous enlightenment and understood that [God] wanted to bring back Kingship (<i>Malkhut</i>) to be 'face to face,' and that the minds, Eternity (<i>Netzach</i>), Majesty (<i>Hod</i>) and Foundation (<i>Yesod</i>) of the Father and the Mother would return to the Small Face  (<i>Zayir Anpin</i>) and not remain in the secret of slumber; and with this, there would be salvation for the Jewish people. Hence he wanted to negate this enlightenment. But behold the numerical equivalent of Haman is <i>tzav</i> (command). And <i>tzav</i> always [refers to] idolatry. As he saw this matter through the husk, which is idolatry, which is in action (<i>assiyah</i>) that rises to [the name,] Lord. And the Holy One, blessed be He, in His mercy, did miracles and wonders for us at this time and negated his plan. And not only that, but He promised us that this enlightenment would always be at this time. And even though the minds would return to their place in the Small Face, this enlightenment remains in Kingship, like it was at that time. And this is [the meaning of] (Esther 9:28), "And these days of Purim, etc. and the memory of them (<i>zikhram</i>) shall never perish (<i>yasuf</i>)" - which is Foundation, which is called the male (<i>zakhar</i>); <i>yasuf</i> is Yosef, which is Foundation. [The verse continues,] "among their descendants," which comes from Rachel. And that which we said that the enlightenment of Foundation of Father was only at the end of seventy years, even though every night, Eternity, Majesty and Foundation of Father enter Kingship, clothed within Eternity, Majesty and Foundation of Mother - such that it would have been fitting every night for the Foundation of Father to be revealed - nevertheless this enlightenment only comes out and becomes recognizable after a long time; and that is why it did not come out until the end of the time of exile.

From Rabbi Chayim Cohen in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak (Ari), may his memory be blessed, who enlightened the eyes of the sages - the order of the arrangement of the Seder plate for the night of Passover: Take the three matzot of <i>shemurah</i> (stringently guarded) matzah and place the [one representing the] priest on top, the [one representing the] Levite below it and the [one representing the] Israelite below it; and these are the three aspects of wisdom, understanding and knowledge (<i>chochmah, binah vedaat</i>)  (in other books, the three minds [<i>mochin</i>]) of the supernal Father. Afterwards take the bitter herbs (<i>marror</i>), the <i>karpas</i>, the shankbone and the egg and place them upon the three matzot - the shankbone which hints to kindness (<i>chesed</i>) on your right, the egg on your left; and the bitter herbs, which hint to harmony, 'extend from end to end' in the middle, between the shankbone and the egg. In other books - because harmony (<i>tiferet</i>) is what mediates between kindness and might (<i>gevurah</i>). And the <i>charoset</i> is on the right, below the shankbone in the right column, corresponding to victory (<i>netzach</i>). And place the <i>karpas</i>, which hints to splendor (<i>hod</i>), below the egg on the left in the left column. And place the horseradish below the bitter herbs in the middle column, to make the sandwich later on, and that corresponds to foundation (<i>yesod</i>). And the plate itself, which includes them all, corresponds to majesty (<i>malkhut</i>).

Gate of Rosh Hashana

Introduction







Chapter 1






When the world was created in Tishrei (Libra) and everything returns to its original condition, there is a need for the sawing [of the unified male-female energy].  The sawing is the following:  it is to give the sawing all the judgment, with mercy only remaining. And the judgment is sweetened with various sweets (that we will explain further below).  The sawing occurs in these ten days.  Each day, one of the attributes are sawed.  It is known that the head of the [female-energy called] Nukvah is back-to-back with his chest and from there and above is the place called Leah, as it is known that his pairing with her happens during these days.  Rachel is not fully sawed (separated) until Yom Kippur and does not couple until Shmini Atzeret.
On the first day of Rosh Hashana, the head of Zeir Anpin (small face) until but not including his Tiferet, the sawings are all taken during these days and it is therefore harsh judgment.  On the second day of Rosh Hashana where the sawing begins on the most elevated section of his Netzach.  This corresponds
