<b>6</b>And if one would ask, "And is it not that <i>yekhasseh</i> [will cover] and <i>yeoafef</i> [will fly] that are before you (in Isaiah 6:2) are in the future tense [even though the context shows that it is actually something that already happened]" — we would answer that it is the way of Scripture to place the future tense in place of the past in a case when it is speaking about something that happens continuously. For example: <i>But a mist would arise [ya'aleh]</i> (Genesis 2:6); <i>according to the word of the Lord did they encamp [yachanu]</i> (Numbers 9:20), and that whole section.
<b>7</b>And you should know that it is [also] the way of Scripture to speak with the past tense in place of the future. And this is usually found with words of prophecy. Since the matter is clear before the Omnipresent, it is as if it already happened.
And in Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, it is the opposite. As most [uses of] the future tense found in them are in place of the past. And so too is it in the Song at the Sea and in Parashat Ha'azinu. But in narratives of events, very, very few [cases] like this are to be found.
