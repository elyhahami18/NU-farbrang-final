Introduction



Letter Alef










10) Our father Abraham, peace be upon him: The Holy One, blessed be He, compared him to rain. Accordingly, the words <i>Abram, "Surely go" [<i>Avram, "Lekh lekhah</i>"] (Genesis 12:1) is the numerical equivalent [<i>gematria</i>] of rain  [<i>geshem</i>]. Just like rain is enclosed in the clouds, and no one knows its nature, but when it falls to the earth, everyone benefits from it; so too [Abraham's] nature did not go out into the world when he was in his [previous] place. And just like rain brings blessing to the world, so too you — <i>and you shall be a blessing</i> (Genesis 12:2). And Rabbenu Ephraim also wrote at length [about this] in his commentary. And it is possible even to say that Avraham is the numerical equivalent of precipitation [<i>matar</i>] when being inclusive [adding the word itself to the count, a tool used when the equivalent is off by one].</i>

When the Messiah comes, there will be fifteen days of darkness like the darkness of Egypt and all of the evil ones will die [then] — the holy Zohar, Shemot, on the verse <i>for, behold, darkness shall cover the earth</i> (Isaiah 60:2), page 6.

5) <b>The Crossing of</b> the Red Sea was in the merit of the righteous Joseph. It is as our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Midrash Tehillim 114:4), "<i>The sea saw and fled</i> (Psalms 114:3) — it saw Joseph's casket." And it is possible to hint [to this], since the words, Red Sea [<i>Yam Suf</i>], are the letters of, from Joseph [<i>meYosef</i>, and that is easy to understand. And see Bereishit Rabbah 84, and see the sweet things at the beginning of the enlightening book, Parashat Derakhim, as per [the author's] way, [to provide] wisdom in every direction.
