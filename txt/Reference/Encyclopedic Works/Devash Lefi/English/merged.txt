<b>New insights: </b>Later scholars may be able to devise new insights that earlier scholars were not able to devise, because the time for this new insight had not yet arisen (Binyan Yehoshua, in his introduction, in the name of our teacher, the rabbi, Rabbi Hertz, may his memory be blessed); and see Nachal Eshkol, p. 12b. And in the Zohar 3:185b [Balak 4:20], they said, "All those who have made efforts [to understand] the Torah and devised new insights, their words have been immediately reported to the members of the Academy, etc.," see there. And it appears that something is missing in the words, see there and see the introduction of the rabbi [author of] Lev Aryeh, see there.



8 <i>Challah</i> Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Vayikra Rabba 15:6), "Anyone who fulfills the commandment of challah, it is as though he abolished idolatry." And the rabbi [author of] Korban Shabbat, p. 28b explained that He, may He be blessed, surely commanded about challah, "The first of your kneading-troughs, etc." (Numbers 15:20); and likewise the priestly tithe and the first fruits, because He, may He be blessed, is the First, so as to negate those who err that the world was pre-existing. And hence, one who fulfills the commandment of challah to show that He, may He be blessed, pre-existed [the world] abolishes idolatry. And there, he cited the rabbi [author] of Torat Chaim on the chapter [entitled] Chelek, that this is the reason that we recite the blessing [on bread] over [the portion] where it got baked first. And that is why Rav Ashi asked, "How do they worship idolatry?" See the statement in the Talmud there at length.

<b>10. Sukkah</b> In Chapter Five of Batra (Bava Batra 75a:6):  Rabbi Yochanan said, "In the future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will prepare a sukkah for the righteous from the skin of the leviathan [...] If one is deserving, a sukkah is prepared for him; if one is not deserving, a <i>tziltzal</i> [shade] is prepared for him." And Rashi explained, a sukkah is a roof and four partitions; a shade is a roof without partitions. And Rabbi [Chaim Abulafia, the author of] Yashresh Yaakov, page 105b, explains in the name of our master, the teacher, Rabbi Baruch Barzilai that Torah scholars will merit a fit sukkah of a room and partitions, but those who [just] fulfill commandments will only merit a roof without partitions. And that is [based on] that which they, may their memory blessed, said (Yalkut Shimoni 935:1), "In the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will prepare the sukkah of those who perform commandments adjacent to the Torah scholars." And that is because we have established that the excess [covering] that goes beyond the sukkah is considered like a sukkah (Sukkah 19a). There is an opinion that says [only] in front of it, and there is an opinion that says [only] in back of it. [But] everyone holds that the sukkah protects the excess on one side, to make it fit [as a sukkah]. That is why He arranges [it] adjacent to the Torah scholars, to make it fit, since they don't have partitions to make it fit. This is the essence of his words, may he be blessed. And even though one can argue with his words, may he be blessed, the idea is sweet. And the crown of my head, my father, my teacher, may his memory be a blessing for life in the world to come, would say in his introduction to the Yalkut Reuveni that one who supports a Torah scholar will be taught Torah by him in the world to come. And now it works well, since his place is reserved adjacent to the Torah scholar. As he, too, is a valiant one who [will] know the Torah. And this is how he would explain, <i>The Lord shall grant strength to His people</i> (Psalms 29:11) — in the future, to the one who supports the Torah scholar. Hence <i>the Lord shall bless His people with peace</i>. For if this were not so, it would be a great distress to dwell there, as he would not know what the rabbis say. And see Midbar Kedemot, Section 49:36.

The wicked Pharaoh and Egypt had three evil beliefs. The first was that the world always existed. The second was that He does the good, but He does not do the bad; the third is that He does not watch over [human] beings. Hence, before anything, the blood of his god, being the Nile, was afflicted. Its blood was smitten upon its head. And from this, it became known that there is a God in the world. And He accordingly said to him: <i>Through this, you will know that I am the Lord</i> ( Exodus 7:17). And with the plague of the frogs, [Moses] said: <i>so that you will know that there is none like the Lord, our God</i> (Exodus 8:6), who strikes with the frogs. But when our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, prayed, Moses removed the frogs through his prayer and left the rest of them in the Nile. So it became known that there is none like our God and that everything is according to His will, that which is good, and that which is not good; and that He is One in all of the worlds. And with the plague of the mix of dangerous wild animals, He said: <i>I am the Lord in the midst of the world</i> (Exodus 8:18), who looks over the smallest details, to destroy the rebels and to save those that trust in Him. So [God’s] detailed providence was recognizable. And that is the meaning of <i>I am the Lord in the midst of the world</i>. To here are the words of the commentators. But I humbly wrote that there is a negation of every part of all of his false beliefs in each one of these [plagues], blood, frogs, and the mix of dangerous wild animals. It is as I humbly wrote in Nachal Kedumim, Parashat Veara, see there at length.

<b>Did you fix</b> set times for Torah study? That is what they ask him in the world to come, as it is written in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Madlikin. But at the beginning of Midrash Shmuel: Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Chilkiyah said in the name of Rabbi Simon, “One who makes his Torah study set times rescinds the covenant.” And what is his reason? <i>It is time to act for the Lord; they have rescinded Your Torah</i> (Psalms 119:126). However, this is ostensibly difficult. For that which they ask him in the world to come is “Did you fix set times for Torah study!” So how could they say, “he rescinds the covenant?” However, Rabbi [Yaakov Pardo, the author of] Mishkenot Yaakov has already explained – as is explained in the commentary on Midrash Shumuel that was printed in Amsterdam – that if a man must engage in business to support his household and his children or he is involved with the needs of the community, that is someone who must set fixed times for Torah study, and not let the time that he has set to study pass by. And for this man, it is enough that he set fixed times for Torah study, and he [thereby] fulfills his obligation. But if he has several hours that he does not have any occupation, yet he spends days and nights in laughter, strolling and wasteful things and [tries to] exempt himself with that which he studies a certain fixed time – it is about this and that which is similar to it that they said, “One who makes his Torah study set times rescinds the covenant.” And these words are correct and true.<br>And Rabbi Menashe Azariah [of Fano], may his memory be blessed, explained that he should set his fixed time and not switch; today at one time and tomorrow at another time. However, if he fixed a time and studied; and afterward, he studied several more times, behold that is praiseworthy.
