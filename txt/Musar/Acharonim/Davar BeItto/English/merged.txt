Davar BeItto

Introduction







Epilogue

And it should also be raised to our brothers, the Children of Israel, to whom God has given their lot to be in Torah, that it is a great commandment to fulfill that which our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 9a), "A Torah scholar is required to learn three matters: Writing, slaughter and circumcision." And Rashi explained that even regarding slaughter - meaning even if he is an expert in the laws - he needs to train his hands for it. And if they required Torah scholars to learn this in the days in which expert and proper slaughterers were found in every place, all the more so in our time is it fitting and correct for each Jew who occupies himself with Torah to learn the laws of slaughter and to train his hands in this craft, at least with the slaughter of fowl - [now] when a large portion of the Jewish people, and especially the youth, travel to different places, and even in places where not many Jews are found and the slaughterers found there are generally lesser individuals who do not know the laws of slaughter clearly, and there are some among them who violate the words of the Torah, from whom it is not fitting to eat from their slaughter according to the law; and there are also some who travel to places in which no Jew is found at all and have no possibility of attaining kosher meat at all. And with this, he would earn merit for himself and also for others, since he could provide them with kosher meat. And I heard this about a great Torah scholar, that when it came up that he should travel to places in which one should be concerned about the propriety of their slaughter, he first learned [how to] slaughter fowl. And it is certainly an obligation on the young Torah scholars to do so.
