Introduction


<b><i>For the commandment is a lamp, the Torah is a light, and the way to life is the rebuke that disciplines</i> (Proverbs 6:24):</b>
<b>The simple understanding</b> of the verse is that the commandment is like a lamp to give off light in front of you, as it is written, <i>the commandment of the Lord is lucid, making the eyes light up</i> (Psalms 19:9); w,hereas Torah is a light to those that study it, while a fool walks in darkness [alluding to Ecclesiastes 2:14]. But behold there are two understandings of a lamp and a light. The first is that a single lamp is called a lamp, whereas a light is a big torch. And this agrees with what the sages, may their memory be blessed, gathered about and decided (Kiddushin 40b), "The study of Torah is greater, as it leads to action." It called a commandment, which is an action, a lamp; and the Torah, which is study, a light. A second understanding is that in the lamp itself, the light is connected to the lamp. For the lamp is the receptacle of the light, meaning the candle or the wick in the oil in a vessel, and the light holds on to it. So they cling to one another and need one another. For the light of the lamp does not have anything to hold on to without the lamp, since the existence of the light, without something to hold onto, returns to its original source [and becomes latent]. The lamp also does not have any luminescence without the light that holds onto it. 
So too is the commandment of study a cause for the action, like that which we learned (Avot 2:5), "Hillel says, 'A boor does not fear sin.'" However study does not have anything to hold on to without action, like that which we learned (Avot 3:9), "Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa says, 'Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom is preserved, etc.'" But, at first glance, these two things contradict one another. Yet if you delve into it properly, you will see that both of them are true. A person may not come to the crown of Torah if he does not have preparation through the fear of sin, such that his soul longs for clinging to the Lord, may He be blessed. But a pure heart longs and desires for [this] clinging. For without it, it is stated, <i>And to the wicked, God said, "Who are you to recite My laws"</i> (Pslams 50:17). Hence he must be clothed, to have the fear of God before his face. However, the details of the fear of sin and the commandments, the laws and the statutes, their general rules and their details are still hidden from him until he merits the crown of Torah. Then he will come from study to action with all, from all [to do] all.
It can also, be answered in a different way, one that is more internal: Torah is action and analysis, revealed and hidden. That which is revealed in the Torah is the practice of its commandments, which are the 248 positive commandments; and the guarding of its prohibitions, which are the 365 negative commandments. But there are [also] hidden reasons for these and those divine secrets that are all attached to His great name. About those that know them, it is stated, <i>I will set him on high, because he has known My name</i> (Psalms 91:14); and they are embodied by, <i>and you who cling to the Lord, your God</i> (Deuteronomy 4:4). So behold the order of levels is like this: A boor does not fear sin, etc.; rather he must first study the 613 commandments. Then the study will bring him to action and he will become, one who fears sin. Afterward, when he arrives at this virtue, all of his actions are a ladder to climb to analysis, which is the hidden part [of Torah] and he will merit to behold the pleasantness of the Lord [alluding to Psalms 27:4]. And this is the true wisdom — knowledge of the secrets of the commandments, which are the divine secrets. And it is for this wisdom that he needs to have it preceded by the fear of sin, as it is written, <i>See, fear of the Lord is wisdom</i> (Job 28:28). And then his wisdom will be preserved, and secrets of the Torah will be revealed to him, to be a sage who understands on his own. And this is a matter that we have seen and heard from many pious ones: Before their occupation with divine secrets, they would be examining [their] deeds, confessing their sins, and clothing themselves with the fear of God.

It comes out that all of the descriptions mentioned about Him, may He be blessed — eye, ear, foot, hand, and likewise all of them; and also the matter of coupling, hugging, kissing, mother and father, son and daughter, his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, and many things like this -- all of these are holy expressions, the essence of these nouns being about holiness. And afterward, it was borrowed in a descending process until even the physical became called by these words, by way of borrowing [them]. Then it becomes understood that just the opposite, all of the limbs of the parts of the chariot are, in their essence, names about Him, may He be blessed; and that is the Supernal Man. And all of the names of the powers of our limbs are borrowed, and are called this way symbolically for that which is above; just like Reuben the son of Jacob is symbolic, as written by the author of [Shaarei] Orah. And the Holy One, blessed be He, created the earthly man symbolically like the Supernal Man. Given that he is a chariot in his true existence, there are rarified internal and completely spiritual things and concepts, which are the parts of the chariot, from which spread the light and the flow for the preservation of this existing thing, which is modeled after it. And they are called hands, feet, eyes, and ears. It is not that the nature of the [human] hand is like the [true] hand, or the structure of the [human] hand like the [true] hand, God forbid! As it is written, <i>To whom can you liken God, etc.</i> (Isaiah 40:18). And there is no similarity between Him and us at all, from the angle of essence and structure. Indeed, we are fashioned and made in this model to teach that if one merits to purify one of his limbs and to perfect it through the commandments that depend upon it, that limb will be like a model of the chariot and [God’s] glorious throne concerning that supernal internal thing that is called by this name. If it is an eye, then eye; if it is a hand, then hand; if it is a foot, then foot, and likewise the other limbs.

And from this, we will understand very well what has disappeared from the eyes of researchers in what they have examined regarding, heaven forbid, a change in God's will.  The Almighty decrees a decree and then repentance, prayer and charity can change that to the better; and sometimes it changes from good to bad.  But they walk in darkness because there can be no change, heaven forbid.  Rather all is one and is only a matter of one desire.  That is to say this inquiry is a matter of faith.  I will also copy what I wrote as a child in my pamphlet, even though it is a little different.  In any event, it all goes together in one place.  These are my words.  Written in section of Godliness in the gate of unity.  And the whole faith of unity is complete; as there is no body nor strength of the body, nor a separate mind, and will not change from thought to thought or from action to action or from one leader to another.  It is a complete intellect and simple and unique in all parts of His names and in all attributes.  And a change in actions on the part of the leadership only exists from the side of the recipients.  Because the one who walks in innocence and straightness, and keeps a good home, receives goodness derived from God Almighty.  And he who perverts his path and distances himself, is distanced from the good derived from God and the opposite is derived from Him.  
For if the reward and punishment were the arrangement, then, Heaven Forbid, it will look as if there is a change from desire to desire.  Because now he agrees one way and then agrees another way.  The matter of Desire is a secret that reveals the emanation that includes all the changes according to awakenings of awakening.  This is how it continues from the essence and in nature.  The idea is if we sanctify ourselves below, we sanctify Him above in the same nature of the matter that arises.  And if he defiles himself, he defiles him from above in the same nature of the matter that has arisen.  And if he awakens himself and throws of his ways of exile and binds himself in holiness, he is found in nature sanctified.  And the Will of heaven is not changed, for on the contrary, the will is revealed and everything is expected and the authority is given to do so.

But there is room for the question, and the question has its place from something else, and this is it: It is because true and absolute faith is that, <i>in the heavens above and on the earth below, there is none else</i> (Deuteronomy 4:39). And the explanation of the verse about that which it is written <i>there is none else</i>, is not that there are no other gods but just He, may He be blessed. For we already knew [that from], <i>the Lord is our God, the Lord is One</i> (Deuteronomy 6:4). Rather, the explanation is that there is no other matter in the world besides His divinity. I mean to say that there is nothing else in the world, whatever it might be, that has life or power or movement, and even something inanimate, which does not derive from Him, may He be blessed. It is like the matter, <i>and You keep them all alive</i> (Nehemiah 9:6): He, may He be blessed, makes all of them exist; and He, may He be blessed, gives them all life. For were it not so, they would not exist. And He knew them before He made them exist, in order that they would exist. And His knowledge is His decree that He decreed, and He said and commanded and they became. Ane one who does not believe like this but distinguishes and gives any intrinsic power to a thing, God forbid, creates two Authorities.

<b>And the thirteen principles</b> emerge from the thirteen traits [of Divine mercy]. One principle comes from each and every trait. But before the explanation of this matter, I must preface it with an explanation of the thirteen traits. For Rashi spoke [only] briefly about their explanation. And [even though] the Tosafot in the first chapter of Rosh Hashanah, together with the Gloss on the Tosafot there, spoke at greater length about their explanation, it is still not completely sufficient.
<b>But I found</b> in Hadarat Kodesh that [the author] wrote at length and expanded upon the intentions of Tosafot with small additions. Hence, I will quote his [words], may his memory be blessed: “Lord, Lord” – some explain that the first name [of God here] is not from the tally of thirteen, but is rather connected to, “and He called,” as if to say, “the Lord called, ‘Lord, God, Merciful, etc.’” But it is not so. For there is a cantillation mark that separates between, “and He called,” and the first name. Rather both of them are traits of mercy, one before a person sins and one for after a person sins and repents. This appears to be the opinion of Rashi. And Rabbenu Tam proves this from the Pesikta. As there it is found (see Pesikta Rabbati 31:5), “’And Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me”’ (Isaiah 49:14) – the Community of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Master of the Universe, those two good traits that You gave to me at Sinai, how did You forsake them, and how did You forget them?’” If so, it appears that they are two traits. And [regarding] the explanation of how it is understood from the name of God that it is a trait of mercy, it is because the name of four letters is the name of existence – was, is and will be (the letters of these three words in Hebrew are all contained in this name). [With it,] He brings into existence and sustains all that exists. So, if that is the case, He is their Father, as it is written (Deuteronomy 32:6), “is He not your Father, who made you, etc.?” So, His mercy is upon them like the mercy of a father for his children who walk in his ways. And this is the Lord before one sins. But when one sins and is a rebellious child and [a father] punishes him, but he [still] does not listen, it is said about them, (see Deuteronomy 21:19), ‘and his father takes him out, etc.’ So, he becomes cruel to him. But if he [then] listens to his parents, when they punish him, and he repents, they have mercy upon him and he will be saved. And this is the Lord after one sins and repents. If so, the two names are two traits of mercy.

I am surprised that when it comes to smallpox outbreaks, which spreads from child to child, why do people not take their children out of the city? In the future, the fathers will be responsible for the deaths of their children who are nursing, and have committed no sin, and those who are weaned and have committed no sins, and died from the sickness whose fathers did not take them away [from the city]. Every man who fears god should fear every eventuality. These things that are included in protecting the body are included in the warnings of (Devarim 4:9) 'take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously' and this is also the way of the world to take care of one's body since it is the container that the soul is wrapped up in so it will be a throne for the soul.

It is taught in Tractate Avot 1:6, "Acquire for yourself a friend." Our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, also said (Taanit 23a:17), "Either friendship or death." The wise one (Shlomo) has said that a person without a friend is like a left without a right. And the pious Rabbenu Yonah wrote, "The paths to repentance require a friend with whom to speak if one errs about the processes of repentance, in order to reprove one another and in order to investigate how to be saved from sin. About them it is stated (Malachi 3:16), 'Thus those who fear the Lord have spoken, each person with their companion, etc.'" To here are [his words].
And likewise did our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say about Torah study (Taanit 7a) [on the verse in Jeremiah 50:36], "A sword is upon the boasters," that colleagues need to review together the teaching that they are studying; so that what this one missed, the other one will reveal. But there are two types of association of colleagues to study. The first is if they are both sages that fully served (apprenticed with) their teacher, yet they join in order to sharpen each other. They then need to fulfill the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, in Tractate Shabbat (63a) in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Isha: Rabbi Yirmeyah said that Rabbi Elazar said, "Two Torah scholars who sharpen one another in halakha (Jewish law); the Holy One, Blessed be He, ensures success for them, as it is written (Psalms 45:5), 'And in your majesty (<i>vahadarkha</i>).' Do not say, 'And your majesty'; but rather, 'and He will sharpen you (<i>vechidedkha</i>).'" (Rashi explained, "And in your majesty," is like, "and He will sharpen you.") Moreover, they will rise to prominence, as it is stated (in the continuation of the verse), "prosper, ride on." I might have thought even [if one engages in the study of Torah] not for its own sake; therefore, the verse states, "on behalf of truth." I might have thought [that one would be rewarded with prosperity even] if he became arrogant; therefore, the verse states. "Meekness and righteousness." And if they do so [in the proper manner] they merit the Torah that was given with [God's] right hand, as it is stated, "and let your right hand teach you tremendous things." Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said, "They are rewarded with the matters that were stated with regard to the right hand of the Torah." To here are their [words]. Behold we must be careful that [our study] be specifically for its own sake and that one not become arrogant. So he should think in his heart, "What am I? I still have not grasped even like a drop in the sea from the depth of the Torah!"

<b>And since</b> it has become clear that the heart corresponds to the Holy of Holies; such that the Torah and the commandments should rest there (in the heart) corresponding to the tablets - it also appears that one should rend his heart, as it is written (Joel 2:12), "rend your hearts, etc." So his heart will be [such that], "God, You will not despise a broken and crushed heart" (Psalms 51:19). And it is like the broken tablets that were resting in the ark (Bava Batra 14b). So his heart should be broken about an incorrect act or attribute of his, or wasting time from Torah study and that which is similar to it. And he should be greatly distressed, regret it with great regret and make a solid commitment in his heart not to go on this path ever again.

<b>And now I have come to mention the laws that are practiced [only] in the land of Israel if you should merit like me to come to the holy land to live, so that you will know what to do; and to motivate you very strongly that you should be very exacting about them, that you not sin, God forbid.</b>
<b>And behold,</b> one year after my coming to Jerusalem, the holy city – may it be rebuilt and established quickly in our days – it was the Shemitah, the seventh year. And many of those dwelling in the land were running to exempt themselves [from it] due to its great difficulty. For there was a famine on the eve of the seventh year in the country and they were unable to eat one day after the next, all the more so to prepare some things in their house for the seventh year. So they said forced teachings [to permit the exemption]. But I debated with myself and thought in my heart [that] I am more obligated to fulfill [these commandments] than they are, even [if it means] ‘to sell the cloak on my shoulders.’ Since the Holy One, blessed be He, will say to me, “Why did you come from a place where you were exempt from this and come to a place of obligation; and now that you are in the place of obligation, you forsake this commandment? Why did you come to profane My land?” Granted, [this is not a general rebuke, since] the punishment for the ones already there is not so great. Moreover, one who travels to the holy land travels in order to sanctify himself and to fulfill the commandments that are there, like the matter that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said at the end of the first chapter of Sotah (14a), “Rabbi Simlai expounded, ‘On account of what did our teacher, Moshe, want to enter the land of Israel? And was it to eat its fruits that he needed, etc.? Rather, it was to fulfill the commandments dependent on the land.
And the idea is that it is fitting for a person to bring himself to be obligated about a commandment in order to fulfill it. Even though he is not obligated about it [at first], he should bring himself to be obligated. And one who does not do so is sometimes punished at a time when strict judgment above is taut. [This is] as it is found in the chapter [entitled] HaTekhelet (Menachot 41a), that an angel said to Rav Ketina, “A cloak in the summer and a coat [sarbela], [which are exempt from ritual fringes], in the winter, what will become of the ritual fringes of sky-blue wool?” He said to him, “Do you punish for [even failing to fulfill] a positive commandment?” He said to him, “At a time when there is [divine] anger, we punish.” And in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Madlikin (Shabbat 32b), there is a teacher who holds that children die for the iniquity of [not having] mezuzot, as it is written (Jeremiah 2:34), “Also in your corners is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor, you did not find them in a breach.” Rashi explains, “’In a breach,’ since it has no posts. This is what the verse means, I have  not found complete people in a breach, etc.” For since they did not make posts, they were exempt from mezuzot. But it was fitting to, just the opposite, bring themselves to be obligated in [affixing] a mezuzah. And this was the idea with our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him, who wanted to bring himself to fulfilling the commandments of the Land of Israel. So behold one who comes to the Land of Israel and has the commandment present itself to him, should he, God forbid, not perform it?  
A while after I had placed these things into my heart, I found them likewise in the Sefer HaCharedim which was written by Rabbi Eliezer Azikri, may his memory be blessed. This following are [the words] that he wrote: All who come to live in the Land of Israel are obligated to be very careful about the Shemitah and about all of the commandments that are dependent on the Land of Israel, just like the Amoraim (later teachers of the Talmud) who lived there were careful to observe them, as it is found in the Yerushalmi. This is so that the commandment of living in the land of Israel not be one that comes through the sin of the negation of the commandments dependent upon it, such that their loss is greater than their gain. And may the God of Israel assist us in fulfilling them, Amen!

chapter 6



chapter 7

And now the time has come for something that is in the manner of mundane food which is treated with the purity of sanctified food. And it is not for nothing that the Torah mentioned the expression of holiness with eating: <i>you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy</i> (Leviticus 11:44). And behold we found that the first command to Adam the first man is: <i>And the Lord God commanded man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you shall surely eat; But from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you must not eat from it"</i> (Genesis 2:16-17). And at first glance, it is difficult, as it should only have said, "From the tree of knowledge, you must not eat." And from other trees in the garden, he could eat or not eat.
However you should know that there is a hint here [that] sometimes eating is a commandment and sometimes not eating — meaning a fast — is a commandment, and both are of the same cloth. For a fast, in which a person diminishes his fat and his blood, is mystically tied to sacrifices. It is as we say in the prayer for a fast, "May it be [Your] will that my fat and my blood which have been diminished today be like fat placed on the altar, etc." (Berakhot 17a). And this matter will [be treated] at length later on in Tractate Taanit, if God wills it.
But sometimes eating is mystically tied to sacrifices, like the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say (Berakhot 55a), "And now, the table of a person atones." And that is in place of a sacrifice. And the idea is that eating has the physical and spiritual in it, as I cited before (s.v. OuDevar Zeh) in the name of the divine ARI, may his memory be blessed, the understanding of the verse: <i>from everything that comes out of the mouth of the Lord, a person lives</i> (Deuteronomy 8:3): According to this, the connection between the soul and the body is through food, the spirituality of the food strengthens the power of the soul, and the materiality of the food strengthens the power of the body. The two of them are connected, just like the hidden soul inside the body. Through this, the body is sanctified and clings to the soul, while the body, which is the holder and container of the soul, then connects the book container with the book. And this is on condition [that] the righteous eats to satisfy his soul [alluding to Proverbs 13:25]. What I mean to say is that one is exacting in his eating, that it is from that which is permissible in his mouth and that there is no doubt or concern of a prohibition in it; and he only eats for his sustenance, and his purpose in it is to serve his Creator, to occupy himself with Torah [study] and commandments. And, also, that he gives to the poor from his bread [alluding to Proverbs 22:9], as will be explained later on at length. Then it is called a commanded meal; in this aspect, he is commanded to eat. For all of his eating is [then] an atoning altar, like a sacrifice, as per the below. But to know good and evil, the secret is [that] if it is desirable to [eat], etc. [alluding to Genesis 3:6], you shall not eat [it]. Rather, the purpose of the creation of man, who was made in [God's] likeness and image, was that the creation be similar to the Maker, as it were; to become similar to Him in all of his ways, as it is written: <i>You are godlike beings</i> (Psalms 82:6). So the food they should eat should be with the secret of the sacrifice, such that his eatings become sanctified.

chapter 8






In the Zohar on Parashat Terumah [it is taught]: 'One who luxuriates at his table and delights in those foods ought to call to mind and to feel concern for the holiness of the Holy Land and for the Temple of the King that has been destroyed. In consideration of the sadness that one feels at one's table--in the midst of the joy and celebration [lit. drinking] there--the Holy Blessed One accounts it to one as if one has rebuilt His House and rebuilt all the ruins of the Temple. Happy is one's portion!' (Zohar 2:157:2).   Therefore it is customary to recite the Psalm 'By the waters of Babylon' (Psalms 137) before Grace after Meals, particularly since the table corresponds to the (Temple) altar, while, through our many sins, the altar itself is no longer.  One should call to mind [the teaching], 'Woe to the children who have been banished from their Father's table' (Talmud Berachot 3a).   The banishment from the Table (shulchan, sh.l.h.n) was caused by the power of the Snake (lenachash, l.n.h.sh), as is taught in the Zohar [about the word] Eichah ('.y.kh.h, 'Alas;' the name of the Book of Lamentations):  'I shall set enmity' (Eivah, '.y.b.h) (Genesis 3:15), an anagram for א׳יכה י׳שבה ב׳דד ה׳עיר 'Alas, the city sits solitary' ('.y.b.h) (Lamentations 1:1).  On Shabbat and Festivals one recites the Psalm 'When the Name restores the fortunes of Zion' (Psalms 126).

chapter 1






















However, I came to explain further the anger and wrath over the severity of the great sin of wasting seed. It is stated in Tractate Niddah, beginning of Chapter 20 (13a): "It was taught in a baraita: Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who holds his male organ and urinates is considered as though he brought a flood upon the world." They said to Rabbi Eliezer: But doesn't seminal drops drip onto his feet, appearing like one who cuts off his own flesh? And it turns out that he speaks disparagingly about his children, who are mamzerim (illegitimate offspring). He said to them: It is better that he should speak disparagingly about his children, who are mamzerim, and not make himself wicked for even one moment before the Omnipresent. And we say: For what reason does the verse state this? Because he emits semen wastefully, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who emits semen wastefully is liable to receive the death penalty, as it is stated: “And it was evil in the eyes of the Lord that which he did; and he also died” (Genesis 38:10). Rabbi Yitzḥak and Rabbi Ami say: It is as though he sheds blood, as it is stated: “Who comfort you with idols under every leafy tree, slaying the children in the valleys” (Isaiah 57:5). Do not read it as slaying [shoḥtei], but rather as squeezing [soḥtei]. Rav Ashi says: It is as though he worshiped idols, as here it is written: “Under every leafy tree,” and there it is written: “Upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree” (Deuteronomy 12:2).
 

Rabbi Yehuda says: One who tempts himself to know should be placed in a state of ostracism. And let the Master say that it is forbidden because he causes his evil inclination to become stronger within him. Rabbi Ami says: He is called an apostate, as this is the way of the evil inclination: Today it tells him to do one thing, and tomorrow it tells him to go and worship idols, and he goes and worships. If you wish, say instead that Rabbi Ami said: Anyone who brings himself to the point of sexual thoughts is not admitted within the partition of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written here: “And it was evil in the eyes of the Lord,” and it is written there: “You are not a God Who desires wickedness; evil does not sojourn with You” (Psalms 5:5). Up to this point
 

 
The Zohar indeed emphasizes the severity of this grave sin in Parshat Vayechi (1:219b). The verse in Isaiah 3:11 states, "Woe to the wicked! It will go badly with him, for what his hands have done shall be done to him." This is its language. Why does it say "what his hands have done"? Rabbi Yitzchak said that this includes anyone who causes harm to himself or damages his own offspring. He is called "wicked," and not "angry at My Divine Presence" (Shechina), as You are not a God Who desires wickedness (Psalms 5:5). Additionally, it is written, "And there was wickedness in Judah's firstborn" (Genesis 38:7). Here too, it says, "Woe to the wicked." Woe to that person who commits evil and brings harm upon himself. For what his hands have done shall be done to him, including anyone who harms himself or damages his own offspring. These troubles are more severe than any others. Look, for it is written, "Woe to the wicked." Why "wicked"? Rather, as we say, he brings harm upon himself. Yet it is written, "No evil shall befall you" (Psalms 91:10). All these [troubles] are eliminated, but this one is not. If you say it is due to other guilty parties who killed the sons of nobles, look, all of them are eliminated, yet this one is not. What is the reason? They killed the sons of nobles, whereas he killed his very own son, and their blood is greater. Look, regarding other guilty parties, it is not written, "He did evil in the eyes of the Lord," but here it is written, "He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, which he committed." What is the reason? Because it is written, "And He destroyed His land" (Genesis 38:9). We learn that Rabbi Yehuda said, "You have no debt in the world for which there is no repentance except for this one. And you have no sin for which the Divine Presence does not become angry except for this one, as it is written, 'No evil shall befall you.'" Rabbi Yitzchak said, "The righteous in this world and the World to Come are called 'your people,' as it is written, 'And your people, all of them righteous, shall inherit the land forever' (Isaiah 60:21)." This is the extent of its language. See how the Zohar emphasizes the severity of this sin more than any other sin in the entire Torah, and one who fails in this sin will weep and mourn, for he has been cast away from the Supernal Abode. He is like a broken earthenware vessel without repair or purification. Woe to him for being created in such a state.

And this is the language of the Tolaat Yaakov in Paragraph (77) [21]: That which they add from the mundane to the holy (stretch out) at the conclusion of Shabbat is to teach and to show that they do not desire the exit of the holy guest from among them, and that its departure is very hard for them. Hence they delay it. And due to their great love for it, they accompany it with songs and praises, like the matter of, “and I would have sent you off with joy and with songs” (Genesis 31:27). And so is it found in the Midrash – there is a [relevant] parable of a bride and a queen, that we accompany her with songs and praises. And [we] have already hinted above to the secret of Shabbat which is called bride [and queen. And thus do we say in the chapter (entitled) Kol Kitvei and in Bereishit Rabbah, “’And God completed on the seventh day’ – the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Come and say] song, new faces have come here.’” That is to say, with the entrance of Shabbat and the bride that have newly arrived, it is said that it is necessary to bring it in with songs and praises when it comes in, [and] to also accompany it when it departs with songs and praises. To here [are his words].

That is why it is written (Leviticus 6:6), "A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar." Our Rabbis said (see Taanit 27b) [that] were it not for the daily (lit., perpetual) sacrifices, the Earth and Heavens would not survive. And the people of the representation would read from the story of Creation [at the time of the sacrifice], since the end of the Creation story is for the sake of His glory and His service, may He be blessed. And there is survival to the story of Creation with this; so they are perpetual and do not end. And it has already been explained that the whole story of Creation was subsumed in fire; and that is, "A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar." That is to say, the fire causes the continuation of the survival of existence; on account of their doing the service of God, may He be blessed, which causes the survival of existence that came about through fire. And then it arouses the fire in the Heavens (Leviticus 9:24): "A fire came forth from before the Lord and consumed what was on the altar; the burnt-offering, etc."

<b>And behold</b> that the purpose of the creation is man; and Adam, the first man, was the dough for the tithe (<i>eesah challah</i>) of the world. But when he became corrupted and sinned, the pollution of the snake went into him, the snake being the Satan and the evil impulse. And that is the leavening in the dough. And then the dough became leavened and became a turbid body of a skin tunic; so he caused his own death. And that is the secret of (Exodus 12:20), “You shall not eat any <i>machmetzet</i> (leavened thing).” Chametz is in the middle and the letters [that spell] dead (<i>met</i>) are at the beginning (<i>mem</i>) and end (<i>tav</i>). Also, chametz are the letters [that spell] arrow (<i>chetz</i>), with <i>mem</i> (the initial for death) in the middle.
And the Zohar in Parshat Pinchas III, 347a) spoke at length about the numerical count of Pinchas’ spear (spelled, <i>reish, mem, chet</i>). It wrote [that] Pinchas has the numerical equivalent of 208 (<i>reish, chet</i>), like Yitzchak, who is the trait of strict justice. And see that the letter, <i>mem</i> (the difference between the numerical count of Pinchas and <i>romach</i>) is dangling in the air, which is the symbol for the <i>Malakh HaMavet</i> (Angel of Death). And it is the <i>mem</i> of, “<i>mipirio</i>” (Genesis 3:6), which is in the middle of four [combinations of] <i>vav, taf</i>, “<i>Vatere haishah […] vatikach mipirio vatochal vatiten…</i>” (And the woman saw […] and she took from its fruit and ate and gave, etc.).” In combining the <i>mem</i> to the four <i>vav, taf</i> [combinations], it is four [times] <i>mem, vav, taf</i> (spelling out <i>mavet</i>, death), since death [then] came down to the four corners of the earth. Behold this <i>mem</i> is [also] in the middle of <i>chetz</i> (arrow), becoming chametz. And the idea of <i>chetz</i> is [identified with] the ‘seed that shot like an arrow’ from Adam, the first man, after he separated from his wife for 120 years and fathered spirits and demons. After the 120 years, he fathered Seth, in his likeness and in his image. And it is from him that the world was established (<i>hustaat</i>). In the same way was the redeemer, our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, born in Egypt – for he is Seth, as it is known in the secret [of] Moshe, Seth, Hevel (Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 69, 114a). So Yocheved was 120 years old [at that time], since Yocheved is the reparation (<i>tikkun</i>) of Chava, and Seth is Moshe. And he is the Foundation of the world, according to the religion and according to the Torah.

<b>”And he (or it) shall be brought</b> before the priest” (Leviticus 14:2). And afterwards, it is written (Leviticus 14:3), “And the priest shall go out.” And glancing quickly, the language [of these verses seemingly] contradicts itself. It is true that the understanding of, “and he (or it) shall be brought before the priest,” is that the matter be brought before the priest; however for what teaching is it written like this?
<b>This section</b> and the matter of the day – meaning the exodus from Egypt – have a similarity: For with tzaraat, we found that the hand of the savior prophet, none like whom has arisen, was afflicted with tzaraat (Exodus 4:6). And also about the opposite, the greatest of the abominations of Egypt, which was Pharaoh – since he said (Ezekiel 29:3), “My Nile is my own, etc.” – it is written (Exodus 2:23), “and the king of Egypt died”; [about which] our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, explained, that he was afflicted with tzaraat, etc. (Shemot Rabbah 1:34). And likewise with the matter of purity: The Jewish people in Egypt were like someone quarantined with tzaraat, since no slave could escape. And with the purification, it is written about the Passover of Egypt (Exodus 12:22), “And you shall take a bundle of hyssop,” like someone with tzaraat. And in the Zohar, it taught (II 35b): It is written, “And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin; touch the lintel and the two side doorposts with some of the blood in the basin.” Why a bunch of hyssop? In order to destroy the impure spirit; and to have it attach complete faith onto the entrance in these three places, one here, one there and one on top of them. And because of that, “the Lord will pass over upon the entrance and will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to plague you” (Exodus 12:23). Because He sees His holy name written upon the entrance. To here [is the Zohar].

Shevuot

Know - that the pious one (R. Yosef Karo) and I agreed to make a great effort on the night of Shavuot, and to keep sleep from our eyes.  Praise to God, so it was. We didn't stop one moment - listen, and your soul will be revived...
The moment that we began to learn the Mishnah, and we learned two tractates, our Creator graced us and we heard a voice speaking from the mouth of the pious one.  A great voice, with clear enunciation, and all around us heard but did not understand.  It was very pleasant, and the voice gained strength. We fell on our faces, and none could raise their eyes from fear. The voice speaking to us began and said - "Hear my beloved ones, most beautiful, cherished, beloved, peace to you, fortunate are you and those that bore you, fortunate in this world and in the world to come, in that you took upon yourselves to crown me this night. It is many years that my crown has fallen from my head, and I have no one to comfort me, and I am cast to the dirt clutching waste piles. But you have returned the crown to its former glory..."  









































































































We also hear from that Baraita that it is forbidden to alter the words of Torah, even in a time of danger, and one is obligated to sacrifice themselves for it. According to one explanation of Tosafot, the wicked kingdom issued a decree against them, but you will not find such a harsh statement to say before the nations that we are exempt from their harm while they are obligated. Would it not be appropriate to be cautious, Heaven forbid, of the many dangers and destructions that could come from them, especially from a wicked kingdom whose intentions are only to defame and attack our enemies? Therefore, they should have altered it, either both are obligated or both are exempt. Rather, we learn from this that they are obligated to give their lives for the sanctification of God’s name. And if, Heaven forbid, the law is changed, it would be as if they are denying the Torah of Moses. Presumably, this refers to a situation where the officials specifically asked about every detail of the law regarding the ox of a Jew that gored a non-Jew, and the ox of a non-Jew that gored a Jew. Therefore, they answered the truth for the sanctification of God’s name, as they had no ability to exempt themselves from this law.
And as it is stated in the first chapter of Megillah (9a), the story of Ptolemy who gathered seventy-two elders and so on, and they changed the Torah. There, it was from Heaven that they agreed with him, and it was as though it were inspired by the Holy Spirit. And it also says there that God placed it in the heart of each one, and so on, and this was according to the word [of God]. Furthermore, there, they did not change anything from its meaning, but only changed the wording so it would not lead to heresy. And as we learned, this is indeed the plain meaning of the verse. But to say that an exemption is an obligation, or the opposite, would be as if denying the Torah of Moses. What difference does it make whether it is one word or the entire Torah? As it is stated in the third chapter of Yoma (38b), Rav said: ‘Anyone who forgets one thing from their learning causes exile for their children,’ as it is written (Hosea 4:6), ‘Because you have forgotten the Torah of your God, I will also forget your children.’ Thus, even one word from the Torah is considered the Torah of God.

<b>Regarding the matter of</b> "Is a eulogy [for] the honor of the dead or the honor of the living," that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, mentioned (Sanhedrin 46b): Even though these things are like their plain sense, about feigned honor - nevertheless they hint to true honor, which is the honor of the soul. As because of the eulogy, the people will be aroused to repent, as we shall explain. And then the soul of the dead person will merit, and that is the honor of the dead. For he benefits others who are aroused to repent; and that is the honor of the living. And the purpose of the eulogy and its commandment is so that they will be aroused to repent, as Rashi wrote on the verse, "and it will be sanctified with My Glory" (Exodus 29:43) - "When the Holy One, blessed be He, applies [exacting] judgment upon those that fear Him, etc."

<b>And close</b> to this is what the [author of] the Pardes wrote in the Section on Colors, Chapter 1. And these are his [words]: If someone wants to perform an action and requires the the drawing forth of strict justice, that person should then wear red garments and design pictures of the world in red. And likewise with all actions and drawings forth [that a person wants to initiate]. So when he requires kindness and mercy, he should wrap himself in white. And we have clear proofs about this from the priests - their drawing forth was from the angle of kindness and their garments were white, to indicate peace. And this is [the meaning of] the matter with the high priest on Yom Kippur, who would remove the gold clothes and wear the white clothes, since the service of the day was with white garments. And [the Rabbis] give an explanation for it - because the prosecutor cannot be the defender (Rosh Hashanah 26a). They taught explicitly about that which is being expounded [here], etc. And the trustworthy witness about this are the stones of the breastplate - the twelve stones are characterized according to the drawing forth of the twelve tribes from a high place. And one should not push this thing away. For behold, naturalists have said that if a person looks at the flow of much water with his eyes, white [vision] is stimulated in him. To the point that sick people who who have no peace of mind and whose sleep is not pleasant to them have water conveyors flow in front of them, so that the white is stimulated and the humor expands, and they sleep. So too is it with this matter. When the spring flows in his mind, he will find ten levels in this matter. As there is an impact on the spiritual from the colors that appear to our eyes or in our physical mind's eye. The essence is stimulated by the spirit; and the soul by the essence. And from the soul, it goes from one state to another, until it rises to the place of their nourishment, and [that place] it is aroused according to the nature of their design. This is because they [reflect back] 'like the face on the water to the face.' So through it, the source will see the face in red and it will be influenced to the red. And likewise if it is white, white. That is because arousal and the lower face is through people. To here are his [words]. The general principle that comes out [of this] is that what is most important is prayer. And these things are to be registered, and to arouse from above.

The Rambam also wrote (Mishneh Torah, Rest on a Holiday 6:17-18): A man is obligated to be happy and in good spirits on the holiday - he, his wife, his children and all who accompany him. [...] How [does one make everyone happy appropriately]? Give the children nuts and candy, and buy the women clothing and jewelry according to what he can afford. [...] And he is obligated to feed strangers, orphans and widows as well as all other poor people. However, if he locks his doors and eats and drinks with his family and does not feed the poor and others going through hard times, this is not the joy which was commanded, but [merely] rejoicing his stomach. About such people, it is said (Hosea 9:4), "Their sacrifices are for them like the bread of mourners, etc." To here are his [words].
I found in the name of the author of the [Sefer] HaYereim, may his memory be blessed: We learn from here that a person is obligated on the holiday to engage in any proper enjoyment and any joyful thing which makes him rejoice; with anything from which his heart derives joy and bliss, like eating, drinking and strolling. So a person is obligated to do everything that makes him rejoice. And just like he is obligated to make himself rejoice; so too is he obligated to make his sons, his daughters and his household rejoice, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:14), "You are to rejoice during your festival - you, your son and your daughter." And just like he is obligated to make his sons, his daughters and his household rejoice; so too is he obligated to make others rejoice with him, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:11), "and the Levite who is in your city, the stranger, the orphan and the widow who are among you." The Holy One, blessed be He, said, "You have four [types of] residents - your son, your daughter, your slave and your maidservant. If you make mine rejoice, I will make yours rejoice." And likewise Ezra says (Nehemiah 8:10), "Go, eat choice foods and drink sweet drinks and send portions to whoever has nothing prepared for himself." To here are his [words].

It is preferred [fulfillment of the] commandment to specifically seek olive oil to light the candles, even [if one] must buy them at much expense, and not light with wax candles or with other oils, but rather only with olive oil. For the miracle in the Temple was done with olive oil. And this is also what I found [to be true], and this is the tradition I received. And a hint to the thing: Chanukkah is called [such] because they rested [<i>chanu</i>] on the 25th [<i>kah</i>], as it is written in the Tur [Orach Chaim] 670. On the 25th [<i>Bekah</i>], has the numerical equivalent [<i>gematria</i>] of clear [<i>zakh</i>, and it is written: <i>and they shall take to you clear olive oil</i> (Exodus 27:20). And also: <i>When you kindle the lamps, etc.</i> (Numbers 8:2), also hints to the lights of Chanukkah, as Ramban writes, at the beginning of [Parashat] Beha’alotecha. Hence it should be with olive oil like it was with the lights of the menorah. 









And behold we have found that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 2a), "'And to serve Him with all your heart' (Deuteronomy 11:13) - which is the service that is in the heart? I would say that is prayer." Also in the words of sages (see Abarbanel on Avot 3:10), "Prayer without intention is like a body without a soul." And these two things are different matters. The first - that which they called prayer, 'service in the  heart' - that is the matter of thought that I mentioned: That a person must do great service in the heart and be as strong as a lion, to be aroused such that no foreign thought come to his mind. And if he is unable to turn his mind from [foreign] thoughts during the time of prayer, he should seek out machinations and strategies. For example, he should think that the Creator, may He be blessed, is standing in front of me and is looking down at what comes out of my mouth and examining the thoughts of my heart; so he will tremble and be filled with shivering and perspiration. And anything he can come up with to remove foreign thoughts, he should do. Then afterwards, he should be strong as a lion to the opposite; to think of thoughts that clarify the words [of the prayer], and pour out his speech and his spirit before the King, the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, who hears prayers and is able to do anything.

And Matatyah [Matthaeus] is also hinted to in the sacrifice of the chieftains, in the [Torah] reading of the first day of Chanukah: <i>And the chieftains of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, brought</i> (Numbers 7:2). The numerical equivalent of "their fathers' houses," is Matatyah, and the miracle happened by way of the high priest, Matatyah. So the Holy One, blessed be He, hinted about this miracle to Aaron, who was the first high priest, with the matter of <i>When you raise up the lights</i> (Numbers 8:2), as was written by Ramban. And likewise, Aaron's place was originally in Majesty [<i>Hod</i>], but he rose up very high afterward. And so is it taught in Tractate Derekh Eretz (Zuta 1), "Seven forefathers were makers of covenants, and these are them: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Phinehas, and David." And they are the seven <i>sefirot</i> of the structure, and there are seven circles on Hoshana Rabba [based] in their secret. And the Sephardim have liturgical poems about this, one of them [for] each circle, [there] Aaron is in the aspect of Majesty, but afterward, he rises to Kindness [<i>Chesed</i>], as it is stated: <i>Let Your Tummim and Urim be with Your man of kindnesses/piety</i> (Deuteronomy 33:8). This is just like our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, arose to the trait of Splendor [<i>Tiferet</i>], in the secret of Knowledge [<i>Daat</i>] above. And behold that [God's] name [with the numerical equivalent] of 72, from the side of Kindness, is like the numerical count of Kindness. And so too [regarding] Judah the Maccabee, who did great heroic acts with the help of God, may He be blessed, Maccabee also equals 72. And the first initials of, <i>Who is like you Lord</i> (Exodus 15:11) are <i>MaaCaBI</i>. <i>MaaCaBI</i> is also the letters of <i>BoChIM</i> [crying], the first initials of <i>blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place</i> (Ezekiel 3:12). (And it appears to me that it hints to that which the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said [Sanhedrin 110a], "One who argues against the monarchy of the House of David is like one who argues against the divine presence." For behold, the sin of the Hasmoneans was that they took the monarchy for themselves. As monarchy had already been decreed for the tribe of Judah, as Ramban [discusses] at length in Parashat Vayechi, on the verse, <i>The scepter shall not depart from Judah</i> [Genesis 49:10]. And this is the hint from  Maccabee crying, <i>blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place</i>, for blessed is the Lord forever, Amen and Amen [alluding to Psalms 89:53]. But the matter of the Hasmoneans did not blemish the glory of the divine presence through that which they took the monarchy, since their glory was for [the sake of] the Heavens. Their matter was rather only like an error that comes out from the ruler.) And great miracles were performed through these holy priests, and they brought back the crown of the Torah to its former [glory] and the performance of the commandments. And it is written: <i>The commandment is a lamp and the Torah is light</i> (Proverbs 6:23). That is why the miracle in the temple was revealed through the menorah.

It is well known that in order to rehabilitate oneself spiritually one must exercise  repentance, prayer and tzedakah. All of these three factors of a person's rehabilitation depend on their mouth. Prayer - "my mouth shall praise Ad-nai etc" (Ps. 145:21). And so too Torah study - "and you shall teach them etc" (Deut. 6:7), that one should repeat them with your mouth. Repentance - they already said "in your mouth and in your heart to to it" (Deut. 30:14) refers to repentance, and the essence of repentance is verbal confession through a broken heart (Eruvin 54) and so too "bring words with you and return" (Hosea 14:3) Charity, too,  as our sages (Baba Batra 9b) say that anyone who gives charity acquires six blessings; if someone also tries to make the recipient feel better by kind and encouraging words he will qualify for eleven blessings - behold the essence of tzedakah is verbal encouragement. Therefore, the words voice, fasting and money [קול צום ממון] all have the same numerical value - 136, and they are [symbolic of] tefilah, tzedakah and teshuvah. The very first part of our parsha Ki Tetze alludes to all the three ingredients of repentance. Even tough the plain meaning is war, the paragraph refers to the ongoing battle between a person and their evil urge. Many of the commentators wrote, regarding the previous portion in Parashat Shoftim on the verse about the siege laid to a city (Deut. 20:19) that this is about the greatest war a person has to fight in this life. The matter is illustrated in the Talmud by the story of the elderly sage who met soldiers of the army of Alexander the Great at the time of his victorious return from a major battle. These soldiers were in a very happy for having conquered such a big city. The sage told them 'you came back from a small battle, get ready for the battle of your lives, against the evil inclination.' This is what the sages meant when they said "the Torah spoke only against the evil inclination" (Kidushin 21b). Through this allegory, we can understand the whole reason why these rules are only regarding a permitted war - permission has been given to us and the choice is ours. Once a person makes the first move in this war, then one can be certain that the Holy one of Blessing will help, as our sages say "were it not for the help of the Holy One, people would not be able to subdue the evil inclination" (Sukkah 52b) - and this is "God delivers him to your hand" (Deut. 21:10). It is significant that the Torah here employs the singular. Behold, regarding war we have a tradition that a nation does not succumb to another nation unless its protective spirit in the Celestial Regions has first suffered defeat. Therefore the text says "and gave him" - him is the protective spirit. And this is also regarding the other war [the personal] because a person has many enemies, which are the negative forces created by one's evil deeds - from every sin a destroying angel is created, and they are all presided by the evil inclination, which is Samael, Satan, the Angel of Death, etc. (Baba Batra 16a). And this is the meaning of  "Ad-nai your God will deliver him into your hand and you will take him captive" (Deut. 21:10). Taking this enemy prisoner is possible only with the help of Torah study and mitzvot, as it is written about Torah: "You went up to the heights, having taken captives" (Ps. 68:19).
