Shemirat HaLashon

Book I

Introduction

It is written (Proverbs 21:23), "One who keeps an eye on his mouth and tongue protects his life from trouble." In order to comprehend chaperoning the mouth and tongue and preventing life trouble which the Scripture defines, even more than all other ideas, that the perfect man needs to watch during the days,  look in the basic commentaries. And I too shall speak over my part which Hashem has granted me, and with this we shall also understand that which is written (Psalms 34:13), "Whoever is a man who desires life and covets [his] days in order to perceive benevolence, shield your tongue from evil" etc. 

The Gate of Remembering



Chapter 1



Chapter 2




We learned, that in an earthly act, an act in the heavens is awakened, if a person act here properly,a mirror act will be awakened in the heavens, a person does kindness in the world, kindness is awakened above and it stays on that day and is adorned with it for him, and if a person acts with mercy below, he arouses mercy on that day and is adorned with mercy for him, and then on that day he is going to be a protector for him when he needs it, etc., blessed is he who does a kosher deed below, for it depends entirely on the deed to arouse [as mirror action above] something else.



There is one spirit that stands over all those who speak evil, and when people are awakened to speak slander, or one person who is awakened to speak with slander, then the same impure evil spirit above, called Saksocha [סַכְסוּכָא], awakens, and it connects with that awakening of evil speech, which humans started with, and it goes up and causes in it the awakening of slander, death and sword and killing in the world. Woe to those who stir up the evil side, and do not guard their mouths and tongues and do not fear it and do not know that the awakening below depends on the awakening above, whether for good or for bad, etc., and all of them conspire to stir up that great serpent, who will conjure up the world, and all for the sake of the same awakening of slander, when its awakening is found below.
