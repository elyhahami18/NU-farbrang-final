Introduction

The Rambam, of blessed memory, in Chapter 3 of his Eight Perakim write, and these are his words, those that came before us said that the Nefesh has health and sickness like the body has health and sickness, and the health of the Nefesh is that its character/attributes exist, etc.

<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The content of this letter suggests that it was written around or during the Ten Days of Repentance, between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. </i>Everything in the world initially comes into being made up of causes and effects. [For example,] obtaining a crop from a field is an effect of many prior causes: planting, plowing, etc. A person’s property is the effect of various causes: commerce, wages, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Salanter starts with analogies from <i>ḥokhmat ha-olam</i>.</i> Each cause is an effect of a cause that precedes it. Sowing a field is the primary cause of the growth of the grain, yet it is the effect of the person who sows. The person’s sowing is an effect of his [causal] will—whether he desires to obtain grain or to obtain wages for planting, etc. In conclusion: there is no effect without a cause that gives birth to the effect. And there is no cause that is not born of a cause that effected it—[until we get] to the ‘First Cause’, a self-generated Cause, that is, the Divine.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is classic medieval thinking undoubtedly drawn from Rambam’s writing (which drew on Aristotelian philosophy and science). </i>
With respect to human action on behalf of his bodily and earthly needs, obtaining money, obtaining honor, etc., the first cause (as seen through mortal eyes, not through the intellect, for all really proceeds from the true First Cause<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Objectively, using one’s reason, one realizes that God is the Ultimate Cause of all. However, subjectively, one’s need for earthly achievements is driven by one’s desire, which is expressed in one’s personal will. </i>) is the desire of one’s will, which proceeds from and is born of itself<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">One experiences one’s will and desire as self-generated.</i>. This will generate effects that are themselves causes of [further] effects, until the object of his desire comes into being. Alternatively, [the first cause is] another person who motivates him, either by coercion or persuasion, to awaken his own desire and will. This is the first cause (as seen through mortal eyes) for this person, which in turn [in this case] is brought into being and caused by another person—who has his own causes that brought him to this point of motivating a first cause within another.
Now let us return and see what would be the first cause to have a person be aroused to examine his actions and meditate introspectively during the month of Elul (this matter is relevant to the whole year, in that it touches upon His service, may His name be blessed) - is it not the case that he has no natural desire for this, as [he does] with earthly matters? Our early rabbis - Eden is their rest - trembled about this thing. They relied upon the Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer and instituted the blowing of the shofar in Elul; and it became the first cause for someone to be aroused from his sleep and from the vanities of his slumbers to examine his actions. It is like the statement of the verse (Amos 3:6), "When a ram’s horn is sounded in a town, do the people not tremble?" 
However it is known that an effect is only created by a cause similar to it. A weighty effect will not come out of a light cause!
And with this thing, the blowing of the shofar was the first cause for someone who was immersed, both inside and out, in His service, may His name be blessed. So a light cause could arouse him to examine himself in a more lofty way. But what can we say or speak? What can be done now when we are immersed, both inside and out, in the the vanities of earthly pursuits, and the heart is blocked and as hard as a solid boulder? Will the light arousal [of the shofar] in front of us make an impression upon the powerful rock? 
However, let us not tie ourselves up with the ropes of the [evil] urge and unthinkingly invert light to darkness and say that the lightweight is weighty. It is patently clear that to go occasionally to the <i>Mussar</i> House in the month of Elul is a very easy thing. Despite our great preoccupation, there is still time for this, by day or night, without great effort. [Just as] the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> is sufficient cause, so when a person goes to the <i>Mussar</i> House, it is [equivalent to] a powerful and awesome cause, which can yield strong and weighty effects.
This is [the meaning of] the Sages of blessed memory’s statement in<i> Kiddushin</i> [30b]: “If the scoundrel<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Scoundrel = evil urge.</i> meets you, draw him to the House of Study.” Sometimes, there are different Houses of Study. In one House of Study, they dealt with matters connected to honest business practices; in another one they dealt with matters regarding keeping kosher, and so on. The Torah’s cure for the [evil] urge is both general and specific. Generally, “when you study Torah, it protects and saves [from sin].”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 21a.</i> Specifically—and this is primary (and practically the essential) for honest business practices—[to study] the Torah which specifically applies to [business]. [Similarly,] for speech, [we must study] the Torah that applies to it. And for every specific place where one meets the “scoundrel”, one should go to the House of Study [and study the Torah] that applies to this specific matter.<br>For this reason, we need <i>Mussar</i> study, which is particularly required in Elul. It will produce two outcomes.
One is physical. A person and dependent family members are in great danger at the time of the great judgment, the time of <i>shofar</i> blowing on Rosh Hashanah, when a person is remembered and judged on his actions. At that time, he is like the High Priest when entering the Holy of Holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., his life is at stake and any false move leads to death.</i> As the Sages of blessed memory say (Rosh Hashanah 26a): Since the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh Hashanah is blown so that we are remembered, it is like being in the innermost part of the Temple. See further there.
How the heart of a person who loves himself and his dependent family members should tremble (even though mortal eyes see that there are people who turn to righteousness without the preparations and awakenings of <i>Mussar</i> and reverence) [and want] to improve his way, or at least be contrite of spirit with broken heart. For this is first principle: to be protected against the great danger, which hovers.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., death.</i> As the Sages, of blessed memory, say in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> (16b) “each year which starts in poverty [ends in wealth]…” [‘Poverty’] refers to the contrition of the heart. As they, of blessed memory, say there (26b): on Rosh Hashanah, “the more a person bows his spirit, the better [the year] is.” See further there.
“Everything has its time” (Ecclesiastes 3:1-2) and “a man does not know his time…[including] the bad time which will suddenly come upon him” (<i>ibid</i>. 9:12). [Do not be caught] without the necessary preparation, to prepare a shield and buckler, to be guarded from the snare, that is, the terrible Day of Judgment. [This is] particularly so, since even mortal eyes see that almost every Rosh Hashanah, May the Merciful One save us, even young men are condemned to death, God forbid, although the rest of the people in their age survive. This is the crux of the matter: the Holy One, blessed be His name, is patient until the allotted time before Him—and for each person there is a unique time.
Since the power of evoking imagery helps <i>Mussar</i>, let a person imagine to himself: if he were the High Priest and had to enter the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, he would be very frightened for his life, that no evil befall him, God forbid. So let him strengthen his trust in the Rabbis, our teachers, the Sages of the Talmud, of blessed memory, who decreed and stopped the use of the horn of a cow, because of the principle that ‘a prosecutor cannot serve as defense attorney.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Golden Calf, the ultimate act of idolatry in the desert. A cow’s horn, which recalls that great sin, may not be used as a <i>shofar</i> to protect the Jewish people by awakening them to repentance. Instead, a ram’s horn is used.</i> Although some enter the holy synagogue wearing articles of clothing made of gold<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Which also recalls the Golden Calf.</i>—still, since the <i>shofar</i>’s purpose is to arouse remembrance, and the person is remembered and judged for his actions, then he is like the High Priest who enters the Holy of Holies. It is as if it were actually so. A person’s heart will tremble mightily if he delves into this awesome matter.
The second [outcome produced by studying <i>Mussar</i>] is spiritual. A person should know that “the Holy One, blessed be He, is patient, but eventually He collects his debts.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 67:4.</i> And the person, himself, who does something against the Torah’s view—against His will, blessed be His name—will surely be punished. For the human body is only the garment. The human faculty that feels pleasure and pain is what lives on after the garment is taken off, and it is specifically designed for feeling pleasure and pain. So, by keeping the Torah and commandments, the person who himself keeps it will receive great pleasure, so great as to astonish. By committing sin or neglecting the Torah and commandments, the person who himself violates it will receive great and awful pain. He will regret it later, but there will be no escape—unless he prepares a way out for himself while he still wears the garment, i.e., while the soul is still tied to the body.
Yom Kippur is a wonderful thing: a day of forgiveness and atonement. There were never any better days for Israel than Yom Kippur (end of <i>Ta’anit</i> [26a]). We have nothing better than it—if we would make the proper preparation to improve our way, for Yom Kippur atones [only] with repentance, i.e. abandoning the sin. However, even a little [repentance] is very good. Nothing compares to it in worldly matters. See to it: on Yom Kippur, at least make some resolution for the future.
There is no enterprise as profitable as preparing with <i>Mussar</i> study, to be mindful and to improve one’s ways, until one arrives at some resolution for the future on Yom Kippur. And in every aspect—even the smallest of the small—wherein a person prepares himself to improve his introspection on Yom Kippur, there is no comparison and no sufficient description<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A play on Isaiah 40:16.</i> of his soul’s success in being saved from many and extraordinary sorrows. And there is no greater profit than this.
Therefore, let a person put his heart and soul to fusing and combine these two matters<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The two matters are: a) the physical awareness that one is on trial for his life during the Ten Days of Repentance, and b) the spiritual awareness of the immeasurable spiritual reward and punishment in the next world for every successful repentance or failure to repent at this very moment. </i> while the body and soul are together. First let him break his heart out of the fear of the physical judgment, for it is awesome, and his life and the lives of his family and their needs all depend on this. From this [awareness], he will come to correct his ways, and this will help for Yom Kippur. Therefore, the scoundrel—the [evil] urge, who hates and lies in wait for a person to stultify his heart—if he meets you, take him to the House of Study that pertains to this area, i.e., the <i>Mussar</i> House. Even if it is made of stone, through <i>Mussar</i> study (which is the Torah for a hardened heart), it will melt, as said above.
All year long, the primary cause is the fear planted in the heart of a person who believes and knows in general that his end will be bad and bitter if he abandons the Torah and commandments of God, blessed be His name. Indeed, when desire overcomes him, a person should habituate himself to study codes (but not cancel his regular studies—for “a person should not knock down an established synagogue [until he builds a new one]”—[Bava Batra 3b]). When he reaches a law that applies to him, let him study it from its [primary] source. Let him go deeply into it, in accordance with the powers of his understanding. This [action] will make his soul take possession of and observe [the law]—almost more than the study of <i>yirah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Yirah</i>”—lit. fear or awe (of God). These are texts which communicate the awesomeness of God and the awfulness of Divine punishments in the next world.</i> itself. However, let him not stop studying <i>yirah</i> either! If there is no Torah, there will be no [true] fear [of God], and if there is no [true] fear [of God], there is no Torah (<i>Avot</i> [3:17]).
As for the sickness of despair, when one sees that desire looms large before him<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Despair arises because, despite his feelings of awe and awareness of punishment, desire threatens to overwhelm his self-control.</i>—and there is no sickness so great as despair—one should know that each sin can be divided in accordance with different aspects, some of which are difficult for him to safeguard against, and some of which, with regard to that very same sin, are easy for him [to handle] at various times, or in various situations. Like neglect of Torah study [for example]: Its aspect changes from Shabbat to weekday, from a time of preoccupation to free time, from a burdened state of mind to a clear state of mind, and so on. With all the particulars of sins, each sin divides into different aspects according to the state of a person and his disposition. Not all times are the same, and not all dispositions are the same. The easier it is for a person to refrain from some aspect of the sin, the more his punishment [for doing it] will grow and grow.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Note this major distinctive theme in R. Salanter’s teaching. Each person’s nature and inner makeup is unique, and its elements are impacted (or stressed by temptation) very differently at different times, situations, and frames of mind. The net is that similar or identical external acts of observance or violations of <i>mitzvot</i> will be judged very differently by Hashem and will have widely varying consequences. Thus, <i>Mussar</i> analysis shows the utter inadequacy of judging people simply by their external behaviors. Therefore, <i>Mussar</i> drives us to assess states of mind and individual character traits. We have to examine our personal motives and causes of behavior as well. In the end, this insight requires us to analyze and pass judgement even on technically proper behavior. These acts may, in fact, be ‘tainted’ or the outcomes of conformity (= spiritual laziness and lack of effort). By this standard, righteous and learned people, conforming to communal norms, may be judged as spiritually lacking or even as moral failures. This type of analysis made <i>Mussar</i> study a demanding discipline that took great effort to live up to. The critique of external correct behavior may also explain some of the backlash against <i>Mussar</i> in the <i>yeshivah</i> world of the 1890s. See: Katz, <i>Pulmus Ha-Mussar</i>.</i> As our Sages of blessed memory say in <i>Menaḥot</i> 43b, “the punishment for the white [string] is greater than the punishment for the indigo….”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment for failure to attach the white <i>tzitzit</i> (fringes), which are widely available and would take little effort to obtain and attach, is greater than the punishment for failure to attach the blue fringe, since it is not available and takes much effort and expense to obtain and attach.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Note how R. Salanter has focused Torah observance on the inner dimension. The same external action carries very different rewards and punishments, commensurate with the inner quality of the observance or the difference as to difficulty or ease in observance due to difference or human nature and/or in the life situation in which the action is done. R. Salanter is also close to ‘modern’ emphasis on the uniqueness of the individual. This leads God to judge similar behaviors by different people in very different ways.</i>
Thus, a person should habituate himself to fulfill the verse in Proverbs (2:4) “if you seek it like silver…,” to reflect on the ways of attaining the bodily needs and to use it as an example and analogy for [attaining the needs of] his soul. When it comes to bodily needs, an unfortunate person will work so hard to obtain anything for his bodily needs, as painful as it may be. It is not too burdensome for him to make every effort, when he is crushed by suffering—may the Merciful One save us—to seek and to see to alleviating his sickness. So why should we not do the same for our souls—to see to it that at least we keep the <i>mitzvot</i> that are easy for us to keep and refrain from sins easy [to resist]? This will save us from hard and bitter suffering, may the Merciful One save us. In this matter, there is no room for a person to despair. If he would only apply his heart and soul to observe the practices of taking care of bodily needs and use them to take care of spiritual needs<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Note this important theme, which becomes a staple of R. Salanter’s thought. 1) One should learn from <i>ḥochmat ha’olam</i>, the life wisdom one derives from dealing in business and work how anticipate and solve difficulties and how to find ways to succeed. One should apply this wisdom and accept spiritual difficulties and solve them. 2) One should employ equivalent energy, wisdom and strategies to prevent sins and accomplish religious goals as one does in business and other worldly matters.</i>. Indeed, [he should never let go of] the yearning and search to keep the commandments in their totality, including study of Torah and the like; and from trying to refrain from sins entirely, he should never let up.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Exodus 17:11 and Ecclesiastes 7:18.</i>
So too in Elul, even though time is short, see to it that one studies a short book such as Rabbeinu Jonah’s <i>Sha’arei Teshuvah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Jonah ben Abraham Gerondi of Girona, Catalonia (d. 1264) was an influential rabbi best known for his commentary on <i>Pirkei Avot </i>and his moralist tract <i>Sha’arei Teshuvah </i>(The Gates of Repentance), which he composed as part of his own penitence for initially opposing the philosophical works of Rambam. He also composed commentaries on several tractates of the Talmud.</i> and the like, which deal with almost all types of <i>mitzvot</i> and sins. When one reaches something that is more applicable to him, he should make sure to study it more deeply, in accordance with his powers of understanding and considering the limited time. He should make sure to divide [the sin] into different aspects, as said above. From this comes the hope to become a true penitent in some aspect of this sin on Yom Kippur, i.e. to resolve to abandon the sin—[at least] in the aspect easiest to him—with true resolve. The benefit of this to him is of immeasurable value, in this world and the next.
For we see instinctively: That which is almost natural for an individual to observe, he will find ‘easy’ to uphold even if it is very burdensome. In this matter, locations differ. In our country, it is easy for a person to observe Shabbat, and he will stand up to almost [all] temptations. In Germany, to achieve Shabbat observance is more difficult than almost anything else in the service of God, blessed be His name.<br>To this end, studying analytically and in depth makes a major impression on the human psyche, to the extent that it becomes imprinted on one’s soul. At that point, he will observe it with barely any <i>Mussar</i> and will withstand temptation. Thus, analytical, in-depth Torah study, of the laws that this person needs, is the foundation of its observance.

<small>[Your] honor’s letter of this month just reached me, and I feel it is urgent that I write [to you] as [you] requested.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This letter is Rabbi Israel Salanter’s reply to a letter informing him of the death of a good person during a cholera epidemic. R. Salanter seeks to guide his correspondent as to how to deal with the threat of the epidemic, the shock of the untimely death of an innocent good man, and how to handle feelings of grief and loss, especially in light of the doctors’ warning that excessive grief can weaken the body’s resistance and ability to fight off disease.</i></small>
The whole purpose of man<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Ecclesiastes 12:13.</i> is to control his spirit,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Proverbs 16:32, <i>Avot </i>4:1.</i> to divert it by his will<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning: to turn it towards his desired outcome in accordance with the Torah’s prescribed good behavior—as against where uncontrolled desire or instinct could lead him.</i> to whatever his situation demands. [In this case, someone has died, so there is a choice] whether to direct the spirit toward sadness, to be embittered by [the dead man’s loss of] His service, blessed be His name, for it has passed<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., premature death cut off a person’s service of God before its time.</i> -- because “the dead are free” [of the Torah and commandments]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>b. Shabbat</i> 30a: “Rabbi Yoḥanan says: ‘the dead are free’ (Psalms 88:6)—when a person dies, he becomes free of the Torah and the commandments.”</i> — or to direct one’s spirit toward calming and relaxing the soul, [by regarding this death as a case of] a good man who is on his way to his eternal rest, which is the aspiration of every human being on the face of the earth. This eternal bliss is the fruit of his purpose; “sweet is the sleep of the toiler…”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Ecclesiastes 5:11. R. Salanter’s application is that the person is enjoying the fruits of his labor, i.e. his good deeds, in the next world as he sleeps in death.</i>
Were it not for the strong words of our Sages, of blessed memory, which confirm and uphold all that we have taught, it would stand to reason that we should stand firm as a rock<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., We would not mourn at all because earning bliss in the World to Come is our main concern.</i> against the natural desire for a happy life in this world,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The natural desire is to focus on life in this world; accordingly, it makes sense to mourn the death of someone who departed with unrequited desires. However, the Sages’ approach - while it emphasizes the reward of the World to Come - nevertheless, takes this world/life seriously and calls on us to mourn the loss of a life. (See footnote 11).</i> and we would not complain about the departure of a noble man. His possessions are in his hand,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He acquired wisdom and good deeds that assured his place in the next world.</i> and who knows what would be the outcome of his struggle, were he to live on?! However, we must follow the words of the Sages, of blessed memory, to go and find a way to maintain fear and grief in our heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">R. Salanter is saying that the rational (i.e. religious) reaction to the death of the righteous should be joy, as he has attained life’s ultimate goal of attaining eternal reward in the next world. This shows yet again that R. Salanter profoundly internalized the centrality of reward and punishment in the next world to life in this world. Nevertheless, one must follow the Sages and train his heart to experience fear and grief. Actually, he is acknowledging that the Sages give greater weight to the significance of this life (or its untimely loss) than he does.</i>
Yet, for everything there is an occasion, and for every experience, a time.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Compare Ecclesiastes 3:1-2. R. Salanter is saying that the epidemic has created a time for grief in our life. We also are pained by the untimely loss of life. Nevertheless, we should guide our emotions not to fear the plague.</i> Now that this plague has appeared in the land, and even here—may the Merciful One save us—this is the teaching that should guide a person,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Compare II Samuel 7:19. The verse in II Samuel carries the overtone that this guidance is a gracious, unmerited gift from God.</i> and this is common sense: Do not be afraid of [the disease] at all. For what is human life in any case? Who knows if his [future] path [in life] would have turned out [to be] upright. Furthermore, we must act in accordance with the wise doctors’ instructions - for our religion tells us to walk by the light of their words<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Halakhah</i> considers “you shall safeguard your lives very much” (Deut. 4:15) to be a <i>mitzvah</i>. <i>Halakhah</i> also rules that saving a life overrules all of the Torah’s commandments except for three.</i> and thus uphold this life to be good and do good.
Experience also taught us in past days when the plague was rife, may the Merciful One save us, that whoever submitted to the burden of the doctors’ orders<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: bowed his shoulder to bear [the weight of] the doctors’ instructions. Compare Genesis 49:15.</i> vis-à-vis diet, etc., wisely, not foolishly, was not affected by plague or disease, may the Merciful One save us. Thus, since all religious behavior is altered, according to <i>halakhah </i>itself,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">R. Salanter is saying that one should not view the shift away from mourning and grief as the interference of a “secular” or “outside” approach in halakhic practice. Rather, <i>halakhah </i>itself commands us to follow the instructions of physicians. This is in keeping with R. Salanter’s leadership during the cholera epidemic in Vilna in 1848. R. Salanter insisted not only on doing life-saving work on Shabbat (and eating on <i>Yom Kippur</i> to protect life), but that all should follow  doctors’ orders and do anything that promotes health, without trying to minimize medically prescribed halakhic changes or seeking exemptions for religious activities.</i> at this time, one should not be excessively bitter on the holidays. This is the time to observe and serve God in joy, and this will be our strength.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Neḥemiah 8:10. There is a tension between joy and dread during the Days of Awe. Here, R. Salanter is instructing his disciples to tilt the balance away from dread by alluding to Ezra the Scribe’s admonition of those who were weeping on Rosh HaShanah that they should prepare festive meals and rejoice, for it is a joyous day. He is also responding to the doctors’ instructions that grief and mourning make the individual more vulnerable to illness, while joy strengthens resistance to the plague. The shift of balance from dread to joy is appropriate in a time of plague.</i>
Similarly, do not grieve or be upset about the precious soul [of the dead], for it has been freed from the troubles of vain life to go on to the ultimate destination of its journey.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">R. Salanter concludes by reasserting his belief that the untimely death of a righteous person means that the person has left the vanities of this life and gone to a desirable eternal reward.</i> May his soul be preserved in the bonds of life.
May God, May His Name Be Blessed, comfort [you]…
May you be blessed with the blessing of <i>mazal tov</i>, and the blessing of years of life and peace.

And that is why when they prayed for rain: Behold Rabbi Akiva's approach was like the way of Hilllel, to forego his reckonings [with others for their sins against him]. Hence he was answered from the Heavens measure for measure. However Rabbi Eliezer's approach was like the way of Shammai, so he would not forego his reckonings. Though it is true that he would receive much reward  about this - that which he did the will of God, may His name be blessed, according to his position; nevertheless, since he ultimately would not forego his reckonings, [for the Heavens to] forego the sins of the community would not have been measure for measure. And that is why he was not answered. So this is the meaning of the heavenly voice which said, "It is not because this one is greater than that one, but rather because this one forgoes his reckonings, etc." That is why he was answered, measure for measure, as just mentioned.
