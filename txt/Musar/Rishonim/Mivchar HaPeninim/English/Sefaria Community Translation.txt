Mivchar HaPeninim



Chapter 1































... The wise man instructed his son. Be wise. And learn. And be attentive. Or (at least) love wisdom. And don't be the fifth(a fool) less you be destroyed. [from the five levels of success: success, desire, involvement, interest, and failure.]
