Bechinat Olam



Chapter 1

The heavens are exalted, and the earth to the valley, and the breadth of the wise in heart is unexplored.
Loves the embrace of the roots of the quarry of his humanity.
There is no research into his wisdom and many of the heart research that is with him.
Many thoughts in the heart of the righteous, righteousness, love.
In him shall the Holy One of Israel be sanctified, and in his lips shall the God of glory be glorified....
There is no wisdom, and there is no counsel, and there is no understanding, and they have no shepherd.
Whoever humbles himself in the fullness of the whole will deny him.
