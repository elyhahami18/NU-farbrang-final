Introduction



i; On Knowing God and Desecrating God's Name

Due to the excellence of this trait, it surpasses all other virtues, and whoever attains this level of virtue will find it easy to ascend to all other spiritual and physical virtues, one level after another. Therefore, I have prioritized it above all other virtues included in this book and have combined with this trait matters that are fundamental pillars of faith and the roots of religion, upon which the Torah stands, since they also bring man to knowledge and recognition of his Creator.

And we also need to understand and know that the Creator, may He be blessed, does not have a body nor physicality, an image, or any appearance, as it is stated, <i>you heard the sound of words but perceived no image; nothing but a voice</i> (Deuteronomy 4:12). And it states, <i>To whom, then, can you liken God, what form compare to Him</i> (Isaiah 40:18). And it likewise states, <i>"To whom, then, can you liken Me, to whom can I be compared," says the Holy One</i> (Isaiah 40:25). And even though we have found many verses in which physical words are written about the Creator, may He be blessed — such as the matter that is stated, <i>The eyes of the Lord are everywhere</i> (Proverbs 15:3); <i>My own hand founded the earth</i> (Isaiah 48:13); <i>under His feet there was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire</i> (Exodus 24:10); <i>written with the finger of God</i> (Exodus 24:10); and many verses like these — they were only written to make people understand what they are able to understand. And about what is similar to this, the sages, may their memory be blessed, have said, "The Torah speaks in the language of people." So it is all appellations and metaphors regarding the Creator. But the central truth is that He is without a body or physical image. And we have been much warned in the Torah to distance ourselves from it, from physicalizing, like the matter that is stated, <i>[So you are to take exceeding care for your selves], for you did not see any image</i> (Deuteronomy 4:15).

ix; On Modesty and Immorality

My children, come and I will teach you the virtue of modesty. My children, you should know that the virtue of modesty is from the most important and pedigreed traits. As it one of the three traits that the Holy One, blessed be He, seeks from the Jewish people, as it is stated: <i>And what does the Lord require of you, etc. and to walk modestly with your God</i> (Micah 6:8). And not only that, but it protects a person from the evil eye, and saves him from sins and transgressions. For such do we find with the righteous Joseph, that because he acted modestly, he was saved from his mistress, the wife of Potiphar, and did stumble because of her. It is like the matter is stated: <i>and his master's wife lifted her eyes, etc.</i>. She lifted her eyes in order to gaze at him, but he did not lift his eyes to gaze at her. Accordingly did the sages, may their memory be blessed, say in the recountings (Bereishit Rabbah 87:10), that she placed an iron bar beneath his neck until he would direct his glance toward her and look at her. Nevertheless, he would not look at her. As it is stated: <i>They tortured his legs with chains; his body was placed in iron</i> (Psalms 105:18). And we found that a certain matron asked Rabbi Yose: She said to him, "Is it possible that Joseph was seventeen years old, standing in vigor, and he would not have done that thing?" He brought out the book of Genesis in front of them. He began to read the story of Reuben, and of Judah and Tamar. He said to her, "If Scripture did not cover for these, who were older and under their father's authority, all the more so would it be for this one who was younger and under his own authority."
