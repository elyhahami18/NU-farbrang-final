Seder Olam Rabbah

Introduction







Chapter 1

Chapter 1
From Adam to the Flood was 1656 years, and this is  their enumeration: Adam 130, Seth 105, Enosh 90, Kenan  70, Mahalalel 65, Jared 162, Enoch 65,  Methuselah 187, Lamech 182, and Noah was six hundred years old, etc." (Genesis 7, 6). Enoch buried Adam, and lived after him 57 years. Methuselah exhausted his days just before the Flood. From the Flood to the division [of languages] was 340 years. Noah lived ten years after the division [of languages]. Our father Abraham was at the division [of languages] 48 years old. Rabbi Yosei said: Eber was so great a prophet that he [preemptively] named his son Peleg ["division"], [aided] by the Holy Spirit. [Eber having foreseen what was to come] as it says "in his days the earth was divided" (Genesis 10, 25). 

Chapter 2

Chapter 2
Our forefather Jacob was 63 when he was blessed. Ishmael died at that time as is written, "Esau saw that Isaac had blessed...Jacob listened to his father...Esau saw [the Canaanite women] were bad [in the eyes of Isaac]...Esau went to Ishmael..."(Genesis 28:9). There seems no need for the verse to state "sister of Nebaioth." What do we learn from the fact that it says "sister of Nebaioth"? We learn that Ishmael died and Nebaioth [Ishmael's firstborn therefore] married off his sister to Esau. Jacob our forefather hid [from Esau] 14 years in the land of Israel and served Eber. Eber died two years after Jacob went to Aram-Naharaim. [Jacob] left and went to Aram-Naharaim and he was found by the well when he was 77 years old and he was in Laban's house for 20 years: 7 before he married any matriarchs, 7 from when he married in the Matriarchs and 6 years after the 11 tribes and Dinah were born. It comes out that all the tribes were born in seven years besides Benjamin. Each and every one each 7 months. He left Aram-Naharaim and came to Succoth and stayed there 18 months as is written "And Jacob went to Succoth" (Genesis 33:17). He left Succoth and went to Bet El and made 6 new encampments close to the place. 

Chapter 3


... The judgment of the wicked in Gehinnom lasts twelve months, as it says “And it shall be from new moon to new moon…” (Yeshayahu 66:23) R’ Yochanan ben Nuri says: from Pesach until Atzeret (Shavuot), as it says “…and from Sabbath to Sabbath…” (ibid.) After twelve months the souls of the sinners of Israel who transgressed the Torah and the commandments are consumed and their bodies are consumed and they are turned to dust. Gehinnom spits them out and the wind scatters them underneath the feet of the righteous, as it says “And you shall crush the wicked, for they will be as ash under the soles of your feet…” (Malachi 3:21) But those who separated from the ways of the community, like the Sadducees, and the betrayers and the hypocrites and the heretics, and those who ‘spread their terror in the land of the living,’ and those who denied the resurrection, and those who say Torah is not from heaven, and those who scoff at the words of the Sages – Gehinnom is locked before them and they are judged there forever, as it says “And they shall go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against Me…” (Yeshayahu 66:24) Not only this, but the netherworld will cease to be but they will not cease to be, as it says “…and their form will outlast the grave as his dwelling place (zevul).” (Tehillim 49:15) From His dwelling place He will wear out their form, and their form will wear out the netherworld. What caused this to happen to them? Because they stretched out their hands against the dwelling place, as it says ‘as his dwelling place,’ and there is no dwelling place other than the Holy Temple, as it says “I have surely built You a house to dwell in…” (Melachim I 8:13)

Chapter 4


The Flood was all of twelve months,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam a year about which no details are given is a simple, regular year of 354 days following the standard Jewish calendar.  Meir Ayin notes that this statement is found in Eduyot 2:10.</i> as it is written: "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened." (Genesis 7:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna interprets Seder Olam to mean that the year of the Flood is counted as full year.</i> And its generation will have no part in the World to Come, and will not be judged,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is a Mishna in Sanhedrin 10:3.  Rashi (Sanhedrin 108b) explains that the water of the Flood was boiling hot and that the generation of the Flood was judged and punished in that boiling water. Meir Ayin notes that the statement about the generation of the Flood is found in Sanhedrin 108a.</i> as it is written "My spirit shall not always strive with man" (Genesis 6:3). R. Yehoshua says: "In the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month" (Genesis 7:11), this is [the 17th of] Iyyar, which is the second [month] after Nissan in which the world was created,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that according to R. Yehoshua, Creation started on the first of Nissan, the day of the vernal equinox.</i> and in it Kimah [the Pleiades] sets. And because they changed their deeds before the Omnipresent, He changed the order of Creation for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashana 11b) reports a discussion of the dates given here between R. Yehoshua and R. Eliezer. According to R. Yehoshua, the world was created in Nissan and the Flood started in Iyyar, while according to R. Eliezer, the world was created in Tishri and the Flood started in Marcheshvan. The Talmud relates that the sages accept the opinion of R. Eliezer regarding the Flood but that of R. Yehoshua for the determination of seasons, as in our text.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that R. Yehoshua is of the opinion that the term Kimah in the Bible refers to the constellation Taurus, and that usually the sun is in that constellation in the month of Iyyar. Because of the sins of the generation of the Flood, the sun stayed in Aries, the constellation of the preceding month of Nissan, and in this way the usual order of the world was "perverted." R. Jacob Emdin explains that by the term Kimah, R. Yehoshua means the last three stars of the constellation Aries, that in his opinion represent cosmic cold.  The punishment of the generation of the Flood was that God took away two stars from that constellation so that cosmic heat would prevail.  Guggenheimer explains that the opinion that the sun already was shining on the first day of Creation is specific to the older Babylonian school of calendar computation and not followed in our current calendar. He explains the details of that older computation which places the beginning of the year and the beginning of Creation on Sunday, Nissan 1, 5 hours and 204 parts after mean midnight, according to the computation of R. Abraham bar Hiyya of Barcelona, the most important early source for Jewish calendar computation. According to that computation, the time from one appearance of the New Moon to the next is 29d 12h 793p, of which in the main computation the full 29 days are disregarded. This gives a difference of 1d 12h 793p between the molad of one month and the next.  The Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 11b, simply notes that the "sages of the Nations" count everything like R. Yehoshua.  Guggenheimer notes that by this term the Talmud refers to gentile astronomers who follow the Seleucid tradition of starting the year at the beginning of spring, which coincides approximately with the beginning of the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar, from whom we have systematic astronomical records. Meir Ayin notes that this statement is found in Rosh Hashana 11b and simply lists the verses quoted by R. Eliyahu from Vilna. </i> R. Eliezer says: "In the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month," this is Marcheshvan, the second [month] after Tishri in which the world was created,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that this is the opinion of all Yerushalmi sources (Rosh Hashanah 56b, Taanit 64a, Genesis rabba 33(10)). Guggenheimer notes that since the passage about the date of the Flood is not part of the halakhic portion of Seder Olam, it is not quoted in the Jerusalem Talmud. </i> and in it Kimah [Pleiades] rises,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Pleiades are visible only in winter.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the implication is that the beginning of summer started a full year of winter. R. Jacob Emdin explains that according to R. Eliezer, the term Kimah here refers to the last three stars of Aries. The punishment of the generation of the Flood was that God let the Pleiades rise during daytime so that it became impossible to determine the time of year from the stars.  Guggenheimer explains that in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 58b, the Pleiades represent cosmic frost, which battles Orion's cosmic heat. He notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud, the "windows of heaven" that were opened at the time of the Flood were opened by pulling two stars from the Pleiades, the beginning of a full year of winter.</i> and that was the time for rain.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rain in Israel falls only in winter. R. Jacob Emdin notes that according to all authorities, the 17th of Marcheshvan was the day on which the Pleiades disappeared from view.</i> The Sages [accept the opinion of] R. Eliezer regarding the Flood and [the opinion of] R. Yehoshua for the determination of seasons. <br> "And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights" (Genesis 7:12). Until when [did it rain]? Forty days and forty nights until the 27th of Kislev.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that the statement "until the 27th of Kislev" is according to R. Eliezer.</i> "And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days" (Genesis 7:24).  Until when [did the waters prevail]? Until the first of Sivan,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The first of Sivan is 150 days after the 27th of Kislev.  Meir Ayin simply lists the verse and adds that the waters prevailed from the 27th of Kislev until the 1st of Sivan, and that from the first of Sivan the waters started to recede.</i>  and the waters were standing still and silent, and the wicked were judged in them, each one according to his deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that according to the Yalqut, this period was from the 27th of Kislev until the first of Sivan.</i> "And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated." "And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen." (Genesis 8:3,5) <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin adds that the tops of the mountains were seen on the 1st of Av, the tenth month counting from the beginning of the rainy season.</i> The water was higher than the land by fifteen cubits, and it was gone in sixty days, a cubit every four days, a handbreath and a half every day.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It follows that on the 1st of Av, the water level was 15 cubits above ground. Meir Ayin notes that in some manuscripts the text has here "from the earth" but that the correct reading is "from the mountains." He explains that the waters were 15 cubits higher than the highest mountains.  Meir Ayin also notes that the text has "from the land" instead of "from the mountains" but that the correct reading is "from the mountains." He adds that this is explicitly stated in the Yalqut.</i>  <br> "And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat" (Genesis 8:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin simply lists the verse.</i>  This is Sivan. And when you start to count after the rain stopped falling, it turns out that it [the ark] rested after sixteen days. So how high was it [the ark's bottom] from the land? Four cubits!<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The ark landed on the mountains of Ararat after 16 days, when the water level went down by 4 cubits.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that this follows Rashi's commentary on Genesis 8:4. </i> And how much was its draught? Eleven cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the total height of the mountains of Ararat was 15 cubits. R. Jacob Emdin notes that Rashi explains that the water level at the time the ark landed was still 11 cubits higher than the land. </i> <br>  "And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made" (Genesis 8:6). After the time that the waters began to recede,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the forty days are counted not from the time the mountain tops became visible, but from the day the waters started to recede.  Meir Ayin notes that this is explicitly stated in Rashi's commentary.</i> in the tenth of Tammuz. "And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth" (Genesis 8:7). He waited seven days "and he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark" (Genesis 8:8-9). He waited another seven days "and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth" (Genesis 8:10-11).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that the reason for mentioning that "the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot" is to explain how it was possible for her to find an olive branch after another seven days. </i> He waited another seven days "And he sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more" (Genesis 8:12), she went and settled upon the mountain tops. "In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen" (Genesis 8:5), this is Av, when you start counting from [the time] that the rain began falling. From the first of Av until the first of Tishri, the waters were absorbed.  "And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth" (Genesis 8:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that the expression "the first day of the month" in this verse is taken to mean that the entire month was counted even if only one day of that month had passed.</i> Part of a month is like the entire month [for calendar computations]. We learn [from here] that when one day of the month enters, one counts a full month, and one day [of a new year] enters the year, one counts a full year, because part of the month is like the entire month, and part of the year is like the entire year.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashana 10a-11a) contains a discussion of the statement presented here between R. Meir and R. Eliezer ben Shamua. According to R. Meir, a year is counted full if only one day of that year has passed; according to R. Eliezer, at least 30 days have to pass. Seder Olam's formulation here is ambiguous in order to avoid deciding between the two opinions. Meir Ayin notes that the computation here is based on the Babylonian tradition as reported by R. Abraham bar Hiyya of Barcelona, who places the new moon of Creation on the 4th day of Creation. </i> "And the earth was dried". The waters that came from above were dispersed by the wind, and the waters that rose from below were absorbed in their places, but the earth was still damp, and of the consistency of paste. They waited, and did not sow until the rains came down because the water of the Flood was a sign of curse and there is in the curse no blessing. <br> "And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month" (Genesis 8:14), this is Marcheshvan,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that the reason that the calendar year of the Flood is a solar year, and not a lunar year like the 12 months of punishment in Gehinnom, seems to be that according to Genesis Rabbah 41:11, "The luminaries did not function in their usual manner during the time of the Flood." Therefore, it was a purely solar event.</i>  "was the earth dried". That makes a total of twelve full months, and another eleven days. What is the nature of these [days]? It teaches us that the solar year is eleven days longer than the lunar year.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin simply notes that this is explained in Genesis Rabbah 53:17. </i> R. Elazar said: Is it not from [the time of] the Creation of the world that the solar year is eleven days longer than the lunar year, since they were created full on the fifteenth [of Nissan]?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that since the sun started to shine at the beginning of the night of the Fourth Day of Creation, there are exactly one and a quarter days difference between the equinox of one year and that of the next. Hence, if Creation started on a Sunday, the moon was full on the 15th of Nissan, and the 11th of Nissan was a Wednesday.  The mean new moon of one month and that of the next are 29d 12h 793p apart, of which for the computation of the calendar the 29 full days are disregarded. So there is a difference of 1d 12h 793p = 1d 12h 44m 3 1/3s between the molad of one month and that of the next.  Meir Ayin notes that according to the Babylonian calendar tradition, the time of the molad is computed from the new moon that happened in the night of the Fourth Day of Creation at 9 hours and 742 parts. In Jewish calendar computation, the mean hour is divided into 1080 parts. According to R. Eliyahu from Vilna, the sages of Seder Olam answer R. Elazar by noting that the same relative position of sun and moon can be achieved also in an intercalary cycle of two simple and one intercalary year which may just contain 1095 days.  Guggenheimer explains that R. Eliezer identifies the light created on the first day of Creation with that of the sun, while according to our current calendar, the moon already was hanging in the sky as a full moon at the time of its creation. Hence, both moon and sun would reach the same position on Iyyar 1 of the year 2.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that all of Creation was completed on the 15th of Nissan and that according to the biblical text, there was no deficiency in the luminaries at that time. Hence, the moon already was full on the first day of Creation and would therefore return to its full position after 29 1/2 days, corresponding to a difference of 11 days to the solar year. </i> Subtract from here four [days], you arrive at eleven. They said to him: But after the first intercalation, the moon caught up with the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The sages refer to the fact that after the first intercalation of a month, the moon again is in conjunction with the sun. Meir Ayin explains that from Creation on, it is impossible to compute from the molad, since after the first intercalary cycle of two simple and one intercalary year, the moon again is in conjunction with the sun.  </i> He said to them: It is always periodic, and returns. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He who wants to determine the sign of the solar year that it is eleven days longer than the lunar year, should make a mark at the summer solstice, and in the year following, it [the sun] will not get there until after eleven days. And so you know that the days of the sun are eleven days longer than the days of the moon. 

Chapter 5


All seven days was the Holy One, praised be He, speaking with Moses at the thornbush,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the statement "all seven days" is based on a simple computation of the three "three days ago" mentioned in the verse. Meir Ayin notes that this statement is quoted in Yalqut Shemot 152.</i> as it is written: "And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue." (Exodus 4:10). "Heretofore" is three days, and three [times] "neither, nor, nor," and the day on which He was speaking, in all seven days. And this section was [at the time of] Passover, and they fix it on the 15th of Nissan.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this follows from his commentary on the preceding chapter, that the ten plagues took a full year from the time Moses was first sent to Pharaoh.  He also notes that in a different midrashic source (Exodus Rabbah 9(12)) it is stated that the duration of each plague was one month; hence, there would not have been time to accommodate the entire sequence of ten plagues in half a year. R. Jacob Emdin notes that he already explained this in chapter 3. Meir Ayin notes that the statement "and they fix it on the 15th of Nissan" is not found in the Yalqut. </i>  And in that same time the next year, the Children of Israel went out from Egypt. Also on the 15th of Nisan was our father Abraham spoken to at the Covenant Between the Pieces,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the Covenant Between the Pieces and the Exodus both happened on the same calendar date, Nisan 15, "exactly on that day." (Ex. 12:41).   Meir Ayin notes that this tradition is found in Tanhuma Buber, Beshallah 9.</i> on the 15th of Nisan the angels came to our forefather Abraham to announce to him [the birth of Isaac], and in that same Section of the year following was Isaac born,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is in accordance with Genesis 18:14: "At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son." Meir Ayin notes that Tanhuma, Pequdei 11, places the birth of Isaac on Nisan 1.</i>  as it is written "At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son" (Genesis 18:14), and on the 15th of Nisan the Children of Israel went out from Egypt, as it is written "And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt" (Exodus 12:41), [that is] one term for all [of these events]. On the 14th [of Nisan] the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt, and on the fifth day [after that] was the last festival day of Passover. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam, Passover started on a Friday. This is also the opinion of Rashi and Tosaphot (Sabbath 87b). R. Jacob Emdin notes that in Megillah 8a it is reported that the Rabbis disagree about the date of the Exodus. In the opinion of R. Yose, it was on a Friday and in the opinion of R. Yehuda, it was on a Tuesday. According to all Babylonian sources, the giving of the Torah was on a Sabbath, and the day of the giving of the Torah is the holiday of Shavuot, which is 50 days after Passover.  Hence, in Babylonian tradition Passover started on a Friday.  R. Jacob Emdin explains that the 14th of Nisan, the day of slaughtering the Paschal lamb, was a Thursday, and that the Children of Israel left Egypt the next morning, Friday the 15th. He adds that it is explicitly stated in the Bible that they travelled day and night; hence, it is reasonable to assume that the places mentioned in the Biblical narrative are places of rest, one per day.  The argument for placing the Exodus on a Friday is that according to Jewish tradition, Pentecost was on a Sabbath, as derived from Ex. 13:3: "Remember this day, in which ye came out of Egypt" and Ex. 20:8: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." By applying the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," one sees that since Ex. 13:3 was spoken on the 15th of Nisan, also Ex. 20:8 refers to a Sabbath.  Since the giving of the Torah was 50 days after the Exodus, the Exodus must have been on a Friday. R. Jacob Emdin notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 8a) the Children of Israel left Rameses, the first station of their journey to the Red Sea, on a Sabbath, since Scripture does not specifically state that they travelled for seven days. However, Meir Ayin notes that the text here reflects the opinion of the Babylonian Talmud, Sabbath 8a, that "the 14th [of Nisan] the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt," while in the Yalqut it says "on the 14th day the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt and the day was Wednesday." </i>  And in that night the firstborn [of Egypt] were stricken. From the day after Passover,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the term "Passover" here refers to the ritual of slaughtering the Paschal lamb on the afternoon of the 14th of Nisan.</i>  which was a Friday, they travelled from Rameses, as it is written: "And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children" (Exodus 12:37), and it is written "And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the Lord had smitten among them: upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments" (Numbers 33:3-4).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states explicitly that the Children of Israel left Egypt on the day after the slaughtering of the Passover sacrifice. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam, the Children of Israel traveled day and night, resting only one day at each of the places mentioned in the Exodus narrative.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that there is a disagreement in the Talmud (Shabbat 8a) regarding the day on which the Children of Israel left Rameses. According to Rab, it was on a Friday, while according to Shmuel, it was on a Sunday. The former opinion is adopted by Rashi, the latter by Tosafot.  </i> From Rameses they traveled to Succoth, and from Succoth to Etham, and from Etham to Pi-hahiroth, in all three days.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the places mentioned in the list of Num. 33 are resting places for the Israelites.</i>  On the fourth day, "And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled" (Exodus 14:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The news that the Children of Israel had left their assigned place of residence reached Pharaoh on the day following their arrival at Pi-hahiroth.</i> On the fifth and the sixth, "And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon" (Exodus 14:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this disagrees with Rashi, who thinks that Pi-hahiroth was close to Egypt, just two days away from the last place where Pharaoh resided. The implication of Seder Olam is that there were at least five days between Pharaoh's residence and Pi-hahiroth.</i> In the evening of the seventh day, they went down to the sea, as it is written "And the cloud and darkness [were there, but it gave] light by night [to them]" (Exodus 14:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The implication here is that the sea split during the night, and the Egyptians were drowned the next morning.</i> In the morning, Israel went up from the sea, and Egypt sank, and in that hour the Children of Israel said the song, as it is written "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord" (Exodus 15:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that since Iyyar 1 was a Sabbath, it follows that Nisan 14, the day on which the Children of Israel slaughtered the Passover sacrifice in Egypt, was a Thursday. The statement that the Israelites sang the song of the sea on the last festival day of Passover disagrees with the Midrash (Exodus Rabbah 23(11), Mechilta Beshallah 4, Shirata 3) that Moses and the Children of Israel said the song on the seventh day after the crossing of the Red Sea, when Miriam and the women sang and danced with timbrels.  Guggenheimer explains that according to R.

Yohanan.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in some manuscripts of Seder Olam and the Talmud, the wording of the arguments is almost identical.  He explains that in Yerushalmi sources, the six commandments given to Adam are: recognition of God, prohibition of idolatry, prohibition of murder, prohibition of adultery, prohibition of robbery, and establishment of courts.  The prohibition of eating limbs of a live animal was added for Noah, since before the Flood only vegetarian food was permitted.  In Genesis Rabbah, R. Jacob of Kfar Hanin notes that the verse Gen. 2:17 also contains a hint to the future prohibition of eating limbs of a live animal.  Guggenheimer notes that the detailed derivation of the seven Noahide laws from Gen. 2:16-17 presented here is based on the hermeneutic principle of "gezerah shavah" ("equal decree"), that all words of God in the Pentateuch have the same meaning.  He explains that the verse Gen. 2:16 only serves as mnemonic device, since all seven laws are explicitly stated elsewhere in Genesis: the prohibition of incest and adultery in 2:24 and the prohibition of murder in 9:6.  He also explains that the term "law" ("dinim") in the text refers to the specific laws mentioned in Ex. 21-23, while the term "ordinance" ("hukim") refers to ritual laws.</i> and so it says "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him" (Genesis 18:19).

"God" - this is idolatry,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">R.

"Saying"-  this is adultery,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in some manuscripts one finds a tradition that the prohibition of adultery was derived from the verse (Ex. 20:14): "Thou shalt not commit adultery." In his opinion, this is a later addition, probably taken from Leviticus Rabbah 23.  He notes that the Talmud (Yevamot 11:12) understands the prohibition of adultery to be derived from the verse (Gen. 2:24): "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."  Guggenheimer explains that "saying" refers to adultery by gezerah shavah from the verse in Jeremiah: "Saying, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord." (Jeremiah 3:1). Since there are no divorces for non-Jews, the verse in Jeremiah cannot apply to gentiles and therefore must be taken as symbolic.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that this is explained in Sanhedrin 56b.</i> as it is written "Saying, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord" (Jeremiah 3:1). "Of every tree of the garden" this is robbery, as it is written: "or anything else about which one swore falsely, that person shall repay the principal amount and add a fifth part to it." (Leviticus 5:24). And R. Hiyya taught: "[produce] that is guarded on the roof is forbidden because of [the laws of] robbery, and [produce] that is not guarded on the roof is permitted because of [the laws of] robbery." "Thou mayest freely eat" - this is [the prohibition of eating] a limb from a live animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">R.

(Genesis 9:4). The Children of Israel added to these at that time [Sabbath], the laws, and the honoring of father and mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to R. Yehoshua (Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ismael, Beshallah 1, ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 156) "ordinances" ("hukim") refer to the Sabbath, and "laws" ("dinim") refer to the honoring of father and mother.  In his opinion, since the Sabbath was given before the Children of Israel arrived at Sinai (Ex. 16) and "as I commanded you" refers to a commandment given at Marah, the commandment to honor one's parents must also have been given at Marah.  In a different tradition (Jerusalem Talmud, Bezah 2:1, fol. 61a) it is discussed whether the Sabbath was given at Marah or at Alush, the station before Rephidim (Num. 33:13, Ex. 16:1). R. Jacob Emdin explains that the statement that the Children of Israel received the Ten Commandments at Marah refers to the specific rulings on the thirty-nine categories of forbidden work on the Sabbath, as opposed to the general prohibition to work on Sabbath that was given earlier.  He notes that this agrees with the general approach of Seder Olam, that if a matter is stated in general terms, it was already given before; a subsequent statement of details of the law implies that before that the general law was already known.</i><br>From Marah they travelled to Elim, as it is written: "And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they encamped there" (Numbers 33:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that the verse implies that the Children of Israel encamped only near water.</i> So we learn [from here] that the Children of Israel only encamped near water.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Yehoshua in the Mekhilta, Israel arrived at Alush on Sunday and rested there on the next day, Monday.  However, manuscripts of Seder Olam put the day of rest at Alush on Sabbath and this is the reading of most Yerushalmi sources. R. Eliyahu from Vilna points out that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) notes that it is possible that Israel arrived at Alush on Sabbath if one assumes that the month of Iyyar of that year had 30 days.

Yehoshua's opinion in the Mekhilta (Beshallah 1, ed.

However, Guggenheimer prefers to follow the manuscript readings against the reading of the editio princeps. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in Ashkenazic manuscripts one reads here "Sabbath," not "Sunday."  He explains that this is the reading of the Mekhilta. R. Jacob Emdin notes that Seder Olam is of the opinion here that at Alush the Israelites received the commandments regarding "techum Shabbat" ("Sabbath limit"), the prohibition to leave the camp on Sabbath, but that they did not yet observe the laws of Sabbath since the verse Ex. 16:22 states that "on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread," implying that on the following Sabbath, they left the camp to gather manna.  Meir Ayin, quoting Keddushin 38a, states that they learned that at Alush the Children of Israel received the law of "techum Shabbat."</i> and there the Children of Israel kept the first Sabbath, as it is written "And the people rested on the seventh day" (Exodus 16:30).

Aqiba (Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashanah 11b), the Ten Commandments were given to Israel on the seventh day of the week, the seventh day of the month, and the seventh day of their encampment at Sinai.  However, this chronology is impossible to accept if the holiday of Shavuot, the "time of the giving of the Torah," was on Sabbath, the 50th day after the Exodus.  Therefore, Seder Olam follows here the chronology of R. Yose the Galilean (Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 11a). Meir Ayin notes that this is a Baraita and not according to R. Yose, but to the Sages.</i>  

Chapter 6


On the seventh day after the Ten Commandments Moshe went up on the mountain, as it says "The Presence of the LORD abode on Mount Sinai, and the cloud hid it for six days..." (Shemot 24:16) This was in order for Moshe to purify himself. "On the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud." (ibid.) "Moses went inside the cloud and ascended the mountain; and Moses remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights." (Shemot 24:18) On the 17th of Tammuz he  came down and shattered the tablets, "The next day Moses said to the people, “You have been guilty of a great sin. Yet I will now go up to the LORD; perhaps I may win forgiveness for your sin.” Moshe went back up on the 18th of Tammuz and pleaded for mercy on behalf of Israel, as it is written "When I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights, because the LORD was determined to destroy you," (Devarim 9:25) At that moment, the Holy One once again viewed Israel with favor and said to Moshe to carve new tablets and to come up the mountain once again, as it says "Thereupon the LORD said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain; and make an ark of wood." (Devarim 10:1) He came down on the 28th of Av and carved the second tablets, as it says "So Moses carved two tablets of stone, like the first, and early in the morning he went up on Mount Sinai..." (Shemot 34:4) He went back up on the 29th of Av and the Torah was repeated to him a second time, as it says "I had stayed on the mountain, as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD heeded me once again: the LORD agreed not to destroy you." (Devarim 10:10) 'As I did the first time,' just as the first was a time of favor, so too the second were a time of favor- we can derive from this that those in the middle were a time of anger. He came down on the 10th of Tishre, which was Yom Kippur, and announced to them that they had found favor before God (Hamakom), as it says "Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own!” (Shemot 34:9) Therefore it was established as a fixed day and a remembrance for the generations, as it says "This shall be to you a law for all time: to make atonement for the Israelites for all their sins once a year..." (Vayikra 16:34)  

Chapter 7


"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof" (Exodus 40:1-4).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that by erecting and disassembling the Tabernacle on each of the seven days of consecration, Moses made sure that its erection on the first of Nissan would be a mitzvah in its own right, since any act repeated on the Sabbath is forbidden (Shabbat 92a).  R. Jacob Emdin, on the other hand, thinks that the statement that Moses erected and disassembled the Tabernacle each day is found only in late sources and cannot be reconciled with the biblical text. He explains that the tent of the tabernacle was standing during all seven days, since otherwise the parts to be eaten by Aaron and his sons (Lev. 8) could not have been consumed within the holy precinct. </i> The seven days of consecration started on the 23rd of Adar and were completed on the first of Nissan.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the source for the statement that the seven days of consecration started on the 23rd of Adar is that in Leviticus 9:1, the eighth day of consecration is mentioned, and Ex. 40:17 states that the Tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month. He adds that according to his tradition, the first of Nisan is always a Sunday. Meir Ayin notes that this is explained in Rosh Hashanah 11a, 12a.</i>  During all the seven days of consecration, Moses would erect the Tabernacle each morning and bring sacrifices and disassemble it. On the eighth [day], he erected it and did not disassemble it. R. Yose the son of R. Judah says: Also on the eighth [day] he erected it and disassembled it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that R. Yose the son of R. Judah is of the opinion that Moses disassembled the Tabernacle on the eighth day after bringing the sacrifices in order to receive a direct order from God to re-erect it.  Guggenheimer notes that the proof that the first of Nisan really was the eighth day of celebration is given in Sifra Shemini 14. The argument is based on the fact that Moses officiated during all seven days of consecration, but the Shekhinah dwelled on the Tabernacle only when Aaron performed the service as high priest (Lev. 9:4). According to Sifra, one could also quote Exodus 40:1, 35 to prove that the eighth day and the first of Nisan were identical. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that R. Zeira, an Amora of the fourth generation, infers from the statement here that any construction performed at night is invalid for the daytime.</i>  <br>"And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket" (Exodus 29:32). "And thou shalt abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not: for so I am commanded."

Now, the laws of ritual impurity related to contact with the dead are described in Num. 19. There it is stated that any such impurity needs a full seven days to be removed. Hence, anyone impure on Nissan 14 must have been in contact with the dead on or after Nissan 7. The Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 25a, relates a discussion about the identity of these people, and the conclusion is that it was the people who had buried a recent dead whom nobody else was burying.

(Numbers 33:2). They went out from the wilderness of Sinai and came to the Graves of Lust, and dwelled there thirty days,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer explains that Seder Olam's computation follows the statement that they never travelled more than one day from one recorded station to the next.</i> as it is written "And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold..." (Numbers 11:19-20). They journeyed from the Graves of Lust and came to Hazeroth, and dwelled there seven days, as it is written "And Miriam was shut up..." (Numbers 12:15). They went out from Hazeroth and came to the Wilderness of Paran. On the 28th of Sivan,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer notes that 28 Sivan is the latest possible date for sending out the spies since the first grapes in Israel appear on the market in Sivan. If the spies were sent when grapes were still primeurs, the 28th of Sivan is the latest possible date for sending them out. This is another instance where Seder Olam infers a date from an indirect remark in the biblical text. The Babylonian Talmud (Taanit 29a) notes that according to Seder Olam, Moses sent out the spies on 29 Sivan, but that by the principle that "Moses did everything always very early in the morning," the spies must have returned on 8 Av. Since Av is a short month of 29 days, the spies were gone for 39 days, and not 40 as explicitly stated in Numbers.  Abbai explains the discrepancy by saying that in that year Tammuz was made to be 30 days long in order to compensate for the shortening of the winter by one day because of the inauguration of the Tabernacle (see Chapter 4).  Guggenheimer rejects this explanation, noting that according to Seder 'Olam, Tammuz always has 29 days, and that the spies simply spent an additional day waiting for the assembly of the people. </i> Moses sent out the spies, as it is written "And the time was..." (Numbers 13:20). "And they returned from searching...forty days" (Numbers 13:25), that was the ninth of Av.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This date follows from the preceding by simply adding 40 days to the 28th of Sivan.  See also previous note.</i> So it turns out saying: On the Ninth of Av it was decreed...that they would not enter the Land. After the spies was the strife of Korah, and his being swallowed up..., as it is written "Wilt thou put out..." (Numbers 16:14). "And the anger..." (Numbers 16:46). And it says "And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea..." (Deuteronomy 2:14). Nineteen years they were circling about..., and nineteen years they dwelled in Kadesh-barnea,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The 19 years of wandering and the 19 years in Kadesh-barnea add up to the 38 years mentioned in Deuteronomy.</i> as it is written "Ye abode in Kadesh..." (Deuteronomy 1:46).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer explains that this means that the total time spent at Kadesh was equal to the total time spent at all other stations.</i> So it turns out, all the journeys were 42 journeys.  

Chapter 9

Chapter 9
They [the Israelites]--the entire congregation--came to the wilderness of Tzin in the first month, and the nation settled there, and Miriam died there and was buried there, and therre was not water for the congregation, and they gathered against Moses and Aaron (Numbers 20:1-2). When the well disappeared, it was Year 40, and it was the first of the month of Nissan, there in the episode when Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the King of Edom (ibid. 20:14), and Israel made [themselves] there for 3 months. Aaron the Priest went up etc., and Aaron was 123 years old when he died at the hill of the mountain (ibid. 33). When Aaron died, the clouds of glory disappeared, and the Canaanites came to make war against Israel. The Canaanites, King of Arad, heard etc. (ibid. 33:40), but what hearing did he hear? He heard that Aaron died, and he the greatest scout traveled among them, and the cloud of glory disappeared, for he had fought for them, and he came to fight with them, and they retreated seven stations and camped at Moserah, for it says "The Israelites traveled from Be'erot Beney Ya'akan towards Moserah; there Aaron died" (Deuteronomy 10:6). Did Aaron die in Moserah? Lo, did he not die at the hill of the mountain? Rather, starting from the location where Aaron died, they retreated seven stations, until they encamped at Moserah, and, from there they traveled towards HaGidgad, etc. (ibid. 10:7), and, from there, towards Be'er etc. (Numbers 21:16), which is the well to which they returned. The Israelites traveled and encamped in Avot, and they traveled from Avot and encamped in Iyyey Ha'avarim etc., and from there they traveled and encamped at the Wadi Zered, and from there they traveled and encamped beyond Arnon etc. (ibid.). There they fought with Sihon, and Israel struck him with the sword etc., and they turned and arose on the path of Bashan etc., "and the Lord said to Moses: 'Do not fear him etc.' and they struck him and his children etc." (ibid.). "The Israelites traveled and encamped at Arvot Mo'av etc." (ibid. 22:1). "It was after the plague etc." (ibid. 26:19), "for these the land shall be divided etc." (ibid. 26:53), and, when staying in Arvot Mo'av, the children retreated to their parents, and their parents retracted and gave inheritance to their children. Serah bat Asher was among those who came to Egypt and those who left it. [She was] from those who came to Egypt, as it is written, "And Serah their sister" (Genesis 46:17), and [she was] from those who came to the Land [of Israel], as it says, "And there was the daughter of Asher, Serah" (Numbers 26:46). And Yokheved was among those who came to Egypt and those who left it. [She was] from those who came to Egypt, as it is written, "And the name of the wife of Amram was Yokheved, daughter of Levi etc." (ibid. 26:59). Ya'ir son of Menasheh and Makhir son of Menasheh were born in the lifetime of our ancestor Jacob, and they died after the death of Moses our teacher, and Novach was among those born in Egypt, and he died after the death of Moses our teacher, and he was buried beyond the Jordan, but there was no man among them left etc. (ibid. 26:65).

Chapter 10

Chapter 10
“And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them; After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei” (Deuteronomy 1:3-4).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer notes that this means that all laws mentioned in Numbers from 1:1 to 19:22 were given either at the time of consecration of the Tabernacle, or during the second year after the Exodus. He also notes that the remaining 38 years are without record except for the list of stations (Num. 33) and the few remarks in Deuteronomy quoted at the end of this chapter. </i> From the first of Shevat until the sixth of Adar, thirty-six days, did Moses our Teacher expound the entire Torah. On the sixth [of Adar] "And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die..." (Deuteronomy 31:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin asks, if you have a difficulty understanding why Scripture reduced one year from the life of the righteous [Moses], see what he wrote in his Sefer Yaavetz, Section 133, at the end of this chapter. Guggenheimer notes that the computation of the date of Moses's death is quoted at length in the Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 38a, and in a shortened version, in Tosefta Sotah 11, in both versions of Tanhuma, and in Deut. Rabba, end of Vaethanan, and Sifry Deut. 304.  He notes that according to all sources, Moses died on 7 Adar. He explains that Josephus puts Moses's death on 1 Adar because he simply copied the dates of the deaths of Miriam and Aaron. </i> On the seventh of Adar "And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day..." (Deuteronomy 31:1-2). Why does Scripture say "this day"? It says "this day" to teach us that on the seventh of Adar was Moses born, and on the seventh of Adar he died, as it is written "So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (Deuteronomy 34:5-7).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that he explains in his Sefer Yaavetz which day of the week was 7 Adar. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the argument is based on the verses "an hundred and twenty years old this day" (Deut. 31:2), and "And there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And the number of your days I will fulfil" (Ex. 23:26), which mean that the just will complete the full measure of their years.  Guggenheimer notes that the first part of Ex. 23:26 speaks of the general blessing bestowed on Israel and the second part is addressed to Moses personally.</i> "And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan..." "And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it" (Joshua 1:1-2,10-11). "And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho" (Joshua 4:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer notes that the verse "Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise" (Joshua 1:2) means that Joshua should act immediately, on the day following the 30 days of mourning.  He notes that according to this verse, Israel crossed the Jordan on 10 Nisan. Hence, the mourning started on the day of Moses's death, and to compute that day, one has to subtract 32 from 39.</i> Count from there thirty-three days backwards, and you will learn that Moses our teacher died on the seventh of Adar.  <br>Three good providers arose for Israel, and these are they: Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. And three good gifts were given through them to Israel, and these are they: the well, and the pillar of cloud, and the Mannah. The Mannah was [given] by the merit of Moses, the pillar of cloud by the merit of Aaron, the well by the merit of Miriam. Miriam died, the well disappeared, it was given back to Israel by the merit of Moses and Aaron. Aaron died, the pillar of cloud disappeared, it was given back to them by the merit of Moses. [Moses died],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna adds "Moses died" here.  The bracket is a later addition.</i>  all three disappeared, and they did not return, as it is written "And I cut off the three shepherds in one month" (Zechariah 11:8). Did they die in one month? They died in one year! Miriam died on the tenth of Nissan,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is a Tosephta of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, reported in the Babylonian Talmud (Taanit 9a).  Guggenheimer notes that Megilat Taanit, which reports the same tradition, probably also is from the school of R. Yose the son of R. Yehudah, in contrast to Josephus who puts Miriam's death on the first of Nissan.  R. Jacob Emdin, however, notes that R. Yose the son of R. Judah's opinion is accepted by Yerushalmi sources, such as the Yerushalmi Targum (Pseudo-Jonathan) to Num. 20, and copied from there by the Gaonic Halakhot Gedolot, and the medieval Tur and Shulhan Arukh.</i>  and Aaron on the first of Av,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Rather, on the day that Moses died, all three disappeared and never returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that, according to Seder Olam, all three good providers died in different months and the verse "And I cut off the three shepherds in one month" does not refer to the month of their death, but to the month in which the Temple was destroyed.  R. Jacob Emdin interprets the statement in the Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 17a, that the wicked are judged for 12 months in Gehinnom, but that according to R. Yohanan ben Nuri the 12 months are counted from Passover to Shavuot, to mean that R. Yohanan ben Nuri holds that only the three Pilgrimage Festivals have the full status of Shabbatot.  He explains that Seder Olam, however, is of the opinion that the term Shabbat is applicable also to the holiday of Sukkot. He also thinks that the statement that both Temples were destroyed on the end of Shabbat, at the end of a Sabbatical year, when the priests of the family of Jehoiarib were officiating, is a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 22a, Arakhin 11b.</i> <br>From the Mannah that they collected on the seventh of Adar they ate until the sixteenth of Nissan,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is based on Joshua 5:11, which states that from the day after Passover the children of Israel ate of the produce of the land.  It follows that on that day, the Mannah ceased.  He also notes that Ashkenazic manuscripts read "Shabbat" instead of "Sunday" for the date of rest at Alush (see chapter 5), but that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) states that they could have arrived at Alush on the Sabbath if we assume that in that year Iyyar was 30 days long.  R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the statement "on the seventh of Adar they ate..." refers to the time after the death of Moses, and before the crossing of the Jordan, that by the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain" one has to assume that the biblical year is counted from Nisan, not Tishri.  Guggenheimer explains that by the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," the date of the last Mannah is taken to be that of the day before the beginning of eating food from the land of Israel, which is given as the day after Passover, 15 Nisan.</i> as it is written "And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year." (Joshua 5:12). Why does Scripture say "And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan" (Exodus 16:35)? The day Moses died, the Mannah stopped coming down. "They did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan",<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning here is that the Mannah that they still had with them disappeared at the border of the land. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi interprets "yamim" in "yamim ve'arba'ah hodashim" (1 Sam. 27:7) as "two days and four months" and not as "one year and four months" since David went to Achish only after the death of Samuel, and Saul only ruled four months after the death of Samuel (according to Seder 'Olam). In addition, he notes that in French manuscripts the text reads "four months," not "about four months."   Guggenheimer explains that the word "yamim" in the verse cited here, that usually means "days," must mean "two days" since by the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," if "yamim" meant "years," then David would have been with Achish for one full year and four months, but this is impossible by the chronology established in Seder 'Olam. </i> that day the Manna that they had in their hands disappeared.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam, they ate Mannah for 39 years and 10 months. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the correct reading is "39 years" since they ate unleavened bread in the 40th year, and Scripture counts a year as full if even one day of the year was complete, but that Seder Olam refers here to 40 "years of servitude" (Exodus 16:35), counting the time they spent as slaves in Egypt.</i> That makes forty years minus thirty days, and thirty days that they ate from the cakes that they took with them from Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 38a), "the cakes that they took out from Egypt had the taste of the Mannah."</i>  which were good for them, like the Mannah. 
This is where the chapter ends and so does part 1 of Seder Olam

Chapter 12



Chapter 13

Eli led Israel for forty years, and the day Eli died, he forsook his tabernacle, as it is said, “He rejected the tent of Joseph” (Psalm 78:67), and “He gave His strength into captivity” (Psalm 78:61). And the Ark of the Lord was in the field of the Philistines for seven months. The Philistines called and said (1 Samuel 6:1-2). The men of Kiriath-Jearim came and took it, and it was from the day the Ark rested (1 Samuel 7:2). Subtract from these seven years the time David reigned in Hebron over Judah, which remained there for thirteen years, and subtract eleven years for Samuel himself and two years for Samuel and Saul. It was from the day the Ark rested (1 Samuel 7:2). At the beginning of these twenty years, the Tabernacle was brought to Nob. Although the Ark of the Lord was in Kiriath-Jearim, in Nob they offered sacrifices for thirteen years and for seven years in Gibeon. At the end of twenty years, David moved the Ark of the Lord from Kiriath-Jearim to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite, and the Ark of the Lord stayed in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months (2 Samuel 6:11). From this, we learn that Obed-Edom was blessed only because of the Ark of God. <br>Saul was one year into his reign (1 Samuel 13:1). Samuel said to Saul at the time of his anointing, “You will go down before me to Gilgal” (1 Samuel 10:8). Saul went down in the first year and struck the Ammonite king, and the Israelites anointed him. In the second year, he went down and did not keep his promise. Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord” (1 Samuel 13:13). In that chapter, David was anointed, as it is said, “And the Lord said to Samuel, ‘How long will you mourn for Saul?’” (1 Samuel 16:1). Then Samuel took the horn of oil (1 Samuel 16:13), and he was twenty-nine years old. And Saul was hostile towards David (1 Samuel 18:9), and it is said, “The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul” (1 Samuel 16:14). In that chapter, Nob was destroyed, and they came to Gibeon. <br>All the days of Samuel the Seer were only fifty-two years. It is also said, “Eli the priest sat on the seat” (1 Samuel 1:9), and she was bitter in soul (1 Samuel 1:10). In that chapter, he was appointed as a judge, and it is said, “And he judged Israel forty years” (1 Samuel 4:18). Thirteen years remained. Subtract one year for the intercalation, eleven years for Samuel, and one year for Saul. Thus, fifty-two years. Samuel died about four months before Saul's death, as it is said, “And the number of days that David stayed in the field of the Philistines was days and four months” (1 Samuel 27:7). And afterward, David inquired of the Lord, saying (1 Samuel 30:8). Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, was forty years old when he began to reign (2 Samuel 2:10), and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. The kingdom of Israel was therefore nullified for five and a half years. All the elders of Israel came to King Hebron (2 Samuel 5:3). In that chapter, David was anointed again, being thirty years old at his anointing (2 Samuel 5:4), and he reigned for forty years.

“And in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, at the completion of the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah, the Lord aroused… So said Cyrus, the king of Persia… Who is among you of all His people… And the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose…” (Ezra 1:1-5) “…forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty. Besides their slaves…” (Ezra 2:64-65) This was the overall count, but in specifics of the count they are only thirty thousand three hundred and sixty. Where did the other twelve thousand go? These are the members of the other tribes who went up. “And they set the altar on its bases… And they gave money to the quarries…” (Ezra 3:1-7) Cyrus reigned for three truncated years. “And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign… Then the work of the House of God, which was in Jerusalem, was stopped…” (Ezra 4:6-24) “In the third year of his reign, he made a banquet…” (Esther 1:3) Esther was hidden in Shushan the capitol for four years, “So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus…” (Esther 2:16) Haman gathered spoils against Mordecai for five years, “In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus…” (Esther 3:7) On the thirteenth of Nisan Haman wrote the letters “…to destroy, kill, and cause to perish all the Jews…” (Esther 3:13) On the fifteenth of Nisan Esther went in to the king. On the sixteenth of Nisan they hung Haman. On the twenty-third of Nisan Mordecai wrote letters to contradict Haman’s decree. On the thirteenth of Adar “And the Jews smote all their enemies…” (Esther 9:5) They killed five hundred in Shushan, and they hung the ten sons of Haman because “…they wrote an accusation against the dwellers of Judea and Jerusalem.” (Ezra 4:6) “On that day, the number of those slain in Shushan the capital came before the king.” (Esther 9:11) And at that time in the coming year, it says “Now, Queen Esther, the daughter of Avichayil, and Mordecai the Jew wrote down…” (Esther 9:29) Behold, it says “For at the completion of seventy years of Babylon…” (Jeremiah 29:10) and “…since the destruction of Jerusalem seventy years.” (Daniel 9:2) Israel spent fifty-two years after the destruction of the Temple under the rule of the Chaldeans, and then they went up. Three years of Cyrus, fourteen of Ahasuerus, two of Darius. In the second year of Darius, the Temple was rebuilt. So Zechariah said “And the angel of the Lord replied and said, ‘O Lord of Hosts! How long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem and upon the cities of Judah, upon whom You are wroth for seventy years already?’” (Zechariah 1:12) The Temple stood for four years, as it says “And the completion of this House…” (Ezra 6:15) And at that time in the coming year Ezra came up from Babylon with a new group of exiles, as it says “Ezra ascended from Babylon… And there ascended from the Children of Israel… in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes… For on the first of the first month… For Ezra had prepared his heart…” (Ezra 7:6-10) He came and separated Israel from the foreign women.

Chapter 30


... Rabbi Yossi says, "A merit ends up being on a day of merit and a punishment ends up being on a day of punishment. For you will find to say that when the First Temple was destroyed, that day was the culmination of the Shabbat, and it was at the culmination of the sabbatical year and it was during the watch of Yehoyariv and it was the ninth of Av. And likewise with the Second. And in both this one and that one, the Levites were standing on the platform and reciting song. And what song did they recite? 'He will make their evil recoil upon them' (Psalms 94:23)."
