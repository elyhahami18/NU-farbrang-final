Introduction







Chapter 1


From Adam until the Flood 1656 years, and these are the details: Adam 130,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From Adam until the birth of Seth 130 years, and Seth lived 105 years when Enosh was born, in all 235. Enosh lived 90, in all 325. Kenan lived 70, in all 395. Mahalalel lived 65, in all 460. Yared lived 162, in all 622. Hanoch lived 65, in all 687. Methuselah lived 187, in all 874. Lemech lived 182, in all 1056. And Noah was the son of six hundred years etc (Genesis 7:6), in all 1,656. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that Seder Olam follows the simple addition method without regard for partial years which is justified by Rebbi Yose's principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain." Meir Ayin simply lists all relevant verses in Genesis.</i> Seth 105, Enosh 90, Kenan 70, Mahalalel 65, Yared 162, Hanoch 65, Methuselah 187, Lemech 182, and Noah was the son of six hundred years etc (Genesis 7:6).<br>Hanoch buried Adam,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since Adam died at age 930 (Gen. 5:5) and Hanoch was born in year 622, Hanoch lived another 57 = 930-622 - 243 years after Adam's death.</i> and lived after him 57 years. Methuselah completed his days until the Flood,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Methuselah reached the full measure of his days. This is from the simple addition principle of Seder Olam since Methuselah lived to be 969 years old (Gen. 5:27). Meir Ayin adds a legend that Methuselah died 14 years after the Flood and spent the time of the Flood in the Garden of Eden with his father Hanoch. </i> from the Flood until the Dispersion 340 years,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">340 years after the Flood was the Dispersion, like it is explained later that the end of the days of Peleg was the Dispersion. And from the Flood to Peleg there were 101 years, and Peleg lived another 239, in all 340 years. And the sign [for remembering the details of the genealogy] is Shem, Ham, Japheth; that is, Shem [marks the time] from the Flood until the Dispersion. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the number 340 is quoted in Genesis rabba 26(4) and from here one can derive that Abraham was 48 years old at the Dispersion, which also agrees with the simple addition principle applied to Genesis 11:10-26. </i><br>And [the Dispersion] was 48 years after Abraham was born, and 400 years from the time our Mother Sarah was born until the Israelites left Egypt. The years of the Patriarchs were like those of Heaven over Earth, which is 400 years, Abraham 175, Isaac 180, Jacob 147, in all 502. And Abraham recognized his Creator when he was three years old, in all 400 years. And in addition another 400 years from the time that Abraham was born until the Exodus from Egypt, that is, 400 years from the time Isaac was born until the Exodus. And Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born. This is the computation. Noah lived another 350 years after the Flood.  so it turns out Noah lived another ten years after the Dispersion. Our father Abraham was at the Dispersion 48 years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin derives the number 48 from Gen. 11. </i> Rebbi Yose said: Eber was a great prophet that he named his son Peleg by Divine inspiration,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">GRA explains that since the Torah does not give a specific date for the Dispersion in Peleg's life, by the principle of definiteness, it must have been either at his birth or death. Since his younger brother Yoqtan already had 13 families, the Dispersion must have been at Peleg's death.</i> as it is written "because in his days the earth was split etc" (Genesis 10:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For the details of the genealogy from Adam to Abraham, see Genesis, Chapter 11. </i> If [the earth was split] at the beginning of his days, then was not his brother Yoqtan younger than him, and [Yoqtan] begot thirteen families, and they were dispersed?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The implication here is that the Dispersion happened when mankind was organized in 70 nations, since Genesis 10 lists 70 nations descending from Noah. Yoqtan's 13 families are included in those 70 nations; hence, the dispersion must have been at Peleg's death.</i> And if [the earth was split] in the middle of his days, was not [Scripture] written not to hide but to explain? <sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The principle "that Scripture does not come to hide but to explain" is the basis for Seder Olam's chronology, both here and in all subsequent chapters. It is ascribed to R. Yose bar Halaphta in the Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 82b. It has two implications. First, that all words and numbers in Scripture have definite meaning. Second, that the dates of birth and death of Biblical characters are not raw data, but adjusted to give correct sums when used to establish the chronology of Biblical events. </i> Does it not say "because in his days the earth was split" but at the end of his days?<br>Our forefather Abraham was at the time He was spoken to at the Covenant Between the Pieces 70 years old,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In Midrash Rabbah and the Mekhilta, the age of Abraham at the Covenant is given as 99, the age at which he was circumcized. Seder Olam derives the number 70 by harmonizing Gen. 15:13 and Ex. 12:41. R. Jacob Emdin notes that in order to obtain 70 years, one has to assume that the Covenant Between the Pieces happened 30 years before the birth of Isaac.  This contradicts the usual interpretation of the biblical verses that the Covenant was executed after Abraham settled in Hebron following the destruction of Sodom and his escape from Gerar.  Guggenheimer notes that this interpretation of Gen. 15:1-6 resolves a seeming contradiction between verses 6 and 8: The promise in v. 6 that God will protect Abraham and that Abraham "trusted the Eternal" is followed by a request in v. 8 for a sign that he will inherit. Seder Olam interprets these as two separate events 30 years apart.</i> as it is written "And it came at the end of four hundred and thirty years etc" (Exodus 12:41).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:41 fixes the length of time that elapsed between the Covenant Between the Pieces and the Exodus from Egypt. </i> After He was spoken to, he went down to Haran and spent there five years, as it is written "And Abram was 75 years old when he went out from Haran" (Genesis 12:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was 70 years old at the time of the Covenant Between the Pieces, which must have been executed in the Land of Canaan (Genesis 15:16), and 75 when he left Haran. It follows that after the Covenant he first returned to his family in Haran, stayed there for 5 years, and then left Haran together with Lot to settle for good in Canaan. R. Jacob Emdin notes that if we accept that Abraham was only 70 years old at the time he last left Haran, then we have to assume that he was twice in the Land of Israel. However, according to his opinion, a simple interpretation of "after these things" (Gen 15:1) is that these things happened after what was described in the preceding section. He notes that Rashi on Gen. 15:1 follows this latter interpretation and that, according to Rashi, the Covenant happened after the wars of the kings and the destruction of Sodom. R. Jacob Emdin's own opinion is that the 430 years of Ex. 12:41 are to be counted from the time God rescued Abraham from Ur Kasdim, after which Abraham went to Haran and, five years later, to Canaan.  Guggenheimer, on the other hand, notes that according to the computation of Seder Olam, Abraham left Haran in Nisan of his 75th year, at the end of 26 years, and therefore the reading "27 years" found in a single manuscript is an attempt at harmonization and has to be rejected. </i> So it turns out from the Dispersion until our father Abraham left Haran, there were 27 years.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This follows from the preceding calculations. There is a manuscript variant "26 years."  See previous note. </i>These are exactly [the time reported Genesis 14:4-5] "Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer". <br>The same year that our father Abraham went out from Haran was the year of the famine. He went down to Egypt, and spent there three months,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is clear from the biblical narrative that Abraham went to Egypt in the year he left Haran. He returned the same year to settle at the terebinths of Mamre, near Hebron. The following verse, Gen 13:1, implies that he had already amassed his large flocks during his stay in Egypt; therefore, by the principle that "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," it follows that Abraham defeated Chedorlaomer the same year. That same year, his nephew Lot was taken prisoner and then freed by Abraham (Gen. 14), but Scripture does not mention any date for these happenings.  R. Jacob Emdin insists that the conquest of the four kings could not have happened before the Egyptian adventure and the subsequent increase in Abraham's flocks and property.</i> and went up and came and dwelled by the terebinths of Mamre which is in Hebron, and this was the year in which he subdued the kings. He spent there ten years before he married Hagar, as it is written "And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, etc." (Genesis 16:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham settled near Hebron after his return from Egypt and defeated the four kings. It follows that the events of Gen. 12:10-14:24 all happened in the same year. In addition, Hagar was not given to Abraham before their stay in Hebron. It follows that Abraham married Hagar in the tenth year after his return from Haran, that is, in year 36 of the settlement of Sodom, when it and its sister cities were still enjoying peace and quiet. R. Jacob Emdin notes that the interpretation of the Talmud (Shabbat 10b) regarding Sodom's settlement is that Sodom and its surrounding cities were at peace and quiet for 26 years, which includes the first two years before the rule of Chedorlaomer. In his opinion, Chedorlaomer's rule lasted 13 years after which Abraham defeated him.</i>  And it is written: "And Abram was eighty and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram" (Genesis 16:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham married Hagar ten years after settling near Hebron. It is explicitly stated in Genesis that he was then 86 years old. </i> It turns out Ishmael was fourteen years older than Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was 100 years old at Isaac's birth, therefore, Ishmael was 14 years older than Isaac. </i> It turns out that from the Dispersion until our father Isaac was born there were 52 years.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The total time of settlement of Sodom was 52 years; of this, 26 years were of peace and quiet for Sodom and its sister cities.  R. Jacob Emdin explains that Seder Olam's statement that the settlement of Sodom lasted 51 years contradicts the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 10b). Hence, either it is a scribal error and should read 52, or it should be understood as a statement that after 51 full years, the last year of Sodom's settlement was incomplete and therefore should not be counted.  The Babylonian Talmud, in turn, follows the opinion of Rashi that the destruction of Sodom happened in Abraham's year 99, that is, in the year preceding Isaac's birth.</i> [The total time] of settlement of Sodom was 51 years, of which 26 were of peace and quiet for it and its sister cities.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin explains that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 10b) the time of settlement of Sodom was 52 years, of which 26 years were peace and quiet. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the Babylonian Talmud follows here the computation of Seder Olam, putting the destruction of Sodom one year before the birth of Isaac.  Guggenheimer explains that the number 52 is derived by simple addition from Gen. 11:10-26 and Gen. 21:5.</i> <br>And from the Flood until Isaac was born 392 years, and these are the details: "These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood" (Genesis 11:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that for Seder Olam, the year of the Flood does not count as a year of history.</i>  Arpachshad 35,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Seder Olam counts the years of Arpachshad and the following descendants of Shem to Terah as 30 each, since only Peleg, Re'u, and Nahor are mentioned to be different, in accordance with the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain." </i> Shelah 30, Eber 34, Peleg 30, Re'u 32, Serug 30, Nahor 29, Terah 70, and Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him" (Genesis 21:5).<br>Our father Isaac was when he was bound at the altar 37 years old. "And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days" (Genesis 21:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham's stay at Beer Sheva was longer than his 25 year stay at Hebron. Guggenheimer thinks that the information that Abraham "dwelt in the land of the Philistines many days" really means that he stayed there longer than at Hebron. R. Jacob Emdin insists that the reading should be "26 years" since he understands that the word  "many"  in the context of a fixed number implies one more than the given number (a rule of Talmudic hermeneutics based on R. Yose's principle of definiteness, that any statement in Scripture has unique meaning.) That reading would put the Aqedah at the time of Abraham's return to Hebron. It also implies that Rebecca was 14 years old at her marriage. </i> These days were more numerous than those [he spent] at Hebron, the latter twenty-five, and the former twenty-six years.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">At that time, Rebecca was born. It follows that Isaac married Rebecca at age 3. Most French manuscripts have "four years" but the reading "three years" is quoted by Rashi and Tosafot, who note that the reading is explicit in Seder Olam and cannot be emended. Guggenheimer thinks that if one accepts the reading "37 years" for Isaac's age at the Aqedah, then one is forced to accept "3 years" for Rebecca's age at her wedding.  However, he notes that no Galilean midrash mentions an opinion that Rebecca married at age 3 and the Babylonian Talmud also implies that Rebecca was an adult at the time of her marriage. Hence, he concludes that the correct Babylonian reading must be "fourteen years" as given in Oriental manuscripts and the Yemenite Midrash Hagadol. R. Jacob Emdin notes that the reading "three years" is that of all printed versions and traditional commentators, but that Tosafot Yevamot 61b do quote a different tradition that Rebecca was 14 years old when Isaac married her, based on the tradition that she lived as long as her ancestor Kehat (Ex. 6:18). That tradition also seems to be based on the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," since the only other woman mentioned in the Bible whose years of life are fixed explicitly is Sarah (Gen. 23:1). R. Jacob Emdin connects "In that section" with Abraham's stay at Beer Sheva, not with the Aqedah.</i> In that Section was Rebecca born. It turns out that our father Isaac married Rebecca when she was fourteen years old.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham buried his father Terah two years before Sarah's death. R. Jacob Emdin notes that if Abraham received the notice of Terah's death together with the notice of Rebecca's birth, then Rebecca must have been at least a young adult at that time.</i>  [three] <br> Our father Abraham buried his father Terah two years before the death of Sarah.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Terah lived to be 205 years old (Gen. 11:32) when Abraham was 135. Sarah died at age 127 when Abraham was 137. Hence, Terah died two years before Sarah.</i>  Jacob served our forefather Abraham fifteen years. And [Jacob served] Shem fifty years. So you would say our father Jacob served Shem fifty years,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was 160 years old when Jacob was born, he died at age 175. Hence, Jacob served Abraham for 15 years.  Jacob was born 452 years after the Flood, Shem died 502 years after the Flood, when Jacob was 50.</i> and Shem served Methuselah 98 years,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Methuselah died just before the Flood and Shem was 100 years old two years after the Flood. It seems that Seder Olam does not count the year of the Flood as a year of history.</i> and Methuselah served Adam the First 243 years.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Adam lived to be 930 years old and was 687 when Methuselah was born.</i>  It turns out [that we are] saying: four out of 22 generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">From Adam to Jacob, there were 22 generations; 4 of them are mentioned here.  Guggenheimer points out that the list of seven men who "folded the world among themselves" is quoted in the Babylonian Talmud, Baba Bathra 121b in the discussion about the laws of inheritance. There, the Talmud quotes a Baraita from Seder Olam which differs from the printed text by adding to the list of seven Lemech, who was the father of Noah. Rashbam in his commentary explains that Lemech is left out of the list since "he enumerates only perfectly just people who served one another as students their master." Rashbam also explains the expression "folded the world among themselves" as "surrounded it so that the world appeared folded among them." He notes that in a different tradition, Hanoch is identified as Metatron, one of the highest ranking angels, so that the entire world would have been folded between Adam and Metatron only. Rashbam also explains the missing name of a father for "Rabbi Yose" since according to his tradition, "Rabbi Yose" without a father's name always refers to R. Yose bar Halaphta.</i> and seven men spanned the entire world.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The seven men spanned the entire world because each one served his predecessor as student his master. </i>These are they: Adam the First, and Methuselah, and Shem, and Jacob, and Amram, and Ahiyah of Shiloh and Elijah, and the latter is still alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Amram was the father of Moses and Ahiyah of Shiloh a prophet in the time of Eli. Since Amram was one of those who went down to Egypt, he must have been alive during the last 17 years of Jacob's life. The statement that Elijah knew Ahiyah is based on an old tradition. Meir Ayin notes that the list here implies that Elijah was not identical with Phineas, the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron. </i> 

Chapter 2


Our forefather Jacob was 63 years old when he was blessed.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is explained later in the chapter.  </i> In that Section died Ishmael,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the implication here is that Ishmael was alive since Esau went to him to take a wife from his daughters.</i> as it is written "And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and went to Padan-aram; And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife." (Genesis 28:6-9).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin suggests that the inclusion of the story of Ishmael marrying off his daughter Mahalath in this section implies that he thinks that the stories of the idol of Micah and the Concubine of Gibeah really happened before the time of Othniel ben Kenaz, at a time where "there was no king in Israel" (Judges 18:1, 19:1, 21:25) really means "there was no judge" since the judge had the authority of a king. Therefore, Ishmael marrying off his daughter would belong to the time period described in Chapter 12.  Guggenheimer agrees that both Josephus and the author of Seder Olam seem to imply this by dating these stories before the time of Othniel, and that it makes sense to assume that "no king" means "no judge."</i> It is not necessary [for the verse] to say "the sister of Nebajoth," so why does it say "the sister of Nebajoth"? It teaches you that Ishmael had betrothed her,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that this statement is found in Megillah 17a.</i> but he died and her brother Nebajoth gave her [in marriage] to Esau. <br> Our father Jacob spent in the Land of Israel fourteen years hidden, serving Eber. And Eber died two years after our father Jacob went down to Aram Naharaim.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the statement about Eber's death is derived from Scripture since Eber lived 430 years after the birth of his firstborn Peleg (Gen. 11:17). Peleg was born 101 years after the Flood and Isaac was born 392 years after the Flood. That means that Eber died when Isaac was 139 years old and Jacob 79, two years after Jacob arrived at Haran. </i>He left from there and came to Aram Naharaim, so it turns out he was standing by the well at age 77.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob was 63 at the time he was blessed, and he spent 14 years studying Torah in Eber's academy.</i> And twenty years he spent in the house of Laban: Seven before he married the Mothers,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The term "Mothers" here refers to the four matriarchs: Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah.</i> and seven after he married the Mothers, and six years after eleven tribes and Dinah were born.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the statement that all the tribes were born in consecutive pregnancies of 7 months each is not found in the Babylonian Talmud or any earlier source, but only in the later Pirkei de Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 37. He notes that in order to accommodate the birth of six sons of Leah and four sons of the maids in seven years, one has to assume that all these children were born as twins with the exception of Joseph, since at least one full month has to be counted for ritual cleansing of the mother after a birth before a new pregnancy can start.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that the statement that Jacob spent 22 complete years in Laban's house contradicts explicit statements in the Talmud. He explains that "22 years" refers only to the time that Jacob served Laban for wages, excluding the first seven years he served for his wives.  Guggenheimer explains that the Talmud, Hullin 91b and Sanhedrin 95b, quotes a Palestinian Amora, Rabbi Isaac Nappaha, that Jacob arrived at Haran the day he left the Land of Israel. </i> It turns out that all the tribes were born in seven years besides Benjamin, each one [born after a pregnancy of] seven months. He went out from Aram Naharaim and came to Succoth and spent there eighteen months,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi, in his commentary on Megillah 16b, states that "Succoth" (Gen. 33:17) implies that Jacob spent there two summers and one winter and built several huts for his flocks in different locations. R. Jacob Emdin notes that in this six months are included all the time that Jacob spent in Shechem, Bethel, and Migdal Eder. </i> as it is written "And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth" (Genesis 33:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The term "booths" in the verse implies that there was more than one booth. Rashi explains that Jacob built a solid house for himself, but booths for his cattle, where he kept his flocks during the two summers of his stay at Succoth.</i> He went out from Succoth and came to Beth El and spent there six months sacrificing to the Omnipresent.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"> R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is not explicitly stated in the biblical text. R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the six months at Beth El should be included in the 18 months at Succoth.</i>  He went out from there, Benjamin was born for him and Rachel died, and in that Section died also Rebecca and Deborah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The death of Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, is mentioned in the same biblical passage that describes Jacob's stay at Beth El (Gen. 35:8). The connection between Deborah and Rebecca is given in Genesis Rabbah 81(5), which states that the term "another time" (Gen. 35:9) refers to another vision after Deborah's death when Jacob received notice of Rebecca's death.</i>  So it turns out Rachel died at age 36, and Leah did not live more than 44 years.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that if Rachel died at age 36, two years after Jacob's return from Haran, she must have been 14 years old at the time she met Jacob at the well. He notes that most manuscripts have "three years" instead of "fourteen years" for the time between the Aqedah and Rebecca's marriage, but that this reading is impossible to accept. This argument is crucial for Seder Olam's chronology and all dates in the following chapters depend on it. R. Jacob Emdin, on the other hand, notes that he could not accept that the period of 22 years that Jacob spent in Laban's house should include the first seven years he worked there without wages. In addition, he explains that Leah's 44 years of life are not to be understood as exact, but as an upper bound for her age at death, derived from her words to Jacob (Gen. 30:15): "Now therefore what is my hire [that you should take my maid Zilpah? I gave her to you as wife because of my son's mandrakes] so that you should also give me children [through her]?" Hence, Leah lived at least as long as from the sale of Joseph until he became Vizier of Egypt.</i> It turns out Rachel and Leah both were married at age 22 since they were twin sisters.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that 63 years + 14 years that Jacob spent in Eber's academy + 20 years that Jacob worked for Laban + 2 years on the road = 99 years, the age of Jacob when his mother died. According to Seder Olam, Isaac died 13 years after the sale of Joseph, when Joseph was 30 and Jacob 117 years old. </i> He came to his father Isaac in the Land of Canaan, and served him for 22 years, and Joseph served him for nine years. "These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old" (Genesis 37:2) etc.; in that Section died Leah.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> R. Jacob Emdin notes that "in that section" does not have to mean that Leah died in the same year that Joseph was sold to Egypt, but only that Leah died before Joseph was sold to Egypt. </i>  Joseph went down to Egypt and spent in the house of Potiphar twelve months,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that since Joseph was a slave, he was appointed immediately by Potiphar as the latter's chief of staff. Meir Ayin notes that Seder Olam states that the 12 months that Joseph spent in Potiphar's house were six months in the house (winter) and six months in the field (summer).  The tradition that Joseph had to spend two more years in jail because he asked for the help of Pharaoh's butler but that he only stayed in jail for 12 years altogether is quoted in Genesis Rabbah 89(2), Exodus Rabbah 7(10), Midrash Tehillim 105(6) and Tanhuma Wayyesev 99.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the 10 year stay in jail is explained (Ex. Rabbah) as punishment for his maligning ten of his brothers. He notes that Exodus Rabbah is a problematic source. R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the ten years are an indication that the punishments of that time were like the punishments of the Heavenly Court in that they were measured in multiples of ten.</i> as it is written "And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field" (Genesis 39:5). [In the house for protection from the cold, and in the field for protection from the heat]. In the house of incarceration he spent twelve years, "They hurt his feet with fetters, he was laid in iron: Until the time that his word came: the word of the Lord tried him" (Psalm 105:18-19). In his thirtieth year he went out from the house of incarceration, as it is written "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh." (Genesis 41:46).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">At that time, Isaac died. The seven years of plenty and two years of famine add up to the nine years that Joseph served Isaac, as stated earlier. In that Section died Leah. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this means that Isaac died in the year of Joseph's rise to power. R. Jacob Emdin notes that "in that section" does not mean that Isaac died in the same year but that he died before the seven years of plenty.</i>  In that Section died Isaac. And [there were] seven years of plenty, and two years of famine. So it turns out Joseph was when our forefathers went down to Egypt 39 years old, and Levi was 44 years old.

Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam's computation, Levi was born when Jacob was 65. Since Jacob spent 14 years in Eber's academy, 20 years working for Laban, and 2 years on the road, Joseph was born when Jacob was 91. If Joseph was sold to Egypt at age 17 and became Vizier of Egypt at age 39, then he was separated from his father for 22 years. </i> Within these years, Judah married the daughter of Shua, as it is written "And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

Ten years, as it is written: "Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"

Chapter 3


It was said to our forefather Abraham at the Covenant Between the Pieces (Genesis 15:13) "Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs four hundred years." And what is [his] seed? This is Isaac, as it is written "for in Isaac shall thy seed be called" (Genesis 21:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This computation is quoted in the Babylonian Talmud, Baba Bathra 15a.  The number 210 is not mentioned there, but it is clear that the Babylonian Talmud accepts this computation since in its discussion of the reality and time of Job, it quotes a Baraita, similar to Seder Olam, that "Job lived from the time that Israel went down to Egypt until they left," with a correction by R. Yohanan that "Let us say, Job lived as long as from the time that Israel went down to Egypt until they left." Rashi explains that God doubled Job's years when he doubled everything that Job had; therefore, if he lived for another 140 years, he was 70 when his troubles occurred.   Meir Ayin simply cites Gen. 21:12 as a source. </i>  And about Isaac it says "And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them" (Genesis 25:26). And our father Jacob said to Pharaoh "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years" (Genesis 47:9), in all 190 [years].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The 190 years are the sum of 60 (Isaac's age at Jacob's birth) + 130 (Jacob's age).</i>  There remain 210 years, a sign for the years of Job who was born in that Section,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The 210 years left from the 400 years of exile are taken as indication that Job lived 210 years.

Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the doubling refers also to the number of years that Job lived. If he lived 140 years after his misfortunes, then he must have been 70 at the time they happened.

Jacob Emdin notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud, Baba Bathra 15a, Job was born at the time of Israel's descent to Egypt and died at the Exodus.</i>  So it turns out that when Israel went down to Egypt, Job was born, and when they went up, he died. <br>Or it could be that Israel was in Egypt the entire four hundred years. But Kehat was among those that went down to Egypt, and it is written "And the years of the life of Kehat were an hundred thirty and three years.

R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the bracket contains the usual interpretation of the verse Ex. 1:8 by the rabbis of the Babylonian Talmud, that the new king had no respect for the memory of Joseph. R. Jacob Emdin explains the verse that "the new king" means that God had taken away the rule from the seed of Jacob (that is, Joseph) and given it to someone else.

Eliyahu from Vilna emends the text to read "87 years" but Guggenheimer notes that all manuscripts and Midrash Hagadol have "86 years."

He explains that the statement about the 12 month duration refers not to the plagues themselves, but to the time period from Moses' initial message to Pharaoh in Nisan of the year preceding the Exodus, until the last plague, the death of the firstborn, in Nisan of the following year.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that Rashi, in his commentary on Rosh Hashana 11b, writes that the plagues lasted only 6 months.

The third one, presented in Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:3, is that most wicked people are punished in Gehinnom for twelve months and then their bodies are burnt and their souls cease to exist, but exceptionally wicked people, especially those that incite others to sin, are punished forever, and perfectly just people, especially those that incite others to do good, enter Paradise without any intermediate punishment in Gehinnom.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the term used in the text here is "minim" instead of the standard "Sadducees," to avoid Christian censorship.

Guggenheimer explains that in the Tosephta and Babylonian Talmud, the discussion is between the school of Shammai and that of Hillel. According to the school of Shammai, perfectly righteous people enter Paradise without an intermediate stay in Gehinnom, perfectly wicked people are punished forever in Gehinnom, and ordinary people go down to Gehinnom but, because of God's grace, "whistle and rise" to enter Paradise. According to the school of Hillel, most people enter Paradise immediately after death, with the exception of those that sin by their bodies, who are punished for 12 months and then their bodies are destroyed and their souls cease to exist.</i>  As it is written "And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts" (Malachi 3:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The term used in the text here, "pose'ei Yisrael," is a general term for people who transgress Jewish law.

R. Jacob Emdin notes that in the printed editions of Seder Olam, the text has here "nephesh bolah vegufo bolah" but that the manuscript versions have "nephesh kalah vegufo kalah."

The Flood was all of twelve months,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Rashi (Sanhedrin 108b) explains that the water of the Flood was boiling hot and that the generation of the Flood was judged and punished in that boiling water. Meir Ayin notes that the statement about the generation of the Flood is found in Sanhedrin 108a.</i> as it is written "My spirit shall not always strive with man" (Genesis 6:3). R. Yehoshua says: "In the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month" (Genesis 7:11), this is [the 17th of] Iyyar, which is the second [month] after Nissan in which the world was created,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that according to R. Yehoshua, Creation started on the first of Nissan, the day of the vernal equinox.</i> and in it Kimah [the Pleiades] sets. And because they changed their deeds before the Omnipresent, He changed the order of Creation for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashana 11b) reports a discussion of the dates given here between R. Yehoshua and R. Eliezer. According to R. Yehoshua, the world was created in Nissan and the Flood started in Iyyar, while according to R. Eliezer, the world was created in Tishri and the Flood started in Marcheshvan. The Talmud relates that the sages accept the opinion of R. Eliezer regarding the Flood but that of R. Yehoshua for the determination of seasons, as in our text.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that R. Yehoshua is of the opinion that the term Kimah in the Bible refers to the constellation Taurus, and that usually the sun is in that constellation in the month of Iyyar. Because of the sins of the generation of the Flood, the sun stayed in Aries, the constellation of the preceding month of Nissan, and in this way the usual order of the world was "perverted." R. Jacob Emdin explains that by the term Kimah, R. Yehoshua means the last three stars of the constellation Aries, that in his opinion represent cosmic cold.  The punishment of the generation of the Flood was that God took away two stars from that constellation so that cosmic heat would prevail.  Guggenheimer explains that the opinion that the sun already was shining on the first day of Creation is specific to the older Babylonian school of calendar computation and not followed in our current calendar. He explains the details of that older computation which places the beginning of the year and the beginning of Creation on Sunday, Nissan 1, 5 hours and 204 parts after mean midnight, according to the computation of R. Abraham bar Hiyya of Barcelona, the most important early source for Jewish calendar computation. According to that computation, the time from one appearance of the New Moon to the next is 29d 12h 793p, of which in the main computation the full 29 days are disregarded. This gives a difference of 1d 12h 793p between the molad of one month and the next.  The Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 11b, simply notes that the "sages of the Nations" count everything like R. Yehoshua.  Guggenheimer notes that by this term the Talmud refers to gentile astronomers who follow the Seleucid tradition of starting the year at the beginning of spring, which coincides approximately with the beginning of the reign of the Babylonian king Nabonassar, from whom we have systematic astronomical records. Meir Ayin notes that this statement is found in Rosh Hashana 11b and simply lists the verses quoted by R. Eliyahu from Vilna. </i> R.

R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the implication is that the beginning of summer started a full year of winter. R. Jacob Emdin explains that according to R. Eliezer, the term Kimah here refers to the last three stars of Aries. The punishment of the generation of the Flood was that God let the Pleiades rise during daytime so that it became impossible to determine the time of year from the stars.  Guggenheimer explains that in the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 58b, the Pleiades represent cosmic frost, which battles Orion's cosmic heat. He notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud, the "windows of heaven" that were opened at the time of the Flood were opened by pulling two stars from the Pleiades, the beginning of a full year of winter.</i> and that was the time for rain.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rain in Israel falls only in winter.

"In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen" (Genesis 8:5), this is Av, when you start counting from [the time] that the rain began falling.

Meir, a year is counted full if only one day of that year has passed; according to R. Eliezer, at least 30 days have to pass. Seder Olam's formulation here is ambiguous in order to avoid deciding between the two opinions. Meir Ayin notes that the computation here is based on the Babylonian tradition as reported by R. Abraham bar Hiyya of Barcelona, who places the new moon of Creation on the 4th day of Creation. </i> "And the earth was dried". The waters that came from above were dispersed by the wind, and the waters that rose from below were absorbed in their places, but the earth was still damp, and of the consistency of paste.

Therefore, it was a purely solar event.</i>  "was the earth dried". That makes a total of twelve full months, and another eleven days. What is the nature of these [days]? It teaches us that the solar year is eleven days longer than the lunar year.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin simply notes that this is explained in Genesis Rabbah 53:17. </i> R. Elazar said: Is it not from [the time of] the Creation of the world that the solar year is eleven days longer than the lunar year, since they were created full on the fifteenth [of Nissan]?<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that since the sun started to shine at the beginning of the night of the Fourth Day of Creation, there are exactly one and a quarter days difference between the equinox of one year and that of the next. Hence, if Creation started on a Sunday, the moon was full on the 15th of Nissan, and the 11th of Nissan was a Wednesday.  The mean new moon of one month and that of the next are 29d 12h 793p apart, of which for the computation of the calendar the 29 full days are disregarded. So there is a difference of 1d 12h 793p = 1d 12h 44m 3 1/3s between the molad of one month and that of the next.  Meir Ayin notes that according to the Babylonian calendar tradition, the time of the molad is computed from the new moon that happened in the night of the Fourth Day of Creation at 9 hours and 742 parts. In Jewish calendar computation, the mean hour is divided into 1080 parts. According to R. Eliyahu from Vilna, the sages of Seder Olam answer R. Elazar by noting that the same relative position of sun and moon can be achieved also in an intercalary cycle of two simple and one intercalary year which may just contain 1095 days.  Guggenheimer explains that R. Eliezer identifies the light created on the first day of Creation with that of the sun, while according to our current calendar, the moon already was hanging in the sky as a full moon at the time of its creation. Hence, both moon and sun would reach the same position on Iyyar 1 of the year 2.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that all of Creation was completed on the 15th of Nissan and that according to the biblical text, there was no deficiency in the luminaries at that time. Hence, the moon already was full on the first day of Creation and would therefore return to its full position after 29 1/2 days, corresponding to a difference of 11 days to the solar year. </i> Subtract from here four [days], you arrive at eleven. They said to him: But after the first intercalation, the moon caught up with the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The sages refer to the fact that after the first intercalation of a month, the moon again is in conjunction with the sun. Meir Ayin explains that from Creation on, it is impossible to compute from the molad, since after the first intercalary cycle of two simple and one intercalary year, the moon again is in conjunction with the sun.  </i> He said to them: It is always periodic, and returns. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He who wants to determine the sign of the solar year that it is eleven days longer than the lunar year, should make a mark at the summer solstice, and in the year following, it [the sun] will not get there until after eleven days. And so you know that the days of the sun are eleven days longer than the days of the moon.

All seven days was the Holy One, praised be He, speaking with Moses at the thornbush,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the statement "all seven days" is based on a simple computation of the three "three days ago" mentioned in the verse.

(Exodus 4:10). "Heretofore" is three days, and three [times] "neither, nor, nor," and the day on which He was speaking, in all seven days. And this section was [at the time of] Passover, and they fix it on the 15th of Nissan.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this follows from his commentary on the preceding chapter, that the ten plagues took a full year from the time Moses was first sent to Pharaoh.  He also notes that in a different midrashic source (Exodus Rabbah 9(12)) it is stated that the duration of each plague was one month; hence, there would not have been time to accommodate the entire sequence of ten plagues in half a year. R. Jacob Emdin notes that he already explained this in chapter 3. Meir Ayin notes that the statement "and they fix it on the 15th of Nissan" is not found in the Yalqut. </i>  And in that same time the next year, the Children of Israel went out from Egypt. Also on the 15th of Nisan was our father Abraham spoken to at the Covenant Between the Pieces,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R.

On the 14th [of Nisan] the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt, and on the fifth day [after that] was the last festival day of Passover. <sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam, Passover started on a Friday. This is also the opinion of Rashi and Tosaphot (Sabbath 87b). R. Jacob Emdin notes that in Megillah 8a it is reported that the Rabbis disagree about the date of the Exodus. In the opinion of R. Yose, it was on a Friday and in the opinion of R. Yehuda, it was on a Tuesday. According to all Babylonian sources, the giving of the Torah was on a Sabbath, and the day of the giving of the Torah is the holiday of Shavuot, which is 50 days after Passover.  Hence, in Babylonian tradition Passover started on a Friday.  R. Jacob Emdin explains that the 14th of Nisan, the day of slaughtering the Paschal lamb, was a Thursday, and that the Children of Israel left Egypt the next morning, Friday the 15th. He adds that it is explicitly stated in the Bible that they travelled day and night; hence, it is reasonable to assume that the places mentioned in the Biblical narrative are places of rest, one per day.  The argument for placing the Exodus on a Friday is that according to Jewish tradition, Pentecost was on a Sabbath, as derived from Ex. 13:3: "Remember this day, in which ye came out of Egypt" and Ex. 20:8: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." By applying the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," one sees that since Ex. 13:3 was spoken on the 15th of Nisan, also Ex. 20:8 refers to a Sabbath.  Since the giving of the Torah was 50 days after the Exodus, the Exodus must have been on a Friday. R. Jacob Emdin notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 8a) the Children of Israel left Rameses, the first station of their journey to the Red Sea, on a Sabbath, since Scripture does not specifically state that they travelled for seven days. However, Meir Ayin notes that the text here reflects the opinion of the Babylonian Talmud, Sabbath 8a, that "the 14th [of Nisan] the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt," while in the Yalqut it says "on the 14th day the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt and the day was Wednesday." </i>  And in that night the firstborn [of Egypt] were stricken. From the day after Passover,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">R.

R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam, the Children of Israel traveled day and night, resting only one day at each of the places mentioned in the Exodus narrative.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that there is a disagreement in the Talmud (Shabbat 8a) regarding the day on which the Children of Israel left Rameses. According to Rab, it was on a Friday, while according to Shmuel, it was on a Sunday. The former opinion is adopted by Rashi, the latter by Tosafot.  </i> From Rameses they traveled to Succoth, and from Succoth to Etham, and from Etham to Pi-hahiroth, in all three days.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the places mentioned in the list of Num. 33 are resting places for the Israelites.</i>  On the fourth day, "And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled" (Exodus 14:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The news that the Children of Israel had left their assigned place of residence reached Pharaoh on the day following their arrival at Pi-hahiroth.</i> On the fifth and the sixth, "And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon" (Exodus 14:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Yohanan.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in some manuscripts of Seder Olam and the Talmud, the wording of the arguments is almost identical.  He explains that in Yerushalmi sources, the six commandments given to Adam are: recognition of God, prohibition of idolatry, prohibition of murder, prohibition of adultery, prohibition of robbery, and establishment of courts.  The prohibition of eating limbs of a live animal was added for Noah, since before the Flood only vegetarian food was permitted.  In Genesis Rabbah, R. Jacob of Kfar Hanin notes that the verse Gen. 2:17 also contains a hint to the future prohibition of eating limbs of a live animal.  Guggenheimer notes that the detailed derivation of the seven Noahide laws from Gen. 2:16-17 presented here is based on the hermeneutic principle of "gezerah shavah" ("equal decree"), that all words of God in the Pentateuch have the same meaning.  He explains that the verse Gen. 2:16 only serves as mnemonic device, since all seven laws are explicitly stated elsewhere in Genesis: the prohibition of incest and adultery in 2:24 and the prohibition of murder in 9:6.  He also explains that the term "law" ("dinim") in the text refers to the specific laws mentioned in Ex. 21-23, while the term "ordinance" ("hukim") refers to ritual laws.</i> and so it says "For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him" (Genesis 18:19).

"Saying"-  this is adultery,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in some manuscripts one finds a tradition that the prohibition of adultery was derived from the verse (Ex. 20:14): "Thou shalt not commit adultery." In his opinion, this is a later addition, probably taken from Leviticus Rabbah 23.  He notes that the Talmud (Yevamot 11:12) understands the prohibition of adultery to be derived from the verse (Gen. 2:24): "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."  Guggenheimer explains that "saying" refers to adultery by gezerah shavah from the verse in Jeremiah: "Saying, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord." (Jeremiah 3:1). Since there are no divorces for non-Jews, the verse in Jeremiah cannot apply to gentiles and therefore must be taken as symbolic.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that this is explained in Sanhedrin 56b.</i> as it is written "Saying, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord" (Jeremiah 3:1). "Of every tree of the garden" this is robbery, as it is written: "or anything else about which one swore falsely, that person shall repay the principal amount and add a fifth part to it." (Leviticus 5:24). And R. Hiyya taught: "[produce] that is guarded on the roof is forbidden because of [the laws of] robbery, and [produce] that is not guarded on the roof is permitted because of [the laws of] robbery." "Thou mayest freely eat" - this is [the prohibition of eating] a limb from a live animal,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to R. Yehoshua (Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ismael, Beshallah 1, ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 156) "ordinances" ("hukim") refer to the Sabbath, and "laws" ("dinim") refer to the honoring of father and mother.  In his opinion, since the Sabbath was given before the Children of Israel arrived at Sinai (Ex. 16) and "as I commanded you" refers to a commandment given at Marah, the commandment to honor one's parents must also have been given at Marah.  In a different tradition (Jerusalem Talmud, Bezah 2:1, fol. 61a) it is discussed whether the Sabbath was given at Marah or at Alush, the station before Rephidim (Num. 33:13, Ex. 16:1). R. Jacob Emdin explains that the statement that the Children of Israel received the Ten Commandments at Marah refers to the specific rulings on the thirty-nine categories of forbidden work on the Sabbath, as opposed to the general prohibition to work on Sabbath that was given earlier.  He notes that this agrees with the general approach of Seder Olam, that if a matter is stated in general terms, it was already given before; a subsequent statement of details of the law implies that before that the general law was already known.</i><br>From Marah they travelled to Elim, as it is written: "And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they encamped there" (Numbers 33:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that the verse implies that the Children of Israel encamped only near water.</i> So we learn [from here] that the Children of Israel only encamped near water.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Yehoshua in the Mekhilta, Israel arrived at Alush on Sunday and rested there on the next day, Monday.  However, manuscripts of Seder Olam put the day of rest at Alush on Sabbath and this is the reading of most Yerushalmi sources. R.

However, this chronology is impossible to accept if the holiday of Shavuot, the "time of the giving of the Torah," was on Sabbath, the 50th day after the Exodus.  Therefore, Seder Olam follows here the chronology of R. Yose the Galilean (Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 11a). Meir Ayin notes that this is a Baraita and not according to R.

Chapter 6


On the seventh day after the Ten Commandments,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is the first day after the giving of the Ten Commandments. Meir Ayin notes that Moses was on Mount Sinai for 40 days. R. Jacob Emdin discusses at length the difficulties in the chronology of Moses' three ascents and descents of Mount Sinai. He thinks that all three accounts of Moses spending 40 days and 40 nights on the mountain are not contradictory, but refer to three separate ascents: (a) Ex. 24:18, Moses went up on Sivan 7 and stayed until Tammuz 17; (b) Deut 9:18, Moses ascended on Tammuz 18 after breaking the first set of tablets and stayed until Av 27 to plead for the people; (c) Deut. 10:10, Moses went up on Av 28 after making the second set of tablets and stayed until Tishri 9. According to his computation, the giving of the Torah was on Sivan 7, and the golden calf was made while Moses still was on the mountain. On Tammuz 17, when he came down, he broke the tablets and ascended again on Tammuz 18 to plead for the people. He descended again on Av 27, made a new set of tablets, and ascended for the last time on Av 28. He descended for good on Tishri 9. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the reason for Moses' prolonged stay on Mount Sinai was that he pleaded with God to forgive the Jewish people their sin of worshipping the golden calf, and also to give them instruction in the entire Torah. He explains that since the first giving of the Torah was on a Sabbath, according to the computation in this chapter, Moses' first stay on the mountain lasted only from Sivan 7 until Tammuz 17, a total of 40 days.</i> Moses ascended the Mountain, as it is written "And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud." (Exodus 24:16) to purify him,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that to purify him means to make him similar to the ministering angels.</i> "And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights" (Exodus 24:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the forty days and forty nights that Moses spent on Mount Sinai are to be counted together with the seven days that preceded his ascent. He notes that in the Babylonian Talmud (Yoma 4b) R. Aqiba asserts that the 40 days and 40 nights started with Moses's ascent of the mountain and that Israel's encampment at the foot of Mount Sinai started on the day of the giving of the Torah. R. Nathan (Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 4a) explains that the reason for this delay is that Moses had to be "purified" to become equal to the ministering angels, who do not eat or drink. R. Matiah ben Heresh (Yoma 4b) explains that the cloud put Moses into a state of fear. In R. Eliyahu from Vilna's interpretation, Moses spent only the first 6 days of the 40 day period in the cloud on top of the mountain, and then went down to encamp with the people. Every day for the next 39 days he ascended the mountain in the morning and descended in the evening to report God's words to the Israelites and to take their questions back to God. </i> He descended on the 17th of Tammuz and broke the tablets, "And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin" (Exodus 32:30),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Meir Ayin notes that this happened after Moses had spent 40 days on Mount Sinai. </i> He ascended on the 18th of Tammuz and prayed for mercy for Israel, as it is written "And I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you" (Deuteronomy 9:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The forty days mentioned here are the same as the forty days of Moses' first ascent. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the first forty days were in joy, the middle forty days in anger, and the last forty days in joy again. He explains that Moses descended from the mountain for the last time on Yom Kippur, when he announced to the Israelites that they had been forgiven their sin of worshipping the golden calf. R. Jacob Emdin notes that in Deut. 9:18 it is explicitly stated that Moses fell down before God for 40 days, but that this is nowhere stated explicitly in Exodus, and therefore it seems clear that Moses was not in the cloud on the mountaintop, but in his tent at the foot of Mount Sinai. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Moses descended from the mountain on Av 28, prepared a new set of tablets, and ascended again on Av 29. On Tishri 9, 40 days later, he came down for good and announced to the people that they were forgiven.</i> At that time, the Holy One, blessed be He, was receptive to Israel, and said to Moses to carve the second tablets and to ascend, as it is written "At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood" (Deuteronomy 10:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that he "carved" the second tablets on Av 28.</i> He descended on the 28th of Av and carved two stone tablets like the first ones, as it is written: "And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone" (Exodus 34:4). He ascended on the 29th of Av,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that after Moses descended on Av 28, he spent one day preparing the second tablets. He ascended with these tablets on the next day, Av 29. R. Jacob Emdin points out that according to the Tanhuma (Ki Tissa 31), Moses went up for the third time on Av 30. In his opinion, Moses came down from the mountain on Av 27, prepared the tablets, and ascended again on the next morning, the 28th. He explains that both the printed text of Seder Olam and Tanhuma are based on manuscripts in the French tradition, while the version given in the editio princeps is the oriental version.</i> and there the Torah was repeated to him a second time,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian Talmud (Baba Bathra 58b) notes that the first set of tablets contained the Ten Commandments as they are given in Exodus, while the second set contained the Ten Commandments as given in Deuteronomy.</i> as it is written "And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee. And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence" (Deuteronomy 10:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna understands this verse to mean that the first forty days were in joy and the second forty days were also in joy; therefore, it follows that the middle forty days must have been in anger.</i> "Like the first time," like the first [forty] days were in joy, so were the last [forty] days in joy; say then that the middle [forty] days were in anger. He came down on the 10th of Tishri, which is Yom Kippur, and announced to them that the Omnipresent had turned to them in joy, as it is written "And he said, If thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written" (Exodus 34:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is generally taken to refer to Moses' request to be allowed to enter the Land of Israel with the rest of the Israelites. However, R. Eliyahu from Vilna, following the text of Seder Olam, understands it to be spoken on the eve of Yom Kippur. Tosafot (Baba Qamma 82a) agree with this interpretation.</i> Therefore it remained a decree of remembrance for all generations, as it is written "And this shall be a statute for ever unto you" (Leviticus 16:34). "And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai." (Exodus 34:29-32). What did he command them? [It was] to fast to make the Tabernacle. They began working on the Tabernacle, "Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded" (Exodus 35:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">R.

Eliyahu from Vilna explains that "the Sanctuary" here refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, because that is the main place where the Shekhinah dwells.</i> They said: "Let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it" (Psalm 90:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The author of Seder Olam interprets this verse as referring to the construction of the Tabernacle. </i> R. Meir says: He did not bless them so, but rather, "The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!" (Deuteronomy 1:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This blessing is taken from Moses' farewell speech to the Israelites.</i> He said to them: "Happy are you, Israel, who merited to serve the Tabernacle.

Chapter 7


"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof" (Exodus 40:1-4).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that by erecting and disassembling the Tabernacle on each of the seven days of consecration, Moses made sure that its erection on the first of Nissan would be a mitzvah in its own right, since any act repeated on the Sabbath is forbidden (Shabbat 92a).  R. Jacob Emdin, on the other hand, thinks that the statement that Moses erected and disassembled the Tabernacle each day is found only in late sources and cannot be reconciled with the biblical text. He explains that the tent of the tabernacle was standing during all seven days, since otherwise the parts to be eaten by Aaron and his sons (Lev. 8) could not have been consumed within the holy precinct. </i> The seven days of consecration started on the 23rd of Adar and were completed on the first of Nissan.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the source for the statement that the seven days of consecration started on the 23rd of Adar is that in Leviticus 9:1, the eighth day of consecration is mentioned, and Ex. 40:17 states that the Tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month. He adds that according to his tradition, the first of Nisan is always a Sunday. Meir Ayin notes that this is explained in Rosh Hashanah 11a, 12a.</i>  During all the seven days of consecration, Moses would erect the Tabernacle each morning and bring sacrifices and disassemble it. On the eighth [day], he erected it and did not disassemble it. R. Yose the son of R. Judah says: Also on the eighth [day] he erected it and disassembled it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that R. Yose the son of R. Judah is of the opinion that Moses disassembled the Tabernacle on the eighth day after bringing the sacrifices in order to receive a direct order from God to re-erect it.  Guggenheimer notes that the proof that the first of Nisan really was the eighth day of celebration is given in Sifra Shemini 14. The argument is based on the fact that Moses officiated during all seven days of consecration, but the Shekhinah dwelled on the Tabernacle only when Aaron performed the service as high priest (Lev. 9:4). According to Sifra, one could also quote Exodus 40:1, 35 to prove that the eighth day and the first of Nisan were identical. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that R. Zeira, an Amora of the fourth generation, infers from the statement here that any construction performed at night is invalid for the daytime.</i>  <br>"And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket" (Exodus 29:32). "And thou shalt abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not: for so I am commanded." "And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses" (Leviticus 8:35-36).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The statement here is a combination of verses from Exodus and Leviticus describing the first seven days of consecration.</i> "And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel" (Leviticus 9:1),<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The eighth day is after the seven days of consecration.

On that day, Aaron and his sons entered their priesthood and washed their hands and their feet from the laver, and performed all the service, and set [everything] in order. And on that day the princes began to bring sacrifices, as it is written:  "And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah" (Numbers 7:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the term "first" in the verse of Numbers implies that the eighth day of consecration was a Sunday, since otherwise the verse should have read: "Nahshon was the first who brought sacrifices." He also notes that Rabad, in his commentary to Sifra, connects this statement with the verse in Lev. 9:1, "And it came to pass" that the eighth day was a Sunday since the angels rejoiced in Heaven like on the day of the Creation. Meir Ayin notes that the eighth day, Rosh Hodesh Nissan, was the first day of the week.</i>  [This day was] the first of Creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The first day for bringing voluntary sacrifices.</i> the first of the princes, the first for the dwelling of the Shekhinah in Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It is written: "And I will dwell among the children of Israel" (Exodus 29:45).  This means that the Divine Presence dwelled among the Jewish people from the day the Tabernacle was erected, and onwards. R.

Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is a Babylonian tradition.  He explains that the Yerushalmi, Megillah 1:13 (fol. 82b-c), contains a lengthy discussion between Amoraim whether non-Jews were allowed to bring peace offerings before the erection of the Tabernacle. R. Elazar, who asserts that they did, follows the Babylonian tradition, while R. Yose bar Hanina, who denies it, follows the Palestinian tradition.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that it seems that Seder Olam follows here the opinion of R. Yose bar Hanina.</i> the first of the priesthood, the first of the priestly blessing, the first of the Temple service, the first of slaughtering [sacrifices] north of the altar, the first for eating [sacrificial parts], the first of the Heavenly fire, as it is written "And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces" (Leviticus 9:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The verse here is taken from the biblical account of the inauguration of the Tabernacle. The statement that the Heavenly fire consumed the offering is based on the parallel verse in Lev. 8:24. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that Meir Ayin, in his commentary, adds another "first":  "First for slaughtering north of the altar."  Guggenheimer thinks that in some French manuscripts the two "firsts" are counted, for a total of 11 crowns.</i> <br>On that day, Israel began to bring the daily offerings, vows, voluntary offerings, sin-offerings, guilt-offerings, firstborns, and tithes. And about that day it says: “Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved” (Song of Songs 4:16-5:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this Midrash is alluded to in the Babylonian Talmud, Zebahim 116a, and explained in detail in the Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 1:13 (fol. 82b,c).  He also notes that this is the opinion of Rashi in his commentary on Song of Songs.  Guggenheimer thinks that this Midrash probably originated in the school of either R. Hiyya in Galilee or Rav in Babylonia, since a similar but more stylized version, also tannaitic, is found in Sifra Shemini and Mekhilta deMilluim, and an entirely different aggadic explanation, ascribed to R. Eleazar, the son of R. Yose the Galilean, is found in Song of Songs Rabba 3(11). The interpretation of Song of Songs as referring to God's love of Israel is also at the base of the Targum to the book and can be found in English, e.g., in the ArtScroll translation.</i> "Awake, O north wind," this is the burnt-offering that is slaughtered in the north [of the altar], "and come, thou south," these are the peace-offerings slaughtered in the south, "blow upon my garden," this is the Tabernacle,  "that the spices thereof may flow out," this is the burning of spices, "Let my beloved come into his garden," this is the Shekhinah, "and eat his pleasant fruits," these are the sacrifices. "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse," this is the Eighth Day,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Eighth Day is the first of Nissan, the day following the seven days of consecration. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the list given here of the ten crowns (or firsts) of the first of Nissan is found in Sifra Shemini (1) and is quoted in the Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 87b.  He also notes that Rashi, in his commentary to Leviticus 9:1, confirms the statement of Seder Olam that the eighth day of consecration was a Sunday. R. Jacob Emdin, however, thinks that since Christians chose Sunday as the preferred day of the week, the statement about the ten crowns must be from before the rise of Christianity.</i> "I have gathered my myrrh with my spice," this is the incense offering and the offering of flour, "I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey," these are the parts of the burnt-offering and the parts [reserved for the priests] of the other offerings,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin adds "milk offerings."  R.

He explains that the grandson is Phineas, who was born in Egypt (Ex. 6:25) and was elevated to the priesthood after he killed Zimri (Num. 25:10-15).  R. Jacob Emdin notes that Seder Olam rejects the Babylonian Talmud's opinion that five men spanned the world and omits Lemech, who was the father of Noah, because according to its tradition, only perfectly just people should be counted, as stated by Rashbam in Baba Bathra 121b.</i>  Her brother-in-law was a king,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian Talmud uses this statement to prove that Moses had the legal status of a king.

Guggenheimer notes that, by tradition, most of Israel was cleansed from any impurity caused by contact with the dead. That follows from the law of the Second Passover (Num. 9:1-14) that was instituted for anyone who was ritually impure on the first Passover. Now, the laws of ritual impurity related to contact with the dead are described in Num. 19. There it is stated that any such impurity needs a full seven days to be removed. Hence, anyone impure on Nissan 14 must have been in contact with the dead on or after Nissan 7. The Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 25a, relates a discussion about the identity of these people, and the conclusion is that it was the people who had buried a recent dead whom nobody else was burying. Meir Ayin notes that the second of Nissan was a Sunday, and that on that day the princes started to sacrifice. </i> On the fourteenth, they slaughtered their Passover sacrifices, and it was a Sabbath.  


Chapter 8


"And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year..." (Numbers 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer explains that this means that the laws mentioned in Numbers from 1:1 to 19:22 were given at the time of the consecration of the Tabernacle or during the second year after the Exodus. He notes that the remaining 38 years before the events described in Numbers 20 are without record, except for the list of stations in Num. 33 and a few remarks in Deuteronomy.</i> "Take ye the sum of all the congregation..." (Numbers 1:2). "From twenty years old and upward..." (Numbers 1:3). "And with you there shall be a man of every tribe..." (Numbers 1:4). After that [it says] "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: Both male and female shall ye put out..." (Numbers 5:1-3). After that "...take the sum of the sons of Kohath..." (Numbers 4:2). After that "...Take the sum of the sons of Gershon..." (Numbers 4:22).

They went out from Hazeroth and came to the Wilderness of Paran. On the 28th of Sivan,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer notes that 28 Sivan is the latest possible date for sending out the spies since the first grapes in Israel appear on the market in Sivan. If the spies were sent when grapes were still primeurs, the 28th of Sivan is the latest possible date for sending them out. This is another instance where Seder Olam infers a date from an indirect remark in the biblical text. The Babylonian Talmud (Taanit 29a) notes that according to Seder Olam, Moses sent out the spies on 29 Sivan, but that by the principle that "Moses did everything always very early in the morning," the spies must have returned on 8 Av. Since Av is a short month of 29 days, the spies were gone for 39 days, and not 40 as explicitly stated in Numbers.  Abbai explains the discrepancy by saying that in that year Tammuz was made to be 30 days long in order to compensate for the shortening of the winter by one day because of the inauguration of the Tabernacle (see Chapter 4).  Guggenheimer rejects this explanation, noting that according to Seder 'Olam, Tammuz always has 29 days, and that the spies simply spent an additional day waiting for the assembly of the people. </i> Moses sent out the spies, as it is written "And the time was..." (Numbers 13:20). "And they returned from searching...forty days" (Numbers 13:25), that was the ninth of Av.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This date follows from the preceding by simply adding 40 days to the 28th of Sivan.

After the spies was the strife of Korah, and his being swallowed up..., as it is written "Wilt thou put out..." (Numbers 16:14). "And the anger..." (Numbers 16:46). And it says "And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea..." (Deuteronomy 2:14). Nineteen years they were circling about..., and nineteen years they dwelled in Kadesh-barnea,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The 19 years of wandering and the 19 years in Kadesh-barnea add up to the 38 years mentioned in Deuteronomy.</i> as it is written "Ye abode in Kadesh..."

"And the congregation came into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron" (Numbers 20:1-2),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that the verse does not say that Miriam died on the first of the month, but only that the children of Israel arrived at the Wilderness of Zin on the first of the month. He thinks that Miriam's death was on the tenth of the month, and the well disappeared on that day, as explained in Chapter 10.  Guggenheimer notes that Josephus in his Antiquities, Book IV (78) also puts the death of Miriam on the first of the month, and that this seems to be based on the tradition of the school of R. Yose bar Halaphta.</i> because the well had disappeared. It was the fortieth year, and it was Rosh Hodesh Nissan.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that since Miriam died in the 40th year, in the first month, and no day is mentioned, she died on the first of the month.  R. Jacob Emdin explains that since "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," it is clear that the verse is talking only about the arrival of the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Zin, but that Miriam's death was ten days later, when the well also disappeared.</i>  In that Section "And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom..."

"And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell..." (Numbers 21:1). What news did he hear?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer explains that this verse is from Tosephta Sotah 11:1.  The argument there is explained in the Yerushalmi, Sota 1:10 (fol. 17a) and Yoma 1:1 (fol. 38b): "(Num. 21:1) ...heard that Israel came by way of atarim.' What means 'by way of atarim'? He heard that Aaron had died, the great scout who was scouting for them the way."  It seems that the Yerushalmi translates the prothetic 'aleph' in the term "atarim" as a Greek alpha privativum, and translates "without scouts."  R. Eliyahu from Vilna adds the words "and the clouds of glory had vanished" to the quote, based on the Tosephta Sotah 12. French manuscripts of Seder 'Olam also add this.</i> He heard that Aaron had died and the Cloud that had fought their wars for them had disappeared, and he came and waged war against them. They retreated seven stations,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin explains that Rashi, who counts the starting point of the retreat as one station, counts here eight stations.  Guggenheimer notes that in Ashkenazic manuscripts there is here the addition: "and the wasp did not cross the Jordan with them." The wasp, mentioned in Ex. 23:28 as helping the Israelites in their conquest of the Land, drove out the Canaanites before Israel. He notes that the addition is appended to statements of R. Yehoshua in the Mekhilta and R. Yose the son of R. Judah in the Tosephta and explains that in their opinion, the promise of help was given to Moses personally, not to the people of Israel.</i> and camped at Moserah, as it is written "And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth benejaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead" (Deuteronomy 10:6). Did Aaron die in Moserah? He died on Mount Hor! But they retreated seven stations from the place that he died until they camped in Moserah. "From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters" (Deuteronomy 10:7). "And from thence they went to Beer..."

And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Arnon..." "...And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword..." (Numbers 21:10-13, 24). "And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei. And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land" (Numbers 21:33-35). "And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho" (Numbers 22:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin insists that the verse implies that those that participated in the conquest of Bashan also participated in the conquest across the Jordan.  Guggenheimer notes that in European manuscripts the text has here: "They waged war against Sihon in Ellul, they were free and went up the way of Bashan after they had time after the holidays in Tishre." That interpretation is from Midrash Tanhuma, which notes that since the terms "free" in Deut. 16:7 and "they turned" in Num. 21:33 have the same root, they must refer to the same time, that is, the time after the holiday of Sukkot.  He notes that the identification of the king of Arad with Sihon, the Amorite king, is also found in Babylonian sources. He thinks that Seder Olam rightly rejects that identification since Sihon ruled Transjordan and Arad is in the Negev. </i> "And it came to pass after the plague, that the Lord said unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel..."

He also notes that it is the same as in the Babylonian Talmud, Baba Bathra 117a,b, and Rashi's commentary on Num. 26:53.  R. Jacob Emdin explains that by his principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," Seder Olam's point here is that only the people that entered the land participated in the census and received a share of the land, in contrast to the earlier census in the second year. </i> they were standing in the plains of Moab, the children returned to the fathers and the fathers again gave to the sons [their inheritance].

He also notes that since Nachmanides holds that the Levites were counted in the fortieth year to establish their claim to the Levitic cities that would be given to them, everybody counted in this census also must have been alive.  Guggenheimer notes that the statement that Yocheved was born in Egypt is attributed in the Babylonian Talmud Baba Batra 123b to R. Hama bar Hanina, who infers from the text "And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt" (Num 26:59) that she was born in Egypt but was conceived outside of Egypt. </i> among those who came to Egypt, as it is written "...And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed..."

Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the Babylonian Talmud (Baba Batra 121b) quotes the statement that Jair and Machir were born during Jacob's lifetime as a tradition that is not verifiable from Scripture. He also notes that according to one opinion, Machir died only after the crossing of the Jordan, which would imply that the decree that all of those that saw the Exodus had to die applied only to adult males. R. Jacob Emdin notes that this statement contradicts the Talmud which holds that anybody older than 60 does not enter the Land. </i> and they died after the death of Moses our teacher. And Nobah was among those who were born in Egypt, and died after the death of Moses our teacher, and he was buried in Transjordan.

Chapter 10

Chapter 10
“And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them; After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei” (Deuteronomy 1:3-4).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer notes that this means that all laws mentioned in Numbers from 1:1 to 19:22 were given either at the time of consecration of the Tabernacle, or during the second year after the Exodus. He also notes that the remaining 38 years are without record except for the list of stations (Num. 33) and the few remarks in Deuteronomy quoted at the end of this chapter. </i> From the first of Shevat until the sixth of Adar, thirty-six days, did Moses our Teacher expound the entire Torah. On the sixth [of Adar] "And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die..." (Deuteronomy 31:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin asks, if you have a difficulty understanding why Scripture reduced one year from the life of the righteous [Moses], see what he wrote in his Sefer Yaavetz, Section 133, at the end of this chapter. Guggenheimer notes that the computation of the date of Moses's death is quoted at length in the Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 38a, and in a shortened version, in Tosefta Sotah 11, in both versions of Tanhuma, and in Deut. Rabba, end of Vaethanan, and Sifry Deut. 304.  He notes that according to all sources, Moses died on 7 Adar. He explains that Josephus puts Moses's death on 1 Adar because he simply copied the dates of the deaths of Miriam and Aaron. </i> On the seventh of Adar "And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day..." (Deuteronomy 31:1-2). Why does Scripture say "this day"? It says "this day" to teach us that on the seventh of Adar was Moses born, and on the seventh of Adar he died, as it is written "So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.  And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (Deuteronomy 34:5-7).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">R. Jacob Emdin notes that he explains in his Sefer Yaavetz which day of the week was 7 Adar. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the argument is based on the verses "an hundred and twenty years old this day" (Deut. 31:2), and "And there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. And the number of your days I will fulfil" (Ex. 23:26), which mean that the just will complete the full measure of their years.  Guggenheimer notes that the first part of Ex. 23:26 speaks of the general blessing bestowed on Israel and the second part is addressed to Moses personally.</i> "And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan..." "And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it" (Joshua 1:1-2,10-11). "And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho" (Joshua 4:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Guggenheimer notes that the verse "Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise" (Joshua 1:2) means that Joshua should act immediately, on the day following the 30 days of mourning.  He notes that according to this verse, Israel crossed the Jordan on 10 Nisan. Hence, the mourning started on the day of Moses's death, and to compute that day, one has to subtract 32 from 39.</i> Count from there thirty-three days backwards, and you will learn that Moses our teacher died on the seventh of Adar.  <br>Three good providers arose for Israel, and these are they: Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam. And three good gifts were given through them to Israel, and these are they: the well, and the pillar of cloud, and the Mannah. The Mannah was [given] by the merit of Moses, the pillar of cloud by the merit of Aaron, the well by the merit of Miriam.

Yehudah, in contrast to Josephus who puts Miriam's death on the first of Nissan.  R. Jacob Emdin, however, notes that R. Yose the son of R.

Rather, on the day that Moses died, all three disappeared and never returned.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that, according to Seder Olam, all three good providers died in different months and the verse "And I cut off the three shepherds in one month" does not refer to the month of their death, but to the month in which the Temple was destroyed.  R. Jacob Emdin interprets the statement in the Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 17a, that the wicked are judged for 12 months in Gehinnom, but that according to R. Yohanan ben Nuri the 12 months are counted from Passover to Shavuot, to mean that R. Yohanan ben Nuri holds that only the three Pilgrimage Festivals have the full status of Shabbatot.  He explains that Seder Olam, however, is of the opinion that the term Shabbat is applicable also to the holiday of Sukkot. He also thinks that the statement that both Temples were destroyed on the end of Shabbat, at the end of a Sabbatical year, when the priests of the family of Jehoiarib were officiating, is a reference to the Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 22a, Arakhin 11b.</i> <br>From the Mannah that they collected on the seventh of Adar they ate until the sixteenth of Nissan,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this is based on Joshua 5:11, which states that from the day after Passover the children of Israel ate of the produce of the land.  It follows that on that day, the Mannah ceased.  He also notes that Ashkenazic manuscripts read "Shabbat" instead of "Sunday" for the date of rest at Alush (see chapter 5), but that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) states that they could have arrived at Alush on the Sabbath if we assume that in that year Iyyar was 30 days long.  R. Jacob Emdin thinks that the statement "on the seventh of Adar they ate..." refers to the time after the death of Moses, and before the crossing of the Jordan, that by the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain" one has to assume that the biblical year is counted from Nisan, not Tishri.  Guggenheimer explains that by the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," the date of the last Mannah is taken to be that of the day before the beginning of eating food from the land of Israel, which is given as the day after Passover, 15 Nisan.</i> as it is written "And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year." (Joshua 5:12). Why does Scripture say "And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan" (Exodus 16:35)? The day Moses died, the Mannah stopped coming down. "They did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan",<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning here is that the Mannah that they still had with them disappeared at the border of the land. R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that Rashi interprets "yamim" in "yamim ve'arba'ah hodashim" (1 Sam. 27:7) as "two days and four months" and not as "one year and four months" since David went to Achish only after the death of Samuel, and Saul only ruled four months after the death of Samuel (according to Seder 'Olam). In addition, he notes that in French manuscripts the text reads "four months," not "about four months."   Guggenheimer explains that the word "yamim" in the verse cited here, that usually means "days," must mean "two days" since by the principle "Scripture does not come to hide but to explain," if "yamim" meant "years," then David would have been with Achish for one full year and four months, but this is impossible by the chronology established in Seder 'Olam. </i> that day the Manna that they had in their hands disappeared.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to Seder Olam, they ate Mannah for 39 years and 10 months. R. Jacob Emdin explains that the correct reading is "39 years" since they ate unleavened bread in the 40th year, and Scripture counts a year as full if even one day of the year was complete, but that Seder Olam refers here to 40 "years of servitude" (Exodus 16:35), counting the time they spent as slaves in Egypt.</i> That makes forty years minus thirty days, and thirty days that they ate from the cakes that they took with them from Egypt,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 38a), "the cakes that they took out from Egypt had the taste of the Mannah."</i>  which were good for them, like the Mannah. 
This is where the chapter ends and so does part 1 of Seder Olam
