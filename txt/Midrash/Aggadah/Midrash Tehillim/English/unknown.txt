Psalm 20

What is the sense of “I am with him in his affliction?” (Psalms 91:15)...  Rabbi Judan said: “It can be compared to a pregnant woman who was angry at her mother, and when she went into labor, her mother went upstairs while she remained crying downstairs.  As her mother heard her crying downstairs, she cried upstairs.  Her neighbors said to her, “What is the matter, that you are screaming.  Are you giving birth with her?”  She said to them, “My daughter is in pain.  How can I stand her screaming?  I am screaming because my daughter’s pain is my pain.”  Similarly when the Temple was destroyed, there was a wailing that went out in the whole world… The ministering angels said to God, “Does this befit you? Does it not say, “Glory and majesty are before God, strength and gladness in God’s place?” (Psalms 96:6)  God said to them, “Has my house not been destroyed and my children have been carried off in chains.  Shouldn’t I be in pain?  This is the meaning of, “I am with him in his affliction.”
