Pesikta DeRav Kahana



Paragraph 1

<b>"And it was on the day that Moses completed (<i>kalot</i>) [erecting the Tabernacle]</b> (Num. 7:1). <br>"I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride (<i>kalah</i>)" (Songs 5:1). Rabbi Azariah in the name of Rabbi Simon said, [this can be compared] to a king that became angry at the <i>matrona</i> and banished her and removed her from within his palace. Then afterwards, he sought to bring her back, and she said, "He should give me something new, and after that he can have me return." So too in the past, the Holy One Blessed be He received sacrifices from above, as it is said, "And God smelled the pleasing fragrance" (Gen. 8:21.) And now, he receives [them] from below.<br>"I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride." Said Rabbi Chaninah, this teaches you the proper course of conduct (<i>derech eretz</i>), that the groom should not enter the wedding canopy until the bride gives him permission, [for it first says] "My beloved shall come to his garden" (Songs 4:16), and after that it [it says], "I have come to my garden."<br>Rabbi Tanchum, the son-in-law of Rabbi Elazar ben Avina, in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yosnai [says]: It is not written here, "I have come to <i>the</i> garden (<i>l'gan</i>); rather, "I have come to <i>my</i> garden (<i>l'gani</i>)" -- to my canopy (<i>l'ganuni</i>), in the place that was preeminent from the beginning. The preeminent [place] of the Shekhinah is in the lower regions. That is what is written, "And they heard the sound of the Lord God [moving about in the Garden [of Eden]], etc." (Gen. 3:8). <br>Said Rabbi Aba bar Kahana, "walking" (<i>m'halech</i>) is not written here; rather, "moving about" (<i>mit'halech</i>), [as in] leaping and ascending (i.e., following Adam's sin].

Paragraph 2







[7] What is the connection between what is written above "And Aharon will atone on its horns once a year" (Shemot 30:10) and what is written after "When you raise the head" (Shemot 30:12)? It is written 'כי תשה' just as 'כי תשה' [when you make a loan, (Devarim 24:10) Moshe said: Master of the Universe, when Israel has merit, forgive them, and when Israel does not have merit, give them a loan as it were, once a year, so Yom Kippur will come and atone for them, "for on this day atonement shall be made for you" (Vayikra 16:30). "Raise the head" - Rabbi Yosi son of Rabbi Chanina said: this is a hint that they will be the first of the tribes to bring a sacrifice, and who are they? Reuven, as it says "may Reuven live" (Devarim 33:6). ["The head of] the children of Israel" [Why does God command a census?] Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani: What is this comparable to? To a king who had a set of undergarments and who commanded his servant saying, “Lay these out. Fold them. Take care of them.” The servant said to the king, "My master, of all the undergarments you have, why have you only commanded me regarding this one?" The king responded, "These ones stick to my flesh."Such is what Moses said to the Holy Blessed One, "Merciful One, of the 70 nations that exist in Your world, why are You only commanding me regarding Israel, as it says "say further to the Israelite people" (Vayikra 20:2); "speak to the Israelite people" (Shemot 30:31); "say to the Israelite people" (Shemot 33:5); "speak to the Israelite people and say" (Shemot 31:13); "Command the Israelite people" (Vayikra 24:2); "you shall further instruct the Israelites" (Shemot 27:20); "When you take a census of the Israelite people" (Shemot 30:12)? - God responds, "Because they are cleaving to me." As is taught in Jeremiah 13:11 “For as the loincloth clings close to the loins of a man, so I brought close to Me the whole House of Israel and the whole House of Yehudah — declares Ad-nai — that they might be My people, for fame, and praise, and splendor.” Another idea: Rabbi Avin said: What is this comparable to? To a king who had crimson clothes and who commanded his servant saying, “Lay these ones out. Fold them. Take care of them.” The servant said to the king, "My master, of all the crimson garments you have, why have you only commanded me regarding this one?" The king responded, "These are the ones I wore when I first became sovereign.” Such is what Moses said to the Holy Blessed One, "Merciful One, of the 70 mighty nations that exist in Your world, why are You only commanding me regarding Israel? as it says "say further to the Israelite people" (Vayikra 20:2); "speak to the Israelite people" (Shemot 30:31); "say to the Israelite people" (Shemot 33:5); "speak to the Israelite people and say" (Shemot 31:13); "Command the Israelite people" (Vayikra 24:2); "you shall further instruct the Israelites" (Shemot 27:20); "When you take a census of the Israelite people" (Shemot 30:12)? - God responds, "These are the ones who crowned me first as they crossed the sea when they said, ‘God will reign forever’ (Shemot 15:18)." Rabbi Berachia said: this is similar to an Elder who had a traveling cloak and commanded his helper: "Lay these ones out. Fold them. Take care of them." The servant said to the Elder, "My master, of all the traveling cloaks you have, why have you only commanded me regarding this one?" The Elder responded: "These are the ones I wore when I first became an Elder". Such is what Moses said to the Holy Blessed One, "Merciful One, of the 70 mighty nations that exist in Your world, why are You only commanding me regarding Israel? as it says "say further to the Israelite people" (Vayikra 20:2); "speak to the Israelite people" (Shemot 30:31); "say to the Israelite people" (Shemot 33:5); "speak to the Israelite people and say" (Shemot 31:13); "Command the Israelite people" (Vayikra 24:2); "you shall further instruct the Israelites" (Shemot 27:20); "When you take a census of the Israelite people" (Shemot 30:12)? - God responds, "These are the ones who received upon them the yoke of Heaven at Sinai, and said "All that the Living Presence said we will do and we will hear" (Shemot 24:7). Said Rabbi Yudan: come and see how much the Holy Blessed One loves Israel, to the point that they mentioned five times in one verse, see that is written thus: "And from among the Israelites I formally assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, to perform the service for the Israelites in the Tent of Meeting and to make expiation for the Israelites, so that no plague may afflict the Israelites when the Israelites come too near the sanctuary" (Bamidbar 8:19).  Shime'on Bar Yochai compared to a king who gave his son over to a teacher and commanded him: feed my child, give my child [water to] drink, take my child from the house of study, bring my child back from the house of study - so too the Holy Blessed One desires to remember the children of Israel at every moment. Said Rabbi Yudah ben Rabbi Simon: this is comparable to one who sat and made a diadem to the king. Another passed and saw him, and asked: 'what are you doing?" and he responded: 'a diadem for the king'. And the other said: 'do everything that you can, set all the precious stones you are able to, since the future of this diadem will actually be to be used by the king'. So too the Holy Blessed One said to Moshe: all the praise about Israel that you can say, do say in front of Me, all their glory that you can say, say, since in the future I will be glorified in them, as in “You are My servant, Israel in whom I glory.”(Isaiah 49:3)

Paragraph 3















R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of R’ Alexandri: one verse says “…you shall obliterate the remembrance of Amalek…” (Deuteronomy 25:19) and another verse says “…I will surely obliterate the remembrance of Amalek…” (Exodus 17:14) How will both of these verses be fulfilled? Before he has reached out his hand against the throne ‘you shall obliterate Amalek.’ Once he has reached out his hand against the throne ‘I will surely obliterate the remembrance of Amalek.’ And is it possible for flesh and blood to raise his hand against the throne of the Holy One?! Rather, since he was about to destroy Jerusalem, as it is written “At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord…” (Jeremiah 3:17) therefore “…I will surely obliterate the remembrance of Amalek from beneath the heavens.”

Paragraph 4



Paragraph 5






"I was asleep, But my heart is wakeful. My beloved knocks! “Let me in, [my sister, my darling, my dove, my innocent one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of night]” (Song of Songs 5:2). The Assembly of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, "Master of the universes, I am asleep regarding the Temple, but my heart is wakeful in synagogues and study halls; I am asleep with regard to the sacrifices, but my heart is wakeful in [fulfilling] the commandments and [doing] righteous deeds; I am asleep regarding the commandments, and my heart is awake to perform them; I am asleep regarding the end [of time], and my heart is wakeful towards the redemption; I am asleep regarding the redemption, but the heart of the Holy One, blessed be He, is awake towards our redemption." Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba said, from where do we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, is called the heart of Israel? From that which is written, "[God is] the rock of my heart, my portion forever" (Psalms 73:26). "My beloved knocks!" (Song of Songs, 5:2) - This is Moses. "Moses said, “Thus says the Lord: Toward midnight I [will go forth among the Egyptians]"" (Exodus 11:4). "Let me in!" (Song of Songs 5:2). Rabbi Yassa said that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, "Open for me an opening like the eye of a needle, and I will open for you an opening that wagons and carriages can enter." "My sister" (Ibid.), who was stitched to me through two commandments: with the blood of the pascal lamb, and the blood of circumcision. "My darling" (Ibid.), who became endeared to me in the sea, and they said, "The Lord will reign for all time" (Exodus 15:18). "My dove," (Song of Songs 5:2), my dove at [the encampment of] Mara, where they excelled [in] my [eyes], like a dove, in the [acceptance of my] commandments. "My innocent one" (ibid.), innocent at Sinai, that they became innocent to me at Sinai, when they said, "everything that the Lord says, we shall do, and we shall heed" (Exodus 24:7). Rabbi Yannai says: [the phrase should be read], "tumyati" [meaning: my twin, cf. Shir Hashirim Rabba 5:2]: I am not greater than her, and she is not greater than me. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, just as with this pair of twins, one has a headache, and the other one feels it, so too, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, "I am with him in his suffering" (Psalms 91:51).  "For my head is drenched with due" (Song of Songs 5:2), even "the heavens dripped" (Judges 5:4); "My locks with the damp of night" (Song of Songs 5:2), "Also the clouds dripped water" (Judges 5:4). When? In this month. "This month shall be for you the first of the months" (Exodus 12:2). 

Paragraph 6



Paragraph 7

And it came to pass at midnight (Ex 12:29)1. R. Tanchum of Jaffa in the name of R. Nunia of Caesaria  explicated  the following verse: And when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes (Ps 73:16) . David said, “No one can stand on the [moment of] midnight except for the Kadosh Baruch Hu . For me, [when I pondered how I might know this,] it was wearisome in mine eyes. Because no one can stand on the [moment of] midnight except for the Kadosh Baruch Hu, it is therefore said, “And it came to pass at midnight.”
2. R. Acha explicated the following verse:  I am YHWH, that is My name; and My glory will I not give to another, neither My praise to graven images. (Is 42:8)  I am YHWH, that is My name. R. Acha stated: The Kadosh Baruch Hu said “I am YHWH, that is My name; it is the name that the first man called me. It is the name by which I made a stipulation with Myself. It is the name by which I made a stipulation with the ministering angels. My glory will I not give to another.” R. Menahama said in the name of R. Avin, “These [others] are the demons.” R. Nechemiah said in the name of R. Mina, “No one can distinguish between the drop  of a firstborn and one that is not of a firstborn, except for the Kadosh Baruch Hu. For me, [when I pondered how I might know this,] it was wearisome in mine eyes. Because no one can stand on the [moment of] midnight except for the Kadosh Baruch Hu, therefore [it is said], “And it came to pass at midnight.”
3. [God] confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers; that saith of Jerusalem: 'She shall be inhabited'; and of the cities of Judah: 'They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof';(Is 44:26) R. Berekiah said in the name of R Levi: Whoever confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers, do we not [therefore also] know that he will say of Jerusalem: 'She shall be inhabited'; and of the cities of Judah: 'They shall be built?' Rather [the apparent repetition may be understood by another text]: an angel appeared to our father Jacob and said to him, 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.' And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel;(Gen 32:28-29). The Kadosh Baruch Hu appeared [afterwards] to our father Jacob to fulfill the decree of the angel [in another verse]: And God said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob: [thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name'; and He called his name Israel.]  (Gen 35:10) Jerusalem, of which all the prophets prophesied that it will be built, all the more so! Another interpretation: “[God] confirmeth the word of His servant” refers to Moses, [as he is called in another verse]: My servant Moses is not so. (Num 12:7)  “Performeth the counsel of His messengers” refers to Moses, [as he is called in another verse]: [God] sent a messenger, and brought us forth out of Egypt. (Num 20:16) The Kadosh Baruch Hu said to Moses, “Go, tell the people Israel that I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, [and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt.]” (Ex. 12:12) Moses went and said to Israel, “Thus saith the LORD: About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt.” (Ex 11:4) The Kadosh Baruch Hu said, “Already I have made my promise to Moses, And I said of him 'My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in all My house.' (Num 12:7) Should I make a liar out of My servant Moses? No, instead Since Moses said “About midnight,” then I will go out at midnight. So it happened that it came to pass at midnight, [that the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt.]
4. At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous ordinances. (Ps 119:62) Rabbi Pinchas said in the name of R. Elazar bar Menachem: What would David do? He would take up a harp and lyre and put them by his head [before he went to sleep], then at midnight he would get up and play them . When the scholars of Israel heard the music, they would say, “Well, if King David is engaged in Torah study [at this this hour], then we should be all the more so!” [Soon,] all of Israel could be found engaging in Torah study. Rabbi Levi said: There was a window above  David's bed open to the south. He would hang the harp across from the window and when the southern wind blew at midnight, it would whirl through the strings of the harp and play it. As it is written: when the instrument played (2Ki 3:15). It does not say “the instrument was played,” but “the instrument played,” as in, “the instrument played itself.” So it was that all of Israel heard the music [and knowing that king David was awake and studying] would say, “Well, if King David is doing so, then we should be all the more so!” [Soon,] all of Israel could be found engaging in Torah study. So it was that David said, “Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will awake [at] dawn.” (Ps 57:9) [By this he means to say,] “I will awaken my honor before the honor of the One who created me. The importance of my honor is nothing compared to the honor of the One who created me. [Do not read], “I will awake [at] dawn.” Rather, [read it as] “I will wake the dawn, the dawn will not wake me.” His evil impulse would pester him and say to him, “David, It is the custom of kings to awaken (no sooner than) dawn, but you say 'I will wake the dawn?' It is the custom of kings to sleep in until the third hour of the day, but you say “At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee  [because of Thy righteous ordinances.]” (Ps 119:62) What is meant by “because of Thy righteous ordinances”? [David meant] For the ordinances that You enforced against the wicked Pharaoh, and for the righteousness that You did for Sarah my elder. As it is written: And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues [because of Sarai Abram's wife.] (Gen 12:17) Another interpretation: because of Thy righteous ordinances. [David meant] for the ordinances that You enforced against the peoples of the world, and for the righteousness that You have done with my two elders, [Boaz and Ruth]. For if he had entered her [when she came to him, or] cursed her at once from below , from whence would I have arisen? Instead, You put a blessing into his heart; [and he said:] “Blessed be thou of the LORD.” (Ruth 3:10)Another interpretation: because of Thy righteous ordinances. For the ordinances that You enforced against the Egyptians in Egypt,  and for the righteousness that You have done with our elders in Egypt, even though they had no mitzvot to save themselves  except for two; the blood of Passover and the blood of circumcision. As it is written: And when I passed by thee, and saw thee wallowing in thy bloods, I said unto thee: In thy bloods, live; [yea, I said unto thee: In thy bloods, live.] (Ez 16:6) Bloods : The blood of Passover and the blood of circumcision. 
5. R. Shimon Ben Yochai taught: Moses could not have known the exact moment, nor the approximate minute, nor the general time at night. This is why he said “About midnight.” (Ex 11:4) However, the Kadosh Baruch Hu knew the exact moment, and the approximate minute, and the general time at night. That is why God entered [without being early or late] by a hair's breadth. So who was it that divided [the hours of the night]? R. Benjamin bar Jafet in the name of R. Yohanan, the night divided itself.  Our Rabbis say that the Creator divided it. Here it says, “And it came to pass at midnight” (Ex 12:29) and elsewhere it says, “And he divided the night against them.”  (Gen 14:15) Rabbi Tanchuma said: Your father set out with Me at midnight, and I will set out with his children and midnight. The Rabbis said: the Kadosh Baruch Hu said, “your father set out with Me from last night until midnight, and I will set out with his children from midnight until the morning.” R. Yonatan said: The angel guarding over Egypt cannot fall except during the day. What is the reasoning? [From the verse] At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her; [as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.](Ez 30:18) [Elsewhere it also] says, In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language [of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called the city of destruction. ] (Is  19:18) Which five cities are these? R. Hilkiah said in the name of R. Simon: Noa, Noph, Tehaphnehes, the City of Destruction, and the City of the Sun;  Noa is Alexandria, Noph is Memphis, Tehaphnehes is Hophnias, the City of Destruction is Sharakani, and the City of the Sun is Heliopolis. R. Yohanan ben Zakkai said: We have found both night and day referred to as “day,” as it is written: And there was evening and there was morning, one day. (Gen 1:5) R. Joshua bar R. Nechamah understood [the same claim] from this: Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee, but the night shineth as the day; the darkness is even as the light.(Ps 139:12) Darkness is [the same as] lightness to Me, and [only] human beings consider it night. This is what is meant [by saying] it was on the day that the firstborn of Egypt died [although it was midnight]. This is how [it happened]: They were afflicted with the deadly curse in evening time, then their bodies shook all night, and then they died in the day time. What is the reasoning? [Because] It is not written “All of us have all died,” but rather “All of us are dying ” (Ex 12:33) Then they went and died . As it is written: On the day that I struck down all the first-born [of the Land of Egypt] (Num 3:13), and further on it says, on the day that I sanctified all the firstborn to Me (paraphrase of Num 8:17 ). On this basis one may conclude  that it was on the very same day that the firstborn of Egypt died, which [God said], “on this day I have sanctified to me the firstborn [of the Israelites].”
6. That God struck down all the firstborn of the Land of Egypt (Ex 12:29). [The text does not simply read] “the firstborn,” [but rather] “all the firstborn.” [The word “all” is meant to include both] the firstborn of man and the firstborn of woman, [that is,] the firstborn of [each] male and the firstborn of [each] female. This is how [it can be illustrated]: [In the case of] a single man who came to ten women and they gave birth to ten sons, each one would turn out to be a firstborn of a woman. [On the other hand, in the case of] ten men who all came to a [single] woman and they fathered ten sons,  each one would turn out to be a firstborn of a man. You might imagine  a house in which there was neither a firstborn of a man nor of a woman [and think, in such a case]“how could I fulfill the verse: for there was no house in which no one had died (Ex 12:30)?” Rabbi Abba bar Acha said: [in such a case,] the trustee  of the household would die, as it is written, “ Shimri the chief – for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief. (I Ch 26:10)” A Tanna said  in the name of R. Nathan: On the day that the firstborn of one of [the Egyptians] would die, [the Egyptian] would carve an icon of him and place it in the house.  On that day,  [the icon] was crushed, pulverized, and scattered, and it was as hard on the [Egyptian] as if he was burying his son again.  R. Yudan said: Since the Egyptians would entomb [their dead] in their own houses, [on that day] the dogs went into the catacombs, pulled out  the [bodies of] the firstborn from their tombs, and tore into them.  It was as hard on [each Egyptian] as if he was burying his son again.

Paragraph 9



Paragraph 10



Paragraph 11













Rabbi Yochanan sat and expounded., "How did the water became for the Jews like a wall [at the splitting of the Sea]?" Rabbi Yochanan expounded, "It was like lattice-work." Serach bat Asher looked out and said, "I was there, and it wasn't like that - it was like a glass window." Rabbi Yochanan sat and expounded, "All the souls coming with Yaakov to Egypt, who came out of his loins, etc." (Genesis 46:26). With Yosef and his two sons, behold they are still lacking one (in order to add up to seventy)! Rabbi Levi in the name of R. Chama bar Chanina: "That is Yocheved, who was born at the gate of Egypt." And some say, "Serach bat Asher completed the number of Israel. 'I am one of those who seek the welfare of the faithful in Israel' (II Samuel 20:19). It is I that has completed the number of Israel. I have completed, being faithful for the faithful." Rabbi Tanchum bar Haanilai said, "The Holy One blessed be He Himself entered with them. And what is the explanation? 'He is your praise and He is your God' (Deuteronomy 10:21). What is written after it? 'Numbering seventy people, your forefathers went down to Egypt' (Deuteronomy 10:22)." 

Paragraph 12

























[25] Another explanation: <i>I am the Lord your God</i> (Exodus 20:2). Rabbi Channina bar Pappa said: The Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to them with an angry face, with a neutral face, with a friendly face, and with a laughing face. An angry face is for Scripture. When someone teaches his child Torah, he is obligated to teach him with fear. A neutral face is for Mishnah. A friendly face is for Talmud. A laughing face is for Aggadah. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Even though you see all these likenesses, I am the Lord your God. Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One appeared to them as an image with faces on every side. If a thousand people were looking at it, it would be looking at all of them. So it is with the Holy One, blessed be He. When he spoke, each and every person of Israel said: The Divine Word has been with me. What is written (in Exod. 20:2) is <i>I am the Lord your God</i>, [with] "your" not [being in the plural], but rather "your" [in the singular]. Rabbi Yose bar Hanina said: It was according to the capacity of each and every person that the Divine Word spoke with him. And do not be surprised at this thing, since we find in the case of the manna that, when it came down to Israel, each one of them savored it according to his capacity, the infants according to their capacity, the young men according to their capacity, the old men according to their capacity. The infants according to their capacity, just like this infant suckles from his mother's breasts, so too was its taste, as it is stated, <i>and its taste was like the taste of cake kneaded with oil</i> (Numbers 11:8). And the young men according to their capacity, as it is stated, <i>The food that I had given you—the choice flour, the oil, and the honey, which I had provided for you to eat</i> (Ezekiel 16:19). And the old men according to their capacity, as it is stated, <i>It tasted like wafers in honey</i> (Exodus 16:31). So, just like with the manna, every one's mouth tasted it according to his capacity, likewise did everyone hear the Divine Word according to his capacity. David said: <i>The voice of the Lord is in strength</i> (Psalms 29:4). "In His strength" is not written here, but <i>in strength</i>; according to the strength of each person. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: It is not [as it appears,] since you are hearing many voices, but rather you should know, <i>I am the Lord your God</i>. In this world, Israel was redeemed from Egypt and subjugated in Babylon, from Babylon to Media, from Media to Greece, and from Greece to Edom [i.e., to Rome]. But the Holy One, blessed be He, will redeem them from Edom, and they shall be subjugated no more, as it is stated, <i>But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation; you shall not be ashamed nor confounded to all eternity</i> (Isaiah 45:17). The end.

Paragraph 13

Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Raise your voice, Bat-Galim, listen, Layishah; destitute is Anatot” (Isaiah 10:30). Raise your voice, burst forth with your voice. “Bat-Galim” – just as these waves [<i>galim</i>] are conspicuous in the sea, so their ancestors were conspicuous in the world. Another matter: “Bat-Galim” (Isaiah 10:30) – <i>bat golim</i>, daughter of exiles: daughter of Abraham, what is written about him: “And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth from your land, etc” (Genesis 12:1); daughter of Isaac, what is written about him: “Isaac went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, to Gerar” (Genesis 26:1); daughter of Jacob, what is written about him: “And Jacob listened to his father and to his mother” (Genesis 28:7). “Listen” (Isaiah 10:30), listen to My commandments, listen to words of Torah, listen to words of prophecy. But if not, “<i>Laisha</i> which can also mean lion]” (Isaiah 10:30) – the lion will ascend upon you. This is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, in whose regard it is written: “The lion has ascended from its lair” (Jeremiah 4:7). “Destitute [is Anatot]” (Isaiah 10:30) – destitute of righteous individuals, destitute of prophecy, destitute of commandments and good deeds. But if not, “Anatot,” – that resident of Anatot will come and prophesy words of rebuke in your regard. That is why it was necessary for Scripture to state, “The words of Jeremiah son of Ḥilkiyahu, [of the priests who were in Anatot]” (Jeremiah 1:1). 













“To whom the word of the Lord came… until the end of eleven years of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.” (Jeremiah 1:2-3) R’ Avon said: the lion (ari) came up during the constellation of the lion and destroyed Ariel. ‘The lion came up’ refers to Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, as it is written “A lion has come up from his thicket…” (Jeremiah 4:7) ‘In the constellation of the lion’, “…until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.” (Jeremiah 1:3) ‘And destroyed Ariel’, “Woe, Ariel, Ariel, the city wherein David encamped!” (Isaiah 29:1) This happened in order that the lion would come in the constellation of the lion and rebuild Ariel. ‘The lion would come’ refers to the Holy One, as it is written “A lion has roared; who will not fear?” (Amos 3:8) ‘In the constellation of the lion’, “…and I will turn their mourning into joy…” (Jeremiah 31:12) ‘And rebuild Ariel’, “The Lord is the builder of Jerusalem; He will gather the outcasts of Israel.” (Psalms 147:2)

Bar Kaparah opened: And the Lord God of Hosts called [read midrashically as the Lord God called to the Hosts] on that day for crying and mourning and baring of the head, and wearing sackcloth. (Isaiah 22:12). The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he hangs sackcloth on his entrance. He said to them, I too will do this: “I clothe the skies in darkness [and make sackcloth their covering]” (Isaiah 50:3). And he asked them further: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he covers the torches. He said to them, I too will do this: “The sun and moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining” (Joel 4: 15). And he asked them further: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he goes barefoot. He said to them, I too will do this: “The Lord’s way is in whirlwind and storm and the clouds are the dust on his feet” (Nahum 1:3).  And he further asked them: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he sits and is silent. He said to them, I too will do this: “He sits alone and is silent for he has imposed it” (Lamentations 3:28). And he further asked them: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he overturns the couches. He said to them, I too will do this: “I watched as thrones were set in place” (Daniel 7:9).  And he further asked them: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he rends his garments. He said to them, I too will do this: “The Lord has done as he intended; he has fulfilled his word” (batzah emrato)  (Lamentations 2:17). What does “he has fulfilled his word” mean? Rabbi Ya’akov of Kefar Hanan said, he rends (mevazei’a) his garment.  And he further asked them: A human king who mourns, what does he do? They said to him, he sits and wails. He said to them, I too will do this: “How does it sit desolate?!” (Lamentations 1:1).  

Paragraph 16

<b>"Comfort, O comfort, my people." (Is. 40:1.)</b><br><br>"Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be purer than his Maker?" (Job 4:17.) Now, is [it even possible to fathom that] there a man who is more righteous than his Creator? Rather, [what is the meaning of] "Can a man be purer than his Maker?" Said the Holy One Blessed be He, Boaz provides comfort; should I not provide comfort? [And how did] Boaz provide comfort? "Boaz answered and said to her, 'It has been repeatedly told (<i>huged hugad</i> (הוגד הוגד)) to me...." (Ruth 2:11.)  And why [does the verse say] <i>huged hugad</i> two times? For he [actually] said to her, "It was told to me in the house, and it was told to me in the field." [The verse then relates what Boaz had been told:] "All that you did for your mother-in-law after after the death of your husband" -- and needless to say, during the lifetime of your husband. "And that you left your father and your mother" -- [that is] "your actual father and mother." "And the land of your birth" --  [that is] "your neighborhood." Another interpretation: "And you left your father and your mother" -- that is "your idols," [as it is said,] "They say to wood, 'You are my father,' and to stone, 'You gave birth to me.'" (Jer. 2:27.) "And the land of your birth," that is "your province" (אפרכייה).<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">Buber suggests that this refers to a government principality, as opposed to a small township, with the relevance here being that in this way Ruth's leaving would signify her permanently alienating herself from the reigning power of her former home, i.e., Moab, rather than simply leaving one's home.</i> "And you came to a people who you did not know of yesterday or the day before yesterday" (Ruth 2:11): He was saying to her, "For if you had come to our place yesterday or the day before yesterday (i.e., anytime in the past), we would not have accepted you," for the halacha [that "An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter the congregation of God" (Deut. 23:4)] had not yet been revised [to exclude only] a male Ammonite, but not a female Ammonite, and a male Moabite, but not a female Moabite. § "May the Lord recompense you for your deeds...." (Ruth 2:12): He was saying to her, "He who in the future will bestow upon the righteous their reward, he will bestow upon you your reward. "And it shall be your full (<i>sh'lemah</i>) reward": "Shlomo" (i.e., King Solomon) is written. Said Rabbi Yosei, he said to her, "Solomon will arise from you." "From the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you have come to seek refuge under His wings (<i>k'nafav</i>)." (Ruth 2:12.) Said Rabbi Abun, we have heard that there are wings for the earth, wings for the dawn, wings for the sun, wings for the Cherubs, wings for the Chayot, wings for the Seraphim. Wings for the earth, as it is written, "From the wing (<i>k'enaf</i>, i.e., extremity) of the earth we heard singing." (Is. 24:16.) Wings for the dawn, as it is written, "If I take wing (<i>kanfei</i>) with the dawn, etc." (Ps. 139:8.) Wings for the sun, as it is written, "And there shall rise for you -- those who fear My Name -- a sun of righteousness, and it will heal with its wings (<i>b'kanafeha</i>), etc." (Mal. 3:20.) Wings for the Cherubs, as it is written, "And the sound of the wings of the Cherubs, etc." (Ez. 10:5.) Wings for the Chayot, as it is written, "And the sound of the wings of the Chayot." (Ez. 3:13).) Wings for the Seraphim, as it is written, "And the Seraphim were standing above Him, six wings [each], etc." (Is. 6:2.) Said Rabbi Abun, Great is the power of those who perform acts of kindness, because they do not take shelter, neither in the shade of the wings of the earth, nor in the shade of the wings of the dawn, nor in the shade of the wings of the sun, nor in the shade of the wings of the Cherubs, nor in the shade of the wings of the Chayot, nor in the shade of the wings of the Seraphim. And in whose shade do they take refuge? In the shade of the Holy One Blessed be He. That is what is written, "How precious is Your lovingkindness, O Lord, and humankind takes shelter in the shade of Your wings." § "And she said, 'Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord, because you comforted me (<i>nachamti</i>), [and because you spoke to the heart of your maidservant, although I am not [even of so high a rank] as one of your maidservants." (Ruth 2:13.) "And Boaz said to her" (Ruth 2:14): He said to her (<i>lah</i>), "No (<i>lo</i>)! How can you say this? Heaven forbid! Should you be counted as one of the handmaidens (<i>aimahot</i>)? Rather, you shall only be counted as one of the matriarchs (<i>imahot</i>)!" And behold these matters may be deduced <i>a fortiori</i>: If, regarding Boaz, who spoke to the heart of Ruth words of kindness, words of comfort, and she was comforted, how much more so when the Holy One Blessed be He comes to comfort [the heart of] Jerusalem as one, [and thus it says,] "Comfort, O comfort, my people, says your God." (Is. 40:1.)
"I spoke with my heart, saying, 'Behold, I became great, and I accumulated wisdom,' etc." (Ecc. 1:16.) From here they said, the heart sees, the heart listens, the heart speaks, the heart knows, the heart stands, the heart falls, the heart goes forth, the heart cries out, the heart rejoices, the heart becomes comforted. The heart sees: "And my heart saw much wisdom and knowledge." (<i>Ibid.</i>) The heart speaks: "And I spoke with my heart." (<i>Ibid.</i>) The heart knows: "The heart knows the bitterness of its soul." (Prov. 14:10.) The heart listens: "Bestow upon Your servant a heart that listens." (1 Kings 3:9.) The heart stands: "Will your heart stand [firm], will your hands remain strong...?" (Ez. 22:14.) The heart falls: "Let no man's heart (courage) fall from within him." (1 Sam. 17:32.) The heart goes forth: "And he said to him, 'Did my heart (spirit) not go forth...?'" (2 Kings 5:26.) The heart cries out: "Their heart cried out to God." (Lam. 2:18.) The heart rejoices: "Therefore my heart rejoices, and my glory exults." (Ps. 16:9.) The heart becomes comforted: "Comfort, O comfort, my people, says your God. Speak unto the heart of Jerusalem." (Is. 40:1-2.)
"What shall I testify to you, and to what shall I compare you?" (Lam. 2:13.) "What shall I testify to you": With how many prophets have I testified? Rebbi says, one prophet in the morning, and one prophet in the evening. That is what is written, "God testified to Israel and to Judah, through every prophet and every seer." (2 Kings 17:13.) Prophets (<i>nevi'ai</i> (plural)) is written.<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">However, in our Masoretic tradition, the word is written "<i>nevi'o</i> ("His prophet"), but read <i>nevi'ai</i> ("prophets")</i> Rabbi Natan says, two prophets in the morning and two prophets in the evening, "daily and persistently" (Jer. 7:25) in the morning, and  "daily and persistently" in the evening. Another interpretation: "What shall I testify to you":  "With how many ornaments have I adorned you?" As Rabbi Yochanan said, on the day that the Holy One Blessed be He descended on Sinai to give the Torah to Israel, sixty myriads (600,000) of ministering angels descended with him, and each and every one of them had a crown in its hand with which to crown Israel. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana in the name of Rabbi Yochanan [says], one hundred twenty myriads, one to adorn [each Israelite] with a crown, and one to gird him with royal armor (<i>zayanim</i>). Rabbi Huna the Great of Sepphoris said [that, rather, the angels girded the Israelites with] belts of magistracy (<i>zunei</i>). It is as if it is stated, "He loosens the bonds of kings, and binds their loins with a girdle." (Job 12:18.) Another interpretation: "What shall I testify to you": "How many appointments did I arrange for you? The Tent of Meeting, Gilgal, and Shiloh, and Nob, and Gibeon, and the two Eternal Houses. And what shall I testify to you? For which people have I [acted] like I have toward you? For which people have I revealed myself with a strong hand, and dealt ten plagues to her enemies? For which people have parted the sea? For which people did I swarm quails? For which people have I brought myself near before Mount Sinai, and given her my Torah? For which people did I encircle with clouds of glory? [For] 'the daughter of Jerusalem (Yerushalayim)' (Lam. 2:13), the daughter who fears (<i>yireah</i>) and is complete (<i>u'mushlemet</i>) for Me."<br>"And to what shall I equate to you, that I may comfort you (<i>va'anachamech</i>), O virgin daughter of Zion?" (Lam. 2:13<sup>*</sup><i class="footnote">This is the continuation of the verse beginning with "What shall I testify to you, and to what shall I compare you?", which has been treated to this point. The conclusion of the verse, "For your ruin is as vast as the Sea, etc." is treated below.</i>.) As Rabbi Yaakov bar Avuna said, [the verse means,] "When I equate it to you, then I will comfort you." "Virgin daughter of Zion," sons who distinguish(<i>metzuyanim</i>) me through circumcision, and with the cutting of hair, and with <i>tzitzit</i>.<br>"For your breach is as vast as the Sea; who will heal you?" Said Rabbi Cholfai, He who in the future will heal the breach of the Sea, He will heal you as well. Said Rabbi Yehoshua bar Nechemiah, He about whom they said at the Sea, "Who is like You?" (Ex. 15:11), He will heal you. Said Rabbi Avin, "Who will heal you?" "Your prophets foretold to you futility and folly" (Lam. 2:14). And our Rabbis say, "Who will heal you?" Your prophets.
"You love justice and hate wickedness; therefore Hashem your God has anointed you with the oil of has of rejoicing above your fellows" (Ps. 45:8). Rabbi Azariah in the name of Rabbi Acha interpreted the verses about Abraham our Patriarch. You find that before the Holy One Blessed be He brought a flood upon the people of Sodom, Abraham our Patriarch said before the Holy One Blessed be He, "Master of the Universe, you swore that you would never again bring a flood." And what is the meaning of, "For this is like the waters of Noah to Me, as I vowed I would never again bring the waters of Noah upon the earth" (Is. 54:9)? A flood of water you would not bring; however, a flood of fire you would bring? Would you employ artifice about that vow? "Heaven forbid You should do such a thing as this, to kill the righteous alongside the wicked" (Gen. 18:25). "Should the Judge of the entire world not perform justice?" (Ibid.). If it is  justice You seek, there can be no world, and if it is the world you seek, there can be no justice. Would You [endeavor to] stretch a rope from both ends? You seek Your world and You seek strict justice, [but] if You do not relent a little, the world cannot [continue to] exist. The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, "Abraham, 'you love justice and you hate wickedness' (Ps. 45:8)." You love justice": On behalf of My creations. And "you hate wickedness": That you hate condemning [the wicked]. Thus, Hashem your God has anointed you with the oil of rejoicing above your fellows. Who are "your fellows"? The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, "From Noah until your [generation], I did not speak with any of them; rather, with you I have spoken first." That is what is written, "After these events transpired, the word of God [came] to Avram in a vision, saying, [I shall be a shield for you, [and] your reward will be exceedingly great]." (Gen. 15:1).<br>Rabbi Azariah in the name of Rabbi Yudah bar Simon interpreted the verse in Isaiah. Said Isaiah: "I was walking about in the house of study, and I heard the voice of God saying, 'Who will I send and who will go forth for us, etc.'" (Is. 6:8). He said, "I sent Amos and they called him the 'stammerer'." Said Rabbi Pinchas, why was he named "Amos"? Because he there was stammering (<i>p'silos</i>) in his speech. They said, "Did the Holy One Blessed be He pass upon the entire world (i.e., in search of a prophet), but let His <i>Shekhinah</i> rest upon this stammerer, on this tongueless man?" [God continues:] "I sent Micah, and they would strike (<i>makin</i>) him on the cheek, [as it is written,] 'With a rod they struck him on the cheek, the judge of Israel' (Mic. 4:14). And now, who should I send, and who will go forth for us, immediately," and "I said, Here I am, send me!" (Is. 6:8). The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, "Isaiah, my children -- they are troublesome and they are stubborn. Do you accept upon yourself to be stricken and demeaned by them?" He said to Him, "On this condition, yes, 'I gave up my body to suffer blows and my cheeks to be plucked, etc.'" (Is. 50:6). But I am not worthy for You to send me on Your mission to Your children." The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, "Isaiah, you love justice (Ps. 45:8): You love the justice of my children. And you hate wickedness (ibid.): You hate condemning [the wicked]. For that reason, Hashem your God anoints you with the oil of rejoicing above your fellows." What are "your fellows"? The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, As you live, that [until now] all the prophets who prophesize [received their] prophetic capacity from the mouth of [another] prophet. He rested the spirit of Eliyahu upon Elisha (2 Kings 2:15). He rested the spirit of Moses on the seventy Elders: "And God extended some of the spirit that was upon [Moses] and rested it upon the seventy men, the Elders" (Num. 11:25). But you will prophesize from the mouth of the Almighty: "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because God has anointed me, etc." (Is. 61:1). And not only that; rather, that as to all the [other] prophets who prophesize, their prophesize simply prophesies, but you will prophesize complex  (lit., "doubled") prophesies: "Arise, arise" (Is. 51:9), "Rouse yourselves, rouse yourselves" (Is. 61:10), "I, I" (Is. 51:12), "Comfort, O comfort my people" (Is. 40:1). 
"If only you were like my brother, who nursed [at my mother's breast]" (Songs 8:1). Like which "brother" [does this verse refer]? Like Cain to Abel? Cain killed Abel. Like Ishmael to Isaac? Ishmael hates Isaac. Like Esau to Jacob? Esau hates Jacob. Like the brothers of Joseph to Joseph? The brothers of Joeph hate Joseph. Rather, like Joseph to his brothers. You find that after all the evil that they did to him, what is written about it? "And now, do not be afraid. I will sustain you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts" (Gen. 50:21). Said Rabbi Simlai, he said to them, "You are the head and I am the body. If the head is taken away, what good is the body?" Another interpretation: He said to them, "You shall be likened to the dust of the earth, and like the sand of the sea, and like the stars of the heavens. Behold, I am going and I am waging war for them (i.e., the Egyptians). If I can do so for them, behold, I can do so for you, and if I cannot do so for them, I could not do so for you." Another interpretation: He said to them, "‘Shall I become an adversary to my father; my father begets and I bury?" Another interpretation: He said, "Shall I become an adversary to the Holy One Blessed be He? The Holy One blesses and I diminish?" Another interpretation: He said to them, "You conduct yourselves according to the order of the world, twelve hours during the day and twelve hours during the night, twelve months, twelve constellations of the zodiac, twelve tribes. Is it possible for me to abolish the conduct of the order of the world?" Another interpretation: He said to them, "Before you descended here, the Egyptians were treating me like a slave. Once you descended here, they recognized my nobility." Another version: "He said to them, "If I kill you now, the Egyptians would say, "He saw a group of young men, and he said, 'Perhaps they are my brethren.' You should know that it is so, that after time had passed, he found some pretext and he killed them." Another interpretation: He said to them, "If I kill you now, the Egyptians would say, 'If he did not keep faith with his brothers, would he keep faith with us?'" Therefore, "He comforted them and he spoke to their hearts" (Gen 50:21). And behold these matters may be logically deduced: If regarding Joseph, who spoke kind and comforting words to the hearts of his brothers, and they were comforted, how much more so when the Holy One Blessed be He comes to comfort Jerusalem as one, [and thus it says,] "Comfort, O comfort, my people, says your God" (Is. 40:1).

Paragraph 17



“Why should a living man complain? A man for his sins.” (Eicha 3:39) R’ Aba bar Yodan said, ‘what is it that person complains while he is still alive? It is enough that he lives!’ R’ Berachia said, ‘I lived next to you, he lives and complains.’ R’ Levi said, ‘what is it that a person complains to the Life giver of the worlds? Rather, if one wants to complain, let him complain of his sins. R’ Yodan said, ‘let him stand up like a man and confess his sins, and not complain. Rebbe said, ‘the Holy One said 'malcontents, the children of malcontents they are!' I busied myself with finding Adam a companion, “…I will make him a helpmate opposite him." (Bereshit 2:18) and he complains before me, saying "The woman whom You gave [to be] with me, she gave me…" (Bereshit 3:12) Even Yaakov did so to Me! I made it My business to make his son king in Egypt, “Now Joseph was the ruler over the land…” (Bereshit 42:6) and he complains saying "...My way has been hidden from the Lord..." (Is. 40:27) Even his sons did so to Me in the wilderness - I made it My business to choose out for them refined food, like that which kings eat, in order that none of them would have indigestion or be seized with diarrhea, and they complain before me saying "...we are disgusted with this rotten bread." (Bamidbar 21:5). Even Zion did so to Me! I busied myself with her to remove the kingdoms from the world, have I not already removed Bavel, Maday and Greece and in the future will remove this wicked kingdom? And she complains before me, saying "The Lord has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me." (Is. 49:14)

Paragraph 18



Paragraph 19



Paragraph 20

“He seats the barren woman of the house as a happy mother of children. Hallelujah!” (Psalms 113:9) There are seven barren women: Sarah, Rivka, Rachel and Leah, Manoach’s wife, Chana and Zion…Another explanation. ‘He seats the barren woman’ this refers to Zion. “Sing you barren woman who has not borne…” (Isaiah 54:1) ‘a happy mother of children,’ “And you shall say to yourself, Who begot these for me…” (Isaiah 49:21)





A  story (This translation of דלמה follows the Penei Moshe on the Yerushalmi Berachot 7:3, Pesachim 5:5). R’ Elazar ben Azaryah and R’ Elazar haModa’i were sitting occupied with these verses: “At that time, they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord…” (Jeremiah 3:17) R’ Elazar ben Azaryah said to R’ Elazar haModa’i: can Jerusalem really hold it? He replied: in the future the Holy One will say to her - spread out and widen to receive your population, “Widen the place of your tent…” (Isaiah 54:2) R’ Yochanan said: in the future Jerusalem will reach to the gates of Damascus, and why do I say this? “The prophecy of the word of the Lord in the land of Chadrach. And Damascus is His resting place…” (Zechariah 9:1) What is Hadrach? This is an argument of R’ Yodan and R’ Nechemiah. R’ Yodan says: this language of ‘chadrach’ refers to the King Messiah who will be sharp (chad) with the nations and soft (rach) to Israel. R’ Nechemia says: the name of the place is Chadrach. R’ Yosi ben Dormaskit said: by the Temple service! I am from Damascus and there is a place there that they call Chadrach. He said to him: what do you do with rest of the verse ‘And Damascus is His resting place’? Rather, just as a fig tree is narrow below and wide above, to in the future Jerusalem will spread out and rise and the exiles will come and take their rest beneath her. This is to fulfill what is written ‘And Damascus is His resting place’ when in truth His resting place is Jerusalem, as it says “This is My resting place forever; here I shall dwell for I desired it.” (Psalms 132:14) He said to him: and what do you do with the verse “…and the city shall be built on its mound…” (Jeremiah 30:18)? He replied: it will not move from its place in the future, but rather rise up and spread out to all sides and the exiles will come and take their rest beneath her to fulfill what is written ““For right and left shall you prevail…” (Isaiah 54:3) This refers to length, where do we learn breadth? This refers to length, from where do we learn width? The scripture says “…from the tower of Hananel until the king's wine-cellars.” (Zechariah 14:10) R’ Berachia said: until the ocean. R’ Zakai Raba said: to the pits of Yafo. They are not arguing – the one who says to the ocean understands the verse as referring to the cellars dug out by the King, king of kings, and the one who says to the pits of Yafo understands it as the pits dug by King Shlomo. We have length and breadth, from where do we learn height? “And it became wider and it wound higher and higher to the cells…” (Ezekiel 41:7) R’ Eliezer ben Yaakov taught: in the future Jerusalem will rise and be lifted up until it reaches the Throne of Glory, until she says to the Holy One “The place is too narrow for me; move over for me so that I will dwell.” (Isaiah 49:20) R’ Yosi son of R’ Yirmiyah Dostai said in the name of R’ Levi: and you still do not know Jerusalem’s praiseworthiness. Rather, what is written “But I will be for it-says the Lord-a wall of fire around, and for glory I will be in its midst.” (Zechariah 2:9) From here you know the praiseworthiness of Jerusalem.

Paragraph 21




… R’ Hoshaya said in the name of R’ Afes – in the future, Jerusalem will be as a torch for the nations of the world and they will go by her light. What is the reason? “And nations shall go by your light…” (Yeshayau 60:3) R’ Acha said – Israel is compared to an olive, “A leafy olive-tree fair with goodly fruit, has the Lord called your name…” (Yirmyahu 11:16) and the Holy One to a lamp, “Man's soul is the Lord's lamp…” (Mishle 20:27) Just as it is the way to put oil in a lamp and they give light together as one, so to the Holy One said to Israel – My children, since My light is your light and your light Mine, you and I will go together and illuminate Zion, “Arise, shine, for your light has come…” (Yeshayahu 60:1)

Paragraph 22





... “For, like the earth, which gives forth its plants…” (Isaiah 61:11) R’ Pinchas and R’ Chilkiya in the name of R’ Simon: like someone who says to his friend ‘may the Holy One make you grow, may you win your judgment, “And nations shall see your righteousness…” (Isaiah 62:2) R’ Levi said: since in this world anyone who explicitly pronounces the name of the Holy One is liable for death, as it says “And one who blasphemously pronounces the Name of the Lord, shall be put to death…” (Leviticus 24:16) so too in the time to come anyone who explicitly pronounces the name of Jerusalem is liable for death, as it says “…and you shall be called a new name…” (Isaiah 62:2) R’ Levi said: there are six things which the Holy One will renew in the time to come and they are: heavens and earth, the heart, the spirit, the name of the Messiah and the name of Jerusalem. From where do we learn the heavens and earth? “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth…” (Isaiah 65:17) From where do we learn the heart and the spirit? “And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you…” (Ezekiel 36:26) And from where do we learn the name of the Messiah? “May his name be forever; before the sun, his name will be magnified…” (Psalms 72:17) And from where do we learn the name of Jerusalem? “…and you shall be called a new name…” (Isaiah 62:2) R’ Levi said: happy is the city whose name is the same as that of her king and whose king’s name is the same as that of her God. Whose name is the same as her king? “…and the name of the city from that day will be ‘The Lord is There.’” (Ezekiel 48:35) Whose king’s name is the same as that of her God? “…and this is his name that he shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness.” (Jeremiah 23:6) 

Paragraph 23



3) Yehudah bar Nachman opened [the discussion] in the name of Reish Lakish: "God ascends amidst acclamation, etc." (Psalms 47:6) - when the Holy One, blessed be He, ascends to sit on His throne of justice, He ascends with justice, as it is written, "God ascends amidst acclamation." But when the Jewish people take the shofars and blow, the Holy One, blessed be He, rises from His throne of justice and sits on His throne of mercy, as it is written, "the Lord, amidst the blow of the shofar." So He becomes full of mercy and has mercy upon them; and He turns the trait of justice into the trait of mercy for them. When? "In the seventh month" (Leviticus 23:24).

Paragraph 24







"Good and upright is Ad-nai; therefore He shows sinners the way." (Ps. 25:8) They asked Wisdom: What should the punishment for the sinner be? She replied: "Evil pursues sinners" (Prov. 13:21). They asked Prophecy: What should the punishment for the sinner be? She replied: "The soul that sins shall die" (Ezekiel 18:4). They asked Torah: What should the punishment for the sinner be? She replied: S/he shall bring a Guilt-Offering (Asham) and it will be atoned. They asked the Holy One of Blessing: What should the punishment for the sinner be? God replied: Let the person do teshuvah and it will be atoned. That's why it's written: "Good and upright is Ad-nai etc." Rabbi Pinchas said: Why is God good? Because God is upright. Why is God upright? Because God is good - "therefore God shows sinners the way", that God teaches to the sinners the way of doing teshuvah, and that's why Hosea warned Israel, and said: "Return, Israel [up to God, because you stumbled in your sin]" (Hosea 14:2)
