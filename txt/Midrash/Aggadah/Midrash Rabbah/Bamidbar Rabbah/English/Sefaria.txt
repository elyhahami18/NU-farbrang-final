Another matter, “do not cut off,” that is what is written: “Do not rob the impoverished as he is impoverished…” (Proverbs 22:22). Our Rabbis say: Regarding what is the verse speaking? If he is impoverished, what does he steal from him? Rather, it spoke only of gifts to the poor that he is obligated to give them by Torah law; gleanings, forgotten sheaves, produce in the corner of the field, and the tithe of the poor. The Holy One blessed be He cautioned that no person should rob them of the gifts that are fit to give them. “As he is impoverished,” his poverty is sufficient for him. Is it not enough for the wealthy person that he exists in comfort and the poor person in suffering, but he even robs from him what the Holy One blessed be He gave him?
