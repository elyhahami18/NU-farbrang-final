Chapter 42

"Now leave me be to make an end of them." Had Moses caught the Holy-One-Blessed be He in his grip that He had to say: "Leave Me Be"? But to what may this be comapred? To a king who became angry with his son and took him to an ante-room and set about to try and kill him. There he shouted fro the room: Leave me alone to kill him! The boy's tutor who was standing outside, reasoned thus: Both the king and his son are in a room together inside. Why then does he shout: Leave me alone? Te reasn must be that the king really wants me to go in and make peace between him and his son. That is why he cries out: Leave me alone!
Similarly the Holy-One-Blessed-be-He said to Moses: "Now leave Me alone." Said Moses: The Holy-One-Blessed-be-He wants me to make peace between Him and Israel. That is why He says: "Now--leave Me alone". So he promptly began to intercede on their behalf.
