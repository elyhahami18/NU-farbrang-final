Chapter 3

...One day Rabbi Akiva came late to the Beit Midrash and he sat outdoors. A question was asked about a particular matter: "Is this the law?" They said, "The law is outside." Again a question arose, and they said: "The Torah is outside." Again a question arose, and they said, "Akiva is outside--make room for him." He came and sat at the feet of Rabbi Eliezer.
