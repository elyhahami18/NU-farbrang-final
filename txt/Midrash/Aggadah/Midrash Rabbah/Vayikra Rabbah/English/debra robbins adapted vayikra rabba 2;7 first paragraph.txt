Rav Levi opened his discourse with the text from Isaiah (41:24): 
“Therefore, you are less than nothing (meh-ayin), your effect is less than nullity (meh-afah),
One who choose you is an abomination.”  
Meh-ayin means: nothing at all, from a foul secretion.  
Meh-afah means: from the one hundred cries (ma’ah pe’ayot) a woman utters when she gives birth, when it is a case of ninety nine chance of death and one of life…
Even though the infant emerges from the womb filthy and soiled, full of secretions and blood,
all embrace and kiss it, especially so if it is a male.
