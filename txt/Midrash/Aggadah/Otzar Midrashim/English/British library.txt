Chapter 1



Chapter 2

From [God's] right shoulder to the left is 160,000,000 parasangs. The right shoulder is called Matatgi'a' 'Angatz and the left Tatmahnagia'. It [also] has another name: Shalmahingya'. From [God's] right arm to the left is 120,000,000. The arms are folded. The right arm is called Gavarhazazya'tachsi and the left Metataghagtziku. The fingers of [God's right] hand are 100,000,000 parasangs each. Similarly the left. [Those] of the right [are called] Tatmah, Tatzmatz, Gagmavah, Gagshamash, Gagshas and [those] of the left [are called] Tatzmatz, Tatmah, 'Agagmatz, 'Ugmatz, Veshoshnas. And thus you may count from the big one onwards. The palm of [God's right] hand are 40,000,000 parasangs and similarly the left. The name of the right is...zaziya' 'Atgariyi and the left is called Shakizaziya'. [God's] toes [on the right] are 10,000,000 parasangs. 2,000,000 parasangs for each toe. And similarly the left. [The names of those] on the right is 'Adomatz, 'Asumat, Darmanat, Kavta...,...ramon, and [those] of the left are Yeshnayan, Baznayan, Hatzmat, 'Ahuz, Vtahamum. From the hands you count onwards. Therefore [God] is called 'the great, mighty, and awesome God,' as it is said: 'For GOD your God is God, [and] ruler of rulers, the trustworthy God, who keeps the covenant and love with those who love [God] and keep the divine commandments for a thousand generations' (Deuteronomy 7:9).
