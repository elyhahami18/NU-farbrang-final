Verse 1


<b>King Ahasuerus elevated Haman:</b> He was from the seed of Amalek, and he first gave the counsel to cancel the building of the Temple. So the Holy One, blessed be He, said, "I will elevate him, and they I will bring him down," to fulfil the verse (Proverbs 16:18), "Pride goes before ruin; arrogance, before failure."
