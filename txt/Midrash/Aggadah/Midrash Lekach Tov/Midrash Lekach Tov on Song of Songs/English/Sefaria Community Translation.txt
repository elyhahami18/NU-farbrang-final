Midrash Lekach Tov on Song of Songs

Introduction







Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

Like a lily among the thorns. Just as the lily is pleasant among the thorns, and everyone can distinguish between the lily and the thorns, so Israel is distinct among the nations, and is distinguished from all their impurities and unpleasantness, like a lily among the thorns. And if it leans one way or the other, it is torn by the thorns. Thus, if Israel deviates from the path of the ETERNAL, immediately the nations of the world converge on their leaves, strike them, and punish them. Like a lily among the thorns. Just as this lily is difficult to gather from among the thorns, so Israel is difficult to redeem from among the nations. Like a lily among the thorns. Just as this lily is nothing but fragrance, so Israel was created for fragrance, to praise God, as it says “The people I formed for Myself that they might declare My praise” (Isaiah 43:21). Like a lily among the thorns. Just as the lily withers in a hamsin, so Israel is pained because of Esau, as it says, “And no survivor shall be left of the House of Esau” (Ovadia 1:18). Immediately, Israel sprouts up, as it says “I will be to Israel like dew; it shall blossom like the lily” (Hosea 14:16).  Israel is like a lily, when it is small, it is called a “crocus,” and when it is large, it is called a “lily.” Because Israel among the nations has varied types of trouble, it is called “a lily among the thorns.”
