Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1

In the beginning, God created. This is a scripture: Thus said the Lord, if the heavens are measured (from above) [to upward] and the institutions of the earth below are searched, I will also be overwhelmed by all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, said the Lord (Jeremiah, 31:36), according to what Jeremiah said, He is overwhelmed by Judah and Gomer (ibid. 14:15), the answer is that if you have seen the heavens and the earth that have passed, at that moment you will be able to say that I am tired of them, according to the fact that Israel is the foundation of heaven, and if the foundation is tired, the building on top of it will fall. And where did you learn that heaven and earth were not created except for Israel, as it is said in <i>Bereshit</i> [בראשית], which means beginning, and Israel was called the first, as it is said that Israel is holy to God, the beginning of his harvest (Jeremiah 2:3). 
Another thing in Genesis. With reverence for God, the Holy One, blessed be He, created his world saying the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God (Psalms 111:10).
<b>Another thing in Bereshit</b>. Thanks to the Torah, the Holy One created his world with his blessings, which is called the beginning, as it is said, God is the beginning of the beginning, and his works have preceded him ever since (Proverbs 8:22).
<b>Another thing in Bereshit</b>. In the beginning, there are six letters, against the six words in which the Holy One created his world with his blessing, as it is said that in her the Lord created the worlds (Isaiah 26:4), there are two words, the Lord is four words, six, do not create but (<i>rock</i>) [<i>flint</i>] Worlds. 
<b>Another thing in Bereshit</b>. <i>b're</i> (ברא) <i>shit</i> (שית), <i>shit</i> is for the altar and the <i>b're</i> for the world. 
<b>Another thing in Bereshit</b>. ב &amp; ר the beginning of the word, י &amp; ת the end of the word, and it is a word ברית (<i>brit</i>) i.e. <b>covenant</b>, And thanks to the Word and the Sabbath, the Holy One with His blessing created the world, and from whence was the Sabbath called a covenant, when it was said to their generations an eternal covenant (Exodus 15), and the word was also called a covenant, which was said to be a covenant in your flesh (Genesis 17:13), and it was also because of the Torah that the world was created, because it remained from the word of Genesis Black fire and it is fire, and there is no fire but the Torah, which is said to be from the right hand, the fire of religion to him (Deuteronomy 32:2). 
<b>Another thing in Bereshit</b>. Six letters are, against six series of <i>Mishnah</i>, and against six days of Creation. 
<b>Another thing in Bereshit</b>. By removing the letter S there are six hundred and thirteen, against six hundred and thirteen unleavened bread, and the letter S that a person is obliged to memorize for his sons, as it was said and memorized for your sons (Deuteronomy 6:7).
And the Torah began with the letter <b>ב</b> (B), and why? It represents two Torahs, the written Torah, and the oral Torah. 
Another thing is why in the second letter, against male and female, it is written that there is no confusion between creation and completion (Isaiah 45:18), and the wise man said that the two years are better than the one (Ecclesiastes 4:9). 
Elokim created. It doesn't say "G-d created," as initially, He thought to create the world through the attribute of Judgement. However, since He saw that it would not be able to endure Judgement alone, he combined it with the attribute of Mercy, as it says, "These are the generations of heaven and earth when they were created, on the day that G-d Elokim made earth and heaven." [<i>Alternative Translation</i>: <b>ברא אלהים Created Elohim</b>. And it is not said that <i>YHVH</i> created, that in the beginning he arose in thought in the measure of judgment to create the world, and since he saw that he could not stand the measure of judgment alone, he shared with it the measure of mercy, as it is said that these are the history of the heavens and the earth in creation on the day that God created the earth and the heavens (Genesis 2:4) ]
And why didn't it say "God created at the first", but said "At the first God created"? According to the fact that there is no mention of the name of heaven except for speech, which is said to be a sacrifice to God (Leviticus 1:2). After all, things are light and heavy, and what about those whose way is to dedicate, the Torah says that one should not say a "to YHVH sacrifice", but a "sacrifice to YHVH", light and heavy to those who revile and blaspheme and who swear in vain, which they must before the place.
את השמים the Heavens. Teaches that all the history of the heavens was created........ In a world where he would not eat and the opinion of the Holy One, blessed be He, agreed with her, therefore she did not put forth a tree bearing fruit.

And they shall serve as lights in the firmament. This teaches that they were created only for the sake of humanity who are on the earth, as it is says, to shine upon the earth. (Genesis 1:17) But the Holy Blessed Infinite God does not need light, as there is light with him, as it says, and light dwells with him. (Daniel 2:22)

Verse 16


And some say that [when the moon was reduced in size] she became totally dark, and [God] decreed upon her that she would only shine from the light of the sun. [The moon] said to [God]: Master of the Universe, [how can it be that] because I spoke a correct matter to you, I should be diminished? God said to [the moon]: If so, I will in the future, in the days of the messiah, return your light. As it is written "And the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun"(Isaiah 30:26). [The moon] said to [God]: I have sinned [by challenging you]. Forgive me. [God] said to [the moon]: I forgive you. [The moon] said to [God]: How will I know that you have forgiven me? [God] said to [the moon]: And you will rule by day and night. [The moon] said to [God]: Master of the Universe, what benefit is there if I shine at day when [the sun] appears? [After all], you have called me the small light, as it says "and the small light" (Genesis 1:16). [God] said to [the moon]: The righteous will be called after your name: Jacob the Small [son] (Genesis 26:15), David the Small (I Samuel 17:14). [The moon] said to [God]: Master of the Universe, if the righteous are also called small, what sign of forgiveness is this for me? Once God saw that [the moon's] mind would not be settled, he increased her multitude [of stars]. As it says: "And the stars" (Genesis 1:16). And due to her honor, [God] increased her multitude [of stars], as a ruler who walks forth and the wealthy [dignitaries] of the land walk with him.

Verse 3

And God blessed the seventh day. With what did God bless it? That everything a person brings to honor the Shabbat with, the Holy One pays him back double.
Another thing, He blessed it. That the wicked are not punished in Gehinnom on Shabbat.
"That God created to do/make." Here is not written "he did/made", but "to do/make", [which means] that He placed strength in them to do/make.

Verse 4

And from the tree of knowledge of good and bad. The Holy One did not say, the tree of knowledge, rather it was Moses who wrote down the Torah and called it the tree of knowledge. And also, Adam did not know that it was the tree of knowledge, which is why the woman said to the snake, and from the fruit of the tree that is within the garden (Genesis 3:3) and she did not say, and from the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

Verse 18

It is not good for the human to be alone. From here, the Sages said, the one who dwells without a wife dwells without goodness.
I will make a fitting counterpart for him. That the woman will help the man, bringing wheat and grinding and baking. And bringing flax and spinning it and making clothing, and dressing him and standing him up on his feet. If he is worthy-a helper, if he is not worthy-against him.

Verse 19

And God formed. In forming the beasts it is written with one yud because beasts do not have a good inclination.

Verse 23


This one shall be called woman. You find that a male and female are called fire. And they cannot survive until the Holy One includes his name with theirs, the hay with the woman and the yud with the man. This yud and hay teach that God is included in a partnership with the two of them.

Verse 24



Verse 25

And the two of them were naked. This teaches that God did not create them clothed and they were like beasts. But they were not embarrassed at their naked appearances, because they did not have the evil inclination.

Verse 1

"And the snake." He thought at that moment and said, I will go and I will kill Adam, and I will marry Eve, and I will be king over all the living creatures and I will walk around with an erect stature and eat of all the dainties of the world. The Holy One said to him, Because you said, I will go and I will kill Adam and I will marry Eve, therefore, "I will place enmity between you and the woman."(Genesis 3:15) You said, I will be king over all the living creatures, therefore, "more cursed shall you be than all beasts." (Genesis 3:14) You said, I will walk around with an erect stature, therefore, "on your belly you shall crawl." (Genesis 3:14) You said, I shall eat of the dainties of the world, therefore, "and dirt shall you eat all the days of your life." (Genesis 3:14)

Chapter 4



Verse 1


<i>And she said, "I have acquired a man with the Lord."</i> She said, "In the past, I and my husband would form [it] and the Holy One, blessed be He, would join with us in its formation. For the limbs would be because of me and because of my husband and the soul would be from God. Hence, let us call him, Cain, since I acquired (<i>kaniti</i>) a man with the Lord — this child was created [only] between Him and I."

"These are the generations of Noah." Rest for the heavens and rest for humanity. Every place that it says, "these are" it adds something to the earlier subject, when it says "these", it cuts off the earlier subject. And here it cuts off the generation of the flood, that they were wicked ones and Noah and his sons were more righteous than them.
Wherever אלה, “these are”, is used it cuts off (פוסל) the preceding section from that which it introduces; where, however, ואלה “and these” is used it adds something to the former subject (i. e. forms a continuation of it). So also here: “And these are the judgments (i. e. these, also)”:
"A righteous man." Because he did righteous acts with creatures, that he fed them all the time they were upon the ark, that is why he is called a righteous person
"Perfect." That he was born circumcised, as it is stated, "Noah walked with God" (Genesis 6:9) because he was perfect.
"In his generation." And not in the generations of the righteous ones. And there are those who say that with the wicked, he was a righteous person who did not learn from their deeds, and if he would have been in the generation of the righteous ones, how much more so would he have been a righteous person!
"With God." Noah walked in the ways of his ancestors, as it is stated, "The God in whose ways my fathers walked." (Genesis 48:15) That they did not need help to be righteous ones, but Noah, "Noah walked with God", that if the Holy One had not held him, Noah would not have been able to stand.

Verse 10



Verse 11

"The earth became corrupt before God." That they were idol worshipers, as it is stated, "not to act wickedly and make yourselves a sculptured image." (Deuteronomy 4:16)
"The earth was filled with lawlessness." That they were thieves, as it is stated, "People remove boundary-stones; They carry off flocks and pasture them." (Job 24:2)
Another interpretation, "lawlessness." That they were spillers of blood, as it is stated, "Because of the outrage to the people of Judah, that they shed the blood of the innocent." (Joel 4:19)
Another interpretation, forbidden sexual relations, as it is stated, "You have devoured My people’s flesh; You have flayed the skin off them." (Micah 3:3)


Verse 12

"That all flesh had corrupted." That they would have intercourse with every animal, and pull out to spill their seed upon the ground, as it is stated, "let [the semen] go to waste upon the ground." (Genesis 38:9)

THE LORD SAID - The Holy One, Blessed is He, said:
ALL HAVING ONE LANGUAGE - Each understood what his fellow would say to him, whether 'clay' or 'brick,' and this way they would build. During the time that they had one language, they were not restrained from building. Rather, I will confuse their languages and they will put aside the construction. What did G-d do? He called the divine messengers and commanded them to descend below, and each one [of the messengers would teach] each family a different language, so that this family would not understand that family. And so they did, as it says, "Come, let us descend."

In that on that night on which the angels came to Lot's house, she went to her neighbors' places with pretext to ask for salt. Her neighbors said to her, "And why do you need salt? Didn't you know that you were short on salt to got and take salt while it was still daytime?" She said to them, "We didn't need salt until guests came to us." And therefore, the people of Sodom knew about the angel that came to Lot's house.

And Joseph was brought down to Egypt." The descent is connected to another descent:
Alternatively, "He descended to Egypt." Do not read "descended" but rather "caused the Divine Presence to descend to Egypt."
Alternatively, "that Jacob, his father, caused to descend to Egypt."
"And Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain." Potiphar is Poti-phera (Genesis 41:50). Why is he called Potiphar? Because he fattenedthe calves for idolatry.
"An Egyptian man." A cunning man. What was his cunning? In every place, an Egyptian was sold as a Cushite, and here a Cushite was sold as an Egyptian.

"Reuben, Simeon - all the tribes were named after their redemption. Reuben after the verse, 'I have seen the affliction of my people' (Exodus 3:7); Simeon after the verse, 'And God heard their groaning' (Exodus 2:24); Levi after the verse, 'And many nations will be joined to the Lord' (Zechariah 2:15); Judah after the verse, 'And you shall say on that day, I will give thanks to you, Lord' (Isaiah 12:1); Issachar after the verse, 'Because there was a reward for your work' (Jeremiah 31:16); Zebulun after the verse, 'And built a city called Zebulun' (1 Chronicles 8:13); Dan after the verse, 'And also the nation that they will serve will judge' (Genesis 15:14); Naphtali after the verse, 'And your speech is sweet' (Song of Songs 4:11); Gad after the verse, 'And the manna was like coriander seed' (Numbers 11:7); Asher after the verse, 'And all the nations will call you blessed' (Malachi 3:12); Joseph after the verse, 'And it shall come to pass on that day that God will again stretch forth His hand to acquire the remnant of His people' (Isaiah 11:11); Benjamin after the verse, 'The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by the arm of His strength' (Isaiah 62:8). This teaches us that all the tribes were named after their redemption. And why aren't their names equal in every place? Because one is placed before the other so that the children of the noble families do not say that they come first and the children of the servant families come last, and so that they do not boast to themselves. Therefore, they are arranged in a certain order to teach you that all the sons of Jacob are equal, that none of them are greater than the others."

Chapter 2



Verse 1

<i>A man of the house of Levi went, etc.</i> And where did he go? This teaches that he went after his daughter's advice. For Amram was the leader of the generation. When he saw the evil Pharaoh's decree, he said, "We are toiling for naught." He arose and divorced his wife. So they all arose and divorced their wives. His daughter said to him, "Father, your decree is harsher than the evil Pharaoh’s, as Pharaoh decreed only against the males, and you decreed against the males and the females. Pharaoh only decreed in this world, but you [decreed] in this world and in the next. Pharaoh is wicked, and it is uncertain whether his decree will be fulfilled or whether it will not be fulfilled. However, you are righteous, and your decree will certainly be fulfilled." As it is stated: <i>You will decree, and it will be fulfilled</i> (Job 22:28). He immediately arose and remarried his wife. All of them arose and remarried their wives. But why does it say, "he took"; it needs [to say], "he took back!" Rather it teaches that he took her with the trappings of a wedding. He placed her in a palanquin, and Aharon and Miriam were dancing before her while the ministering angels were saying, "A happy mother of children" [alluding to Psalms 113:9].

<b>In the Sinai Desert, in the Tent of Meeting, etc.:</b> That is why the verse needed to say, "in the Tent of Meeting in the second month." It is like a man who enters with his bride under the wedding canopy and writes her a ketubah, signing the time and the place to it. Likewise did the Holy One, blessed be He, do. As up until now, he wrote them neither a ketubah nor a divorce bill. But now he wrote them a ketubah, however he did not write them a divorce bill. That is what the prophet said (Isaiah 50:1), "Where is your mother's book of divorce?"

"And they wept for Aaron thirty days, all the House of Israel" (Numbers 20:29): What is stated about Aaron is greater than what is stated about Moses. As regarding Moses, only the men wept for him, but regarding Aaron, the men and the women wept for him - since he was one that pursued peace and loved peace, and restored peace between a man and his wife, and between a man and his fellow. This is [the meaning of] that which is written (Malachi 2:6), "He walked with Me in peace and justice, and brought many back from iniquity." And what did Aaron do? When he heard that two men or a man and his wife were arguing, he would go to one of them and say to him, "Your fellow came to me and is distraught in his heart that he angered you; so he cajoled me that I should come to you [and get your forbearance], so that he [can] come to you and be forgiven by you." And Aaron would not leave from there until he would remove all the hatred in his heart and bring peace between them. Then he would leave. And when he (the one with which Aaron had spoken) met his fellow, they would immediately love and embrace each other and kiss each other. And so was it during all the days of Aaron, peace be upon him; and such was his trait. When he heard that there was an argument between a man and his wife, he would not leave them until they made peace. Hence the men and the women wept for Aaron, but only the males wept for our teacher Moses, peace be upon him. And also [because] Moses would say, "Let justice pierce the mountain," whereas Aaron would bring a compromise between two litigants.

And it will be for his seed - From here they said that Pinchas was not a kohen until that very moment, when he stood up - as it is written (Malachi 2:5) "My covenant was with him was life and peace"
From the [book of] commentary of Eliezer Ben Hyrkanus: "And he said 'I certainly was zealous for Ad-nai'" (I Kings 19:14) The Holy One of Blessing said to Eliahu: You were zealous regarding idolatry in Shittim, as it says: 'Pinchas the son of Eleazar etc.' and here you were certainly zealous! For your life [I swear] that there will be no brit milah that Israel does and you don't see with your eyes. From here the sages established that a honorary seat will be made for Eliahu, who is the angel of the brit [milah] as it says "And the angel of My brit" (Malachi 3:1)
The Holy One of Blessing said to Pinchas: 'you defended My children with your tongue, hold onto the jaw as a gift; you directed the spear on the belly of a man and a woman, hold onto [your] belly; you exerted yourself with your arm, hold your arm as you project peace between people - behold you will bless My children with peace, as it says "May Ad-nai give you favor and grant you peace" (Numbers 6:26) 
Resh Lakish said: Pinchas and Eliahu are one and the same. The Holy One of Blessing said to him: you established peace between Me and the children of Israel, so too even in the future you will establish peace between Me and them, as it is written "behold I am sending to you Elijah the prophet" (Malachi 3:23)
And it will be for him and his seed after him - that they will be blessed by Me ;;forever.
