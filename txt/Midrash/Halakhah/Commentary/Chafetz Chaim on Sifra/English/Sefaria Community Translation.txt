Chafetz Chaim on Sifra

Introduction

Here is known the magnitude of the virtue of the Torah that changed the scripture in his heart several times.  And His will be blessed that His Torah be in our mouths as it is written "And you shall have a sign on your hand, etc., so that the Torah of God may be in your mouth".  And let it be engraved on the tablet of our heart as it is written "And these things which I command today upon your heart" and may His will be blessed that we be diligent in the Torah and as it is written "If you walk in my commandments" and with the Torah of the priests (quoted in Rashi) can this be the fulfillment of the mitzvot, when he says "And my commandments you shall keep  "After all, keeping the unleavened bread means, oh, what am I fulfilling if in my law you go that you labor in the Torah. And this saying is very dear to him, which praises the people of Israel in this and as it is written (Isaiah 7:7) "My people have my Torah in their hearts." And on the contrary, those who distract themselves from the Torah and forget it  Out of his laziness, he warned about this very much and the Ahzal in the Minachot (page 19:) He who forgets one thing from the Talmud goes over how much to the enemy as it is said: "Guard yourself and guard your soul very much lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen and lest they turn away".  And so it is with the Fathers above that the scripture is written as if he commits himself in his soul:
And therefore we must strengthen ourselves with all our strength to the knowledge of His Torah.  And it is usually for the knowledge of the entire Torah [each according to its value] and as it is written "And there were these things which I command today" which includes everything that the Shi'i commanded, and in particular a book of reading about which the scripture says "And God saw the light that it is good" and it is in Genesis Rabbah this  A book of Leviticus which contains many laws - surely we must strengthen ourselves to know it. And the late Midrash of Proverbs (chapter 10) said Rabbi Ishmael came and saw how difficult the Day of Judgment is when God will judge the whole world in the Valley of Jehoshaphat and since a scholar comes before him he says nothing.  You have dealt with the Torah. Says the Lord, tell him what was false and what is false.  This is why they said that whatever a person reads will be taken in his hand and what he writes will be taken in his hand so that shame and fear will not overtake him on the Day of Judgment, etc. He who has a book in his hand and no change in his hand comes - the Almighty turns his face away from him and the angels of hell grow stronger in him like werewolves and they take him and throw him into their hell  A person comes who has two orders or three in his hand - God says to him, son of all laws, why didn't you change them.  If I tell them to leave it better, if not, etc.  The one who has the laws in his hand says to him, the sons of the Torah priests, why is there not a second time that he has the impurity of vermin impurity and purity, the impurity of lesions and the purity of lesions, the impurity of parts and the purity of parts, the impurity of houses and the purity of houses, the impurity of zabin and the purity of zebot, the impurity of birth and the purity of birth, the impurity of a leper and the purity of a leper,  Yom Kippur confession order and equal decree and value laws and all the laws of Israel that are discussed in it.
And here are the words of this Midrash, don't we have a great awakening to the validity of this study since they ask us about it and also really, isn't the Torah, priests on Vaikra and Mikhilta and my books, they are the basis of oral Torah that they go and recite all the letters of the Torah and explain them according to the oral Torah handed down to us from Sinai and they are the source of all  The secondary and the creation.  And that's why I wondered why this study from Israel is so strange, except for a small number of individuals in the generation since it is the basis of oral Torah.  And in particular, according to the words of the aforementioned midrash who ask about this and think how many of the principal laws were found in it and the sources of the order of sanctification and purity in it:
And I will praise you first and foremost in this study Gabi Benyahu ben Yehoideh Biyaru Chazal (Barachot 18:2) what he wrote "And he went down and struck Harry in the pit on the day of the snow" Datana Sefra Debi Rav Bioma Dastia and it is the Torah of the priests, and his for Ari who is the donkey in the books [Tosafs]  Rabbi Yochanan also said (Yavmot eb, 1) that he hated the day and the moon. And in this study there is another great virtue in that the study of the Torah is the study of matters of work, and this is the commentary of Rashi.  KiD) Scholars of wisdom who deal with work laws, I exalt them as if they were sacrificing and offering to my name.  And I have already affirmatively extended the study of work matters in the introduction to the Law Collections groups:
And I observed that the reason for preventing the study of the Torah of the Priests is because it is very distorted and also because there is no simple explanation of it that is comparable to any soul [that the Rabbinical commentary in several places is very long in settling the issues brought up there in the Torah of the Priests and this is also the case with the Rabbi's explanation of the Shantz and there are some creations that they did not explain  Rule because according to their highness it occurred to them that it is simple for every source but we will not understand Ditami without an interpretation. Also in the book Karban Aharon - even though it is a very respectable composition and his way of interpreting the whole Baryta - the reader will get tired of its length on the issues of the Shas.  And also the Gaon Rabbi Meir Bosho of the late Rabbim elaborated and very much made it possible according to his broad opinion to correct each sermon in the grammar of the readings and many times peppered the issue of the Shas and the rulings of the Rambam and Sari Rashonim, and all this is only for Torah elders and not for simple people like me:

Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2



<b> And whence is it derived that we count the years of the Jubilee?</b> The explanation is that if it had not written anything more, I would have thought that one counts each year for the sabbatical; and at the end, he would say, "Seven years, that are one sabbatical." And likewise the second sabbatical, and the third — he would say at the beginning of his counting, "Today is one year; today is two years for the sabbatical." And whence is it derived that we count the years of the Jubilee — that he should say, "Today is one year for the jubilee"; and likewise, "Today is seven years for the jubilee, which are one sabbatical"; and likewise, "Fourteen years for the jubilee, which are two sabbaticals"; and likewise with all of [the years]? [Hence] we learn to say, <i>and they shall be for you, the days of the seven, etc. forty-nine years.</i> Hence, we count all of them and not just each seven on its own.
<b>Whence do we derive that the sabbatical year is observed even if the Jubilee is not observed?</b> The explanation is that you must observe the sabbatical year even though there is no Jubilee, such as when the ten tribes were exiled, since the Jubilee was then annulled. Nevertheless, the sabbatical year was not annulled for the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
<b>[Hence] we learn to say, <i>and they shall be for you.</i></b> Meaning to say, they shall be seven Shabbats for you, which are sabbatical years, even though there is no Jubilee year after them. 
<b>And whence is it derived that the Jubilee is observed even if the sabbatical year is not observed?</b> As in if they return to the land [of Israel] towards the end of fifty years, they observe the Jubilee, even though they did not observe the sabbatical years. 
<b>We follow this textual version: [Hence] we learn to say, <i>and they shall be for you [...] forty-nine years.</i></b> As the words, <i>and they shall be for you</i>, relate to what follows it and to what is after that: <i>and they shall be for you, the days of the seven seven-year cycles</i> — that they should be counted for the sabbatical year; <i>and they shall be for you [...] forty-nine years</i> — that they should be counted for the Jubilee as well. (For were it not so, that "forty-nine" would be superfluous. As who does not know that seven times seven is forty-nine?) And that which we say at the end of Chapter 2 of Arakhin (12b:9) according to Rabbi Yehudah that "those years, from when Sennacherib exiled the ten tribes until Jeremiah came and returned them, they did not count" — hence those years in which not all of the Jewish people were in the land, they do not add to the tally for the count of the Jubilee — there that is just a casual rebuttal, but we we do not conclude like that there. And there are some of the early commentators who explain, "the Jubilee is observed even if the sabbatical year is not observed," as being, for example, when they transgressed and planted on the sabbatical year.
