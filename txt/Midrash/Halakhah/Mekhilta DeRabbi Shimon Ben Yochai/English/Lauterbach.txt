"And God spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, this proves that before the land of Israel was especially consecrated, all countries were fit places for the divine revelation, but after the land of Israel had been especially consecrated, the prophets in all places (outside of Palestine) received their revelations only at a place near water, for thus it is said, 'The word of the Lord came unto Ezekiel ... by the river Kebar' (Ezek. 1.3), and it is also said: 'And I saw in a vision and I was by the river Ulai' (Dan. 8.2), 'As I was by the side of the great river which is Hidekel, etc.' (Dan. 10.4-5). Likewise with Jonah God spoke only near or upon the water. R. Judah says, even formerly (i.e. before Palestine was consecrated) God would speak with the prophets only near water. R. Nehemiah says, formerly He would speak with the prophets at any place."
