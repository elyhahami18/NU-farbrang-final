Learning to Read Midrash

Introduction

<b>Discovering an Approach to Midrash</b>
Learning to read midrash is a valuable skill for students of <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanakh</i> is the Hebrew acronym for the Jewish Bible. It stands for <b>T</b>orah (the Pentateuch), <b>N</b>evi’im (Prophets) and <b>K</b>etuvim (Scriptures).</i> For teachers, it is of vital importance. And yet, our attempts to study midrash systematically are often stymied by the lack of a clear understanding on how to approach it.
Even people familiar with midrashic sources may have difficulty defining exactly what midrash is or seeing the connection between a particular midrash and the biblical text it discusses.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The term ‘midrash’ (plural – ‘midrashim’) will be defined shortly.</i> Readers may also find certain midrashim disturbingly implausible, such as the talmudic description of the angel Gavriel affixing a tail to Queen Vashti (<i>Megila</i> 12b). Are statements such as this meant to be taken literally? If not, what are we to make of them?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of these and related issues, see Part II of this book, in particular Chapter 8: Understanding the Narrative Expansion (the Midrashic Story).</i>
Turning for guidance to the commentaries found in standard editions of midrash, we often find that they are essentially annotations rather than fully developed interpretations of midrashic texts. While invaluable for explaining difficult terminology and providing related sources, these commentaries often leave us with unanswered questions. Sometimes we come upon brief, illuminating interpretations within them, but thorough discussion of the midrashic message and methodology is rare.
Even commentaries offering extensive discussion may not completely meet our needs because they tend to approach midrash from the perspective of Jewish thought, or from a mystical world view. Thus, for example, the profound readings of midrash found in the works of the Maharal<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda Loew of Prague, sixteenth century.</i> and the <i>Hasidic</i> masters typically seek a core concept at the heart of the midrash. Not surprisingly, this leads them to focus on specific elements within midrashic texts, leaving other aspects without interpretation. Within their particular intellectual framework, this omission is not problematic, but it may leave general readers with unresolved questions about the midrash as a whole.
Given the elusive nature of midrash and the absence of tools for analyzing it, we may find ourselves at a loss when attempting to grasp what midrash has to teach us. Even worse, we may mistakenly assume that we have plumbed the depths of a complex, subtle text just because it seems accessible and easy to translate.
Like many <i>Tanakh</i> teachers, I have wrestled with the problem of how to understand midrash, as it inevitably arises when midrash is used as an interpretive tool in the <i>Tanakh</i> classroom. Early in my career, I discovered that I could not really articulate the rationale behind my readings of midrash or offer students methodological tools for reading midrash independently. This gap in my pedagogical repertoire stood in sharp contrast to the clarity with which I was able to explain the conceptual and methodological tools I used in teaching later Bible commentary. As my teaching style matured, I began to feel that a hit-and-miss approach to midrash was no longer adequate.
During a two-year sabbatical with the Jerusalem Fellows program, I concentrated on deepening my understanding of midrash by studying the writings of the <i>rishonim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>rishonim</i> refers to rabbinic authors from approximately the tenth to the sixteenth centuries.</i> on midrash and <i>agada</i>, and by reading a wide range of academic works on the subject. My reading showed me that the analytical tools used by academics would enable me to think systematically about midrash, and offer categories and concepts that could be employed to translate <i>Hazal’</i>s<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazal</i> is a Hebrew acronym for <i>Hahamenu zikhronam livrakha</i> (our Sages of blessed memory) and refers to the rabbis of the talmudic period.</i> mode of discourse into language my students would understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Yitzchak Heinemann’s <i>Darkhei Haagada</i> (Magnes Press, 1953) was of particular help in this respect. Reading his thoughtful, detailed analysis of <i>Hazal’</i>s methodology, I was often struck by his ability to describe elements within <i>Hazal’</i>s thought and language that were already familiar to me, but in terms that I had not encountered before. This led me to become aware of a great body of knowledge, largely unconscious, with which I was fortunate enough to have been inculcated. It was like learning the grammatical terms for my native language. This enabled me to teach the “language” to “non-native speakers.”<br>While I didn’t always agree with what Heinemann had to say, his overall approach was extremely beneficial to me.</i> Because I am not an academic, I did not feel constrained to comply with all the conventions of academic discourse. This enabled me to adopt from the academic world those elements that enhanced my understanding of midrash without abandoning my sense of midrash study as unambiguously part of <i>talmud Torah</i> (Torah study).
Returning to the teaching of <i>Tanakh</i> with this new perspective, I was now able to make the most of midrash as an interpretive mechanism. Before my sabbatical, I had frequently employed midrash as Bible commentary without being able to show how the message had been derived from the midrash. Now, I was able to explain readings and present the basics of a methodology for approaching these texts.
<b>Locating Midrash Within the Literature of <i>Hazal</i></b>
One positive outcome of my explorations was a newfound ability to construct a working definition of midrash. Interestingly, my academic excursion had led me full circle back to essentially the same definition of midrash I had been taught as a child: midrash is <i>Hazal’</i>s unique approach to the study of <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Arriving at this definition was the outcome of a synthesis between my original understanding of midrash and some of the academic reading I had done. None of the academic works I read defined midrash in precisely this way.</i> This definition became far more meaningful, however, when I realized that it had concrete implications for distinguishing midrash both from other areas within the literature of <i>Hazal</i> and from biblical commentary of later periods.
The first element in this definition – and the one most easily overlooked – is that a midrashic teaching, by definition, is <i>always</i> based on a biblical verse or topic, unlike other texts from the period of <i>Hazal</i>. This is the case whether the type of midrash is <b><i>midrash halakha</i></b> or <b><i>midrash agada</i></b>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the most part, when people use the term “midrash” in non-technical discussion, they are usually referring to <i>midrash agada</i> but the term “midrash” more accurately refers to both categories.</i> <b><i>Midrash halakha</i></b> is the body of legal teachings derived from the Torah text through midrashic methodology. <b><i>Midrash agada</i> </b>is the body of interpretive and homiletic teachings derived from the narrative portions of the <i>Tanakh</i> through similar techniques. Critically, what distinguishes both these categories from other halakhic and agadic (non-halakhic) teachings of <i>Hazal</i> is their necessary connection to the biblical text.
<b>Midrash vs. Mishna</b>
The ramifications of defining midrash as <i>Hazal’</i>s unique approach to the study of <i>Tanakh</i> become clearer when we contrast midrashic literature with the Mishna. While midrashic works are often organized to follow the order of the verses within the books of the <i>Tanakh</i> and extract meaning from the verses as they occur, the Mishna is encyclopedic in nature, organized loosely by topic. Generally, topics are discussed in terms of legal cases and the rulings that emerge from them. Biblical verses may be cited as prooftexts in the Mishna, but mishnaic method does not primarily involve mining the biblical text for its teachings.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Consider, for example, the difference in approach between the <i>Sifre</i> (a book of <i>midrash halakha</i> on Deuteronomy) and the mishnaic tractate <i>Bikurim</i> with regard to the mitzvah of first fruits. The midrash begins with the first verse of the commandment, Deuteronomy 26:1 and, following the order of the verses, extracts the halakhic teachings from each verse. Thus, for example, where Deuteronomy 26:2 states: “And you shall take of the first of all the fruits of the earth…” the <i>Sifre</i> comments: “You might [think that] all the fruits are obligated in [the commandment of] <i>bikurim</i>, [but we learn otherwise because] the biblical text says, ‘of the first, ’ and not ‘all the first….’”<br>In contrast, the Mishna in the first chapter of Tractate <i>Bikurim</i> starts from a different perspective, with the first mishna reading: “Some people bring first fruits and recite the required declaration; some bring first fruits but do not recite; and some do not bring first fruits...” While the midrash is tied to the biblical text, the Mishna is free to organize the material as it sees fit. In this case, that means starting the topic with <i>who</i> is obligated to bring first fruits rather than <i>what</i> types of fruit must be brought.</i>
Because the Mishna is organized around legal topics, it includes relatively little discussion of the biblical narrative. In contrast, the obligation of midrash to the biblical text makes it address whatever the verses raise. In practical terms, this means that while the two broad categories of <b><i>midrash halakha</i></b> and <b><i>midrash agada</i></b> are in many ways distinct, the lines between them are often blurred. For example, a text of <i>midrash halakha</i> may introduce a midrashic story in the midst of its halakhic discussion if the verses being discussed give rise to the story.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For example <i>Mekhilta d’Rabbi Yishmael</i>, a <i>midrash halakha</i> on Exodus, contains many <i>midreshei agada</i>, one of which is discussed in Chapter 5.</i> By the same token, books of <i>midrash agada</i> may contain halakhic elements.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 46:11–13, which discusses halakhic aspects of circumcision.</i> Thus, a defining characteristic of midrash – its necessary linkage with the biblical text – plays a role in determining how it is organized and what it addresses.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Interestingly, although the Talmud is based on the Mishna, it often digresses from the halakhic discussion into other areas and, in fact, contains many midrashim.</i>
<b>Midrash and <i>Agada</i></b>
This connection between midrash and the biblical verse also enables us to identify midrashic elements in the Talmud and distinguish them from <b><i>agada</i></b>, an area within the literature of <i>Hazal</i> with which midrash is sometimes confused.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The confusion between the two arises because many people use the word “midrash” as shorthand for the more accurate “<i>midrash agada.</i>”</i> Although the two terms are frequently used interchangeably, “midrash” and “<i>agada</i>” are distinct categories. The general term <b><i>agada</i></b> refers to any area within the literature of <i>Hazal</i> that is not halakhic in nature. Included in this overall category are stories about the Rabbis, historiography, rabbinic proverbs, and, indeed, <i>midrash agada</i>. What distinguishes the specific category of <b><i>midrash agada</i></b> from <b><i>agada</i></b> is that midrash, by definition, is based in the biblical text. <b><i>Midrash agada</i>, </b>a subset of <b><i>agada</i></b>, contains interpretations of the biblical text or uses the biblical text as a springboard for discussion. <b><i>Agada</i></b>, however, need not be linked to the biblical text, and can convey its teachings through other means.
<b>Midrashic Purpose: the Broad Scope of Midrashic Inquiry</b>
If we want to plumb the depths of midrash, we need to consider it in light of the larger body of classic Jewish writings. Not surprisingly, some of the elements that characterize midrash are also reflected in the larger rabbinic corpus<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">One such element, found throughout the literature of <i>Hazal</i>, is the use of simple, concrete examples to convey sophisticated ideas. The midrashic use of parables to clarify subtleties in the biblical text is an illustration of this element. Similarly, in the realm of <i>agada</i>, <i>Hazal</i> often teach complicated theological concepts through the medium of seemingly simple stories about the Rabbis. Halakhic teachings are also characterized by the use of concrete images to encapsulate complex categories. Thus, for example, in its discussion of compensation for damages (in <i>Bava Kama</i>), the Talmud uses images like “an ox that gored” or “a pit in the public domain” to represent different categories of liability. Each such image stands for a class of features that define a whole category and distinguish it from other categories. For more on this idea, see Susan Handelman’s discussion of <i>binyan av</i> in <i>Slayers of Moses</i>, State University of New York Press, 1982, chapter 3.</i> as well as in later forms of biblical commentary.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Traditional Bible commentary, for instance, shares the reverence of midrash for the biblical text and its sensitivity to the nuances of biblical language.</i> Nonetheless, in purpose, style, and methodology, midrash is unique.
To reach a better understanding of the difference in purpose between midrash and later biblical commentary, we must distinguish between <b>interpretation</b> (<i>parshanut</i>) and <b>homiletics</b> (<i>darshanut</i>) in the study of <i>Tanakh</i>. Interpretation is an attempt to explain the meaning of the text. The interpretive act demands that the reader<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I am using ‘reader’ to refer both to Bible students, and commentators on the Bible throughout the ages.</i> listen to the text in order to hear what it is saying; the careful reader works on letting meaning emerge from the text rather than on projecting meaning upon it. Homiletics, in contrast to interpretation, involves using the biblical text – very often against its plain sense – as a vehicle for conveying a predetermined concept or lesson. Connecting that lesson with a biblical source lends the homily authority and rhetorical force. Doing so, however, entails exploiting the biblical text to personal ends rather than trying to understand it on its own terms.
Interpretation is a complex matter, and the description of the interpretive process offered here doesn’t exhaustively describe or explain it. For our purposes, though, focusing on the distinction between interpretation and homiletics allows us to avoid the knotty problem of actually defining that slippery term “<i>peshuto shel mikra</i>” (the plain sense of the text), so often mistakenly perceived as the opposite of a midrashic reading.
Just how difficult it is accurately to define “the plain sense of the text” becomes clear through a comparison of readings offered by commentators on almost any given biblical verse. As one might expect, despite the purported goal of each commentator to explain the <i>peshat</i> (plain sense) of the verse, rarely are two readings alike. We can only conclude that an absolute, completely objective “plain sense of the text” does not exist (or that if it exists it is not accessible to us, which amounts to the same thing). Indeed, we cannot expect to arrive at <i>the</i> “plain sense of the text,” since we know that all readers bring a set of assumptions and preconceptions, often unconscious, to the act of reading; the unique mindset of each reader inevitably affects his understanding of the text. For this reason, much of the work of Bible study involves attempting to reconstruct the reasoning behind conflicting interpretations. Needless to say, the various commentators differ in their approaches to biblical grammar, the role of context in interpretation, and the nature of biblical conventions – to name just three factors that contribute to the interpretive act. Not surprisingly, then, they perceive the biblical text in such a diverse range of ways.
By the same token, the line between interpretation and homiletics is far easier to draw in theory than in practice, as Nehama Leibowitz wryly noted in her tongue-in-cheek definition of the terms <i>peshat</i> (the plain sense reading of the text) and <i>derash</i> (a homiletical reading): “<i>Peshat</i> is what <i>I</i> say and <i>derash</i> is what <i>you</i> say.” Interpretation and homiletics are perhaps more accurately conceived of as opposite poles in a continuum. At the extremes, the distinction between the two categories is fairly clear but the lines blur toward the middle.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It is also worth noting that context and readers’ perceptions play a role in determining whether a statement has an interpretive or homiletical effect. Thus, a preacher might incorporate an interpretive statement in a homiletical text to strengthen his point; in that context, the interpretive statement will take on a homiletical coloration. By the same token, a reader might derive interpretive insight from a homiletical text, even though the text was composed with a purely sermonic agenda.</i>
I would like to suggest, even so, that there is value in framing our discussion in terms of <i>parshanut</i> (interpretation) and <i>darshanut</i> (homiletics) rather than the more commonly used <i>peshat</i> and <i>derash</i>. This is because “the plain sense of the text” is commonly assumed to be a property of the biblical text, with each text having only one “plain sense.” Interpretation and homiletics, in contrast, are modes of text study and, as such, can be understood as descriptions of authorial intent. When we ask ourselves whether a commentator’s reading is interpretive or homiletical, what we are really asking is what he is attempting to do with the biblical text – explain it or exploit it – and not whether he has succeeded in doing so. This gives us the intellectual space to recognize a reading as interpretive even if we initially find it implausible. Recognizing the interpretive process even in a reading we disagree with enables us to examine not only the author’s underlying assumptions, but also our own.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For an interesting discussion of issues relating to the interpretive process, see Stanley Fish’s <i>Is There a Text in This Class?</i> Harvard University Press, 1980.</i>
Jewish tradition accords legitimacy both to interpretation of the <i>Tanakh</i> and to homiletical teachings based on the <i>Tanakh</i>. Both styles of study are hallowed forms of <i>talmud Torah</i>, and each fills a niche within Torah scholarship. The Bible class (i.e., learning <i>Tanakh</i> and commentary) and the rabbinical sermon (i.e., the creative homiletics of a speaker) continue to coexist and thrive in Jewish communities where Torah study is taken seriously, as they have throughout Jewish history.
<b>Midrash and Later Traditional Bible Commentary</b>
For the most part, classic Bible commentary from Rashi (eleventh century) to the Netziv<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin of Volozhin, author of <i>Ha’amek davar</i> among other works.</i> (nineteenth century) assumes the task of interpreting the text, rather than offering a homiletical approach to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, Rashi’s programmatic statement in his commentary on Genesis 3:8 (“<i> vayishme’u</i>…”) and the Rashbam’s on the necessity of explaining the plain sense of the text in his commentary on Genesis 37:2 (“<i>eila..</i>.”) Also note the distinction the Ramban draws between the plain sense of the text and its mystical meaning in his commentary on Genesis 1:3 (“<i>yehi ohr</i>...”). We may assume that commentators who do not make programmatic statements of this sort also share the goal of explaining the plain sense of the text since they often argue the merits of their reading (or disagree with others’ readings) on the basis of the distinction between the plain sense of the text and a homily.</i> Even in instances when biblical commentary of this type spills over into homiletics, the homily is usually an aside, parenthetical to the overall agenda of the commentator.
The midrashic agenda, in contrast, is far broader. Midrash explores the biblical text exhaustively, seeking both the plain sense of the text and its homiletical possibilities without distinguishing rigidly between them. This does not mean that <i>Hazal</i> were unaware of the distinction between interpretation and homiletics. They and the Bible commentators who followed them shared the understanding that while there are many ways of reading a text, there is a qualitative difference between explaining the text and projecting meanings onto it. Statements like <i>ein mikra yotze midei peshuto</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 24a. See Rashi on these words. (The phrase appears in other places as well, such as <i>Shabbat</i> 63a and <i>Yevamot</i> 11b. An examination of the quote in the context of <i>Shabbat</i> 63a will show why the <i>Yevamot</i> citation is preferred.)</i> (“a biblical verse does not lose its plain sense meaning”) attest to this. Indeed, the midrashic use of biblical verses often depends on <i>Hazal’</i>s assumption that the reader can distinguish between the plain sense of the verse and the use to which it is put in a midrash. That said, the purpose of midrash is to derive a maximal amount of teachings – homiletical as well as strictly interpretive – from each biblical verse as fully as possible, on the assumption that the Torah contains endless levels of meaning. This breadth of purpose is one source of the puzzlement felt by readers accustomed to the more narrowly focused agenda of classic Bible commentary, and leads them to conclude, mistakenly, that the midrashic agenda is largely homiletical rather than interpretive. Actually, the midrashic agenda encompasses both homily and interpretation.
The word ‘midrash’ (from the root <i>d-r-sh</i>) also plays a role in creating this impression. The root <i>d-r-sh</i>, which conveys meanings like ‘seek,’ ‘ask,’ and ‘investigate,’ is also the basis for the word <i>derasha</i> (homily, sermon). As might be expected, the association of the word ‘midrash’ with ‘<i>derasha</i>’ could easily lead one to conclude that midrashic literature is made up of <i>derashot</i> (homilies).
In fact, however, the two primary styles of <i>Tanakh</i> study – the interpretive and the homiletical – are found side-by-side within midrashic literature. The interpretive midrash, like the classic Bible commentary succeeding it historically, usually focuses on a difficulty in the biblical text for the purpose of resolving it. This may involve explaining the meaning of a word, phrase, verse, or story and/or its connection to other elements in the biblical text. In contrast, the homiletical midrash, like the rabbinical sermon, plays with the possibilities inherent in the seemingly simple language of the <i>Tanakh</i> to teach, preach, or discuss concepts that do not necessarily rise organically out of a reading of the biblical text.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As noted above, interpretation and homiletics are poles of a continuum. The same may be said for interpretive and homiletical midrashim. Although classifying midrashim helps us understand them, we should always be aware that interpretive midrashim may be used homiletically, and homelitical midrashim may have interpretive aspects.</i>
<b>Midrashic Style</b>
Because midrashim do not come neatly labeled by type or genre, only a thorough understanding of the text enables a reader to know whether a midrash is interpretive or homiletical.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This point was brought home to me very dramatically in a lesson I was teaching on the David-Avigayil story (I Samuel 1:24). Preparing the material for the class, I had come across the following brief midrashic comment in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> (Volume 2:134): R. Simon said: ‘He is Naval, he is Lavan. Just as Lavan was a trickster, Naval was a trickster.’ I noted the word play on the names of the two characters and the connection made between their personalities. However, since I generally choose interpretive midrashim in teaching a biblical text, and had mentally categorized this midrash as homiletical, I omitted it from the list of sources my students would be asked to study in preparation for the class. Imagine my surprise when a student piped up with: “You know, this guy Naval really reminds me of Lavan.” I showed the class the source in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> and asked her to elaborate. With the help of the rest of the students, she produced a beautifully detailed comparison of the Yaakov-Lavan story and chapter 24 of Samuel.</i>
<br>Among the similarities they noted are that both stories are set in a pastoral setting. The plots of both stories revolve crucially around the flocks and wealth of the wicked character. In both cases, the righteous character of the story provides a service for which the wicked character does not wish to pay. Both stories place women in a conflict of loyalties between the righteous and wicked characters: Rahel and Leah have to choose between righteous husband and wicked father, Avigayil between wicked husband and righteous incumbent king.
<br>The contrast between the stories was no less illuminating than the comparison. Both contrast and comparison gave us much food for thought in our analysis of the chapter.
<br>It is impossible to say whether R. Simon meant to imply as much as we derived from his brief comment, but my failure to see the interpretive potential of this source showed me very clearly the dangers of automatically assuming that a midrash is homiletical. Understanding midrash demands that we learn a mode of discourse very different from the one in which we are accustomed to read Bible commentary.
Many of the classic Bible commentators use language that is considerably more succinct than that of Western philosophical or literary works. Nonetheless, even the most laconic of the Bible commentators convey their readings in prose form, building their arguments in the straightforward, linear style that generally characterizes Western non-fictional writing.
In our encounters with the kinds of stories and images midrash employs to communicate information, we find ourselves in a literary universe light years away from that of later Bible commentary. Midrashic style is characterized by the dense, concise, figurative language <i>Hazal</i> use to convey the complex understandings they uncover in the biblical text. Among the vehicles employed for the midrashic message are parable, story, and word-play. Each of these literary devices is misleadingly simple; a true appreciation of them requires careful consideration. The skills we use to analyze linear arguments are inadequate for the task of extracting the Rabbis’ subtle, highly sophisticated messages from the figurative language in which they are clothed.
Some examples might be the statement in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 85:2 that Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce Yosef “for the sake of Heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 14</i> <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 3:1 tells us that God called to Moshe using his father’s voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 10.</i> <i>Sanhedrin</i> 107a portrays David as contemplating idol worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 15.</i> And <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 3:4 compares God to a common maidservant.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12.</i> Texts such as these, taken at face value rather than read closely, may lead us to think that <i>Hazal</i> could not possibly be conveying interpretive readings of the type found in later Bible commentary. In the absence of guiding principles on how to approach texts of such opacity, readers may find themselves at a loss, locked out of the midrashic discourse.
Once we have learned the Rabbis’ language, though, and understand how it operates, midrashic style ceases to be an impediment to understanding. In effect, it even sensitizes us to the power of the biblical text, and provides a link between the more diffuse modern language we use for discussing ideas and the stark linguistic density of the <i>Tanakh</i>, so heavily laden with meaning.
<b>Midrashic Methodology</b>
The uniqueness of midrash is manifested not only in its broad agenda and distinctive style, but also in its methodology. Although classic Bible commentary is remarkably sensitive to nuances in the language of the <i>Tanakh</i>, only in midrash are the interpretive and homiletical possibilities of biblical language stretched to the fullest extent. This is due to <i>Hazal’</i>s unique view of language as a whole, and to the special significance they perceive in the Holy Tongue and in biblical language. In keeping with biblical theology, they maintain intense respect for the word, according it independent reality and even power over the physical world. Taken together with the religious obligation to understand the <i>Tanakh</i> as fully as possible, their sanctification of language compels the Rabbis to explore every conceivable combination and permutation within the linguistic universe of the <i>Tanakh</i>.
At the same time, <i>Hazal</i> treat language with astonishing flexibility, allowing themselves virtually absolute freedom to engage with it as they see fit.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Yitzchak Heinemann, in <i>Darkhei Haagada</i>, points out that while Greek hermeneutics is governed by the notion of <i>logos</i>, the organizing principle for both language and the world, <i>Hazal’</i>s approach is not constrained in the same manner. The smallest possible meaningful unit in the Greek hermeneutic is the word, and its meaning is dependent upon the larger context within which it appears. In the linguistic universe of <i>Hazal</i>, however, even the letter is not the smallest meaningful unit. (See <i>Menahot</i> 29b for the story of Moshe in the <i>bet midrash</i> of Rabbi Akiva which begins with Moshe’s question about the purpose of the crowns he is affixing to the letters of the Torah. God answers that the as-yet-unborn Rabbi Akiva will expound upon them.) This is not to say that <i>logos</i> and context play no role in <i>Hazal’</i>s interpretation of the <i>Tanakh</i>, but rather that meaning may be construed both within and outside the bounds of these categories.</i> Given that <i>Hazal’</i>s search for meaning is not of necessity restricted to the plain sense of the text, and given the openness with which they approach the language of the <i>Tanakh</i>, the wide-ranging nature of their readings may seem arbitrary – even anti-methodological – to the uninitiated.
Careful analysis of midrash, however, shows that the Rabbis are profoundly thoughtful and respectful in their reading of the biblical text, even though some of the mechanisms used in midrash are hard to recognize as methodology for a reader unfamiliar with them. On one hand, midrashic methodology uses a variety of close reading techniques to analyze the biblical text,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis describe some of these techniques formally in different lists of ‘rules by which the Torah is interpreted’ (<i>middot she’haTorah nidreshet bahen</i>). For a complete discussion of these rules and how the different lists relate to one another, see Rabbi Moshe Ostrovsky, <i>Hamiddot she’haTorah nidreshet bahen</i>, Jerusalem, 1981.</i> on the assumption that each word in the <i>Tanakh</i> is intentionally chosen and charged with significance. The arrangement of words and phrases within a verse and across the narrative are seen as purposeful, as are cases of apparent repetitiveness or missing details. Every aspect of the text counts in <i>Hazal’</i>s search for meaning. On the other hand, some midrashic insights are a matter of free association, play on words, or subtle alterations made in the grammar or punctuation of the biblical text, mechanisms many readers may have difficulty seeing as methodological. These “un-methodological” methodologies, though, are completely reasonable from <i>Hazal’</i>s perspective; a reader initiated into the rabbinical mindset begins to see their reason too. After all, if language has a reality of its own, words and other elements of language are objects to be studied, manipulated, taken apart and put back together again in order to be understood, just as physical phenomena are explored, poked, prodded and speculated about by the scientific mind in its specialized quest for meaning.
<b>The Interpretive Midrash as a Window on <i>Tanakh</i></b>
Midrash is far too vast and complex a body of Torah to be studied using only one approach. Even when a methodology for analyzing a particular category of midrash can be suggested, it would be highly presumptuous to assume that any given midrash can be reduced to a single meaning, however deep.
As a teacher who has come to the world of midrash through <i>Tanakh</i> study, I have always been most interested in <i>midrash agada</i> that <i>interprets</i> the biblical narrative, as opposed to <i>midrash halakha</i> or homiletical <i>midrash agada</i>. In this book, I have limited my inquiry to a very particular area: a methodology for analyzing interpretive <i>midrash agada</i>. I have chosen to explore two genres within the category of interpretive <i>midrash agada</i>: the <i>mashal</i> (midrashic parable) and the narrative expansion (midrashic story).
Each of the readings presented in this book attempts to reconstruct the reasoning behind midrashic commentary on biblical narrative with the goal of conveying a sensitivity, inspired by <i>Hazal</i>, to the language and meanings of the <i>Tanakh</i>, as well as a reverent appreciation for the language and teachings of <i>Hazal</i>. I have tried to justify my readings by grounding them in a close reading of rabbinical language and by presenting, with greatest possible clarity, the assumptions guiding my readings of these texts. Ultimately, however, the interpretive act, unlike the mathematical proof, requires a leap on the part of the person engaged in interpretation, one that may or may not be seen as plausible by others.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">As anthropologist Clifford Geertz said, “You either grasp an interpretation or you do not, see the point of it or you do not, accept it or you do not” (<i>The Interpretation of Cultures</i>, Fontana Press, 1993, p. 24).</i>
Studying midrash has been, and continues to be, a source of deep religious inspiration for me. I hope the reader will likewise be moved by these readings to even greater respect for the midrashic mind. May the intellectual process involved serve to reinforce the spiritual and religious awe evoked in any act of Torah study.

<b>About the Structure of This Book</b>
Chapters 1–7 of this book focus on the <i>mashal</i> (parable) genre. These chapters present a step-by-step methodology for reading the <i>mashal</i> – something akin to a template. The rationale for this template is laid out in Chapter 1: Understanding the Mashal; Chapter 2 presents its structure. My hope is that the readings offered in this section will demonstrate how <i>Hazal</i> use stories of their own making to interpret the biblical narrative.
The tools acquired in analyzing the <i>mashal</i> lay the groundwork for understanding chapters 8–17, which deal with the narrative expansion (midrashic story). Along the way, we will grapple with issues that inevitably arise when studying midrash, such as the question of midrashic factuality, and the freedom in <i>Hazal’</i>s use of biblical verses in their readings of the <i>Tanakh</i>.
Several of the midrashim selected will be familiar to readers; some may be completely new. I have deliberately chosen texts from the volumes of midrashim that might be found on the average Jewish bookshelf rather than from more obscure sources. I have also opted for standard traditional editions of midrashic texts over more recently produced academic editions. My motivation is the wish to remain focused on techniques for deriving messages from midrash rather than on issues of textual emendation.
That said, the reader is advised that the standard editions of midrash are not always the ones most faithful to the historically reliable manuscripts. In the case of the examples analyzed here, the differences between the standard editions and the best scholarly editions did not seem critical to me, but it is always interesting and often worthwhile to make the comparisons.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In a number of places, I refer readers to an alternate version of a midrash and/or point out some of the differences between the version I analyze and other versions.</i>

<b>A Note on Translations</b>
Translating biblical and midrashic texts has been something of a technical headache, as might be expected. I chose not to rely upon existing translations (although I have in certain cases checked my “home-made” translations against others).
Much has been said and written about what is lost by reading literature in translation. When it comes to the study of Torah, the problem of translation is immeasurably more acute, because the sanctity of the texts we are trying to understand is fundamentally untranslatable.
A Spanish proverb has it that a translation may be either faithful or beautiful but not both. For the purposes of this book, beautiful translation would have proved deficient, since much of our interpretive work hinges on precisely the kind of ambiguity or nuance that would be destroyed in the attempt to produce a flowing or elegant rendition. My preference, then, has been the faithful translation over the beautiful one. The choice is not a simple one, since the more literal the translation, the less it does justice to the aesthetic qualities of the original. To compensate for the aesthetic deficiencies of these translations, I recommend that readers take advantage of the original texts of the midrashim, which are reproduced in the appendix.
<b>Acknowledgements</b>
Writing this book has been an educational experience. Among the things I have learned is just how many wonderful people I know.
First and foremost, I would like to express the deepest gratitude to my dear friend, Professor Susan Handelman, without whom this book would never even have been attempted. With characteristic warmth and tenacity, she pushed, pulled, prodded and cajoled every step of the way, constantly exhorting me to “Write it down!”
Not the least of her gifts to me was an introduction to Dr. Ora Elper who has become a valued friend and an indispensable editor. Ora’s impressive editorial skills, professionalism, and formidable intelligence were always offered with tact and gentle good humor. This book would not be what it is without her and I am very grateful.
Tzvi Mauer of Urim Publications has been everything a publisher should be. It has been a pleasure working with him and his excellent staff.
Most of this book was written in the Judaica Reading Room of the National Library on the Givat Ram Campus of Hebrew University. I am greatly indebted to its impeccably professional staff. Alisa Allon, Elona Avinezer, Zipora Ben Abou, and Ruth Flint have created a warm home-away-from-home for the numerous scholars and students who frequent it. I would also like to thank Dena Ordan, one of the “regulars” at the library, for helping me learn to use my laptop and for introducing me to many of the wonderful scholars at the Reading Room. My friends Chana Slutzkin and Robin Eaton provided both pleasant companionship and much appreciated transportation on my almost daily trips to the library.
Several people read portions of the book at various stages and I benefited significantly from their input. I would like to thank Meir Baruch, Rabbi Dr. Joshua Berman, Adi Bougich, Rabbi Dr. Gavriel Cohen, and Tyra Lieberman for their thoughtful, perceptive comments. My friend and <i>hevruta</i>, Batya Gallant, offered both constructive criticism and warm personal support throughout. I would like to express my particular appreciation to Rabbi Shalom Carmy for taking the time to read my manuscript despite the fact that he did not know me personally. His suggestions were indispensable, and they were offered with generous encouragement. I also cannot thank Rabbi Zev Leff enough for his kind willingness to read my manuscript. His gracious <i>haskama</i> is an adornment to this book.
My sisters, Jeanette Baruch and Channie Rappaport, provided much needed moral support during the lengthy process of writing this book, as did my dear friends Miriam Triebitz, Miriam Shaul, and Ruth Pinkenson Feldman.
I have been privileged to learn Torah from many wonderful teachers. Some have been truly exceptional, like Dr. Avraham Zalkin. As my mentor in the Jerusalem Fellows program, he was a formative influence in helping me develop the approach to midrash taken in this book. Among other things, he guided my reading and directed me to some of the special teachers and thinkers in Jerusalem. A true <i>yakir Yerushalayim</i>, he is a role model in every sense of the word.
The most important teachers in my life have been my many students. I have been blessed with the privilege of teaching Torah in Jerusalem and have been fortunate to have students from all walks of life. To them I owe not only intellectual and spiritual lessons, but also the extraordinary gift of being a teacher.
My children, Shmuel Moshe, Avigayil, and Baruch Nechemiah have been a continual source of joy and pleasure. Their maturity and forbearance while I was writing this book were greatly appreciated. Their supportiveness made everything easier.
<i>Aharon aharon haviv.</i> My husband, David, has supported me in every way imaginable from the earliest days of our marriage. At every crossroads in my teaching career, he has lovingly cheered me on, encouraging me always to grow. This book could never have been written without him. Appreciation, gratitude, and love are not easily conveyed in a public acknowledgement. David evokes them all, in abundance.

Chapter 1; Understanding the Mashal (The Midrashic Parable)

<b>Understanding the <i>Mashal</i><br>(The Midrashic Parable)</b>
Our exploration of the interpretive midrash begins with the <i>mashal</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>mashal</i> is also used by <i>Hazal</i> to refer to uses of figurative language.</i> genre for two reasons. First, the <i>mashal</i> is the most obviously interpretive type of midrash; by its very nature it requires the reader to compare and contrast texts. Second, determining the structure of the <i>mashal</i> is usually straightforward. This makes it easier to analyze than the midrashic story.
A <i>mashal</i> is generally made up of two parts, though many <i>meshalim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the plural form of <i>mashal</i>.</i> contain other elements as well. The only indispensable part of the <i>mashal</i>-type midrash is the <i>mashal</i> itself, which is introduced by phrases like, “<i>le-ma hadavar domeh</i>,” (to what may this thing be compared?) or “<i>mashal</i> <i>le</i>…” (this may be compared to…). A midrash of the <i>mashal</i> type usually also contains a <i>nimshal</i> (explanation of the <i>mashal</i>), introduced by the word “<i>kakh</i>” (thus). Often the <i>nimshal</i> is considerably less detailed than the <i>mashal</i> and in some cases there is no <i>nimshal</i>, but most midrashim of the <i>mashal</i> genre are made up of at least these two parts at a minimum.
In reading a <i>mashal</i>, as in the reading of any midrash, we need to be guided by a question characteristic of <i>Hazal</i>. The formulation of the question is typically succinct and goes to the heart of the matter: “<i>Lama li</i>?” (Why do I need this word, verse, statement, phrase?) The use of a <i>mashal</i> as commentary on a biblical text sparks the question, “What does the <i>mashal</i> add to my understanding of the text, and what would be missing if I read the text without the aid of this <i>mashal</i>?”
Another guiding principle in the analysis of the <i>mashal</i> is that <i>meshalim</i> are revealing not primarily because of the similarities they demonstrate but, more critically, because of the differences they highlight. The message of a <i>mashal</i> is thus often found in the discrepancies between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>, <i>mashal</i> and biblical text, or the <i>mashal</i> element and other parts of the same midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I am indebted to Professor Yona Fraenkel for this insight. I had the pleasure of studying with Professor Fraenkel during the course of a two-year sabbatical with the Jerusalem Fellows and benefited greatly from his lectures and writings.</i>
<br>Professor Fraenkel’s influence finds expression in two critical elements of my approach to midrash: (1) the structural approach, demonstrated throughout the book and (2) the guiding concept that the message of a <i>mashal</i> is often found in the discrepancies between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>, or <i>mashal</i> and biblical text.
<br>Having said this, I must, however, point out that he would probably disapprove of my application of his methodology. Professor Fraenkel strongly opposes the idea that midrash is in any way interpretive. In addition, I do not do the kind of text-critical reconstruction and comparison of manuscripts that he considers so central to an academically valid approach to the text.
<br>For a thorough introduction to Professor Fraenkel’s work, see his <i>Darkhei ha’agada vehamidrash</i> (Yad Latalmud) 1991, Israel.
In this respect, a <i>mashal</i> is like a metaphor or a simile. A metaphor is thought provoking because its comparison of two things reveals differences between them; the parallels drawn by the metaphor are only partial or superficial. For example, to say that God may be compared to a king expresses an almost banal truth if the intent is merely to indicate power, a quality shared by God and human kings. At the same time, our awareness that no earthly king – however powerful – can approach the greatness of God, sensitizes us to the inadequacy of the comparison and highlights our understanding of God’s greatness, at least in some measure.
In analyzing a <i>mashal</i>, the reader should bear in mind that all parables, by nature, break down if taken too far. The above example of the God/king comparison illustrates the dangers of trying to push the likeness in a <i>mashal</i> beyond its intended bounds. After all, if we say that God is <i>really</i> like a human king, we have missed the point of the metaphor. We must also remain aware, though, that the breakdown in a <i>mashal</i> is often part of an interpretive strategy. As we have noted, the message of the midrash frequently resides in the intentionally planted discrepancies between its various parts. Otherwise, as <i>Hazal</i> say, “<i>Lama li</i>?”
The midrashim that follow in this section illustrate the properties of <i>mashal</i>-type midrashim in a variety of ways. The first example, from <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i>, introduces a step-by-step, systematic approach to the reading of <i>meshalim</i> used throughout this book. I have found this approach a useful tool in my own study of midrashim of this type, but it is by no means the only way to read any given <i>mashal</i>. The method outlined here, like any interpretive approach, also has its pitfalls. Just as a midrash may be misunderstood by “under-reading” it, one can fail to get at the meaning of a midrash by “over-reading” it, finding discrepancies or problems where none exist. That said, the method has one distinct advantage – it forces us to slow down and think about what the midrash is saying. Wealth and depth of meaning await the careful reader.

Chapter 2; The Methodology of the Mashal; God and Avraham as King and Warrior

It is reprinted here with permission from <i>Jewish Action</i>, the magazine of the Orthodox Union.</i>

<b>Nineteen Verses</b>
The story of the <i>Akeda</i> is a complex narrative because the text is so succinctly written and yet so dense with meaning. In the space of nineteen verses, the biblical account compels us to struggle with sensitive and weighty issues like the meaning of faith and the limits of rationality in our relationship with God. Because the powerful ideas it grapples with are not presented in a neutral framework, however, the <i>Akeda</i> story is more than an intellectually demanding exercise. We are emotionally and spiritually stretched by these verses as well because they call upon us to accompany Avraham – father figure for us as well as for Yitzchak – through the immediacy of his private experience of the <i>Akeda</i>.
<b>Midrash as Tool</b>
Midrash is an ideal tool for mining this loaded text. <i>Hazal’</i>s close reading techniques open the subtleties of the <i>Akeda</i> to the interpretive process, while the <i>mashal</i> form and the midrashic story convey the significance of the various textual difficulties explored.
The midrash to be analyzed here is a revealing illustration of how midrashic technique operates within the <i>mashal</i> form. To see how a <i>mashal</i> functions as an interpretive tool, we need to follow the interpretive process from the identification of a textual problem to its resolution by the midrash.
<b>The Interpretive Problem</b>
The story of the <i>Akeda</i> (Genesis 22) opens as follows:
(1) And it was after these things and the Lord tested Avraham, and He said to him, “Avraham,” and he said, “Here I am.” (2) And He said, “Take, please, your son, your only one, the one you love, Yitzhak, and go you to the land of Moriah and bring him up as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will show you.”
Even a cursory reading of this passage raises a number of questions. <i>Midrash Tanhuma</i> addresses in particular the use of the word “<i>na</i>” (please) in God's commandment to Avraham (verse 2). No other biblical command from God takes this form.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Imagine, for example, the effect of “Guard, please, the Sabbath to keep it holy” in the Ten Commandments, or “Speak, please, to the children of Israel” as an instruction to Moshe Rabbenu.</i> Is God commanding or requesting? The grammar of the verse implies that God is commanding; the verb <i>lekh</i> (go) is in the imperative form. In any case, if this is simply a request, why doesn't Avraham refuse, argue – as he did for the salvation of Sdom – or at least ask for an explanation? Avraham's immediate, silent compliance seems to indicate that he understands these words as a commandment. How, then, are we to interpret the use of the word “please” here?
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
<i>Tanhuma</i> (<i>Vayera</i>) comments:
(1) ...And He said, “Take, please”: [The word] ‘please’ is none other than an expression of request.
(2) This may be compared to a king of flesh and blood who had many wars come upon him,
(3) and he had one warrior who won all the wars.
(4) After some time, he was faced with a difficult battle.
(5) The king said to that warrior,
(6) “Please, [I request] of you, stand for me in this war,
(7) so that my generals will not say, ‘Those first [wars] had no substance.’”
(8) Even thus, the Holy One Blessed be He said to Avraham,
(9) “I have tested you with nine tests and you have withstood them.
(10) Now stand for me in this test,
(11) so that they will not say, ‘Those first ones had no substance.’”
<b><i>Lama li?:</i> What Does the <i>Mashal</i> Add?</b>
At first glance, the <i>mashal</i> section of the midrash (i.e., the story of the king and the warrior in lines 2–7) does not appear to add anything substantial to our understanding of the difficulty it purports to address. The substance of the message seems to be in the way the midrash elaborates God's commandment (lines 8–11). Why do we need the <i>mashal</i>?
One possibility is that the <i>mashal</i> is a stylistic device – a word picture painted to enliven the text. While there are <i>meshalim</i> of the word-picture type, we should always consider the possibility that the <i>mashal</i> has an interpretive function before relegating it to this category since our initial failure to understand a midrash may stem from our lack of familiarity with <i>Hazal’s</i> linguistic style.
<b>Using a Methodological Approach</b>
On the assumption that we may be missing something, the next step is to examine the paragraph more closely. To make sure we do this thoroughly, we will follow a six-step procedure. The advantage of this systematic approach is that omitting something essential in our reading becomes highly unlikely. The steps are:
(1) dividing the paragraph into its constituent parts
(2) examining the <i>mashal</i> part of the midrash as a story in its own right to look for inconsistencies, gaps or problems
(3) isolating the important elements of the <i>mashal</i> part of the midrash
(4) matching the elements of the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i>
(5) drawing conclusions
(6) re-reading the biblical text in light of the midrash to see how the <i>mashal</i> has helped us interpret the text.
<b>(1) Structure of the Midrash</b>
In the case of our midrash, step1 is fairly easily accomplished. The paragraph is divisible into three parts: the statement of the textual difficulty (line 1), the <i>mashal</i> (lines 2–7), and the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 8–11). In dividing the paragraph, we should, however, note two things.
First, the statement of the interpretive problem (line 1) is somewhat cryptic, and the inexperienced reader of midrash might easily miss its significance. Line 1 simply informs us that the word <i>na</i> (please) implies a request. The reader has to infer from this that the midrashic commentator is bothered by the discrepancy between the <i>fact</i> of the commandment and the <i>language</i> in which it is couched, i.e., language which seems to undermine its commandment-like character.
This is an important point for the student of midrash: the absence of a straightforward statement of the interpretive difficulty is highly characteristic of midrashic style. Readers must take this into account in every reading of midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Students of Rashi are familiar with this problem. Rarely does Rashi directly state what his difficulty with the text is. The reader almost always has to reconstruct the question from the answer.</i> At times, the midrash will clearly state the textual problem it is addressing. Often, though, there will be no mention of the textual problem or, as in our case, the nature of the textual problem must be reconstructed from a terse, indirect, statement.
Second, we should note that the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 8–11) is a narrative expansion, i.e., a midrashic story which extends the biblical story beyond what is actually written in the text. The words that the midrash attributes to God do not appear in Genesis 22 and are not the only possible interpretation of verse 2; they are part of the midrashic <i>commentary</i> on the story.
<b>(2) <i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
Step (2) requires us to analyze the <i>mashal</i> (lines 2–7) as a story in its own terms. The story line is easily summarized. A king has to contend with many wars. One of his warriors wins all his battles for him. Faced with the prospect of a particularly difficult confrontation, the king requests of his warrior that he win this war, so that the king’s generals will not disparage the value of all the previous victories.
Re-thinking the story, we realize it is more complicated than it appears. Questions arise. For one thing, why is this king faced with so many wars and what are the wars about? Why is the king concerned with his generals' reaction to the possible loss of this particular war? Doesn't the king trust the warrior who has won all his previous battles for him? If so, why does he request of the warrior to “stand for me in this war” (line 6)? If the king does not trust the warrior, or does not believe that he is capable of winning the battle, what is the point of making the request?
These questions subtly reshape the story of the <i>mashal</i> for us, in part by making us notice what is missing from the text. The king’s wars do not appear to involve territory, conquest for economic gain, or even the security of his realm. Our analysis reveals a king who is concerned about prestige; the wars have an impact on the king’s image, even within his own kingdom. The “difficult battle” (line 4) is particularly important to him because a loss in this war will undermine all his previous gains.
While we have not answered all the questions raised regarding the story of the <i>mashal</i>, we can see that the process of asking these questions enables us to identify a complexity overlooked on our first reading. The problems we have seen here will influence our understanding of the midrash as a whole.
<b>(3) Isolating the Elements</b>
In step (3), we must make some decisions concerning the essential elements of the <i>mashal</i> story. Here the process is straightforward. In list form, we have:
a king
many wars
a warrior
wins all the wars
a difficult battle
the king’s request
the king’s generals
“the first wars had no substance”
<b>(4) Matching the Elements</b>
In step (4), we need to match the elements of the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i>. (Since the <i>nimshal</i> is often less elaborated than the <i>mashal</i>, this will usually require us to fill any gaps left by the <i>nimshal</i>. In this particular case, the <i>nimshal</i> completes the <i>mashal</i> almost without gaps). Let’s complete our list by filling in the correspondences.
a king / the Holy One Blessed be He
many wars / nine tests
a warrior / Avraham
wins all the wars / withstanding the tests
a difficult battle / this test (the <i>Akeda</i>)
the king’s request / God's request (line 10)
the king’s generals / -----
“the first wars had no substance” / “the first ones had no substance”
Lining up the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i> in this way allows us to see that the correspondence between the two leaves some unresolved issues. The most noticeable is the gap in the <i>nimshal</i>. In the <i>mashal</i>, the king worries that his <i>generals</i> will say that the first wars had no substance, but the <i>nimshal</i> leaves the corresponding role blank. The skeptics of the <i>nimshal</i> are left unspecified (see line 11 of the midrash).
Even more significant is the fact that the <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> don't accurately reflect the biblical story they are supposed to be explaining. In the <i>mashal</i>, the wars are the <i>king’s</i> wars; the warrior is merely the king’s proxy. In the biblical story, however, it is Avraham – not God – who undergoes the nine tests and must withstand the <i>Akeda</i>. This leaves us with a gap and a discrepancy that require resolution.
<b>(5) Drawing Conclusions</b>
As we have seen, the midrash makes a point of collapsing the distinction between God (the king of the <i>mashal</i>) and Avraham, by making an equivalence between the wars of the king (in the <i>mashal</i>), and the tests of Avraham (in the <i>nimshal</i>). The author of the midrash uses this blurring of identities to tell us that the <i>Akeda</i> is not really a testing of Avraham but, more significantly, an ordeal which Avraham must undergo for God's sake. If this is so, God’s words to Avraham also have the nature of a request. Should Avraham refuse to obey God here, or fail the test by backing out at the last moment, the battle he loses is not really his own, but God's. Avraham's acts of faith are inextricably linked with God's name, in much the same way that the warrior acts as the king’s proxy on the battlefield. Avraham's ability to withstand the test is not in question here. (After all, if the king does not believe that his warrior can win the battle, any request is pointless.) In this reading, God wants Avraham to understand just how critical the <i>Akeda</i> is, not for Avraham's sake, but for His own. According to the midrash, then, the word <i>na</i> underlines the element of request inherent in God's commandment. We might even argue that a request would be more effective than a commandment, both in the <i>mashal</i> and in the story of the <i>Akeda</i>. Both the king of the <i>mashal</i> and God appeal to personal loyalty and not the formal nature of the relationship between king/King and servant.
<b>Filling in the Gap</b>
We are still left with the problem of the gap. Generally, when we try to fill a gap in a <i>nimshal</i>, we look to the biblical text for the missing correspondence. In this case, however, there appears to be nothing in the verses from Genesis that can fill the role of the generals in the <i>mashal</i> since God's commandment to Avraham is delivered privately. Who is the “audience” of the <i>Akeda</i>? And why is this “audience” represented as the king’s generals in the <i>mashal</i>?
One possibility is that the gap is left to show us that the exact identity of the king’s generals is unimportant. On this interpretation, the author of the midrash leaves the blank for readers to fill in as they choose. The role could be assigned to whomever the reader sees as the potentially critical observers of the <i>Akeda</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Some of my students' suggestions have been: the angels, the nations of the world, Avraham's contemporaries, and the members of Avraham's household, especially Eliezer and Yishmael, who are waiting at the foot of the mountain, according to some midrashim.</i>
However, since the author of the midrash could have constructed the <i>mashal</i> in any of a number of different ways, we can legitimately ask why he gives the king’s <i>generals</i> the role of skeptics, rather than, for example, choosing the king’s enemies. Alternatively, the author could have left the role unspecified in the <i>mashal</i> just as he did in the <i>nimshal</i>. Lines 6–7 of the <i>mashal</i> might then have read something like: “Please [I request] of you, stand for me in this war, so that they will not say, ‘Those first [wars] had no substance.’” Either of these options would have seemed eminently reasonable within the context of the <i>mashal</i>.
This leads us to a second possibility. The audience of the <i>Akeda</i> is, self-evidently, the reader of the text, since only the reader of the text has access to the private interaction between God and Avraham. The midrash may be suggesting that the <i>Akeda</i> with a different ending – Avraham's failing the test – would cause the reader to doubt God. This hypothesis is reinforced when we note that the midrash assumes a Jewish reader of the text. If Avraham is the king’s greatest warrior, the Jewish people are likewise generals of the king.
<b>The Midrash Without the <i>Mashal</i></b>
We can now answer our original question. Why do we need the story of the <i>mashal?</i> Analysis of this midrash has shown us that its message really emerges from the <i>contrast</i> between the <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>, rather than from their apparent similarity. Let’s consider the message that would be conveyed if we eliminated the <i>mashal</i> part of the midrash and rewrote it as follows:
And He said, “Take please”: [The word] ‘please’ is none other than the language of request. Thus said the Holy One Blessed be He to Avraham, “I have tested you with nine tests and you have withstood them. Now stand for me in this test, so that others will not say, ‘Those first ones had no substance.’”
What we have here is the <i>nimshal</i>, rewritten as an expansion of the biblical narrative. While this rewritten <i>nimshal</i> successfully explains that a request is being made by God, a great deal has been lost. Without the <i>mashal</i>, it is not clear that Avraham represents God in the world, and that his failure to withstand the test of the <i>Akeda</i> would have a negative impact on the status of God's name in the world. The <i>mashal</i> enables us to see that, on this reading at least, Avraham is not being tested in the ordinary sense of the word. According to the full text of <i>Tanhuma</i>, Avraham's ability to withstand the test is not in question here, nor is the test for his sake. The rewritten version of the midrash in which the <i>nimshal</i> alone appears would, in isolation, fail to convey this.
<b>(6) Reading the Midrashic Commentary Back into the Text: Explanatory Power and Spiritual Ramifications</b>
The task of reconciling difficulties and filling gaps forces us to look at the text of the <i>Akeda</i> with new eyes. The <i>mashal</i> form offers us a story that is similar to, but ultimately also different from, the story we have read so many times. God is a king, and Avraham is His mightiest warrior – that much is familiar and almost self-evident, but the discrepancies between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> tell us more.
The word <i>na</i>, so delicately inserted into God’s commandment to Avraham, is barely noticeable to most readers who are so familiar with this text. For the midrashic commentators, though, this word alludes to a relationship between God and Avraham that we might not otherwise have dared to envision.
As the <i>mashal</i> describes it, God’s relationship with Avraham is not only that of sovereign and subject, but also involves trust, love, and even “need,” in a certain sense. Reading the midrashic explanation back into the biblical text, we see that it has sufficient explanatory power to solve the interpretive difficulty raised by the use of the word <i>na</i> in God’s commandment to Avraham. Beyond that, however, and perhaps more significantly, it also challenges the reader to conceive of an almost unimaginable level of obligation and self-sacrifice demonstrated by Avraham in his relationship with God. By introducing the king’s generals into the <i>mashal</i>, the midrash further suggests the possibility of a more profound connection to God possible not only for Avraham, but for the reader as well, as a descendent of Avraham.
When we come to realize that the tests of Avraham and the king’s wars are one and the same, our reading of the <i>Akeda</i> is altered dramatically. And when we cease to see the <i>Akeda</i> as a comfortable and familiar text, and begin to understand it as a profound challenge, we can never again look at ourselves in the same way.

<b>The <i>Petihta</i>: Using a Verse to Interpret a Verse<br>The Passerby and the Fortress</b>
(<i>Genesis Rabba</i> on Genesis 12:1)
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Every ‘going’ is a movement and a distancing from where one is toward where one is headed, whether it is a physical movement…or a spiritual one</i>… (R. Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenberg, <i>Haktav ve-hakabbala</i> on Genesis 12:1)</span>
<b>The Unknown Avraham</b>
When we compare the beginnings of the Noah and Avraham stories (Genesis 6 and 12), we are struck by a puzzling incongruity. The text comments on God’s choice of Noah to be the saving remnant of humanity, but Avraham – surely the more pivotal figure – is virtually an unknown when we encounter him.
God’s selection of Noah is understandable because “… Noah found favor in the eyes of God,” (Genesis 6:8) and “…Noah was a righteous man, he was perfect in his generations; with the Lord walked Noah” (Genesis 6:9). In contrast, the opening verses of the Avraham story give us no motivation for God’s choice of Avraham. The only things we know about Avraham before God tells him to leave his father’s house are the names of his relatives, which are listed in chapter 11, and that he has left Ur of the Chaldees with his father. The omission is thought provoking. Clearly, there is a gap in the narrative fabric of the text.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Genesis 11:26–12:1 for a better appreciation of the midrashic discussion.</i>
The following <i>mashal</i> is one of many midrashim that seek to fill this gap and answer the question, “Why Avraham?”
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
And God said to Avram: “Go, you, from your land, and your birthplace and your father’s house to the land that I will show you” (Genesis 12:1).
<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 39:1 comments:
(1) <i>And God said to Avram: Go, you, from your land</i>...
(2) R. Yitzhak opened: (Psalms 45:11) ‘Listen, daughter, and see and turn your ear and forget your people and your father’s house.’
(3) R. Yitzhak said: This may be compared to one who was passing from place to place and saw a fortress (<i>bira</i>) illuminated/burning (<i>doleket</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The translation of the word <i>doleket</i> is discussed below.</i>
(4) He said, ‘Will you say this fortress has no governor (<i>manhig</i>)?’
(5) The master (<i>baal</i>) of the fortress peeped out (<i>hetzitz</i>) at him.
(6) He said to him, ‘I am the master of the fortress.’
(7) Thus, because our father Avraham would say, ‘Will you say this world has no governor?’
(8) the Holy One Blessed be He peeped out at him and said to him, ‘I am the Master of the world.’
(9) (Psalms 45:12) ‘And the king will desire your beauty’ – to beautify you in the world;
(10) ‘because he is your master and bow to him,’ that is, ‘And God said to Avram....’
<b>Translation Problems in Reading Midrash</b>
Here we encounter our first problem with translation, which is why two English alternatives for the Hebrew word “<i>doleket</i>” have been offered in line 3.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The classic commentaries on midrash differ on the meaning of this word.</i> Translation problems in midrash may arise for several reasons, and part of our interpretive task will be to determine which of them apply in our case.
In reading midrash, we need to remember that word meanings may have changed or been lost to us over time. Meaning loss is usually obvious because we simply find ourselves unable to translate words, but when the meaning of a word has changed, we may mistakenly assume we have understood something correctly. A case in point is the word “<i>bira</i>,” translated here as “fortress” (line 3).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Other possible translations of this word are “castle,” “beautiful building,” or “building complex.”</i> In the <i>Tanakh</i>, the word means “capital city,” but if we were to use the biblical meaning here, it would be misleading.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Also note that the word “<i>baal,</i>” translated here as “master,” could have been translated as “owner” (line 6). It might even be argued that “owner” is a better translation, at least in the <i>mashal</i>. In the <i>nimshal</i>, however, it would probably sound awkward as a description of God, at least to most English speakers. To translate the word “<i>baal</i>” one way in the <i>mashal</i> and another in the <i>nimshal</i> would be misleading, since the reader of the translation would assume, incorrectly, that the Hebrew text is using different words where it is not. Readers of the original Hebrew text, who are not forced to choose between translations for the word “<i>baal,</i>” enjoy the advantage of choosing the definition that best suits their understanding of the text while remaining aware that the same word is used in both <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>.</i>
In this midrash, we need to determine whether the word “<i>doleket</i>” meant “illuminated” or “burning” for R. Yitzhak, or whether he may have deliberately chosen an ambiguous word to create more than one possible interpretation of the text. Our choice of a translation for the word “<i>doleket</i>” will obviously have an impact on our understanding of the <i>mashal</i>, so we need to see whether any clues in the <i>mashal</i> itself can help us choose the best possible translation.
<b>(1) Structure of the Midrash</b>
Our first task, however, is to divide the midrash into its constituent parts. The midrash opens with a <i>dibur hamat’hil<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dibur hamat’hil</i> is perhaps best translated as “opening quote” and refers to the words from the biblical text that will be commented upon.</i></i> (line 1), followed by a <i>petihta</i> (a verse cited as an introduction to the midrash) from Psalms (line 2). The <i>mashal</i> is contained in lines 3–6, the <i>nimshal</i> in lines 7–8. These are followed by a concluding quote from Psalms which is broken in two and interspersed with R. Yitzhak’s commentary on it (lines 9–10).
The structure of the midrash is, thus, a <i>mashal</i> framed by verses from Psalms, which may be mapped as follows:
(1) the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> (line 1)
(2) the <i>petihta</i> (line 2)
(3) the <i>mashal</i> (lines 3–6)
(4) the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 7–8)
(5) the concluding verse from Psalms, with commentary (lines 9–10)
<b>(2) <i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
Our next step is to examine the story of the <i>mashal</i> in its own terms. The story describes a man who is passing from place to place when he comes upon a fortress which is either illuminated or burning. He asks about who is responsible for the fortress when someone looks out at him and identifies himself.
Even on a first reading, the story of the <i>mashal</i> poses a number of problems, quite apart from its translation. For one thing, given that the only characters named in the story are the passerby and the figure who responds to him, to whom is the passerby speaking when he poses his question? We cannot say that the question is addressed to the governor of the fortress since he is not visible, as we learn from his act of “peeping out” (<i>hetzitz</i>). Considering the passerby’s question further, we also note from its syntax that it is rhetorical (line 4): “Will you say this fortress has no governor?” These words are not actually a request for information. In context, this question functions as an assertion or a statement that expects a confirming answer. In fact, the question is probably best punctuated as: “Will you say this fortress has no governor?!”
The response to the passerby is also somewhat strange. Why does the figure who peeps out identify himself as the <i>master</i> of the fortress (line 5), if the passerby is asking about the <i>governor</i>? Looking ahead to the <i>nimshal</i>, we see that this distinction between governor and master is not just an authorial slip, because it is preserved in the <i>nimshal</i> as well (lines 7–8).
If we argue that the fortress is burning, and that the sight of it is what prompts the passerby to speak, why is he asking rhetorical questions while a fortress burns? In such a situation, we would expect an information-seeking question like, “<i>Where</i> is the governor of the fortress?” or “<i>Why</i> is the governor not putting out the fire?”
These problems might suggest that we could solve our translation problem by favoring the reading in which the fortress is illuminated.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">We will retain both possible translations because a case can be made for the “burning” reading. On this reading, the rhetorical question is an expression of shock that no one appears to be saving the fortress, a situation the passerby finds inconceivable. Although I obviously favor the “illuminated” version, I have yet to convince all the students in any given class that this is the best possible translation. Still, as several of the classical commentators on midrash take this position, it is difficult to discount.</i> But whether it is illuminated or burning, our original problem remains unresolved. Whom is the passerby addressing and what prompts his question?
<b>(3) Isolating the Elements</b>
Having noted several problems with the <i>mashal</i> as a story, our next step is to isolate the elements of the <i>mashal</i>, as follows:
one [a man]
who was passing from place to place
a fortress
illuminated (or)
burning
“will you say the fortress has no governor?”
the governor/master
peeping out
“I am the master of the fortress”
<b>(4) Matching the Elements</b>
Our next step is to draw correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>, a task that is somewhat complicated by both our translation problem, and the fact that the <i>mashal</i> is more elaborated than the <i>nimshal</i>. A preliminary attempt yields the following:
one / Avraham
who was passing from
place to place / -----
a fortress / this world
illuminated / -----
burning / -----
“will you say....” / “will you say this world has no governor?”
the governor/master / the Holy One Blessed be He
peeping out / peeping out
“I am the master....” / “I am the Master of the world”
<b>Filling in the Gaps</b>
As we can see, certain gaps in the <i>nimshal</i> need to be filled. The first is the absence of a parallel to the description of Avraham as a person “who was passing from place to place.” While this detail might be viewed as a simple description and not an actual gap in the <i>nimshal</i>, it may, on the other hand, be significant since midrashic discourse is generally very concise. After all, the text of the midrash could just as easily have said something like: “This may be compared to one who saw a fortress...” Furthermore, while the <i>nimshal</i> leaves a gap for this item, the biblical text supplies us with an element that corresponds to it very well. When we encounter Avraham for the first time in Genesis 11 he is, indeed, traveling from place to place, i.e., from Ur of the Chaldees to the land of Canaan. This detail might therefore be a device for connecting the <i>mashal</i> more tightly to the biblical text.
R. Yitzhak may, however, intend more than a reference to Avraham’s geographical wanderings. The <i>mashal</i>, quite possibly, is describing Avraham as a person who is in transition spiritually as well as physically – a person who is asking questions about God. This detail, if we have understood it correctly, would thus suggest part of the answer to our question about the gap in the Avraham story. On this reading, God might be choosing Avraham because he is a person who is not fixed in a rigid position, but open to other spiritual possibilities, “passing from place to place” in search of a different reality.
The next gap in the <i>nimshal</i> is the description of the fortress. If the fortress is the world, what does it mean to say that it is illuminated, or burning? There is nothing in the biblical text to fill this gap, so we must interpret this metaphor by asking what a “burning” or “illuminated” world might be. Perhaps we could say that an illuminated world is a world lit up with its own beauty and order, a world that shows every sign of being managed by a “Governor,” a God Who is running things. By the same token, a burning world is an ordered structure which is being destroyed by uncontrolled forces, such as human corruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These are the two approaches taken by the classical commentators.</i>
<b>The Passerby’s Question</b>
Having considered ways to fill the obvious gaps in the <i>nimshal</i>, we might, at this point, also examine why R. Yitzhak chooses a fortress as a metaphor for the world. This is particularly important in light of the passerby’s rhetorical question. Significantly, the passerby does <i>not</i> ask <i>if</i> the fortress has a master or builder since it is self-evident that a structure of such complexity could not have come into being by itself. The passerby is concerned with the issue of the governor’s<i> presence</i> in the fortress and, as we have already noted, the passerby’s words are less a question than an assertion that the governor <i>must</i> be present.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is, perhaps, further evidence that the correct translation of “<i>doleket</i>” is “illuminated” and not “burning.” It would seem unreasonable to assert the presence of a governor in a burning fortress. In fact, the governor might well be missing from a burning fortress. Why else would it be burning?</i>
The passerby’s rhetorical question is not prompted by the existence of the fortress, but by the state in which he finds it. If the passerby is contemplating an illuminated fortress, his words are prompted by his certainty that the fortress is inhabited. If the fortress is burning, the passerby is expressing his horror that no governor is coming to save it.
The <i>mashal</i> does not specify for us whom the passerby is addressing with his words, perhaps because that is less important than the nature of the question itself. By not specifying a listener, the <i>mashal</i> also leaves open the possibility that the passerby is, in fact, talking to himself.
<b>(5) Drawing Conclusions</b>
We could reasonably say, then, that R. Yitzhak views Avraham not as someone who questions whether or not God exists, or if He created the world, but rather as someone who, in contemplating the world’s existence, sees the presence of God in the world as the only rational hypothesis. This reading of the midrash is strengthened when we consider the language of the <i>nimshal</i>: “Thus, because our father Avraham <i>would</i> say...” (line 7). The use of the subjunctive (“would”) indicates repeated action in the past.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Compare, for example, the frequent use of the subjunctive in Ethics of the Fathers to indicate that the sayings of the various sages were their constant refrain.</i> R. Yitzhak is presenting Avraham as a person who repeatedly asserts the immanence of God – either to himself or to others – in a skeptical society which assumes that God has abandoned the world He created.
The role of the governor in the <i>mashal</i> reinforces this hypothesis. As we have noted, although the passerby has asked about the <i>governor</i>, it is the <i>master</i> who answers. His response indicates that there is no distinction between “governor” and “master”; the person sought by the passerby is one and the same. Translating this role into the <i>nimshal</i>, we can say that when God does reveal Himself to Avraham, it is as both Creator and immanent presence in the world. And, just as the governor of the <i>nimshal</i> “peeps out” from a place of concealment, God has been “hiding” in the world, waiting for an Avraham to whom he can reveal Himself.
<b>The <i>Petihta</i> and the Concluding Verses: A Frame for the Midrash</b>
The <i>mashal</i>, as we have understood it so far, enables us to fill the narrative gap in the Avraham story and answer our original question, “Why Avraham?” The answer appears to be that God chooses Avraham because Avraham has been searching for God, even before God reveals Himself to him. Since we are able to derive this message without reference to the <i>petihta</i> (line 2), we need to understand what the <i>petihta</i> adds to our understanding of the midrash.
<b>Going Back to the Source</b>
Our first step in understanding a <i>petihta</i> (or, for that matter, quotation of any biblical verse in a midrash) is to look at the verse in its original context. There are several reasons for this. First, the midrashic context in which we read the verse may radically change its original meaning, so that the simple sense of the verse is lost. If we don’t know the simple sense of the verse, we may not grasp the full significance of its use in the midrash. Second, the midrash sometimes quotes only part of a verse, or only one verse of several which we would need to know to understand the text. This might be due to scribal error or because the author assumes that we know the <i>Tanakh</i> as thoroughly as he does, and therefore takes it as given that we know the whole verse and its original context. Third, the author of the midrash may be alluding to words that do not actually appear in the quoted text but that we need to know in order to appreciate his intent. Finally, it is easier to notice difficulties in the quoted verse when we read it in context. If the midrashic use of the verse hinges on a difficulty in the verse itself, it is easier to pick this up in its original context (as we will see in the <i>petihta</i> and closing verse of this midrash). Whatever the reason for a partial quotation, we need to check the original source.
<b>A Confusion of Cause and Effect</b>
The two verses (Psalms 45:11–12) quoted by R. Yitzhak as the frame for our <i>mashal</i> are:
(11) ‘Listen, daughter, and see and turn your ear [to hear] and forget your people and your father’s house. (12) And the king will desire your beauty because he is your master, and bow to him.’
Verse 11 is easily understood, and the connection between verses 11 and 12 is straightforward within the context in Psalms. Psalm 45 is a love song in the style of the Song of Songs; it describes the beauty and virtue of a king and then exhorts the “daughter” of our <i>petihta</i> to become his subject. Like the Song of Songs, this psalm is an allegory in which the king is God, and the daughter is the servant of God.
However, verse 12, the concluding piece of the frame (lines 9–10), is harder to gloss when we read it in its original context since cause and effect seem to be misplaced. Because the verse, in its midrashic setting, is broken in two and interspersed with commentary, the illogical language of the verse is less readily apparent. We would understand the verse if it said, ‘Bow to the king because he is your master,’ or ‘The king will desire your beauty, and because he is your master you should bow to him.’ But the verse seems to be saying that ‘the king will desire your beauty <i>because</i> he is your master,’ surely an unexpected juxtaposition of cause and effect.
<b>Avraham as “Daughter”</b>
Now that we have seen these verses in context, we need to examine how the midrash employs them to convey its message. At first glance, the <i>petihta</i> appears to be echoing the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i>, i.e., Genesis 12:1. Like Avraham, who is commanded to leave his land, birthplace, and father’s house, the “daughter” of Psalms 45:11 is being told to forget her people and her father’s house. On the basis of this similarity, one might suppose that R. Yitzhak is using the source in Psalms as an allegory for the commandment to Avraham. After reading the <i>mashal</i> section of the midrash, though, the verse from Psalms resonates differently. Rather than an echo of God’s words to Avraham, it now seems to be an allegory for the actions the <i>mashal</i> ascribes to Avraham <i>before</i> God ever speaks to him, namely looking and listening for God. On this reading, Avraham, in his quest for God, has opened his eyes and ears to the possibility of God and abandoned his past, before God ever speaks to him.
The concluding lines (lines 9–10) which frame the end of the <i>nimshal</i> mesh well with this reading. R. Yitzhak’s reading of the phrase ‘And the king will desire your beauty,’ both exploits the difficulty we noted in the verse and removes it. His explanation is: the king (God) will [desire to] beautify you (Avraham) in the world, i.e., to make your beauty known to the world. The verses in Genesis which follow “<i>lekh lekha</i>” (go, you) correspond with this reading. In these verses, which follow the commandment for Avraham to leave his father’s house, God says (Genesis 12:2–3):
And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. And I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse, and all the families of the earth will be blessed in you.
<b>(6) Rewriting “<i>Lekh Lekha”</i></b>
Taking the framing verses and the body of the midrash together, we see that R. Yitzhak has reframed the story in Genesis 12 as follows: Avraham, the “daughter” in the <i>petihta</i>, seeks God, the “king” in the <i>petihta</i>, just as the passerby seeks the governor of the fortress. In consequence, God, the king of the <i>petihta</i>, desires that Avraham become a source of blessing to the world (‘to beautify you’). As a result, He reveals Himself to Avraham – just as the master of the fortress peeps out at the passerby – setting before Avraham a moral imperative to obey His commandment. That is the significance of the concluding words of the midrash: ‘because he is your master and bow to him,’ that is, ‘And God said to Avram...’ (line 10).
In R. Yitzhak’s view, then, God can only speak to Avraham as his Master if Avraham has made himself receptive to God by seeking Him out. The midrashic answer to our original question, “Why Avraham?” is that God chooses Avraham because Avraham has already chosen God.
When God wants to save the world from physical destruction, He picks Noah, because Noah is a righteous man who deserves to be saved. But when God is searching for the person who will carry his message to the world, He can only choose someone who himself yearns to bring that message to humankind. That person is Avraham, and God finds him because Avraham is searching for God.

Chapter 4; The Role of the Prooftext; The Lady and Her Attendants

<b>The Role of the Prooftext:<br>The Lady and Her Attendants</b>
(<i>Eikha Rabba</i> on Lamentations 1:1)
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>And now, hear this, o delicate one, who sits securely, who says in her heart, ‘I am and there is none like me. I will not sit a widow, and I will not know the loss of children</i>.... (Isaiah 47:8)</span>
Beloved, harlot, wife, widow, mother, daughter – all are metaphors for the Jewish people and for Zion. These metaphors are scattered liberally throughout the <i>Tanakh,</i> but are highly prominent in the Song of Songs and in Lamentations. <i>Hazal</i>, too, adopt feminine metaphors to characterize the Jewish people, often using the image of a lady of high birth (<i>matrona</i>) to chart the course of our relationship with God.
The <i>matrona</i> image is particularly appropriate in commenting on Lamentations since the image with which the book opens describes Zion as a desolate widow sitting in the ruins. The first verse is a poetic expression of grief, a cry from the heart: “How (<i>eikha</i>) did she sit alone, the city that was full of people…” (Lamentations 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Lamentations 1:1–9 to follow the midrashic discussion. I have opted for a translation that retains the feminine form of the verb from the Hebrew original since the metaphors used to describe Jerusalem in the first two chapters of Lamentations are largely feminine.</i>
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
<i>Eikha Rabba</i> 1:1 comments:
“<i>How did she sit (eikha yashva)</i>…”
(1) Three [prophets] prophesied using the language of “<i>eikha</i>”: Moshe, Yeshayahu, and Yirmiyahu.
(2) Moshe said, “How (<i>eikha</i>) can I carry alone…” (Deuteronomy 1:12).
(3) Yeshayahu said, “How (<i>eikha</i>) did she become a prostitute…” (Isaiah 1:21).
(4) Yirmiyahu said, “How (<i>eikha</i>) did she sit alone…” (Lamentations 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Jewish tradition, Yirmiyahu is the author of Lamentations.</i>
(5) R. Levi said,
(6) “This may be compared to a lady of high birth (<i>matrona</i>) who had three attendants (<i>shoshvinin</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>shoshvin</i> is a friend or agent/attendant of a bride or groom. Among the functions of a bridal attendant is to act as a chaperone.</i>
(7) One saw her in her serenity.
(8) One saw her in her recklessness.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to sexual indiscretion.</i>
(9) And one saw her in her disgrace.
(10) Thus, Moshe saw Israel in their honor and serenity
(11) and said, “How can I carry alone....”
(12) Yeshayahu saw them in their recklessness
(13) and said, “How did the faithful city become a prostitute....”
(14) Yirmiyahu saw them in their disgrace
(15) and said, “How did she sit alone....”
<b>(1) Structure of the Midrash</b>
Structurally, the above midrash is extremely simple. It may be mapped as follows:
(1) an introductory statement (line 1)
(2) three citations of the word <i>eikha</i> (lines 2–4)
(3) a <i>mashal</i> (lines 5–9)
(4) the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 11–15)
The simplicity of structure we see here is particularly marked by the repetitiveness of the paragraph as a whole. The <i>nimshal</i> echoes both the citations in lines 2–4 and the <i>mashal</i>, virtually word for word. And if we examine the <i>mashal</i> as a story, it too appears to be more like a list of events than a narrative. Beyond informing us that three prophets used the word <i>eikha</i>, it is hard to see, at first glance, what point the midrash wishes to make.
<b>The Interpretive Problem</b>
Line 1 tells us that this midrash is reacting to the word <i>eikha</i> in Lamentations 1:1, a relatively rare form in the <i>Tanakh</i>. The singularity of the word stands out here because it is the first word of the book, and because there is no obvious reason why the more common form (<i>eikh</i>) could not have been used in this context. Since the word appears in only a few places, it makes sense for the midrash to cite other contexts in which the word is used (lines 2–4). But R. Levi appears to take this exercise further by constructing a <i>mashal</i> around these three citations, with the apparent intent of linking them in a meaningful way.
<b>(2) <i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
The story of the <i>mashal</i> is very straightforward: A lady of high birth is accompanied by three different attendants through three stages in her life. The first attendant is with her during her tranquil years; the second attendant watches her as she succumbs to sexual temptations, and the third sees her reap the consequences of her actions. We are not told anything beyond this, such as why the woman has acted as she has, or what role the attendants play in her life during these periods. Nonetheless, the sequence of events described in the story is coherent and logical, and the outcome is predictable. We are perhaps frustrated by the story’s lack of detail, but have no difficulty understanding it.
<b>(3) Isolating the Elements</b>
Because the <i>mashal</i> is both short and simple, we are able to list the elements very easily, as follows:
a lady of high birth
the first attendant
her state of serenity
the second attendant
her state of recklessness
the third attendant
her state of disgrace
<b>(4) Matching the Elements</b>
Finding correspondences for the elements is similarly uncomplicated, since all the elements of the <i>mashal</i> are covered by the <i>nimshal</i>, as follows:
a lady of high birth / Jerusalem
the first attendant / Moshe
her state of serenity / the forty years in the desert
the second attendant / Yeshayahu
her state of recklessness / the sins of the First Temple period
the third attendant / Yirmiyahu
her state of disgrace / the destruction of the Temple
<b>Looking for Discrepancies</b>
In our discussion of the <i>mashal</i> genre, we noted that the interpretive and rhetorical power of a <i>mashal</i> resides in its ability to make us see the familiar in a new light by framing it differently. This <i>mashal</i>, however, does not appear to add anything new to our understanding of the word <i>eikha</i> and/or its use in Lamentations 1:1. If the point of this midrash were to list the appearances of a rare word in the <i>Tanakh</i> for concordance purposes, that task would have been accomplished in the first four lines of the midrash, with no need for the support of a <i>mashal</i>. Moshe, Yeshayahu, and Yirmiyahu all use the word, they are all prophets, and each prophesied at a different period in Jewish history. Beyond pointing out that prophets are like <i>shoshvinin</i> – hardly a major revelation – it does not seem that the <i>mashal</i> has told us anything new, or placed any of the facts we know in an illuminating relationship with each other.
<b>Checking Biblical Citations</b>
That is the impression, at least, until we examine the verses quoted by R. Levi. As we have suggested, it is always worthwhile to check biblical quotations in midrashim to ascertain whether they have been cited in full, and to see the plain-sense meaning of each in its original context.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See the discussion of biblical verses in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5.</i> The crucial importance of this exercise comes to the fore in R. Levi’s <i>mashal</i>.
The context of the first citation, Deuteronomy 1:12, is the opening of Moshe’s farewell sermon to the Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Deuteronomy 1 for context.</i> In the first chapter of Deuteronomy, Moshe explains how the people ended up wandering in the desert for forty years when they were originally intended to enter the Land of Israel immediately after receiving the Torah. Moshe begins by recalling the events that follow the giving of the Torah. In explaining why he appointed judges after this event, he says, “How (<i>eikha</i>) can I carry alone, your toil, and your burden, and your quarreling?”
When we consider this quotation in the framework of R. Levi’s <i>mashal</i>, we are struck by the discrepancy between the actual verse and the state of being it is meant to illustrate. This description of the Jewish people as too difficult and quarrelsome for Moshe to handle alone hardly fits the depiction of the children of Israel in the desert as a <i>matrona</i> at a tranquil time in her life.
This discrepancy is particularly significant because the other biblical verses cited by R. Levi perfectly match the circumstances they are intended to illustrate. Thus, in Isaiah 1:21, the city of Jerusalem is compared to a prostitute, corresponding with the image of the unfaithful <i>matrona</i> in the <i>mashal</i>. The full quotation of Lamentations 1:1 is similarly appropriate in the context of the <i>mashal</i>. It seems reasonable to conclude, then, that R. Levi’s use of the verse from Deuteronomy is not an oversight but a deliberate undermining of the <i>mashal</i>’s structure in order to convey a message.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shalom Carmy has pointed out to me that the identical verse from Deuteronomy is used with a different effect in the last few lines of <i>petihta</i> 11 in <i>Eikha Rabba</i> (Buber edition). There the verse is used to indicate a positive state of affairs, and contrasted with Lamentations 1:1 to underscore the punishment of the Jewish people. The radically different uses to which the verse is put in these two midrashic settings dramatically illustrate the role of context in interpretation.</i>
<b>(5) Allusion</b>
When we focus on the discrepancy between the verse from Deuteronomy and the image of a serene <i>matrona</i>, we can pick up on the irony with which R. Levi has constructed the <i>mashal</i>. The <i>mashal</i> describes the <i>matrona’s</i> first attendant as one who “saw her in her serenity” (line 7); the <i>nimshal</i> assigns that role to Moshe, as the prophet who “saw Israel in their honor and serenity” (line 10). After seeing the verse in context, the reader realizes that the words <i>serenity</i> (in the <i>mashal</i>) and <i>honor and serenity</i> in the <i>nimshal</i> should actually be written with quotation marks and read with a sarcastic intonation. In R. Levi’s reading, the “honor and serenity” of the Jewish people in the desert is anything but that. This ostensibly idyllic era is, in fact, the setting for the sin of the Golden Calf, the sending of the spies, and the demagoguery of Korah (to list just a few of the many transgressions committed during the forty years in the desert).
By constructing the <i>mashal</i> so that the verse from Deuteronomy appears to undermine it, R. Levi makes an important point about the use of the word <i>eikha</i> in these three places by these three prophets. He suggests that these uses of the word by Yeshayahu and Yirmiyahu are not coincidental; instead, they are allusions to its previous appearances.
In none of these cases is the word <i>eikha</i> used in the ordinary manner – <i>eikh</i> (“how”) – because none of them preface real questions. Each of its three contexts uses <i>eikha</i> as a rhetorical device for expressing emotion. When Yeshayahu asks in dismay how a faithful city has become a prostitute, he is echoing Moshe’s cry of helplessness in the face of the quarrelsome and stubborn Jewish people. In much the same way, when Yirmiyahu calls out in pain and horror at the destruction of Jerusalem, he is alluding to the cry and dismay of his predecessor Yeshayahu. The midrashic statement that these three prophets “used the language of <i>eikha</i>” in their prophecies (line 1), draws our attention to the link Yeshayahu and Yirmiyahu made between events they witnessed in Jewish history and stages preceding them.
<b>(6) Explanatory Power</b>
This connection here, though, is more than a case of literary allusion. It has explanatory power. The answer to Yirmiyahu’s rhetorical question about how Jerusalem could be destroyed lies in Yeshayahu’s description of Jerusalem as a promiscuous woman. Jerusalem was destroyed because a once faithful city prostituted itself. By alluding to this even in his initial expression of grief, Yirmiyahu, in effect, answers himself. Similarly, when Yeshayahu asks how Jerusalem could have deteriorated as it did, he finds his answer in Moshe’s <i>eikha</i>. The negative character traits of the Jewish people which led to the corruption of Yeshayahu’s Jerusalem were already present in Moshe’s time, and the seeds of destruction reaped by Yirmiyahu had been planted in earlier generations.
<b>Prophets as <i>Shoshvinin</i></b>
Interestingly, when we return to the <i>mashal</i> with this insight, the comparison of the prophets to <i>shoshvinin</i> takes on a new coloration. Above, we noted that the simplicity of the <i>mashal</i>-story is due in part to the absence of an explanation for the <i>matrona’</i>s behavior, and to the lack of interaction between the <i>matrona</i> and her <i>shoshvinin</i>. This part of the <i>mashal</i>, however, has no parallel in the <i>nimshal</i>. Unlike the <i>matrona</i>’s downfall which remains unexplained, the downfall of the Jewish people is all too easy to trace. And, unlike the <i>shoshvinin</i> of the <i>mashal</i> – who appear completely passive in the face of the <i>matrona</i>’s slide into disaster – the prophets try diligently to correct the sins of the Jewish people and prevent their doom. That is, after all, one of the important duties of both a <i>shoshvin</i> and a prophet.
One possible reason the <i>shoshvinin</i> of the <i>matrona</i> in the <i>mashal</i>-story are unwilling or unable to help her is that each of the three acts as her agent only at a specific, delimited time of her life. The <i>shoshvin</i> who knows the <i>matrona</i> during her sexually promiscuous stage was not with her during her stable, healthy period, and will not accompany her after this stage has passed.
In contrast to this, the prophets do have a frame of reference within which to maintain continuity in their individual relationships with the Jewish people. That frame of reference is the <i>Tanakh</i> and the continuity is maintained by language. Yirmiyahu, looking back at Yeshayahu’s struggles with the Jewish people, knows that they share a mission and a problem; Yeshayahu, recalling Moshe, knows the same. It is not really surprising then, that Yeshayahu and Yirmiyahu also look back into the past to find the words for expressing their strongest emotions of frustration, grief, horror, or pain.

Chapter 5; Engaging the Reader in Dialogue; The Servant in the Graveyard

<b>Engaging the Reader in Dialogue:<br>The Servant in the Graveyard</b>
(<i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on the Book of Yona)
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>One should always live in the Land of Israel…and not outside the Land…for all who live in the Land of Israel are like one who has God, while all who live outside the Land are like one who has no God.</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 110b)</span>
<b>“A Mystery Story”</b>
The famed <i>Tanakh</i> teacher, Nehama Leibowitz, described the Book of Yona as a mystery story. Her tongue-in-cheek comment strikes a chord with readers from the moment they encounter the first chapter. The story is characterized by so many critical gaps that it is nearly impossible to make sense of the narrative flow. A sample from the opening verses of the book amply illustrates this:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Yona Chapter 1 for a better understanding of the midrashic discussion.</i>
(1) And the word of God came to Yona the son of Amitai saying: (2) Get up, go to Nineveh, the great city and call out upon her, for their wickedness has risen up before me. (3) And Yona got up to flee to Tarshish from before God; and he went down to Yafo, and found a boat going to Tarshish, and he paid its fare, and he went down into it to come with them to Tarshish from before God.
Our familiarity with numerous biblical stories in which God commands and prophets obey leads us to anticipate a story different from the one we encounter here. We would expect verse 3 to read something like: “And Yona got up to go to Nineveh to call out upon her....” Instead, we are told, Yona flees from before God, going down to Yafo to board the nearest ship that will take him as far away as possible from God’s presence.
This sequence of events cries out for interpretation. Why has God sent Yona to Nineveh? Why doesn’t Yona want to go? How can Yona – divinely appointed, after all – possibly think that he can flee from the presence of God? Why does he seek out a boat and why is he headed to Tarshish, of all places?
As the story unfolds, numerous questions of a similar nature come to mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For example, why does God choose the extremely reluctant Yona, if he has many other, presumably willing prophets at His disposal? Why does Yona go to the hold of the ship in the middle of the storm? Why does he keep telling the sailors to throw him over the side of the ship – certain death under the circumstances? Considering that he is endangering their lives, why don’t they?<br>This list does not even exhaust the questions provoked by Chapter 1. Other questions emerge throughout this truly puzzling book.</i> Common to almost all of them is the sense that we are not being told the whole story, that we are missing critical information. For this reason, the various midrashic commentaries on Yona can be studied as model examples of the ways in which midrash often functions to render a biblical text comprehensible.
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
The midrash that follows from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> Yona 550<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> cites <i>Mekhilta d’Rabbi Yishmael Parshat Bo</i> as the source for this midrash. In comparing the original version of this midrash in <i>Mekhilta</i> with the version cited in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> which we are analyzing here, we should note the following points. First, the midrash on Yona cited in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> is part of a much longer midrash in <i>Mekhilta</i> dealing with the sanctity of the Land of Israel. Second, the version in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> appears to have been altered slightly from its form in <i>Mekhilta</i> so that it would be a more coherent commentary on the book of Yona in its new context. A comparison of the two sources reveals several small changes that serve to make the version in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> clearer and more explicit.</i> fills in information missing from the beginning of the story:
<i>And Yona got up to flee to Tarshish from before God</i>
(1) Was he [really] fleeing from before God?!
(2) Doesn’t it already say, “Where will I go from Your spirit, and where from Your face will I flee? If I go up to the heavens, there You are…” (Psalms 139:7–8).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The full quotation of verse 8, cited below in the text, is “If I go up to the Heavens, there You are; if I lie down in the grave (<i>she’ol</i>) there You are.” The pertinence of the whole verse to the effect of the midrash will become clear in the discussion below. This is yet another instance showing the importance of checking the original biblical citations in midrash.</i>
(3) And it says, “…the eyes of God move over the whole earth (<i>bekhol haaretz</i>)” (Zekhariah 4:10).
(4) And it is written, “In every place (<i>bekhol makom</i>), the eyes of God watch…” (Proverbs 15:3).
(5) And it is written, “If they dig down into the grave (<i>she’ol</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>she’ol</i> is difficult to translate. I have opted for the word “grave,” in keeping with Rashi’s translation of the term in Genesis 37:35. Note, however, that in his midrashic reading of the term, Rashi translates <i>she’ol</i> as <i>gehinnom</i> (Hell). The word is also sometimes rendered as “the Underworld” in translation, and various concordances translate it as “the world of the dead.”</i> from there My hand will take them…” (Amos 9:2).
(6) And it is written, “There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death (<i>tzalmavet</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This too is a difficult term to translate. It is usually understood to mean something like “gloom,” or “deep darkness.” I have translated it literally, in keeping with the targumic translations of the term, for reasons that will become clear in the discussion below.</i> [in which] to hide…” (Job 34:22).
(7) But rather, Yona said,
(8) “I will go outside the Land [of Israel] because the Divine presence is not revealed there,
(9) for the nations [Nineveh] are close to repenting,
(10) [and I do not want to go to Nineveh] so as not to convict Israel.”
(11) They gave a parable [that compared this]
(12) to a servant who fled from his master, a <i>kohen</i>, to a graveyard.
(13) He said, “I will flee to a graveyard, a place that my master cannot follow me.”
(14) His master said to him, “I have [other] servants like you.”
(15) Thus Yona said, “I will go outside the Land [of Israel] (<i>hutz la’aretz</i>)....”
(16) The Holy One blessed be He said, “I have [other] servants like you.”
(17) As it says, “And God cast a great wind on the sea…” (Yona 1:4).
<b>(1) Structure of the Midrash</b>
Our first step toward understanding this midrash is to divide the paragraph into its constituent parts. The midrash opens with a rhetorical question (line 1) and then proceeds to quote no less than five prooftexts (lines 2–6), before presenting us with a narrative expansion that is meant to answer the question (lines 7–10). The narrative expansion is followed by a <i>mashal</i> (lines 11–14) with its <i>nimshal</i> (lines 15–17), which appears to be a continuation of the narrative expansion. A mapping of the structure of the paragraph would thus look something like this:
(1) The <i>dibur hamat’hil<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> only in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> and not in the <i>Mekhilta</i>. See footnote 3 above.</i></i>
(2) The opening question (line 1)
(3) Five prooftexts (lines 2–6)
(4) The first part of the narrative expansion (lines 7–10)
(5) The <i>mashal</i> (lines 11–14)
(6) The <i>nimshal</i>/end of the narrative expansion (lines 15–17)
<b>Framing the Question</b>
The question with which the midrash opens in line 1 draws our attention to perhaps the most important interpretive difficulty posed by verse 3. How can Yona, the prophet, believe that it is possible to flee from the presence of God? The midrash employs a rhetorical question to express the difficulty. The form of this question has the effect of conveying incredulity, thereby calling upon the reader to provide the expected answer: “Was he fleeing from before God?!” Clearly, the answer we are meant to give is, “No, that simply cannot be.” Using a rhetorical question enables the author of this midrash to enlist us – or at least try to enlist us – in his assumption that Yona could not possibly be attempting to flee from God.
<b>An Excess of Prooftexts?</b>
The next section of the midrash (lines 2–6), the citation of five prooftexts, is somewhat unusual for two reasons. First, as we have noted, the rhetorical question with which the midrash opens seems to deny even the possibility that Yona is fleeing from God. Second, the omniscience and omnipotence of God are unquestionable in rabbinic thought. In light of this, the citation of even one prooftext for the idea that Yona cannot be fleeing from God seems unnecessary. Why, then, such textual overkill – five prooftexts where one should more than suffice?
<b>Creating a Dialogue With the Commentary</b>
To answer this question, we need to be aware that midrashic style is designed to draw the reader into a dialogue with the commentary. Midrash employs a number of devices to foster the reader’s interaction with the text. Two examples we have seen are the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>petihta</i>. The <i>mashal</i> creates discrepancies between text and commentary that the reader is forced to resolve, while the <i>petihta</i> provokes the reader to discover how a verse quoted from one biblical text can be a commentary on another. These two examples by no means exhaust the methods by which midrashic style actively engages the reader in dialogue, but they do indicate that this sort of engagement is pervasive in midrashic literature.
In the case of the midrash we are examining here, the multiple proof-texts are an example of yet another subtle, but rhetorically powerful tool for engaging the reader in dialogue – the anticipation of the reader’s presumed questions. For a full understanding of how this tool operates, we need to examine how <i>Hazal</i> use biblical verses in midrash.
<b>The Biblical Verse in Midrashic Discourse</b>
Readers unfamiliar with the conventions of midrashic literature are often confused when they see biblical verses cited in midrashim in violation of customary rules of logic, context, and/or chronology. Thus, the chronology of historical events may be ignored in the use of a verse as a prooftext. Or a midrash may have a biblical character quote a verse anachronistically – as when Yaakov answers Rahel with a verse from the book of Samuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megila</i> 13b.</i> Similarly, the quotation of a verse in the context of a midrash may distort or even cancel the plain sense of the verse as read in its original context.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For examples of this, see Chapter 15.</i> Small wonder, then, that inexperienced readers sometimes find <i>Hazal’</i>s use of biblical citations a haphazard enterprise.
This difficulty is best resolved by taking a number of factors into account. First, <i>Hazal</i> themselves drew a clear distinction between understanding the plain sense of the text (<i>peshuto shel mikra</i>) and use of the text as a springboard for creative homiletics (<i>derash</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, the statement: <i>ein mikra yotze midei peshuto</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 63a).</i> When they use biblical verses for the purposes of <i>derash</i>, <i>Hazal</i> are not confined to the categories of logic, chronology, or context that guide them in understanding the plain sense of the text. In midrashic use of verses, <i>Hazal</i> grant themselves a great deal of freedom because they assume an audience aware of the conventions of midrashic style. Readers who understand the difference between the plain sense of the text and its use in creative homiletics will not confuse the two. Aware of the distinction between <i>peshat</i> and <i>derash</i>, they are able to read the midrashic use of a verse in the right spirit, i.e., with an appreciation of the effect created by contrasting the plain sense of the verse and the innovative use to which it is put. Significantly, <i>without</i> a distinction between <i>peshuto shel mikra</i> and <i>derash</i>, midrash would lose much of its rhetorical power.
Another element which contributes to the freedom with which <i>Hazal</i> use biblical verses in midrash is the fact that the <i>Tanakh</i> is, in a very real sense, their vocabulary. <i>Hazal</i> quote biblical verses not only in order to lend authority to their interpretations; biblical verses, for them, are a natural mode of expression. Just as we use the words and textual heritage of our language to express ideas and form narratives, <i>Hazal</i> do so, using the building blocks of their language and cultural legacy, i.e., the biblical texts.
Moreover, <i>Hazal</i> clearly view the <i>Tanakh</i> as a self-interpreting text. This means that all of the <i>Tanakh</i> – especially <i>Neviim</i> (Prophets) and <i>Ketuvim</i> (Writings) – is a treasury of clues for the interpretation of other parts of the <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For an interesting discussion of how <i>Hazal</i> viewed the interconnectedness of the <i>Tanakh</i>, see Daniel Boyarin’s <i>Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash</i>. See also, Yitzhak Heinemann’s <i>Darkhei Haagada</i> for a discussion of <i>Hazal’</i>s use of biblical verses.</i> <i>Hazal</i> were conscious, both through tradition and on the grounds of internal evidence, that the <i>Tanakh</i> is a compositional text, divided into different books and composed by different authors at different times in history. As highly sensitive close readers of the <i>Tanakh</i>, they were keenly aware that the various books of the <i>Tanakh</i> make reference to one another both directly and indirectly. This awareness reinforced their perception that the parts of the <i>Tanakh</i> stand in a dialogical relationship with one another.
Finally, <i>Hazal</i> seem to assume that their audience is as familiar with the text of the <i>Tanakh</i> as they are. <i>Hazal</i> demonstrate an astonishingly complete command of the <i>Tanakh</i> and a capacity for close reading that verges on the miraculous. To fully understand their use of biblical verses in midrash, readers must, at the very least, check every biblical citation in context and make sure that they understand the plain sense of the text.
Returning to our midrash, we need to analyze it with two factors in mind. First, as we noted, the opening of the midrash (lines 1–6) has been structured in anticipation of our presumed questions. Second, bearing in mind our observation about <i>Hazal’</i>s use of biblical verses, we need to remember that the biblical citations in our midrash are being used in the service of the midrashic commentary. These citations will be critical in helping us get at the plain sense of the text in Yona, even if their use in the context of the midrash does not conform to the logic of <i>peshuto shel mikra</i>.
<b>A Dialogue With the Reader</b>
When we read the first six lines of this midrash as one side of a dialogue with an assumed reader, its internal logic becomes transparent. The midrashic author asks, rhetorically, “Was he fleeing from before God?!” (line 1) inviting the reader to agree that Yona could not possibly be doing so. He then offers a prooftext for the assumption implied by the question to pre-empt the imagined reader’s possible counter-assertion: “Why <i>can’t</i> we say that Yona was fleeing from God? Verse 3 says he was. Perhaps Yona believed he <i>could</i> flee.” The verses from Psalms (line 2) used as the first prooftext seem, at first glance, an adequate answer to this unspoken presumed question. In fact, read in the context of our midrash, they are almost a purpose-built answer, containing both a rhetorical question (“Where will I go from Your spirit, and where from Your face will I flee?”) and a powerful, inclusive image in answer (“If I go up to the Heavens, You are there, and if I lie down in the grave (<i>she’ol</i>), You are there”).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">I have quoted the full verse although it is not quoted in its entirety in the body of the midrash. See footnote 15.<br>Significantly, the theme of the chapter in Psalms from which these verses are taken is God’s omniscience.</i> The midrashic author implies, plausibly, that if we know the verses from Psalms (and the truth that they express) Yona surely does as well. Why, then, does he go on to offer the next prooftext?
To answer this question, we need to imagine a die-hard, skeptical, literal-minded reader who interprets the verses from Psalms not as a poetic description of the range of God’s power from Heaven to the grave with everything in between (which is, after all, the plain sense of these verses), but as a narrow and exact description of where God is, i.e., up in Heaven and down in the grave. Our imaginary reader might then argue that the verse claims God’s presence only for these places, and Yona, after all, has run neither to the heavens, nor to <i>she’ol</i>. Perhaps, our reader might argue, we can still claim that Yona believes he can run away from God.
In response to a possible narrow reading of the verse from Psalms, the author of our midrash offers the second prooftext, the verse from Zekhariah (line 3). This verse tells us that God’s eyes move over the whole earth (<i>bekhol haaretz</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The anachronism of the citation from Zekhariah need not trouble us here. <i>Hazal</i> assume that the presence of a verse in the <i>Tanakh</i> means that it is the expression of a universal truth to which Yona would have access without regard to chronology. Or, as we formulated it above, if we know the verses from Psalms and all that they imply, Yona, as a prophet of God, surely does too.</i> Once again, we might assume that this verse solves the problem, but the midrashic author anticipates his skeptical reader’s next objection: “Your prooftext tells us that one can’t escape God’s eyes <i>bekhol haaretz</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I have translated <i>bekhol haaretz</i> as “over the whole earth” in keeping with the plain sense of the verse in its original context (Zekhariah) and its intended use in the midrash. However, as our imagined skeptical reader might argue, <i>bekhol haaretz</i> can be translated as “over all the land” which would limit its meaning to dry land (as opposed to the sea) and would change it from the plain sense meaning of “everywhere.”</i> but <i>haaretz</i> literally means ‘the land,’ and Yona has run away to the sea. Perhaps Yona believes that he can escape God’s presence at sea.” To counter this objection, we are offered a third prooftext, from Proverbs (line 4) which asserts that God’s eyes are watching everywhere.
While this prooftext solves the problem of Yona’s presumed knowledge of God’s omniscience, one might argue that we are still left with the problem of divine omnipotence. Yona may indeed be convinced that God is <i>watching</i> “in every place,” but yet believe that God has power to <i>act</i> only in some places. The prooftexts offered up to this point talk about God’s spirit, His face, and His eyes. Our literal-minded reader might suggest that the biblical citations have proven only that Yona knows God’s <i>presence</i> is everywhere, but have not asserted His power. The next prooftext, from Amos (line 5), therefore responds to this presumed argument. Only part of the verse is cited in the body of the midrash, but the full verse, along with the one following it, offers a thorough rebuttal of our imaginary reader’s objections:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In offering the full quotation from Amos, I am operating on the understanding (discussed above) that the midrashic author not only knew the full quote himself, but also assumed that his audience would. In fact, the midrashic author may well have quoted the entire verse in his original commentary, while those who later repeated it, or later redactors, or scribes, may have abbreviated the quotation.</i> “If they dig down into the grave, from there My hand will find them; and if they will go up to the Heavens, from there I will bring them down. If they hide at the top of [Mount] Carmel, from there I will seek and take them; and if they hide from My eyes at the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and he will bite them.”
We might expect this to end the argument. One last location, though, remains for our skeptical reader. “Perhaps,” one might argue, “Yona knows that he cannot escape God as long as he lives, but believes that he can escape God if he dies.” In refutation, the midrashic author offers the proof-text from Job (line 6): Even in the shadow of death, one cannot hide from God.
At this point, we could reasonably ask why the midrashic author doesn’t simply pick the most convincing or inclusive of the prooftexts (the citation from Amos, for example) and offer that in answer to his initial question: “Was he fleeing from before God?!” What is gained by this extensive quotation of verses?
First, no single verse can provide an irrefutable answer to a skeptical reader determined to maintain that Yona is indeed fleeing from God. Only the cumulative effect of several verses can rebut such a position. Furthermore, as we noted above, the use of these verses creates a dialogue effect between the reader and the midrash. Equally important, however, is the repetition of certain motifs within the verses cited; this repetition prepares us to understand the <i>mashal</i> that follows the narrative expansion. We will return to this connection later in our discussion.
<b>The Narrative Expansion: Filling in the Gaps</b>
Turning to the narrative expansion portion of the midrash (lines 7–10), we can see how this section fills in the information missing from chapter 1 of the Book of Yona. Yona, the midrash tells us, is not fleeing from God, but rather from prophecy. Yona is aware that the people of Nineveh (the capital of Assyria) are on the brink of repenting their sins; he knows equally well from his experiences as a prophet to the northern kingdom of Israel, that the Jewish people are not “close to repenting.” If Yona goes to Nineveh and succeeds in persuading them to repent, the Jewish people will be “convicted” for their failure to return to God after the exhortations of many prophets. Rather than precipitate such a dire outcome, Yona decides to evade God’s prophetic message for Nineveh by fleeing the Land of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence Yona’s decision to go to sea – probably the quickest way out of the country for him – and the irrelevance of his destination. He is not going <i>to</i> Tarshish; he is simply going away <i>from</i> the Land of Israel.</i> since “the Divine presence is not revealed” outside the Land, and he will not be able to receive prophecy there.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For a somewhat different understanding of this midrash, see Abarbanel’s commentary on the book of Yona, chapter 1. He contends that Yona wishes to see Nineveh (the capital of Assyria) destroyed for its sins because he knows that Assyria will be the instrument of God’s wrath on the northern kingdom. If Yona is successful in his prophetic mission, Nineveh will not be destroyed and God will be able to use their military might against the Jewish people. To avoid bringing about this situation, Yona flees the Land and, thereby, prophecy.</i>
This narrative expansion is a persuasive account of Yona’s thought processes. He is not, as we might have supposed, foolish enough to think that he can escape God, and he is correct in his assumption that leaving the Land of Israel will allow him to avoid prophecy. Furthermore, his desire to avoid prophecy seems both noble and selfless, motivated by a wish to protect the Jewish people from the punishment they would surely receive if their behavior were compared with that of the Assyrians. Having understood this, we might ask why the midrash doesn’t simply end here. What does the <i>mashal</i> add to our understanding of the situation?
<b>The <i>Mashal</i></b>
To answer this question we need to analyze the <i>mashal</i> (lines 11–14). The story of the <i>mashal</i> is simple and recounted succinctly. The servant of a <i>kohen</i> wishes to escape from his master. Knowing that his master’s priestly status forbids him by Torah law from entering a graveyard, he flees there. In response to this, his master says, “I have [other] servants like you,” meaning that even if he, the master, cannot follow the servant into the graveyard, he has servants who can.
<b>(2) Problems With the <i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
At first glance, the story of the <i>mashal</i> seems straightforward, but a closer look shows us that this is not the case. Initially, the servant’s logic seems plausible, but we must ask why he has not considered the possibility that occurs to his master immediately, i.e., that the master can send others to pursue him in the graveyard. Is the servant a total fool, or is he so desperate to escape his master that he simply can’t think one step ahead? Furthermore, even assuming that the master doesn’t send other servants into the graveyard to bring him out, what is the servant going to do in a graveyard? A graveyard is for the dead, not the living. Leaving the graveyard means risking capture by his master, but if he stays there, he faces certain and lonely death by starvation. What does this servant think he’s doing?
<b>(3) Isolating the Elements of the <i>Mashal</i></b>
Moving on to the next step in our process of analyzing the <i>mashal</i>, we need to isolate the elements that comprise it. Given the simplicity of the story, it is not difficult to come up with a list that looks like this:
the servant
his master, the <i>kohen</i>
the servant’s choice of a graveyard
the graveyard
the master’s response
the master’s other servants
<b>(4) Matching the Elements</b>
Our next step is to match the corresponding elements of the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i>:
the servant / Yona
his master, the <i>kohen / </i>  / the Holy One blessed be He
the servant’s choice of a
graveyard / Yona’s decision to leave Israel
the graveyard / outside the Land of Israel
the master’s response / God’s statement, “I have other servants....”
the master’s other servants / God’s casting of a great wind on the sea
<b>(5) Drawing Conclusions</b>
A careful examination of the correspondences we have set up shows us that we are in the unusual position of having a <i>nimshal</i> that completely matches the <i>mashal</i> with no gaps. The correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> are, in fact, easily assigned. However, something critical to the narrative expansion has been completely ignored in the <i>mashal</i> – Yona’s motivation for fleeing his prophecy. This is somewhat surprising because we would be inclined to target this element as the most important aspect of the narrative expansion, given that it answers our question about why Yona has fled. Instead, this element is completely absent in the <i>mashal</i>. Since the <i>mashal</i>-story could have been constructed to provide the servant with a motivation for fleeing his master, it is hard to see why no such motivation appears. Rather than concentrating on the ostensibly most important detail of the narrative expansion, the <i>mashal</i> seems to focus on something secondary – the place to which Yona/the servant escapes. What has the <i>mashal</i> added to our understanding of Yona’s actions by reframing the narrative expansion in this way?
A preliminary examination of the correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> shows us that Yona, like the servant of the <i>mashal</i>, has not brought his analysis of the situation to its logical conclusion. While we may understand – and even admire – Yona’s desire to avoid being the instrument of God’s plan, his reasoning is seriously flawed. If God wishes to “convict Israel,” Yona’s flight cannot prevent this outcome. Either God will send another prophet to do Yona’s job, or God will somehow force Yona to return to Israel, receive his prophecy, and carry out his mission. The result, in any event, is unavoidable; Israel will stand convicted, and Yona will have accomplished nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It is also worth stressing that Yona ignores the primary reason that Israel will be “convicted” by Nineveh’s repentance – the fact that they themselves have not repented. If the Jewish people listen to the voices of their own prophets, nothing in the repentance of Nineveh need pose a threat to them.</i> Yona, like the servant of the <i>mashal</i>, appears to be acting on a strong emotional impulse that leaves little room for logic.
<b>(6) The “Graveyard” Motif</b>
The structure of this <i>mashal</i> seems to be telling us that Yona’s motivations are less critical to our understanding of his flight than other elements of the story. The <i>mashal</i> forcefully makes the point that a prophet’s abandoning the Land of Israel, thereby cutting himself off from prophecy, is tantamount to seeking death. <i>Hutz la’aretz</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Anywhere outside the Land of Israel.</i> is a graveyard for Yona. Nonetheless he chooses to flee there. Whatever his motivations, how can Yona act as he does? The inescapable conclusion is that Yona is, in fact, seeking death – that he would literally rather die, than fulfill his prophetic mission. This impression is reinforced when we re-read the five prooftexts in light of our understanding of the <i>mashal</i>. A recurring motif of these biblical citations is that one cannot flee from God to <i>she’ol</i> (the grave) and that even in the “shadow of death” one cannot hide from Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See the full quote from Psalms (line 2), the quote from Amos (line 5), and the quote from Job (line 6). It is important to note that the quote from Job – the last of the quotes, and the one that immediately precedes the narrative expansion – actually contains the word “death” <i>(tzal<b>mavet</b>).</i></i> Reading these prooftexts retrospectively, we suddenly become aware that they not only draw us into dialogue with the midrashic commentary, but also foreshadow the theme explored in the <i>mashal</i>, namely, Yona’s willingness to die in evasion of his prophetic mission.
The impression that Yona is seeking death is further reinforced throughout our reading of the book of Yona and, indeed, helps explain some of the most puzzling parts of the story. In Chapter 1, Yona’s descent to the hold of the ship to sleep in the middle of the storm and his willingness to be thrown overboard into a raging sea make sense only if Yona does not wish to live. Likewise, his two requests that God let him die (in verses 3 and 8 of chapter 4), clearly indicate that Yona would rather die than live.
The midrashic author of our <i>mashal</i> reads the first few verses of the book of Yona in light of that recurrent theme – Yona’s desire for death – and redirects our question about the motivation for Yona’s flight even as he answers it. The narrative expansion fills in the missing information by revealing what Yona has told himself, that he is fleeing the Land of Israel to avoid a prophecy that will be damaging to his people. But by framing this narrative expansion between the biblical citations and the <i>mashal</i>, the midrashic author also tells us that to answer this question is to understand only partially what is motivating Yona. In highlighting this aspect of Yona’s flight, the midrash illuminates not only the first few verses of Chapter 1, but the book as a whole.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">For another midrash that discusses Yona’s desire for death, see the continuation of the discussion of Yona in <i>Mekhilta d’Rabi Yishmael</i>: <i>Rabi Yonatan omer, lo halach Yona ela l’abed atzmo bayam....</i> In this connection it is also worth noting the midrash that identifies Yona as the child of the widow whom Elijah the prophet revived from death. See <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> Volume 2:250 on Yona which quotes the Yerushalmi <i>Sukkah</i> Chapter 5, <i>halakha</i> 1.</i>
Significantly, the author does not end the midrash with the <i>mashal</i>. The <i>mashal</i> is followed by a combined <i>nimshal</i>/narrative expansion (lines 15–17) which repeats part of the narrative expansion that precedes the <i>mashal</i>, but then goes beyond it: “Thus Yona said, ‘I will go outside the Land [of Israel]....’ The Holy One blessed be He said, “I have [other] servants like you.” As it says, “And God cast a great wind on the sea…” (Yona 1:4). The midrashic author’s intent is that God will not allow Yona to die, and will force him to fulfill his mission. The servants God employs will not replace Yona, but will be used to bring Yona back to the Land of Israel – and life – to receive the prophecy and deliver it. The ship, the storm, the sailors on the ship, and the huge fish that swallows Yona are God’s servants, instruments of His will, just as Yona will be. God will not allow Yona to die, and Yona will have to change from a person who seeks death and evades his prophetic role into a prophet who learns the lessons God wishes to teach him.

Chapter 6; Mashal as Dialectic; Questioning God About the Akeda

<b><i>Mashal</i> as Dialectic:<br>Questioning God about the <i>Akeda</i></b>
(<i>Genesis Rabba</i> on Genesis 22)
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Since a person’s actions are absolutely under his own control…a test is thus called from the perspective of the one being tested.</i> (Nachmanides, Commentary on the Torah, Genesis 22:1)</span>
<b>The Interpretive Problem</b>
One of the difficulties facing readers of the <i>Akeda</i> story is the challenge of reconciling God’s testing of Avraham with His omniscience. Trials and tests are used to determine something about the person or object being tested; implicit in the concept of a test is the uncertainty of its outcome. If one knows exactly what the results of a test will be, the test is unnecessary. Given that God is all-knowing, the idea that He would need to test someone for such reasons is not in the realm of possibility.
The first verse of the <i>Akeda</i> (Genesis 22:1) tells us that “…the Lord tried Avraham.” Early and later Bible commentators alike are troubled by the self-contradictory quality of this phrase. Why should an omniscient God test Avraham?
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
The two midrashic commentaries that follow (<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 55:2–3) offer a range of perspectives on how to approach the <i>Akeda</i>. The first of the midrashim (<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 55:2) reads as follows:
(1) “God will test the righteous, but the wicked, and he who loves violence, His soul despises” (Psalms 11:5).
(2) R. Yonatan said,
(3) “A flaxworker, when his flax is blighted, doesn’t beat it very much,
(4) because [if he beats it too much,] it splinters.
(5) But when his flax is [of] good [quality], he beats it a lot.
(6) Why? Because it improves, and continues [to improve, the more he beats it].
(7) Thus, the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked.
(8) Why? Because they cannot [with]stand the test, as it says,
(9) ‘And the wicked are banished like the sea…’ (Isaiah 57:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentators on this verse read the phrase “banished like the sea” as carrying the connotation of constant, restless motion. (See, for example, RaDak, ibn Ezra, and R. Yosef Kara.)<br>For the full quote and the implications of this prooftext in its midrashic context, see discussion below.</i>
(10) And whom does he test? The righteous, as it says,
(11) ‘God will test the righteous....”
(12) ‘And it was after these things, the wife of his master lifted up her eyes…’ (Genesis 39:7).
(13) ‘And it was after these things…’” (Genesis 22:1).
(14) R. Yonatan<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Genesis Rabba</i> 32:3 contains a different version of this midrash, as commentary on the Noah story. Among the dissimilarities is that the three <i>meshalim</i> appear in a different order from the one given here, and that R. Yosi ben Hanina – not R. Yonatan – is cited as the author of the linenmaker <i>mashal</i>. I have chosen not to address the issue of the discrepancy in attribution of the <i>mashal</i> because in this case, the authorship of the <i>mashal</i> is not critical to my analysis. Also, as I note in the introduction, I prefer to use standard texts (the kind likely to appear on the average Jewish bookshelf) unless circumstances require otherwise.<br>The version that appears in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 32:3 is of great interest in its own right. The ordering of the <i>meshalim</i> is particularly intriguing. In both versions, the three <i>meshalim</i> employ objects which form a natural hierarchy – inanimate (pots), organic (flax), and animate (cows), although their ordering in this paragraph does not make that immediately obvious. The hierarchical nature of the objects selected is much clearer if we look at the version of this midrash which appears in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 32:3. Nonetheless, I have chosen to analyze this version of the midrash – rather than the one in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 32:3 – because it is offered as commentary on the <i>Akeda</i>, a fact that has subtle implications for our analysis.</i> said,
(15) “The potter, when he checks [the contents of] his kiln,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As is clear from what follows, the potter is checking the pots, and not the workings of the kiln itself. See <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 32:3.</i> doesn’t check the defective pots.
(16) Why? Because he doesn’t get a chance to strike them even once, before he breaks them.
(17) And what does he check? Well-made pots,
(18) because even if he strikes them several times, he doesn’t break them.
(19) Thus the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked, but rather the righteous, as it says,
(20) ‘God will test the righteous.’”
(21) R. Elazar said,
(22) “[This may be compared] to a householder who had two cows,
(23) one strong, and one weak.
(24) Upon whom will he place the yoke?
(25) Not upon the one which is strong!?
(26) Thus the Holy One blessed be He tests the righteous, as it says,
(27) ‘God will test the righteous.’”
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
The first step in analyzing this midrash is to divide the above paragraph into its constituent parts. The structure of the paragraph is straight-forward. It opens with a <i>petihta</i> followed by three <i>meshalim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On a first reading, the placement of lines 12 and 13 is somewhat unclear. These lines might be read as part of the first <i>mashal</i>, as part of the second <i>mashal</i>, or as a comment inserted by the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i>. A glance at the commentaries on this midrash shows that many of them had manuscripts or editions in which line 13 is preceded by the phrase “<i>davar aher</i>” (another explanation), which clearly assigns line 12 to the first <i>mashal</i> and line 13 to the second. As we will see in the discussion below, this division is plausible.</i> The structure of the paragraph can be mapped as follows:
(1) the <i>petihta</i> (line 1)
(2) the first <i>mashal</i> of R. Yonatan (lines 2–12)
(3) the second <i>mashal</i> of R. Yonatan (lines 13–20)
(4) the <i>mashal</i> of R. Elazar (lines 21–27)
<b>The <i>Petihta</i>: Tests as a Sign of Love</b>
As we can see from the repetition of the <i>petihta</i> (Psalms 11:5) throughout the paragraph (lines 11, 20, and 27), this <i>petihta</i> will be important to our understanding of the midrash. The verse is interesting in its own right. Unlike many similar poetic verses, it seems at first glance to violate the conventions of biblical parallelism.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Simply defined, parallelism in biblical poetry is the tendency of poetic verses in the Bible to be made up of either matching or contrasting phrases which either reinforce or counter-balance each other. A good example of the “matching” type is Psalms 34:2: “I will bless God at all times; His praise is always in my mouth.” An example of the “contrasting type” is verse 11 of the same psalm: “Lion cubs are lacking and hungry; but those who seek God will not lack for any good.”</i> Biblical poetic style would lead us to expect the verse to read something like this: “God loves the righteous, but the wicked His soul hates,” or, perhaps, “God will test the righteous, but the wicked He will not test.” The intent of this verse is clearly to contrast, rather than compare, the righteous and the wicked. To do so, the “testing” of the first part of the verse is <i>opposed</i> to the “hating” of the second part of the verse. The testing of the righteous described in the first half of the verse must, therefore, be a sign of love. What this <i>petihta</i> shows us, then, is the direction the midrashic authors will take in understanding the <i>Akeda</i> and, by extension, all Divine trials. The three <i>meshalim</i> in this paragraph will describe Divine tests as a variety of painful experiences (a beating, a blow, a yoke). Nonetheless, we are undoubtedly meant to understand from the
<i>petihta</i> that whatever else a Divine test might be, it is <i>not</i> a sign of God’s lack of love for the person being tested, but the exact opposite.
This introduction to the midrash has rhetorical power because it compels readers to work out what the verse is meant to convey without explicitly stating the connection between the verse and the rest of the midrash. The <i>petihta</i> anticipates – and eliminates – an erroneous reading of the <i>Akeda</i>, i.e., that the <i>Akeda</i> is a punishment to Avraham or a sign of disfavor from God. This effect is created whether the reader gets the point of the <i>petihta</i> at the beginning of the midrashic discussion, or only after reading the whole midrash.
<b>The First <i>Mashal</i></b>
Having examined the <i>petihta</i>, we can now turn to the first of the three <i>meshalim</i>. The <i>mashal</i> describes the linenmaking process. For flax to be turned into linen, it must first be soaked till the hard outer covering softens, and then beaten so that the fiber fluffs enough to be spun into thread. The thread can then be woven to make linen.
The linenmaker of this <i>mashal</i> is shown in two situations. In the first, the flax is damaged and he is unable to beat it very much, because it splinters rather than turning into fiber. In the second scenario, the flax is of good quality, and the linenmaker beats it a lot, because the more he beats it, the better the result. The description in this <i>mashal</i> isn’t really a story; it just outlines the technicalities of linenmaking. As such, there is nothing odd or ambiguous about the <i>mashal</i> story, and we can move on to the step of listing the elements of the <i>mashal</i>.
<b>Isolating the Elements</b>
The elements of the <i>mashal</i> are as follows:
the flaxworker
blighted flax
the beating of the flax
the splintering of the flax
good flax
the improvement of the flax
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
The correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> are easily made. The first five elements are explicitly alluded to in the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 7–11), and the last element is virtually self-evident. The correspondences are as follows:
the flaxworker / the Holy One blessed be He
blighted flax / the wicked
the beating of the flax / tests / trials
the splintering of the flax / inability to withstand a trial
good flax / the righteous
the improvement of the flax / the improvement of the righteous
<b>Testing the Righteous or Not Testing the Wicked?</b>
Examining this mashal, our first assumption is that R. Yonatan is explaining the purpose of Divine trials as the improvement of the righteous person. The choice of objects used in the <i>mashal</i> bear this out. Even the finest flax is just a bundle of plant stems until it is beaten; only then can it be made into thread. The description of transformation from raw material to usable product implies that the purpose of a trial is to turn a righteous person into a more refined version of himself. And, indeed, at one level, the <i>mashal</i> may be understood this way.
But a closer examination of the <i>nimshal</i>, while it does not negate this reading of the <i>mashal</i>, shows us that the <i>mashal</i> is actually emphasizing something else. For one thing, R. Yonatan opens the <i>nimshal</i> by discussing the wicked, not the righteous: “Thus the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked” (line 7). For another, he offers an explanation for the fact that the wicked are not tested – and a prooftext for this explanation – while he simply asserts that God tests the righteous, without any explanation:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The prooftext cited in line 11 is a repetition of the <i>petihta.</i></i> “Why [are the wicked not tested]? Because they cannot stand, as it says, ‘And the wicked are banished like the sea....’ And whom does He test? The righteous, as it says, ‘God will test the righteous…’” (lines 8–11).
<b>Who Benefits?</b>
As we have noted, the explanation for the testing of the righteous is implicit in the correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>, and this explanation is definitely part of the message of the <i>mashal</i> as a whole. Nonetheless, two aspects of this midrash reinforce the impression that R. Yonatan is more concerned with explaining why the wicked are <i>not</i> tested than he is with explaining why the righteous <i>are</i>. First, on closer examination, the <i>mashal</i>/<i>nimshal</i> correspondence breaks down to a certain extent. While it is clear from the <i>mashal</i> that the linenworker beats choice flax to improve its quality, it is also obvious that his prime concern is not the positive effects on the flax – his true goal is to benefit himself. On the basis of the correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>, we concluded that the purpose of a trial is to refine the righteous person in some way, but the ultimate beneficiary of that refinement is left unspecified in the <i>nimshal</i>. And although any <i>mashal</i> breaks down if carried too far, we may reasonably pursue the possibility that here, at least, the breakdown is not merely coincidental. Perhaps R. Yonatan does not fully elaborate the refinement metaphor because he does not wish to deal with the question of who (or Who) ultimately benefits from the refinement of the righteous person. Equally possible, though, is that R. Yonatan does not bring the refinement metaphor to its logical conclusion in this <i>mashal</i> because his main concern is to explain why the wicked are not tested, rather than why the righteous are. After all, if Divine tests are a sign of love – as the <i>petihta</i> states – and, in a very real sense, an opportunity to attain a higher state – as the <i>mashal</i> implies – why are the wicked not offered this possibility?
<b>The Wicked Are Like the Sea</b>
The second aspect of the midrash that suggests R. Yonatan is concerned essentially with the wicked, and not with the righteous, is the prooftext from Isaiah (line 9). The full quotation reads as follows: “And the wicked are banished like the sea, for it cannot be still, and its waters cast up dirt and mud.” The pertinence of the verse to R. Yonatan’s point is clear – like the sea, the wicked “<i>cannot</i> be still.” They are not tested because they are incapable of being refined. Just as the sea throws out dirt and mud, and the blighted flax splits into useless fragments, the wicked can only respond to tests with failure. There is no point in testing the wicked. To do so would be a futile act of cruelty.
<b>The <i>Akeda</i> and the Testing of Yosef</b>
R. Yonatan’s first <i>mashal</i> concludes with a quote from Genesis 39 (line 12), the verse that introduces the story of the attempted seduction of Yosef by Potiphar’s wife. Both the attempted seduction and its subsequent disastrous consequences for Yosef can easily be seen as a Divine trial. By placing the story of Potiphar’s wife in the context of the <i>mashal</i> of the linenmaker, R. Yonatan implies that the purpose of Yosef’s test is to refine and elevate him. And, by juxtaposing this verse with the <i>dibur ha-mat’hil</i> of the next <i>mashal</i>, the redactors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> draw our attention to the elements common to the <i>Akeda</i> and the story of Potiphar’s wife. Both stories open with the phrase “And it was after these things…” and both stories, for all their narrative differences, describe the test of a righteous person.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In drawing our attention to the similarity between the opening phrases of the <i>Akeda</i> and the story of Potiphar’s wife, the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> indicate that the similarity is intentional, i.e., that the text foreshadows and underlines the nature of Yosef’s test by using a phrase that alludes to the <i>Akeda</i>. Mentioning Yosef’s test in connection with the <i>Akeda</i> underlines that the tests of the righteous may take widely divergent forms and come at different stages of life. Avraham’s trial is the test of his faith in old age; Yosef’s involves a young man’s steadfastness and fear of God in the face of sexual temptation. Nonetheless, the biblical text draws a parallel between these situations, and the midrashic authors pick up on that. Here, again we see the sensitivity with which <i>Hazal</i> read the biblical text and show the stylistic and thematic connections in it.</i>
We have seen that although R. Yonatan’s first <i>mashal</i> is primarily concerned with the reasons the wicked do not undergo Divine trials, the <i>mashal</i> also offers an explanation for the Divine trials of the righteous. The next <i>mashal</i>, however, greatly reinforces our impression that R. Yonatan is more interested in explaining the non-testing of the wicked than the testing of the righteous.
<b>The Second <i>Mashal</i></b>
This second <i>mashal</i> (lines 14–20) describes a potter checking the contents of his kiln. As is clear from line 18, checking the pots involves striking them. The potter can strike well-made pots several times, because they will not break under the blows, but he does not strike defective pots even once because the slightest touch breaks them.
<b><i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
An examination of this <i>mashal</i> as a story shows that it is even sketchier than the <i>mashal</i> of the linenmaker, perhaps intentionally so. Here the motivation for striking the pots is completely unclear, given that the potter already knows which pots are defective and which are well made. R. Yonatan could easily have constructed the <i>mashal</i> so that the potter was seen striking the pots in order to demonstrate their quality to potential customers. Or, he might have suggested that the potter strikes the pots to determine their usability. But the <i>mashal</i> as it stands does not offer even a hint of such possibilities. The potter strikes the pots that are well made, and does not touch the defective pots.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Some of the commentaries on <i>Genesis Rabba</i> suggest that in striking the good pots, the potter takes pride in their quality, affirming to himself that the job has been done well. (See, for example, the commentary Yefe Toar in the Vilna edition of <i>Genesis Rabba</i>. For a related but somewhat different approach, see the Netziv (<i>Haamek Davar</i>) on Genesis 22:1, <i>dibur hamat’hil “Ve-haElokim nisa et Avraham.”</i>) On this reading, a Divine test would have the purpose of demonstrating the righteousness of the righteous and, by extension, sanctifying God’s name in the world. Such a reading is eminently plausible as an explanation for the purpose of Divine tests and, indeed, appears explicitly in other midrashic sources. (See, for example, <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 55:1. The <i>mashal</i> of the king and the warrior from <i>Tanhuma</i>, analyzed in Chapter 2, may also be read this way.) Nonetheless, I find this interpretation somewhat difficult to reconcile with this particular <i>mashal</i> since there appears to be no audience – or explanation – for the potter’s actions in the <i>mashal</i> story, and it fails to account for the focus on the wicked in the <i>nimshal</i>.</i>
<b>Isolating the Elements</b>
Having examined the <i>mashal</i> as a story, we can list the elements of the <i>mashal</i>, as follows:
the potter
defective pots
well-made pots
the checking/striking of the pots
the breaking of the defective pots<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It would be more accurate to label this element “the potential breaking of the defective pots” since the defective pots are not actually checked, and therefore not actually broken in the <i>mashal</i>, but for the sake of brevity, the element is listed as above.</i>
the endurance of the well-made pots
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
The <i>nimshal</i> offers correspondences for only the first four elements of the <i>mashal</i>, but the last two are easily supplied even without recourse to the previous <i>mashal</i>, although the parallels (and the contrasts) to the previous <i>mashal</i> are clear:
the potter / the Holy One blessed be He
defective pots / the wicked
well-made pots / the righteous
the checking/striking of the pots / a Divine test
the breaking of the defective pots / the inability of the wicked to
withstand the test
the endurance of the well made pots / the ability of the righteous to
withstand the test
<b>Drawing Conclusions</b>
Lining up the elements and their correspondences in this way highlights a number of significant points, especially if we compare this second <i>mashal</i> to R. Yonatan’s first <i>mashal</i>. Like the first one, this <i>mashal</i> tells us that a Divine test is a blow, something painful to be endured. However, while the first <i>mashal</i> offers an explanation for the trials of the righteous, i.e., their refinement, this <i>mashal</i> seems to say that the righteous are tested simply because they can withstand the test. Even if we are <i>not</i> meant to conclude that the righteous are tried for this reason, no other reason is offered. More significant, however, is the focus in the <i>nimshal</i> – as in the previous <i>mashal –</i> on the wicked rather than the righteous. In this <i>mashal</i>, R. Yonatan offers no explanation whatsoever for the testing of the righteous. Here, even more than in the first <i>mashal</i>, his primary concern is to explain why the wicked are <i>not</i> tested. R. Yonatan’s message may be that while the exclusion of the wicked from Divine trials is easily explained, the testing of the righteous is a far more complex matter. No single, universal explanation can account for it.
Significantly, R. Yonatan’s second <i>mashal</i> is preceded by a <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> from the <i>Akeda</i>, although his first <i>mashal</i> is not. This might indicate that R. Yonatan feels able to offer an explanation for Divine trials of the type undergone by Yosef, but is uneasy doing so for the <i>Akeda</i>. Faced with the mystery and awesomeness of the <i>Akeda</i>, one might well conclude that it is not really susceptible to explanation, and that any attempt at explanation is of necessity superficial. Perhaps R. Yonatan wishes to imply that while trials like that of Yosef can be understood, the <i>Akeda</i> cannot. If so, we can only hope to eliminate the possible misreading of Avraham’s greatest trial as a punishment from God or a sign of His disfavor.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Even on the assumption that the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> is the redactors’ addition, rather than R. Yonatan’s, the point remains.</i> Thus, although R. Yonatan’s first <i>mashal</i> focuses on the wicked, he also offers an explanation for the trials of the righteous. In the second <i>mashal</i>, he makes no such attempt at explanation.
<b>The Third <i>Mashal</i></b>
In the last <i>mashal</i> of the paragraph (lines 21–27), R. Elazar describes a situation in which the owner of two cows needs to place a yoke upon one of them so that it can carry out some task for him. Given the choice between the strong cow and the weak one, the householder naturally will choose the strong one, i.e., the one better able to bear the burden.
<b>Isolating the Elements</b>
Like the previous two <i>mashal</i> stories, this <i>mashal</i> story is very simple, posing no problems requiring resolution. Moving on to the elements, we are able to list them as follows:
a householder
the strong cow
the weak cow
the yoke
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
The correspondences of the elements are also easily made as follows:
a householder / the Holy One blessed be He
the strong cow / the righteous
the weak cow / the wicked
the yoke / a Divine test
<b>R. Elazar vs. R. Yonatan</b>
R. Elazar’s understanding of the nature of Divine trials differs significantly from R. Yonatan’s. First, R. Elazar represents the Divine trial not as a blow to be endured, but as a burden to be borne. Although, as we have seen, the blows to the flax have a purpose, it is not clear that the blows to the pots do. A yoke, we could say, is virtually by definition employed for some reason. One does not affix a yoke to an animal unless there is some task it must accomplish or some burden it must bear. R. Elazar sees Divine trials as intrinsically purposeful.
It also seems clear that R. Elazar is more interested in understanding why the righteous are tested than in explaining why the wicked are not. This can be seen from the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 26–27), which does not even mention the wicked. Indeed, R. Elazar’s lack of interest in the wicked here is a natural extension of his views on Divine trials. He interprets such trials as divinely ordained tasks that need to be accomplished rather than as tests of endurance. If the focus is the task, then the best person for the job will be chosen, namely, the righteous person. This perspective on Divine trials also helps us understand why the wicked person is not chosen, but that is a by-product of the investigation, not its purpose.
R. Yonatan’s portrayal of a Divine trial as having the purpose of refinement (in the linenmaking <i>mashal</i>) implies that the righteous person who has not yet experienced such a trial is flawed in some way. R. Elazar’s reading involves no such implication. On the contrary, the righteous person of his <i>mashal</i> is spiritually strong, capable of bearing whatever burden God places upon him. Seen in this way, a Divine trial might even be considered an honor.
Finally, and significantly, R. Elazar chooses animate beings to portray the righteous and the wicked in his <i>mashal</i> story. Both, in R. Yonatan’s <i>meshalim</i>, are represented by inanimate objects. The effect of this is to raise a number of disturbing questions about the nature of the relationship between the actors and the acted upon in his <i>mashal</i> stories.
<b>Free Will and the Ordering of the Midrash</b>
Rabbinic thought stresses that free will is central to Judaism. Yet both the <i>mashal</i> of the potter and, to a lesser extent, the <i>mashal</i> of the linenmaker seem to describe the wickedness of the wicked and the righteousness of the righteous as a given. The linenmaker has no control over the quality of the flax he works with, but neither does the flax choose to be blighted or healthy. The case of the potter is even more problematic since, after all, the potter is ultimately responsible for the quality of the pots he has made.
It seems highly unlikely that R. Yonatan wants us to conclude that some people are created wicked by God (making them unable to withstand tests) while others are simply born righteous (enabling them to withstand tests). Far more plausible is the idea that R. Yonatan expects us to take the <i>mashal</i> only so far. And, as we have noted, it is self-evident that every <i>mashal</i> breaks down if taken too far. But it is conceivable that the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> order the paragraph as they do so that we read R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i> last, since this sort of theological problem is less likely to arise in a <i>mashal</i> which describes autonomous beings rather than inanimate objects. By concluding the paragraph in this way, the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> can mitigate mistaken impressions about free will that might have been produced by the first two <i>meshalim</i>.
<b>Human Dignity and the Divine Trial</b>
As we have seen, of the three <i>meshalim</i> here dealing with the nature of Divine trials, R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i> of the cows and the householder is the most comforting and the one that most preserves human dignity. This is by virtue of its focus on the righteous and through the choice of objects used in the <i>mashal</i> story. R. Elazar sees the righteous person as worthy rather than needing refinement, and he sees Divine tests as purposeful. Midrashic editors tend to move from pessimism to optimism in their ordering of midrashic commentary. Here, too, the text moves from a somewhat dark portrayal of Divine tests toward a more uplifting way of viewing them.
<b>The Second Midrashic Commentary: R. Avin’s <i>Mashal</i></b>
In studying midrash, it is valuable to bear in mind that while individual midrashic teachings can be studied profitably in isolation, there is also much to be gained by looking at how redactors of midrashic texts organized them.
The second midrashic commentary we will analyze here (<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 55:3), follows immediately upon the three <i>meshalim</i> we have examined. This suggests that the redactors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> saw this <i>mashal</i> as pertinent to the issues raised in the previous <i>meshalim.</i> Like them, the <i>mashal</i> discussed below deals with the problem raised by the notion of a Divine test. Unlike the previous three <i>meshalim</i>, though, it does not address the question in general terms. Instead, this midrash tackles the specifics of the <i>Akeda</i> and addresses them directly, as follows:
(1) Another explanation:
(2) “God will test the righteous” – this is Avraham.
(3) “And it was after these things, and the Lord tested Avraham.”
(4) R. Avin opened [with these words]:
(5) “For the word of a king is sovereign, and who will say to him, ‘What will you do?’” (Ecclesiastes 8:4).
(6) R. Avin said,
(7) ‘This may be compared to a <i>Rav<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “teacher.” I have used the term <i>Rav</i>, because it carries a connotation of authority not conveyed by the word “teacher.” In line 17, I have translated <i>rabi</i> as “my master” for that reason.</i></i> who commands his <i>talmid<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“Student.” This word is often translated as “disciple.” I have opted for leaving the term <i>talmid</i> in the original Hebrew, rather than translating it, for much the same reason I used the term <i>Rav</i> in the same line. <i>Talmid</i> connotes a sense of obligation, respect, and even dependence somewhat lost in the term “student.”</i></i> and says to him,
(8) “Do not subvert judgment” (Deuteronomy 16:19),
(9) and [yet] he [himself] subverts judgment.
(10) [He tells his <i>talmid</i>,] “Do not favor someone [in judgment]” (ibid),
(11) and [yet] he [himself] favors someone [in judgment].
(12) [He tells his <i>talmid</i>,] “Do not take bribes” (ibid),
(13) and [yet] he [himself] takes bribes.
(14) [He tells his <i>talmid</i>,] “Don’t lend money with interest,”
(15) and [yet] he [himself] lends money with interest.
(16) His <i>talmid</i> said to him,
(17) “My master, you tell me, ’Don’t lend money with interest, and you lend money with interest?!’
(18) For you it is permitted, and for me it is forbidden?!”
(19) He said to him,
(20) “I tell you, ‘Don’t lend money with interest to an Israelite, but lend money with interest to a pagan,’
(21) as it says, “From a stranger you may take interest, from your brother, you may not take interest” (Deuteronomy 23:21).
(22) Thus Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(23) “Master of the worlds, You wrote in Your Torah,
(24) ‘Do not take revenge and do not bear a grudge’ (Leviticus 19:18).
(25) And [yet] you take revenge and bear a grudge,
(26) as it says, “God is vengeful and a master of wrath; He takes revenge against His rivals, and bears a grudge against His enemies” (Nahum 1:2).
(27) The Holy One blessed be He said to them,
(28) “I wrote in the Torah, “Do not take revenge and do not bear a grudge against the children of your people,”
(29) but I take revenge and bear a grudge against those who worship the stars,
(30) [as it says,] ‘Avenge the vengeance of the children of Israel…’ (Numbers 31:2).”
(31) It is written, “Do not test God…” (Deuteronomy 6:16).
(32) “And the Lord tested Avraham.”
<b>Structure of the Paragraph</b>
The first step in analyzing this midrash is to divide the paragraph into its constituent parts. The lion’s share of the paragraph is made up of a <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> (lines 6–30), but there are a number of introductory comments that contextualize the <i>mashal</i> within the <i>Akeda</i>, and connect the paragraph to the midrash that precedes it (lines 1–4). The paragraph also concludes with two quotations following the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 31–32), forming a coda to the midrash as a whole. The paragraph can be mapped as follows:
(1) an introductory comment that links this paragraph to the previous one (line 1)
(2) a repetition of the <i>petihta</i> used in the previous midrash (line 2)
(3) a quote from the opening of the <i>Akeda</i> (line 3)
(4) the <i>petihta</i> of the <i>mashal</i> (lines 4–5)
(5) the <i>mashal</i> (lines 6–21)
(6) the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 22–30)
(7) a quote from Deuteronomy (line 31)
(8) a repetition of the quote from the opening of the <i>Akeda</i> in line 3 (line 32)
Lines 1 and 2 of the midrash prepare us for another explanation of the <i>petihta</i> that has been repeated throughout the previous paragraph, an explanation linking it directly to the <i>Akeda</i>. The quote from the <i>Akeda</i> in line 3 reinforces this, and also serves as a <i>dibur ha-mat’hil</i> for the <i>mashal</i> that follows.
<b>Understanding the <i>Petihta</i></b>
At first glance, the <i>petihta</i> (line 5) introducing the <i>mashal</i>/<i>nimshal</i> section of the midrash, seems unconnected to the <i>mashal</i> that follows. The plain sense of the verse is that the word of a king has the force of absolute law and that a king’s actions are unquestionable.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, Ibn Ezra on this verse. He, like other commentators on the verse, reads “king” as referring not only to human kings, but also by extension to God.</i> As part of a commentary on the <i>Akeda</i>, this verse seems to imply that we have no right to question the story or seek explanations for the contradictions implicit in God’s testing of Avraham. The <i>mashal</i> which follows this <i>petihta</i>, however, doesn’t match this approach to the <i>Akeda</i>. It presents us with a situation in which asking questions is the norm – an exchange between a <i>Rav</i> and <i>talmid</i>.
<b><i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
The dissonance created by the incongruity of the <i>petihta</i> to the <i>mashal</i> is intensified when we examine the <i>mashal</i> story. The <i>mashal</i> describes a <i>Rav</i> in the process of teaching his <i>talmid</i> a number of prohibitions from the Torah. Three of the prohibitions are found in one verse (Deuteronomy 16:19) and relate to proper judicial conduct: a judge is forbidden to subvert justice; he may not favor one participant in the proceedings over another; and he is forbidden to take bribes. The last <i>mitzvah</i> the <i>Rav</i> teaches is the prohibition against lending money with interest, which appears in a different verse in Deuteronomy. The <i>mashal</i> then goes on to say that the <i>Rav</i> himself violates all the prohibitions he has taught his student. The student, disturbed by the contradiction between the <i>Rav</i>’s teachings and his actions, challenges the <i>Rav</i> for having taken interest for money loaned. The master defends his actions by telling his disciple that the prohibition applies only to money lent to a fellow Jew, but not to a loan made to a non-Jew. This defense is buttressed with a prooftext – the verse in Deuteronomy (23:21) in which the distinction is made.
Even without reference to its <i>nimshal</i>, the <i>mashal</i> story is highly problematic and gives rise to a number of questions. The first difficulty relates to the figure of the <i>Rav</i> in the <i>mashal</i>. The <i>Rav-talmid</i> relationship is nearly sacrosanct in rabbinic literature and a <i>Rav</i> is generally conceived of as an awe-inspiring authority figure of great morality and virtue. The hypocritical <i>Rav</i> of this <i>mashal</i> story completely violates this convention. Furthermore, the reader of this story cannot help but be frustrated by the fact that the <i>talmid</i> doesn’t challenge his teacher about his flagrant violations of proper judicial conduct. The <i>Rav</i> would clearly have no response to such charges. The only violation of Torah law that the <i>talmid</i> raises – the prohibition against taking interest on a loan – is not actually a transgression, as the <i>Rav</i> is easily able to prove. Indeed, the reader might argue that had the <i>Rav</i> taught the <i>talmid</i> properly, the <i>talmid</i> would have seen for himself that no transgression had taken place. The reader of this <i>mashal</i> story is left both disturbed and confused.
This feeling of disorientation is increased by the juxtaposition of the <i>mashal</i> story with the <i>petihta</i>. As we have pointed out, the <i>petihta</i> has prepared us to expect a <i>mashal</i> about a king, but the <i>mashal</i>-story that follows is about a <i>Rav</i> and <i>talmid</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Convention inclines us to expect a <i>mashal</i> about a king in any event, since the vast majority of <i>meshalim</i> about God are of this type. There are, of course, other figures that represent God in <i>meshalim</i>, among them, father, <i>kohen</i> and, indeed, <i>Rav</i> – but the king-figure is the most typical. As we have noted, the <i>petihta</i> would seem to make the choice of the king-figure a foregone conclusion.</i> The reader is left wondering how to connect the disparate parts of the midrash.
<b>Isolating the Elements</b>
Our next step in understanding this <i>mashal</i> is to isolate its elements:
the <i>Rav</i>
the <i>talmid</i>
the prohibition against subverting judgment
the <i>Rav’</i>s violation of this prohibition
the prohibition against favoring someone in judgment
the <i>Rav’</i>s violation of this prohibition
the prohibition against taking bribes
the <i>Rav’</i>s violation of this prohibition
the prohibition against taking interest on a loan
the <i>Rav’</i>s (apparent) violation of this prohibition
the <i>talmid’</i>s question (“For you it is permitted and for me it is forbidden?!”)
the <i>Rav’</i>s answer (lines 20–21)
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
Before we begin finding correspondences for the elements of the <i>mashal</i>, we should note that our listing of the elements shows us yet another odd feature of this midrash. Rather than compressing the elements of the <i>mashal</i> story, R. Avin draws them out. The first three prohibitions quoted in the story all originate from the same verse in Deuteronomy. In light of the generally concise nature of the <i>mashal</i> form, we might have expected them to be lumped together both in the <i>Rav</i>’s lesson to his <i>talmid</i>, and in his transgression of them. However, the <i>mashal</i> story is constructed so that this is not the case. Instead, each prohibition is listed separately, as is each violation of the prohibition by the <i>Rav</i>. This has the effect of drawing the reader’s attention to a significant gap. A large portion of the <i>mashal</i> has no correspondences in the <i>nimshal</i>, as can be seen in the listing that follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Our use of the methodology outlined in Chapter 2 makes this graphically apparent. One might argue it is the methodology that produces this effect, rather than it being a property of the <i>mashal</i> itself. I contend, though, that the gaps would still be noticeable, even if the elements of the <i>mashal</i> were heard or read, rather than written down. The effect is created because the verse from Deuteronomy is quite deliberately broken up and stretched out – this despite the fact that all the prohibitions in it are organically related and could have easily been conflated or even just listed serially.</i>
the <i>Rav / </i>the Holy One blessed be He
the <i>talmid / </i>Israel
the prohibition against subverting
judgment / -----
the <i>Rav’</i>s violation of this prohibition / -----
the prohibition against favoring
someone in judgment / -----
the <i>Rav’</i>s violation of this prohibition / -----
the prohibition against taking bribes / -----
the <i>Rav’</i>s violation of this prohibition / -----
the prohibition against taking interest / the prohibition against taking
/ on a loan / revenge (Lev. 19:18)
the <i>Rav’</i>s (apparent) violation of this / “God is vengeful... and bears a
prohibition / grudge (Nahum 1:2)
the <i>talmid’</i>s question (“For you it is / permitted
and for me it is forbidden?!”) / Israel’s question (lines 22–26)
the <i>Rav</i>’s answer (lines 20–21) / God’s answer (lines 27–30)
It is not usually difficult to supply correspondences for elements of the <i>mashal</i> that do not appear in the <i>nimshal</i>, as we have seen in other cases. Even where the absence of elements is a rhetorical device designed to draw attention to the main point of the midrash, correspondences can often be made without much effort. After all, if the correspondences were not apparent, the midrash would not convey its message. Here, however, the reader seems to come up against a brick wall. There are no correspondences for these elements in the <i>nimshal</i> and they do not appear to refer to anything in the biblical story. And nothing in the <i>mashal</i> itself leads the reader in the direction of an answer.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As we saw in the <i>mashal</i> of the linenworker at the beginning of the chapter, the <i>mashal</i> can be set up in such a way as to virtually guarantee that we provide the expected answer for a missing correspondence. This does not appear to be the case in this <i>Rav-talmid</i> <i>mashal</i>.</i> Are we to conclude that there are no correspondences for these elements?
What, then, is the point of the unmatched parts of the <i>mashal</i>? Why doesn’t R. Avin simply begin the <i>mashal</i> story from the point at which the <i>Rav</i> appears to breach Torah law (line 14) and then demonstrate through the <i>talmid</i>’s question that the <i>Rav</i>’s behavior is not actually wrong – although it is made to seem so initially? The <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> would then be perfectly aligned and the message would be unambiguous: what appears to be inconsistency in God’s conduct toward the world is, in fact, only the <i>illusion</i> of inconsistency, while a closer examination would prove it to be appropriate and just. This message could then be extended to our understanding of the <i>Akeda</i> in the following way: the testing of Avraham at the <i>Akeda</i> merely <i>appears</i> to be a problem. If we could know the whole context, we would see that the testing of Avraham is perfectly just and consistent.
<b>Planned Discrepancies as a Teaching Strategy</b>
A reading of the midrash that solves the problem of the <i>Akeda</i> by viewing it as a case of misleading appearances is possible only if we ignore three important aspects of the midrash as a whole. First, the plain sense of the <i>petihta</i> (line 5), as we have noted, doesn’t at all mesh with the reading suggested above; on the contrary, it seems to contradict the <i>mashal</i> rather than prepare us for it. Second, R. Avin seems to be deliberately creating loose ends that we cannot tie up – we see this in our listing of the elements and their correspondences. He highlights elements that we cannot match to anything in either the <i>nimshal</i> or the biblical story. Finally, the last two lines of the midrash leave us with yet another contradiction – a verse in Deuteronomy that warns us not to test God, juxtaposed with the first verse of the <i>Akeda</i>, “…the Lord tested Avraham.” What are these closing lines meant to convey?
<b>A Subtle Message</b>
I would like to suggest that these difficulties are best resolved by recognizing that R. Avin’s interpretation of the <i>Akeda</i> as a Divine test is far more subtle and nuanced than the understanding we would get by ignoring these elements of the midrash. R. Avin is able to convey his subtle interpretation only by balancing the various elements of the midrash as he does. We began with the problem, presented in the three <i>meshalim</i> preceding this <i>Rav/talmid mashal</i>, of how to understand the nature of a Divine test in light of God’s omniscience. Why does God test us – why did He test Avraham – if He knows, as He must, the outcome of every test? The <i>petihta</i>, taken in isolation, suggests that the very question is inappropriate and should not be asked, because God is King and we are in no position to question his actions. Had the midrash ended there, we would have come away with a straightforward answer to our question, if not necessarily an emotionally satisfying one. This answer might also have sparked a new question, considering the rabbinic emphasis on <i>imitatio Deus</i> and <i>Hazal’</i>s understanding that our relationship with God and the stories of the <i>Tanakh</i> are meant to teach us something. That question would be: why tell us about the <i>Akeda</i> if we cannot conceivably understand it?
But, in fact, the midrash does not end there. R. Avin offers us an alternative model for approaching the question – not the king/subject relationship, but the <i>Rav-talmid</i> relationship. In the <i>Rav-talmid</i> relationship, questions are not only appropriate, but also necessary. Even so, the <i>Rav-talmid</i> interaction in this midrash is decidedly strange. The behavior of the <i>Rav</i> in the <i>mashal</i> story is not consistent with his teachings, and the reader knows that at least some of this inconsistency (the violations of proper judicial norms) cannot be justified by any standard. By the same token, the <i>talmid</i>’s reactions are not what we would expect in this situation. He questions only selectively.
When we try to draw a parallel between the <i>Rav-talmid</i> relationship in the <i>mashal</i> and our own relationship with God, R. Avin sets the stage for our realization that we cannot completely do so. By creating elements in the <i>mashal</i> that have no possible parallels in the <i>nimshal</i>, in the biblical text, or in life, he deliberately underlines the difference between a human <i>Rav</i> who, by virtue of being human, is capable of corruption, and God, the Divine teacher, Whose perfection is axiomatic. In that framework, certain questions about God simply don’t exist because, appearances notwithstanding, God, unlike a human teacher, is always consistent, and never violates the standards of absolute justice. R. Avin’s construction of the midrash does, however, cause the question voiced by the <i>talmid</i> (in the <i>mashal</i>) and Israel (in the <i>nimshal</i>) to become both reasonable as a question and answerable once its context has been defined.
<b>Questioning the <i>Akeda</i>: a Balancing Act</b>
By playing off the parts of the midrash against one another, R. Avin creates a seesaw effect. This, ultimately, serves to clarify the limits within which we can productively approach the profound mystery of the <i>Akeda</i>. The verse from Psalms quoted in line 2 (explored extensively in the three <i>meshalim</i> that precede this midrash), establishes that, whatever the reason for the <i>Akeda</i>, it is not a punishment or a sign of disfavor from God. That said, what <i>is</i> the purpose of the <i>Akeda</i>? Well, says R. Avin in the <i>petihta</i>, on one level, God is King, and one cannot really question his actions. But leaving the question at that level is not really satisfactory, for God is not only King; He is also Teacher, and we are meant to learn from Him. What defines a productive question in the context of the <i>Akeda</i>? A question that springs from the recognition that God is both King and Teacher, not simply “teacher” in the human sense. Our asking should not be silenced, but in formulating our questions, we need to recognize that certain of our perceptions and questions simply do not apply to God.
<b>Leaving Us With the Question</b>
R. Avin pushes us to internalize this message by quoting the verses in the last two lines of the paragraph. The first is a partial quote from Deuteronomy (6:16): “Do not test God….” The second is the end of the opening verse of the <i>Akeda</i> story: “…and the Lord tested Avraham….” At first reading, we might think that R. Avin is pointing to an inconsistency of the type we would have liked the <i>talmid</i> in the <i>mashal</i> story to question. The Torah tells us not to test God. Doesn’t that imply testing others is a bad thing? Why, then, does God test Avraham?
A little contemplation reveals the problem with this challenge. For one thing, the full quote from Deuteronomy contextualizes the statement. Context is crucial to a correct understanding of both the verse and its use in the midrash. The complete verse reads as follows: “Do not test God, your Lord, as you tested [Him] at Massa.” The incident referred to is recounted in Exodus 17:1–7. Faced with a shortage of water, the people complain bitterly against Moshe and against God.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The word for “test” or “trial” occurs twice in the seven verses of the story and is preserved in the place name of the site at which the story takes place. See verses 2 and 7.</i> The testing at Massa is part of a series of complaints and ungrateful behaviors that begins immediately after the miraculous salvation at the Red Sea and culminates in the sin of the Golden Calf. Clearly, this is a negative kind of testing, indicating the people’s lack of faith in God and love for Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, Rashi and Ramban on Deuteronomy 6:16. Both draw attention to the point made by the verses in Exodus, i.e., that the children of Israel see God’s ability to “deliver the goods” – in this case, water – as a way to prove God’s presence in their midst. As usual, Rashi’s formulation is much more concise than that of the Ramban, but the point is clear: Israel’s testing of God at Massa is an act of stunning arrogance.</i> Can Israel’s trying of God in this way legitimately be compared to God’s testing of Avraham at the <i>Akeda</i>?
The recurrent <i>petihta</i> from Psalms (“God will test the righteous…”) attests that Avraham’s trial at the <i>Akeda</i> is anything but an indication that God does not love him. R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i> of the householder and the cows in the previous midrash even goes so far as to indicate that in His act of testing, God demonstrates His great trust in Avraham’s ability to carry out the task He needs performed in the world. Thus, Massa and the <i>Akeda</i> are hardly analogous situations.
The very juxtaposition of the verses from Deuteronomy and the <i>Akeda</i> shows us how absurd it is to compare the two cases. God is Divine and Avraham is human. Of course God can test Avraham, because He is the King “and the word of the king is sovereign.” For this very reason, we, who are only human, have no right to test God.
If we cannot test God, are we permitted to question Him? R. Avin’s <i>Rav-talmid mashal</i> suggests that we can. But the way R. Avin chooses to construct his <i>mashal</i> hints that our “<i>Rav-talmid</i> relationship” with God is not entirely like a human <i>Rav-talmid</i> relationship. While the human <i>Rav</i> may err or sin, God is infallible. This means that certain types of questions simply don’t apply to God.
The internal dialectic of R. Avin’s midrash, created by the careful balancing of its different parts, tells us how he wishes us to approach the <i>Akeda</i>. R. Avin wants us to examine the <i>Akeda</i> and learn from it, but he wants our questions to be grounded in a firm understanding that God is King, and that we must fear Him. Certain assumptions about the <i>Akeda</i> are rejected <i>a priori</i>. R. Avin thus rejects the possibility that the <i>Akeda</i> is unfair to Avraham. Hence we can find no analogue to the immoral behavior of the human <i>Rav</i> in the <i>mashal</i> story. In his view, the <i>Akeda</i> is also not a sign that God hates Avraham or wishes to punish him. This point is made by his repetition of the quotation from Psalms. Perhaps also, in R. Avin’s view, the <i>Akeda</i> can never be totally understood. He does not, after all, offer his own explanation for why God tries Avraham, preferring instead to comment on the perspective from which the <i>Akeda</i> should be approached.
That said, what would R. Avin like us to do with the story of the <i>Akeda</i>? His message seems to be: ask your questions, and learn, for God is your Teacher and you must emulate Him. Nonetheless, you must approach the mystery of the <i>Akeda</i> and the presence of God with the appropriate humility, for He is also your King, and you are only human.

Chapter 7; The Affective Force of a Mashal; Aharon "Purifies" God

<b>The Affective Force of a <i>Mashal:</i><br>Aharon “Purifies” God</b>
(<i>Exodus Rabba</i> on Exodus 12:1)
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>A certain heretic said to</i> R.<i> Abahu: Your Lord is a kohen…When He buried Moshe, how did He immerse Himself…?</i> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 39a)</span>
The midrash that follows discusses what appears to be a minor textual difficulty in the twelfth chapter of Exodus. As we will see, the solution the midrash proposes to this small problem – a <i>mashal</i> which compares God to a <i>kohen</i> – is knottier than the question it purports to answer. The midrash leads us into a theological maze that ultimately changes our understanding of Divine love dramatically.
<b>The Interpretive Problem</b>
Exodus 12 contains a detailed description of the laws of Passover, as well as the story of the plague of the first-born and the beginning of the actual exodus from Egypt. The chapter opens with the following words (Exodus 12:1): “And God said to Moshe and to Aharon in the land of Egypt, saying.”
Both the midrash and the later commentaries question the phrase, “in the land of Egypt.” Since the reader already knows where the story is taking place, and since none of the hundreds of similar verses of this kind make mention of the land of Egypt as their setting, we need to ask why this phrase is included here.
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
<i>Exodus Rabba</i> 15:5 comments:
<i>In the land of Egypt</i>...
(1) R. Shimon said: Great is [God’s] love of Israel
(2) that the Holy One Blessed be He revealed Himself in a place of idol worship, a place of filth, and a place of impurity in order to redeem them.
(3) This may be compared to a <i>kohen</i>
(4) whose <i>teruma<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma</i> is the portion of produce set aside by the Israelites for the <i>kohanim</i>. Only <i>kohanim</i> and their families and servants are permitted to eat <i>teruma</i> and only when they are in a state of ritual purity.</i></i> fell into a graveyard.
(5) He said, ‘What shall I do?
(6) To render myself impure is impossible,
(7) and to abandon my <i>teruma</i> is impossible.
(8) Better to render myself impure one time,
(9) and return and purify myself,
(10) rather than lose my <i>teruma</i>.’
(11) Thus, our fathers were the <i>teruma</i> of the Holy One Blessed be He
(12) as it says (Jeremiah 2:3), “Israel is holy to God, the first of His grain...”;
(13) they were among the graves,
(14) as it says (Exodus 12:30), “because there was no house that had no dead”
(15) and it says (Numbers 33:4), “and Egypt were burying those whom God had smote among them, all the first-born.”
(16) The Holy One Blessed be He said, ‘How will I redeem them?
(17) to abandon them is impossible.
(18) It is better to go down and to save them,’
(19) as it says (Exodus 3:8), “And I will go down to save him from the hand of Egypt.”
(20) When He took [them] out,
(21) He called to Aharon
(22) and he purified Him,
(23) as it says (Leviticus 16:33), “And he will atone for the Holy of Holies”;
(24) (Leviticus 16:16) “and he will atone for the Sanctuary.”
<b>(1) Structure of the Midrash</b>
The first step toward understanding this midrash is to divide the paragraph into its constituent parts. Lines 1–2 give us R. Shimon’s introductory statement about God’s love for Israel. The <i>mashal</i> is contained in lines 3–10, and the <i>nimshal</i> in lines 11–24.
This preliminary division of the midrash is accurate, but not really adequate as it stands; a closer look at the <i>nimshal</i> shows that it is actually made up of two parts. The first part, in lines 11–19, corresponds to the part of the <i>mashal</i> that deals with the <i>kohen</i>’s decision-making process. The second part of the <i>nimshal</i>, in lines 20–24, greatly expands on only one line of the <i>mashal</i>, line 9, in which the <i>kohen</i> says he will purify himself after leaving the cemetery.
The midrash may be mapped as follows:
(1) R. Shimon’s introductory statement (lines 1–2)
(2) the <i>mashal</i> (lines 3–10)
(3) the first part of the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 11–19)
(4) the second part of the <i>nimshal</i> (lines 20–24)
<b>Problems in the <i>Nimshal</i></b>
Mapping the midrash in this way enables us to see that the second part of the <i>nimshal</i> is rather disquieting for a number of reasons. First, and most difficult, it introduces a radical, almost inconceivable idea, namely that God has to undergo some sort of purification after descending to Egypt (and that He receives it from a human being – Aharon). The theological problem here is obvious and, unlike other anthropomorphisms that lend themselves to a metaphorical reading, it is hard to see what an image of this kind could possibly represent. Second, R. Shimon’s reasons for expanding the <i>nimshal</i> in this way altogether are unclear. Given that we are not shown the <i>kohen</i> of the <i>mashal</i> actually undergoing a purification process, but merely contemplating it, surely R. Shimon could have ended the <i>nimshal</i> with line 19, especially since, as we have seen, midrashic authors often leave gaps in the <i>nimshal</i>. Why fill this one, and why in such a disturbing way?
The problematic nature of this <i>nimshal</i> leads us, once again, to the key question we must ask in the interpretation of any <i>mashal</i>: Why do we need the <i>mashal</i> altogether? R. Shimon has already told us that God’s appearance in the land of Egypt is a sign of His love for us, and the <i>nimshal</i> creates more problems than it solves. Why not simply leave us with the introductory statement that God loves us? Neither <i>mashal</i> nor <i>nimshal</i> seem critical to our understanding of the text.
<b></b>
(2) <i>Mashal</i> as Story
Our next task is to examine the <i>mashal</i> as a story in its own right. A <i>kohen</i> discovers that his <i>teruma</i> has fallen into a graveyard. According to Torah law, the <i>kohen</i> is forbidden to enter the graveyard since this would render him impure. After weighing his options, the <i>kohen</i> decides to enter the graveyard, retrieve his <i>teruma</i> and afterwards undergo ritual purification, rather than abandon his <i>teruma</i>.
The story seems plausible until we realize that the <i>kohen</i> of our story behaves as no normal <i>kohen</i> would. The alternatives which are presented in the story as equally unthinkable, i.e., for the <i>kohen</i> either to render himself impure or to abandon his <i>teruma</i>, are not, in fact, remotely equivalent in Jewish law. The prohibition against becoming ritually impure through contact with the dead is, for a <i>kohen</i>, a serious matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kohen</i> is permitted to violate the prohibition against ritual impurity only in two sets of circumstances. The first is upon the death of one of his immediate relatives: his wife, his parents, his siblings or his children. The second is a situation in which no other Jew is available to perform the mitzva of burying a dead person (<i>met mitzva</i>).</i> Deliberate violation of this prohibition carries the penalty of lashes and disqualifies the <i>kohen</i> from fulfilling his priestly function in the Temple for the duration of his state of impurity. Leaving one’s <i>teruma</i> in a graveyard is, however, not a violation of Jewish law.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although neither a <i>kohen</i> nor an Israelite is permitted to deliberately render <i>teruma</i> impure, once it has attained that status, there is no prohibition against leaving it in an impure place.</i> Furthermore, <i>teruma</i> that has fallen into a graveyard is diminished in value for a <i>kohen</i> since he can no longer use it as food.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma</i> which has become impure still has some value for a <i>kohen</i> since he can burn it for fuel or sell it.</i>
The strangest aspect of the <i>kohen</i>’s behavior is the fact that he does not consider the simplest alternative of all. Since the <i>kohen</i> is prohibited from entering the graveyard himself, why not send a non-<i>kohen</i> to retrieve the <i>teruma</i> for him? The <i>kohen</i> of this <i>mashal</i> appears to be so distraught over his <i>teruma</i> that he is not thinking at all logically.
<b>(3) Isolating the Elements</b>
The next step in our analysis is to isolate the elements of the <i>mashal</i> as follows:
a <i>kohen</i>
his <i>teruma</i>
the falling of the <i>teruma</i> into the graveyard
the graveyard
his dilemma (line 5)
to render himself impure
to abandon his <i>teruma</i>
his decision (line 8)
returning and purifying himself
<b>(4) Matching the Elements</b>
Having determined the elements of the <i>mashal</i>, we need to find the correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> as follows:
a <i>kohen</i> / the Holy One Blessed be He
his <i>teruma</i> / our forefathers
the falling of the <i>teruma</i> into
the graveyard / -----
the graveyard / the land of Egypt
his dilemma / ‘How will I redeem them?’ (line 16)
to render himself impure / -----
to abandon his <i>teruma</i> / ‘to abandon them is impossible’ (line 17)
his decision / to go down and save them
returning and purifying himself / God being purified by Aharon (lines
20–24)
<b>Dealing with Problems</b>
In this case, the correspondence between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> is fairly uncomplicated, except for two areas. The first is one we have already noted – that the purification process alluded to in the <i>mashal</i> becomes a greatly expanded story in the <i>nimshal</i>.
The second area is the two gaps we see above. In the <i>mashal</i>, the <i>kohen</i> is presented as weighing two alternatives, i.e., to render himself impure or to abandon his <i>teruma</i>. In the <i>nimshal</i>, there is only the impossibility of abandoning the Jewish people. “Rendering Himself impure” does not appear to be an unthinkable option for God.
<b>The Second Gap</b>
The second element for which we have no correspondence is “the falling of the <i>teruma</i> into the graveyard.” Ordinarily, we would expect such an important detail to have a correspondence, since it is clearly an essential ingredient of the story. In this particular case, however, trying to find a correspondence would be a mistake. This midrash is one of a number of <i>meshalim</i> in <i>Exodus Rabba</i> dealing with God’s redeeming of Israel from Egypt and/or His relationship with them in their state of exile. In writing <i>meshalim</i> that relate to these matters, the authors obviously have to skirt the issue of how the Jewish people got to Egypt, since it was God Himself Who sent them there to undergo exile and slavery. They thus allude to accidental or incidental circumstances such as “a <i>kohen</i> whose <i>teruma</i> <i>fell</i> into a graveyard” or “the son of a king who <i>traveled</i> to another place.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 20:7 for this midrash.</i> These devices enable the authors to sidestep the causal connection between the presence of Israel in Egypt and the fact that God sent them there. They are then free to construct <i>meshalim</i> that deal with matters other than that causal connection.
If we try to force a correspondence for these details of the story, we will get bogged down in the question of why God’s plan to exile Israel to Egypt is being described as something over which He has no control. Since this is not the point of the <i>mashal</i>, we have to conclude that “the falling of the <i>teruma</i> into the graveyard” is not, in fact, an essential element of the <i>mashal</i> story, but simply a plotting device that need not be translated into something else.
As we noted in our reading of the midrash from <i>Tanhuma</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2.</i> a critical step in the analysis of a <i>mashal</i> is determining which elements of the <i>mashal</i> story are essential. In the case of this particular <i>mashal</i>, we are able to leave a blank for an element that was mistakenly deemed important. Here, then, is as an example of the potential pitfalls of our methodology. Seeking a correspondence for what is actually an inessential element of the <i>mashal</i> may lead to over-reading or under-reading a midrash.
<b>Biblical Citations in the Midrash</b>
The next area within the midrash that we need to examine in detail is the use of the prooftexts in the <i>nimshal</i>. The first prooftext, from Jeremiah (line 12), is brought to substantiate the<i> mashal</i>’s portrayal of Israel as God’s <i>teruma</i>. The next two, from Exodus (line 14) and Numbers (line 15), reinforce the description of Egypt as a graveyard. The fourth prooftext, from Exodus (line 19), summarizes God’s decision to “go down” to rescue Israel, and the last two, from Leviticus (lines 23–24), are used to prove that God was subsequently “purified” by Aharon.
When we analyze the use of these prooftexts in the <i>nimshal</i>, we notice that the effect of the verses is to <i>heighten</i> the anthropomorphism of the <i>nimshal</i> – to literalize it – rather than allowing us to read it figuratively. Thus, for example, the verse from Jeremiah (2:3), “Israel is holy to God, the first of His grain...” (line 12) is, in its original context, a metaphor. In the context of the <i>nimshal</i>, however, the metaphor is taken literally. Similarly, the verses from Exodus and Numbers describe Egypt, literally, as a graveyard, in the wake of the plague of the first-born.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Careful readers will no doubt have noted the problem with the chronology of these quotations. The verse in Exodus 12 that R. Shimon is explaining here, precedes the actual occurrence of the plague of the first-born. How can R. Shimon “prove” that Egypt is a graveyard, on the basis of verses describing an event that hasn’t happened yet?<br>This is one of many difficulties we encounter in understanding how <i>Hazal</i> use biblical citations in midrash. For a discussion of this topic, see Chapter 5.</i> The quotes from Leviticus are perhaps most striking in this regard. Their original context is a description of the ritual purification of the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies during the Yom Kippur service. However, the purpose of this purification ritual is to atone for the presence of <i>human</i> impurity in the Tabernacle or Temple. In context, there is not the remotest possibility of reading these verses as referring to God’s “impurity.” In the framework of the <i>nimshal</i> (itself a narrative expansion), though, they are made to sound as though God is being purified before He can enter His own Sanctuary!
In this midrash, as opposed to others we have seen, the difficulties we need to reconcile are not primarily in the relationship between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>. Instead, the difficulties seem to lie <i>within</i> the <i>mashal</i> as a story and <i>within</i> the <i>nimshal</i> as a narrative expansion. Each, independently, is highly problematic.
<b>(5) Drawing Conclusions</b>
Let us examine the effect created by this difficult midrash. As we have already noted, the <i>mashal</i> shows us a <i>kohen</i> who is so attached to his <i>teruma</i> that he cannot think properly. The <i>nimshal</i> superimposes this image of the <i>kohen</i> onto God, creating a picture of God as so enamored of His people, that He will “degrade” Himself to redeem them. Like the <i>kohen</i> of the <i>mashal</i>, God does not consider sending someone other than Himself to retrieve His precious possession. But, in contrast to the <i>kohen</i>, who at least considers his two alternatives, God, in the <i>nimshal</i>, envisions only one possibility – to rescue the Jewish people regardless of the “cost” to Himself. The <i>nimshal</i> intensifies this image in two ways. The first is the use of metaphorical prooftexts which are made to read literally; the second is by making God’s “lowering” of Himself appear more than a mere metaphor. It is an actuality that ultimately compels Him to undergo ritual purification, just as a <i>kohen</i> in similar circumstances would.
<b>(6) Love Beyond Our Comprehension</b>
R. Shimon opens by saying that God’s appearance in Egypt is a sign of His great love for us, but the midrash shocks us into a realization of what that really means. Without the <i>mashal</i> of the <i>kohen</i> and the analogy drawn between the <i>kohen</i> and God, a strikingly concrete image, we would not see just how “great is [God’s] love of Israel.” R. Shimon wants us to read Exodus 12:1 as follows:
And God said to Moshe and Aharon IN THE LAND OF EGYPT!
On this reading, the thrust of the verse is that God’s very presence in the land of Egypt for our sake is an act of tremendous, nearly inconceivable love.
The power of R. Shimon’s interpretation of Exodus 12:1 lies precisely in those areas of the midrash that we have found most problematic. The irrational behavior of the <i>kohen</i>, the disturbing use of anthropomorphism, and the literalizing effects of the prooftexts force us to rethink the implications of R. Shimon’s introductory statement. The <i>mashal</i> shakes us out of our intellectual and emotional complacency because we <i>have to think about it in order to understand it</i>, unlike the introductory statement which we can process relatively easily. The <i>mashal</i> thus awakens us to the emotional force of R. Shimon’s statement about Exodus 12:1. In his reading, this verse has a profound teaching for us: God’s love of Israel is so great that it defies our understanding.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">My intent is not to suggest that the reading presented here is the only way to understand this complex and difficult midrash. The midrash clearly touches upon kabbalistic ideas that extend beyond the scope of this book. It is not hard to imagine that a kabbalistic reading of this midrash would yield a far more profound understanding than the one presented here. But even when read as commentary on the biblical verse, this midrash has much to offer us.</i>

Chapter 8; Understanding the Narrative Expansion

<b>Understanding the Narrative Expansion</b>
Nehama Leibowitz was fond of recounting the story of a lesson she had given to a group of high-ranking Israeli army officers. She asked them to open their <i>Tanakhim</i> to the account of Avraham breaking his father’s idols. One officer kept flipping back and forth in frustration until at last he exclaimed, “Where is the <i>Tanakh</i> I learned from when I was a child?” Nehama had proven her point: many people recall well-known midrashic stories, especially those learned in childhood, as part of the biblical text.
The body of midrashic literature commonly called simply “story” midrashim, can also be designated by the literary term “narrative expansion.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Harhavat sipur</i>, in Hebrew.</i> Unlike the word “<i>mashal</i>,” which is used by <i>Hazal</i> to describe parables, “narrative expansion” is a modern invention, a useful label for the midrashic stories that “expand” the biblical narrative. Many people associate the whole of midrash with these <i>Tanakh</i>-related stories, which do not actually appear in the biblical text but are often incorporated into it by readers and teachers, either unconsciously or deliberately.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Nehama’s frustrated army officer exemplifies the type of reader or learner who tends unconsciously to incorporate midrashic stories into the biblical text. Many teachers, though, deliberately blur the line between biblical text and midrashic story as part of their teaching strategy. To my mind, this blurring of lines is a serious pedagogical error.</i>
As we begin exploring the nature of narrative expansions, we will find ourselves confronting questions that generally don’t arise in studying the <i>mashal</i> genre. This is because the genres differ in crucial ways: while the <i>mashal</i> is a deliberately constructed story whose interpretive purpose is an evident part of its design, the interpretive function of the narrative expansion is often hard to identify.
<b>I. Types of Narrative Expansions</b>
To explore this genre successfully, we must first recognize that the narrative expansion category is very broad. It includes many types of stories whose connections to the biblical text differ in essential ways. The relationship between narrative expansion and biblical text depends in part on the type of biblical text to which the narrative expansion is attached.
<b>(1) Gaps</b>
In cases of obvious gaps in the biblical text, for example, narrative expansions often serve a bridging function. One illustration of this common type of narrative expansion is the midrash from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on the Book of Yona (See Chapter 5). The book of Yona opens with Yona’s flight from God, but leaves us in the dark as to Yona’s reasons for fleeing. The midrash from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> fills the gap in the storyline by telling us what motivates Yona’s actions. Without the information supplied in the midrashic account we would be hard-pressed to make sense of the biblical narrative.
<b>(2) Discrepancies and Inconsistencies</b>
A similar function is served by narrative expansions that reconcile discrepancies or smooth out inconsistencies in the biblical text. One such example is the narrative expansion found in <i>Yevamot</i> 76b (cited by Rashi on I Samuel 17:55) which explains the puzzling dialogue between Shaul and Avner at the end of the David/Goliath story.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See I Samuel 16:14–23, and I Samuel 17:55–58 to understand the example.</i> In I Samuel 16, we are told that David has been summoned to play the harp for Shaul, and that Shaul appoints David to be his arms-bearer. Shaul sends a message to Yishai, David’s father, requesting that David remain with him. And yet, in the following chapter, Shaul – who at this point certainly knows David well – asks Avner who David’s father is. Avner professes not to know. This is decidedly odd, given that both Avner and David are well-known members of Shaul’s court. The narrative expansion from <i>Yevamot</i> rewrites the dialogue between Shaul and Avner in such a way as to bring out the latent meaning of the words. Reinterpreted through the narrative expansion, Shaul’s question and Avner’s answer are no longer difficult to understand.
A subset of the discrepancy/inconsistency category is those cases in which the chronology of the biblical text is unclear. For an example of a narrative expansion that deals with this sort of problem, see the discussion of chronology in the Yosef/Yehuda story (Chapter 14).
<b>(3) Interpreting Biblical Dialogue</b>
Narrative expansions are also often used to interpret biblical dialogue, as in the midrashim from <i>Exodus Rabba</i> which discuss God’s dialogue with Moshe at the burning bush. (See Chapters 12 and 13). By adding elements to the biblical dialogue, the various midrashic authors are able to express a range of opinions on the meaning of the exchanges between God and Moshe.
<b>(4) Explaining the Meanings of Words</b>
Similarly, in the case of an ambiguous or unclear word, a midrashic story can be used to spell out its meaning by constructing a narrative framework that elucidates it. One such example is Genesis 21:9–10, in which Sara sees Yishmael “<i>mitzahek</i>” (laughing) and then demands that Avraham banish him. The word in context requires interpretation; it couldn’t simply refer to the innocuous behavior we associate with laughter if it leads Sara to take such drastic action. <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 53:8 offers a range of possible interpretations for the word in the form of brief narrative expansions.
<b>(5) “Rewriting” the Biblical Story</b>
The purpose of a narrative expansion may not be immediately apparent, especially when it seems to contradict or “rewrite” the biblical story. In at least some of these cases, the biblical text is being exploited for its homiletic possibilities rather than being explicated in its own terms. One instance of this is the midrashic discussion in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 8:3–5. The narrative expansions in this source use an interpretive problem within the biblical verse as their starting point, but they do not actually solve the interpretive problem. Instead, the various opinions employ the interpretive difficulty in the verse to discuss the philosophical implications of human-kind’s creation.
<b>(6) Apparent Contradiction</b>
In other cases, however, a closer look at a seemingly difficult midrash reveals that what appears to be a contradiction to the biblical text is, in fact, a subtle close reading of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashbam calls this <i>omek peshuto shel mikra</i> (a deeper reading of the plain sense of the text). See, for example, Rashbam’s commentary on Genesis 37:28,<i> vayaavru</i>.</i> One such case is the series of narrative expansions on the story of Hana found in <i>Berakhot</i> 31a–b. (See Chapter 16.)
<b>(7) Narrative Expansions That Enrich the Biblical Text</b>
Many narrative expansions occupy a middle ground between interpretation and homiletics. In these cases, the midrashic story appears to be neither necessary to our understanding of the biblical text, nor contradictory to it. A midrash of this type is compatible with the verses it addresses and enriches our reading of them, but we would not have trouble understanding the plain sense of the biblical story without it. A familiar instance of this type of narrative expansion is the story of Avraham breaking the idols, which appears in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 38:13 (see Chapter 9).
<b>II. The Limits of Methodology</b>
The list of categories compiled here is not complete, but it is sufficient to show that the broad selection of texts we tend to lump together in the narrative expansion genre is really quite diverse. In some respects, this list is also somewhat misleading. For one thing, many of the narrative expansions fit into more than one category. A case in point is the midrash in <i>Yevamot</i> mentioned above in the “reconciling discrepancies” category. It might be argued that this midrashic story is actually a case of “interpreting the biblical dialogue” or even “rewriting the biblical story.” For another thing, several of the midrashim listed in the <i>mashal</i> category are built upon narrative expansions, which means that describing them as <i>meshalim</i> is only partially accurate.
This does not imply that classification is without value. Categorizing midrashim by genre does aid in analyzing them, as we have seen. However, even more important than knowing how to categorize a given midrashic story is recognizing the limits of methodology. While we can propose and use a whole arsenal of techniques to dissect any given midrash, we need to remember that <i>Hazal’</i>s teachings were not produced with our methodology in mind. It requires considerable detachment and humility not to force a midrash arbitrarily into the pigeonhole we have designed for it and to recognize that our technical approach may sometimes fail us.
In facing the limitations of methodology we acknowledge the depth and mystery that characterize the language of <i>Hazal</i>. Midrash can be learned in more ways than one, not only because our methodology is not sacred, but because the teachings of <i>Hazal</i> are. At best, our methodology can uncover some of the levels at which midrash operates.
I raise this point here because the following discussion will involve difficult issues, such as the factuality of midrashic stories, the nature of their connection to the biblical text, and their origins. We will discover that while we can make many generalizations about midrash, deciding how to read a midrash may involve skills and attitudes not so easily acquired.
<b>III. Problems in Understanding the Narrative Expansion Genre</b>
<b>(1) The Problem of Factuality</b>
Perhaps the most weighty question for serious students of midrash is how to relate to the factuality of certain narrative expansions. As we have noted, this issue does not arise often in relation to the <i>mashal</i> genre because a <i>mashal</i> usually serves as commentary on another text. Parables need not be factual to be valuable, since their function is to highlight another story or lesson. Narrative expansions, in contrast, seem to operate as an extension of the biblical text. At the same time, many narrative expansions are hard to accept at face value since they involve events of a miraculous or fantastic nature. Are we actually meant to take stories of this type literally? If not, how should we relate to them?
<b>The Rambam’s Approach to <i>Agada</i></b>
The Rambam<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">R. Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides), late 12th century, Spain.</i> discusses this question in his introduction to <i>Perek Helek</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hakdamot HaRambam Lamishna,</i>translated by R. Y. Kapah (Mossad Harav Kook). See also the Rambam’s introduction to <i>Moreh nevukhim</i> (The Guide for the Perplexed).</i> in which he describes three approaches to the study of <i>agada</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash <i>agada</i> is included in the category of <i>agada</i>. The Rambam addresses not only problematic midrashim, but all agadic material that is difficult to understand.</i> Readers who follow the first approach take all of agadic literature literally, even where common sense would dictate that a story could not have happened as described. The Rambam explains that what motivates such readers is their reverence for <i>Hazal</i>. They mistakenly assume that in accepting all of agadic literature at face value they show honor to the rabbis. Instead, the Rambam says, they disgrace <i>Hazal</i> without even being aware of it, by degrading <i>Hazal’</i>s teachings to the level of nonsense.
Proponents of the second approach also take agadic literature completely literally. They differ from readers of the first type only in their attitude to <i>Hazal</i>, whom they view as primitive storytellers. While the first approach assumes that even the most unlikely agadic texts are factual, the second contends that these texts are fictional, but that <i>Hazal</i> view them as factual. Adherents to this approach reach the inescapable conclusion that <i>Hazal</i> are philosophically unsophisticated and that their stories are simple-minded nonsense. The Rambam condemns this position even more vehemently than the first. Readers of the second type, he contends, although they consider themselves critical and philosphical, have far less intellectual sophistication than they suppose, and actually miss the depth and complexity of <i>Hazal’</i>s teachings completely.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Rambam rejects both positions, it is clear that he favors a simple-minded faith in <i>Hazal</i> to a prideful rejection of them. The first type of reader has made an intellectual error that can be corrected; the second type is religiously corrupt. The Rambam’s preference comes to the fore in his remark that the intellectual error of the readers who revere <i>Hazal</i> stems from their lack of training in philosophy, and in his statement that proponents of the second position “are more stupid and foolish” than those who take the first approach.</i>
The third approach to agadic literature is represented by the Rambam himself. It shares the total reverence for <i>Hazal</i> of the first approach, but it rejects the misconception of both the unsophisticated believer and the simple-minded “philosopher,” namely, that <i>Hazal’</i>s words must be understood unconditionally literally. The Rambam maintains that <i>Hazal</i> use language figuratively as well as literally. They consciously employ figurative modes of expression as a deliberate strategy for conveying difficult ideas in language understandable at multiple levels. In the Rambam’s view, when <i>Hazal</i> tell a story that violates rationalist norms, they are signaling to the sophisticated reader that the story must be analyzed to uncover the message concealed beneath the surface. <i>Hazal</i> do not expect the intellectually developed reader to take such stories literally.
<b>The Language of Philosophers and the Language of <i>Hazal</i></b>
In his attack on the position of the so-called philosophers, the Rambam explains the rationale behind <i>Hazal’</i>s use of figurative language. Proponents of the “philosophical” approach fail to appreciate <i>Hazal’</i>s mode of discourse, he contends, because they themselves lack the ability “to write about theology and related philosophical matters for the masses as well as the wise” and fail to “value the practical aspects of philosophy.”
The Rambam’s intent here is that the teachings of <i>Hazal</i> are a “practical” form of philosophy, and their use of language reflects this. <i>Hazal’</i>s goal in all their teachings is manifestly didactic; their intended audience is potentially everyone. Had <i>Hazal</i> conveyed complex ideas in philosophical language – as philosophers generally do – their teachings would have remained the exclusive province of the intellectually privileged, because only educated people can follow philosophical discourse. By employing language figuratively, <i>Hazal</i> open up multiple levels of interpretation. A child who hears the midrashic story of Vashti’s punishment<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Megila</i> 12b and <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> Esther 1049 <i>dibur hamat’hil: bet hamalkhut.</i> These sources explain that Vashti refuses to go to Achashverosh when he calls her because the angel Gavriel has placed a tail on her.</i> will picture a beautiful queen who has sprouted a tail. An adult understands the midrashic message that Vashti is a person who is no better than an animal. The childish literal interpretation of the midrash is mistaken, but it contains an embryonic form of the message that can evolve into a fuller understanding. As the child matures and reencounters the midrash, his understanding should grow with him. Stated in adult terms, the idea would simply elude the child altogether.
The Rambam makes two other points in defense of his approach to the interpretation of <i>agada</i>. First, he observes that in their use of stories and parables to teach profound ideas, <i>Hazal</i> are emulating the style of the <i>Tanakh</i>. In particular, the Rambam cites the works of King Shlomo, the wisest of all men, who uses parable, metaphor, and allegory extensively in Proverbs, the Song of Songs, and parts of Ecclesiastes. Second, the Rambam maintains that by understanding <i>agada</i> figuratively, we remain loyal to <i>Hazal’</i>s approach to interpreting parts of the <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Among the examples brought by the Rambam is the anonymous opinion that the book of Job is a parable (<i>Bava Batra</i> 15a) and the statement in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 92b that Ezekiel’s vision of the dry bones is a parable.</i> Having anchored his position firmly in biblical style as well as <i>Hazal’</i>s interpretive methodology, the Rambam argues persuasively that a non-literal reading of problematic agadic literature perpetuates a well-established, traditional form of Jewish text study. Indeed, from the Rambam’s perspective, taking certain types of agadic material at face value is a serious distortion of their true meaning and an act of disrespect to <i>Hazal</i>.
<b>Truth vs. Factuality</b>
In effect, the Rambam’s description of <i>Hazal’</i>s mode of discourse could be restated as the tension between truth and factuality. When people ask about a midrash, “Is it true?” they usually mean, “Did it really happen?” Failing to distinguish between these two questions reflects confusion about the difference between truth and fact. Facts are invariably “true,” but may well be completely insignificant. Truths are not always grounded in fact, but remain truths nonetheless. Thus, the statement, “Everything in the world is either blue or not blue,” is a fact – but devoid of significance. On the other hand, R. Akiva’s parable of the fish and the fox<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot</i> 61b. R. Akiva uses this parable to answer Papus ben Yehuda’s question about why he is still teaching Torah if it endangers his life with the Roman authorities. R. Akiva describes a fox looking at the fish in a river. The fox asks the fish what they are fleeing. The fish answer that they are fleeing the nets of fishermen. The fox suggests that the fish join him on dry land. The fish answer that if they are fearful in the place where they can live (the water), then they will certainly be fearful in their place of death (dry land). In the parable, water represents Torah, the fish represent the Jewish people, and the fisherman’s nets are the Roman decrees. Papus, of course, is the fox.</i> expresses a deep truth although it never actually occurred.
<b>(2) The Relationship Between the Midrashic Story and the Biblical Text</b>
Let’s turn now to the connection between narrative expansions and the biblical text. Narrative expansions often appear to contradict one another. Assuming we are meant to view these stories as extensions of the biblical text, it is difficult to see how such contradictions can be reconciled. In the same vein, if narrative expansions are really an extension of the biblical story, why aren’t they included in the text of the <i>Tanakh</i>? And, finally, given that they are not included in the <i>Tanakh</i>, what is the purpose of these stories?
<b>Interpretation, Not Extension</b>
In the first section of this chapter, we noted the breadth of the narrative expansion genre. The many categories within the genre attest that the midrashic story is not so easily classified simply as an extension of the biblical text. Some midrashic stories are indeed extensions,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, R. Nehorai’s teaching about pomegranates growing in the newly dried Red Sea (<i>Exodus Rabba</i> 21:10). Midrashim of this type do not seem to have an obvious interpretive aspect, and they do not really fit the homiletical mode either, since they do not seem to be exploiting the text for the purpose of conveying a preconceived idea. Rather, these midrashim appear to preserve oral traditions associated with the biblical text. Their non-inclusion in the biblical text is part of a larger question which is outside the scope of this book – why parts of tradition were preserved in written form while others were transmitted orally.</i> but many others could be more accurately understood as <i>Hazal’</i>s <i>commentary</i> on the <i>Tanakh</i>. In this view of the narrative expansion genre, most of the questions we have raised answer themselves.
The apparent contradictions between narrative expansions, like the different interpretations of the classic commentators, no longer need to be reconciled because they are not required to be compatible. For example, R. Yehoshua ben Levi and R. Nehorai each rewrite part of the dialogue between God and Moshe at the burning bush; the result is two sharply variant versions.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12.</i> If we see their differing accounts of the dialogue as extensions of the biblical text, we have a problem. But if their expansions of the biblical story are commentary, nothing compels us to reconcile them, just as we wouldn’t necessarily try to reconcile the views of the Ramban and ibn Ezra on a verse in the Torah. Each narrative expansion offers a different perspective on the text and can be studied as interpretation.
This view also helps us explain why narrative expansions are not preserved in the <i>Tanakh</i>. Narrative expansions of an interpretive nature are not extensions of the biblical text, in the same way that Rashi’s commentary is not an extension of the text. We would not expect narrative expansions of this type to be included in the text of the <i>Tanakh</i> any more than we would expect the commentary of Rashi to be.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, we would not expect homiletical midrashim to be integrated into the biblical text since midrashim of this type are neither interpretive nor extensions of the text. This sort of midrash exploits the potential of the biblical text in order to discuss an idea that may be tangentially related to the text, but is not organically related to the verses it uses. See discussion of <i>parshanut</i> and <i>darshanut</i> in the introduction.</i>
When we manage to give up the idea that narrative expansions are always an extension of the text and begin thinking of them as commentary, the purpose of these midrashic stories becomes transparent – they help us understand the meaning of the <i>Tanakh</i>. Even in narrative expansions that appear to be extensions of the biblical text, we can sometimes discern an interpretive function. Perhaps the best way to determine the purpose of midrashic stories is to examine each one individually. Each narrative expansion conveys at least one unique, significant message that the reader should explore.
<b>(3) The Sources of Midrashic Stories</b>
Another important issue concerning the narrative expansion genre is the origin of these midrashim. This question as well is not usually relevant in the case of <i>meshalim</i>, because parables, by definition, are fictional constructs. The sources of narrative expansions, however, are not so easily determined.
In keeping with what we know of other parts of oral tradition, we could reasonably say that some midrashic stories are grounded in received tradition (<i>mesora</i>) while others are derived through logic or reasoning (<i>sevara</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Another possible source for midrashic stories is Divine inspiration of some kind. <i>Hazal</i> signal this with the phrase <i>sod HaShem leyere’av</i> (“God’s secrets [are made known] to those who fear him”). See, for example, <i>Sota</i> 4b and 10b, in which this phrase is used to describe knowledge which appears close to miraculous in nature.</i> The difficulty is to determine which are which.
Consider, for example, the midrash we mentioned above, cited by Rashi, interpreting Yishmael’s laughter (<i>mitzahek</i>) (<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 53:11). We noted that this midrash is an example of a narrative expansion that explains the meanings of words. It might be argued that each of the opinions cited is based on <i>mesora</i>. However, the presence of a proof-text supporting each opinion would suggest, more reasonably, that here we have a case of <i>sevara</i>. The different textual sources used to defend the different readings makes it plausible that each rabbi reasoned out his interpretation without recourse to a received tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It is still conceivable, of course, that each rabbi received his opinion through <i>mesora</i> with an associated prooftext. We can only make educated guesses about the likelihood of a midrash having been derived through either <i>mesora</i> or <i>sevara</i>.</i>
In contrast, it would be difficult to conceive of R. Hiyya’s description of Avraham breaking the idols as either a narrative reconstructed from the biblical text or as a story he himself fashioned out of thin air. There are not enough elements common to both the midrash and the biblical story to support the former possibility. Moreover, elements of the story reappear in other contexts in rabbinic literature, which would suggest that the story is based on a widely known oral tradition.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">C.f. <i>Eruvin</i> 53a which refers to Nimrod as the man who threw Avraham into the burning furnace, and <i>Pesahim</i> 118a which also makes reference to the story.<br>Also note that the story of Avraham mocking idol worshippers by reference to their age appears with different biblical figures in the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i>: <i>Berakhot</i> 9:2 and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 11:5.</i> In this case, at least, it seems far more reasonable to assume that R. Hiyya received the story as part of the oral tradition than that he produced it on his own.
<b>Movement and Redaction in Oral Traditions:<br>The Compositional Nature of Midrashic Texts</b>
Oral tradition, however, need not necessarily imply transmission word for word, as it usually does in the case of <i>halakhic</i> texts. Indeed, much of both the Mishna and the Gemara is devoted to the attempt to reconstruct <i>halakhic</i> teachings in their original wording and/or to identify their original contexts in order to determine the precise legal implications of each teaching. In the area of <i>agada</i>, though, which rarely has a bearing on <i>halakhic</i> practice, this kind of reconstructive effort seldom occurs. On the contrary, variant versions of <i>agadot</i> and midrashim are used freely by <i>Hazal</i>, inserted in whatever context they are needed.
To assume that the story of Avraham’s breaking of the idols is based on <i>mesora</i> means that it predates R. Hiyya’s version of it, and perhaps even the version known to those who passed the story on to him. An orally transmitted narrative expansion would have been told and retold in a variety of contexts and for many different ends. A midrash taught for a particular purpose at one time might well have been retold elsewhere, in altered form, to serve another purpose. R. Hiyya’s story of Avraham’s breaking of the idols, then, is not exclusively his; it is a compositional work – polished, influenced, and sharpened by generations of sages who evoked it in many different contexts.
We can reasonably suppose that in his own retelling of the story, R. Hiyya, like his predecessors, shaped it so as to emphasize certain ideas, while preserving the essential narrative. It would be surprising indeed if midrashic material did not undergo some sort of change in the course of transmission over the ages, given the nature of Oral Torah. We often find several versions of a basic narrative expansion; <i>Hazal</i> took pains to preserve these different versions, which suggests that a great many narrative expansions are based in <i>mesora</i>. The different versions are variations of traditions preserved for different interpretive or homiletic purposes<i>.</i>
We have already seen that the redactors of midrashic texts influence our understanding of a midrash by the context in which they place it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12 for an example of the effect of redaction.</i> That later generations of <i>Hazal</i> are authorized to edit the teachings of previous generations, like the subtle changes in versions of midrashim, reflect the power of the oral character of midrash. A midrash, whether it is a <i>mesora</i> or an interpretive <i>sevara,</i> is not intended to remain a static text on a shelf. It is a living teaching that must be studied repeatedly and brought to bear on contexts other than the original one in which it was taught.
<b>IV. Tools for Understanding the Narrative Expansion</b>
<b>(1) Structure as a Key to Understanding</b>
The complexity of this genre makes it difficult to formulate a simple, uniform methodology for analyzing it, as we did with the <i>mashal</i>. Still, certain tools and principles can be used in approaching the midrashic story.
One such tool is examination of the story’s structure. As we have seen with the <i>mashal</i>, the structure of a midrash can guide us in understanding it. The difficulty with the narrative expansion genre is that each midrashic story has a unique structure; the structure of the <i>mashal</i>, on the other hand is more easily identified because it routinely contains certain elements, even if other elements sometimes complicate the picture. Despite the complexities of the narrative expansion genre, however, sensitivity to structure can function as a valuable tool for getting at the meaning of the midrashic story, just as it does for the <i>mashal</i>.
<b>(2) Distinguishing Between Events and Stories</b>
Another valuable tool for analyzing the midrashic story is a modified form of the question, “Why do I need this?” (<i>lama li</i>) discussed in connection with the <i>mashal</i>. It revolves around the distinction between events and stories. To see why this distinction is significant for our understanding of midrash, consider an event such as a car accident. Undoubtedly, a newspaper account of the event will differ from that of the eyewitnesses, and the accounts of each eyewitness will differ from the others. Even if each teller is perfectly honest and even when the accounts corroborate each other on all relevant points, each story will be unique because each storyteller will have shaped his account, consciously or unconsciously, to fit certain subjective perceptions of the event.
As students of midrash, we should be aware that a similar process takes place in the telling of the midrashic story. The author/s of a midrashic story, whether or not they recount actual events, are engaged in conveying certain messages and values through the medium of midrash.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This becomes very obvious when we consider variant versions of the same midrash. Compare, for example, <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 1:12 and <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 23:8<i>.</i> The two midrashim recount essentially the same story of how the children survived the decrees of Pharoah, although they are offered as commentary to different parts of the biblical narrative. The first is more detailed and focuses on the actions of the mothers, while the second describes the effect upon the children. These differences may reflect their use as commentary on different parts of the biblical narrative.</i> To that end, they shape each midrash to draw attention to certain elements rather than others, or to juxtapose or separate particular details or ideas so that the reader is forced to think about specific issues in relation to one another. If we wish to gain a deeper understanding of the midrashic message, we must notice the structural and rhetorical elements of each story and ask ourselves why the author of the text has chosen to tell the story in precisely this way.
<b>“Tasting” the Text</b>
Psalms 34:9 urges us to “Taste and see that God is good....” Something similar might be said about experiencing the midrashic story. Because many narrative expansions are familiar to us, either as childhood stories or from secondary sources, too few have been read and studied with the seriousness they deserve. We need to slow down and savor the words, “taste” the beauty of the midrashic story’s language and structure. Thinking deeply about the messages hidden behind <i>Hazal’</i>s seemingly simple language empowers us to join the third category of readers described by the Rambam – those who truly honor <i>Hazal</i> by endeavoring to understand their words.

Chapter 9; Exploring a Midrashic Story; Avraham Breaks the Idols

<b>Exploring a Midrashic Story:<br>Avraham Breaks the Idols</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>And Yehoshua said to all the people, “Thus said God, the Lord of Israel, ‘Your fathers always lived on the other side of the river – Terah, the father of Avraham and the father of Nahor – and they worshipped other gods.’”</i> (Joshua 24:2)</span>
Anyone who has received a Jewish Sunday school education is familiar with at least some version of the story of Avraham breaking the idols. It features in countless editions of Bible stories for children and evidently has a powerful hold on the collective Jewish soul. In effect, it is the only “Bible story” some people know or remember.
Very few people, though, have actually studied this midrash at its source. As a result, it is mistakenly seen as a child’s tale with a simple moralizing message rather than as a subtle discussion of complex issues lying at the heart of Judaism.
This midrash, almost stereotypically familiar, is an illuminating place to start examining the nature of the midrashic story. In the following analysis we will see how attention to structure and rhetorical properties can reveal the significance of a midrash in ways that a superficial reading cannot.
<b>Avraham Breaks the Idols</b>
Genesis 11:26–32 introduces the story of Avraham which actually begins with God’s first commandment to Avraham in chapter 12.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read this section of Genesis 11, and the first few verses of Genesis 12.</i> In these seven verses, we are told, among other things that Haran, Avraham’s younger brother “died before [literally ‘on the face of’] Terah his father” (Genesis 11:28). <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 38:13, the story of Avraham breaking the idols, takes this verse as its point of departure, employing the oddity of the phrase “died on the face of Terah” as an opening for the story that appears below.
<i>And Haran died on the face of Terah his father</i>
(1) R. Hiyya the son of the son of R. Ada of Yafo:
(2) Terah was a maker/worshipper [<i>oved</i>] of idols.
(3) Once, he went somewhere and had Avraham sell [idols] in his place.
(4) A person would come, wanting to buy, and he [Avraham] would say to him, “How old are you?”
(5) And he [the customer] would answer, “Fifty or sixty years old.”
(6) And he would say to him, “Woe to a sixty-year-old who wants to bow to [something that is] a day old.”
(7) And he would be embarrassed and go away.
(8) One time, one woman came, carrying one plate of fine flour.
(9) She said to him, “This is for you to offer before them.”
(10) He got up, took a stick in his hand, and broke all the idols, and then placed the stick in the hand of the biggest of them.
(11) When his father came, he said to him, “Who did this to them?”
(12) [Avraham] said to him, “Shall I hide it from you?
(13) A woman came, carrying a plate of fine flour, and she said, ‘This is for you to offer before them.’
(14) I offered it before them, and this one said, ‘I will eat first,’ and that one said, ‘I will eat first.’
(15) The biggest one among them got up, took the stick, and broke them.”
(16) He said to him, “Why are you mocking me? And do they know?!” [Are they conscious beings?]
(17) [Avraham] said to him, “Don’t your ears hear what your mouth is saying?”
(18) [Terah] took him and handed him over to Nimrod.
(19) [Nimrod] said to him [Avraham], “Let’s worship fire.”
(20) Avraham said to him, “Let’s worship water, which extinguishes fire.”
(21) Nimrod said to him, “Let’s worship water.”
(22) [Avraham] said to him, “Then, let’s worship clouds, which carry water.”
(23) He said to him, “Let’s worship clouds.”
(24) He said to him, “Then, let’s worship the wind, which moves the clouds.”
(25) He said to him, “Let’s worship the wind.”
(26) He said to him, “Let’s worship Man, who bears the wind.”
(27) He said to him, “You are speaking foolishness. I worship only fire. Now, I will throw you into its midst, and let the God that you worship come and save you from it.”
(28) Haran was standing there, divided.
(29) He said, “<i>Ma nafshakh</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is best translated in context as, “What’s the difference?” It is used in talmudic legal discussion to mean, “whatever your opinion…” or “in any event…” and usually prefaces a rejoinder to an argument of the following form: “Whatever your opinion of X, you would certainly say Y.”</i> If Avraham wins, I will say, ‘I am with Avraham,’ and if Nimrod wins, I will say, ‘I am with Nimrod.’”
(30) When Avraham went down into the furnace of fire and was saved, they said to him, “Whose are you?”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “Whose side are you on?”</i> and he said to them, “I am with Avraham.”
(31) They took him and threw him into the flames and his innards were scorched
(32) and he came out and died on the face of Terah his father.
(33) That is what it says, “And Haran died on the face of Terah his father.”
<b>The Use of Structure as an Interpretive Tool</b>
Our study of the <i>mashal</i> and our discussion of the midrashic story (Chapter 8) have made it clear how important structure is in understanding the message of a midrash. But while the <i>mashal</i> form is fairly well-defined structurally, each narrative expansion is structurally unique. This, unfortunately, makes it hard to decide how to divide a given story.
In the case of this midrash, however, at least one of the structural elements is apparent immediately – the story is composed almost exclusively of dialogues between Avraham and the other characters, a feature that enables us to see fairly easily how the story is organized.
In addition, this long and rather detailed story has a well-defined turning point: the moment at which Terah hands his son Avraham over to Nimrod, ruler of Ur of the Chaldees (line 18). So decisive is this turning point that it draws our attention to the strong contrast between the first and second parts of the story. (Many people even remember this story as two separate stories). The two sections are sharply distinguished in setting and mood; the private setting of Terah’s shop in the first half of the story is opposed to the public arena of Nimrod’s court in the second. The lighthearted mood of the first part also contrasts dramatically with the horrifying climax in the second. The power of this midrash lies, in part, in the juxtaposition between the first and second sections of the story, and the connection made between them.
The story may be outlined as follows:
(Lines 2–3) / Terah leaves his son Avraham in charge of his business,
/   setting the stage for what follows.
(Lines 4–7) / A stylized synopsis of Avraham’s dialogues with his
/   father’s customers.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A number of clues in the text indicate that this dialogue represents several such conversations, rather than a single exchange. The first is the use of the subjunctive mood (“would come,” “would say”) using the auxiliary <i>hava</i> in the original Aramaic, rather than the simple past. See also line 5, which is clearly not the answer of one person. Finally, note that Avraham’s encounter with the woman is preceded by the phrase, “One time,” indicating that his encounter with her – as opposed to the ones that precede it – is unique.</i>
(Lines 8–10) / Avraham’s encounter with the woman.
(Line 10) / Avraham breaks the idols.
(Lines 11–17) / Avraham’s dialogue with his father (which contains the
/   fabricated dialogue between the idols in lines 13–15).
(Line 18) / Terah hands Avraham over to Nimrod.
(Lines 19–27) / Avraham’s dialogue with Nimrod.
(Lines 28–29) / Haran’s internal dialogue.
(Line 30) / Haran’s dialogue with Nimrod’s followers.
(Lines 31–32) / Haran’s death “on the face of Terah his father.”
(Line 33) / A return to the biblical text by means of the verse that
/   connects this story with the biblical account of Avraham.
<b>Linguistic Ambiguity Reflecting Cognitive Dissonance</b>
The first line of this story (line 2) sets the stage for what follows by informing us that “Terah was a maker/worshipper of idols.” The word <i>oved</i> that appears in the original source is a cleverly planted pun, made possible by the transition from one language to another. The root <i>ayin – bet – dalet</i> denotes “work” or “worship” in Hebrew, but in Aramaic it means “make” or “do.” In the Hebrew context of the first sentence of the story, then, Terah is an idol <i>worshipper</i>, but in the Aramaic context of the rest of the story, he is a <i>manufacturer</i> of idols. The absurdity of Terah’s position mirrors the cognitive dissonance that governs the larger society portrayed in this midrash.
<b>The First Dialogue: Avraham and the Customers</b>
This cognitive dissonance comes strongly to the fore in Avraham’s prototypical dialogue with his father’s customers (lines 4–7). Avraham tries to make them aware of the absurdity of their actions; how can a grown man with many years life experience worship an object made yesterday? His argument seems eminently reasonable to us and, significantly, none of the customers attempt to refute it. Instead, we are told, the person with whom Avraham was arguing “would be embarrassed and go away” (line 7).
What is striking about this exchange is that R. Hiyya characterizes the reaction of the customers as embarrassment. This implies that Avraham is not telling his father’s customers something they don’t already know. If he were, we might expect them to react with shock (“What are you saying?!”) or anger (“How dare you defile the sanctity of the gods!”) or, perhaps, wonder (“I never thought of that.”) or even gratitude (“Thank you for enlightening me.”) Any of these attitudes would indicate that the customers are true believers whose ideas are challenged by his argument against idol worship. The ugly truth revealed in this dialogue is that anyone who would purchase an idol is already aware that idol worship is a sham. The only possible reasons a <i>purchaser</i> of idols would continue to practice idol <i>worship</i> are convention and/or expediency. Terah’s customers cannot be persuaded out of idol worship even though they do not believe in it, but they <i>can</i> be embarrassed by Avraham’s exposure of a socially convenient arrangement as a lie.
<b>The Second Dialogue: Avraham and the Woman</b>
The next section of the midrash (lines 8–10) presents a completely different sort of situation. Unlike the preceding composite dialogue, meant to represent several such conversations, this encounter is unique.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See footnote 3.</i> Avraham’s antagonist here is a woman, the only female character in the narrative. And, unlike the customers who come to <i>buy</i> idols, this woman has entered the shop with the express purpose of <i>serving</i> them. Finally, this episode, unlike most of the rest of this story, contains no verbal interchange.
The crucial importance of this episode to the rest of the story is clear in Avraham’s reaction to it. After his encounter with the woman, Avraham breaks the idols, an action so radical and uncompromising that it leads to his being cast into the furnace by Nimrod. What in Avraham’s interaction with the woman triggers this change from the reasoned persuasion found in the preceding section of the story?
I would like to suggest that Avraham’s encounter with the woman is so decisive because it is his first confrontation with a true believer in idols. In contrast to his father’s customers, this woman wishes not to possess gods in an expression of the prevailing conventions of society, but to serve them as an act of self-sacrifice and piety. Her impulse is intellectually mistaken, but her intent is spiritually pure and emotionally valid, resembling Avraham’s own impassioned commitment to God. As the only female character in the story, the woman represents pure emotion and devotion, the antithesis of the rationalization and equivocation that characterize Terah’s customers.
R. Hiyya does not show us any attempt on the part of Avraham to argue with the woman as he did with the customers in the previous dialogue, and we may well assume he did not break the idols in her presence. If he had, it is inconceivable that the woman, a true believer, would not have reacted and, in fact, the story records no such reaction. Perhaps Avraham is not shown arguing with the woman because trying rational persuasion with a true believer would either provoke angry resistance or risk breaking the believer’s spirit. The problem, Avraham realizes, is not the woman’s desire to worship, but the absence of any worthy focus for that desire in his society. The only solution is to destroy the idols and declare war on the hypocrisy of his father’s world.
<b>The Third Dialogue: Avraham and Terah</b>
Terah returns to discover the damage to his merchandise, and in the ensuing dialogue (lines 11–17), the contradiction inherent in Terah’s position is exposed once again. His very first question, “Who did this to them?” (line 11), shows clearly that he doesn’t even entertain the possibility that idols have power to act, despite Avraham’s having “planted the evidence” in the largest idol’s hand.
Avraham’s answer (lines 12–13) is a clever and subtle rebuke to his father. Exploiting the real-life situation that precipitated his breaking of the idols, he constructs a scenario in which the idols quarrel over the woman’s offering until the largest idol breaks all the others (lines 13–15). This narrative accomplishes two things. Avraham tricks his father into an admission that he himself does not believe in the power of the idols: “Why are you mocking me? And do they know?!” (line 16). Even more importantly, Avraham exposes the system of idol worship as a cruel one, founded in a conception of the gods as greedy beings opposing one another – and human beings as well – in adversarial relationships, their divinity based solely on the exercise of brute force. Terah’s gods, in truth, are made “in the image of Man.” The picture is not a pretty one.
Avraham’s response to Terah’s exasperated rejection of his fabrication can be read as an impassioned attempt to break through his father’s willful self-deception: “Don’t your ears hear what your mouth is saying?!” (line 17). Avraham’s argument is clearly unanswerable, as is evident from Terah’s silence. Unlike his customers, however, Terah cannot simply walk away from the situation. Avraham has declared war on his father’s values, and his actions pose so great a threat that Terah commits the ultimate act of parental betrayal – he hands Avraham over to the authorities (line 18).
Terah’s purpose in bringing Avraham to Nimrod’s court is not entirely clear. Is he just trying to cow Avraham into submission? Does he want to see Avraham punished? Is he hopeful that Nimrod, a greater authority than himself, will be able to persuade Avraham of the error of his ways? Whatever his purpose, Terah has taken such a serious step because he sees no alternative; he cannot cope with the dangerously subversive Avraham himself, so he hands him over to Nimrod despite the king’s life-and-death power over his subjects.
Terah’s action is not motivated by the selfless love of a father. It stems from the desire to protect himself, his property, and his standing in society. In taking this action, though, Terah has unwittingly confirmed Avraham’s accusation: Terah believes that might makes right. His gods are the incarnation of his society’s values.
<b>The Fourth Dialogue: Avraham and Nimrod</b>
At first glance, the dialogue between Avraham and Nimrod (lines 19–27) seems to undermine Avraham’s critique of his society. Initially, in fact, Nimrod appears remarkably tolerant of Avraham. When Nimrod tells Avraham to worship fire (Nimrod’s personal deity, as it turns out) and Avraham suggests that it would be more appropriate to worship water because water extinguishes fire (line 20), Nimrod goes along with the suggestion. This sets in motion a <i>had gadya</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Had gadya</i> (“One little kid”) is one of the festive songs with which the Passover seder ends. It is structured in a “This-is-the-house-that-Jack-built” fashion, beginning with the purchase of a goat, which is eaten by a cat, which is in turn eaten by a dog, etc.</i>of sorts in which Avraham suggests yet another deity to worship, more powerful than the previous one, and Nimrod acquiesces. Until the last line of this dialogue, when Nimrod tells Avraham that he will be thrown into the fire (line 27), the conversation between Avraham and Nimrod echoes the humorous tone of Avraham’s dialogue with Terah’s customers, and the ironic scenario Avraham has prepared for his father.
R. Hiyya constructs his narrative to invite the reader to laugh at the inconsistencies and contradictions of idol worship in these three dialogues. Significantly, however, in only the first of the three exchanges is the tone genuinely lighthearted; Avraham’s dialogues with his father’s customers culminate in nothing worse than some well-deserved shame. The humor in the dialogues with Terah and Nimrod, though, takes on sinister hues, when we consider how each of the episodes ends. Avraham bests his father verbally, but his father retaliates by placing Avraham in a highly threatening situation. Nimrod, likewise, appears to go along with Avraham’s reduction of the institution of idol worship to absurdity but really has no intention of allowing Avraham to win the argument.
By structuring Avraham’s interaction with Nimrod in this way, R. Hiyya shows us the iron fist that rests so firmly in the velvet glove of idol worship. Nimrod is shown to be tolerant of Avraham’s pick-and-choose method for selecting a deity because polytheism is, in principle, a tolerant ideology, at least in some ways. One can choose one’s god from an almost unlimited supply, and worship as many gods as one wishes because polytheism presupposes a multiplicity of divinities. However, the world view that gives rise to this wealth of gods is not in reality positive and does not espouse a genuine tolerance; the gods are portrayed as violent forces in constant competition with one another, and their relationship with humankind is anything but benevolent. Much of the mythology of polytheistic religions describes the vengeful, jealous interactions of the gods with one another and with humanity, and the ritual of these religions largely involves the appeasement of these dangerous gods. For the pagan mind, the world is a dangerous place full of powerful forces that must be appeased. Power is god.
The pagan mind-set is necessary to Nimrod’s hold on power. Since he maintains his rule by exercising force, he needs subjects who fear and worship power.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In light of this, it is not surprising that Nimrod’s personal deity is fire. Mastery of fire is the beginning of human technology and control over the surrounding environment.</i> As Nimrod implies by going along with Avraham’s suggestions at the beginning of the dialogue, it doesn’t matter to him which god Avraham chooses as long as he does not reject the premises of polytheism. Monotheism represents the only real threat to Nimrod’s dominance because it portrays the world in a way which undermines the fear and the valuing of power. Avraham’s conception of a single, benevolent God Who relates to human beings according to their deeds radically challenges the values of a society that runs on the basis of competition and assumes the absolute value and primacy of power.
Nimrod is tolerant up to the point at which Avraham indicates that he refuses to accept the framework and basic assumptions of his society’s belief system. Avraham does this by bringing his argument around to its unavoidable conclusion: “Let us worship Man, who bears the wind” (line 26). As in his dialogue with Terah, Avraham is conveying two ideas here: First, he is exposing the logical absurdities of polytheistic theology. Second, and more significantly, he is telling Nimrod that his religious pretensions are merely a cynical excuse to maintain his own position. Ultimately, Avraham implies, you wish to worship yourself, and idol worship provides you with the perfect cover for your actions; your religion boils down to “worship[ping] man,” more specifically, yourself. In much the same way that Avraham has shown his father that the gods he worships are not only powerless but a reflection of a cruel society, he shows Nimrod that his theology is nonsense and that Nimrod himself is corrupt. And like Terah, who reacts with force when Avraham’s actions threaten his livelihood and his place in society, Nimrod protects the foundations of his power by simply disposing of Avraham – or at least attempting to.
Nimrod’s words to Avraham at this point in the narrative are particularly telling: “You are speaking foolishness. I worship none other than fire. Here, I will throw you into its midst, and let the God that you worship come and save you from it” (line 27). As in the dialogue between Terah and Avraham, Nimrod does not try to refute Avraham’s argument on logical grounds, nor does he attempt to appeal to piety, filial devotion, or even his right as king to command his subject’s respect. Nimrod is far more cynical than that, and his cynicism is given no fig leaf here. Nimrod simply says in effect, “The sword is mightier than the pen. Your being right is irrelevant, because I have the power to kill you. I don’t care that I cannot make you agree with me, because might really does make right.”
R. Hiyya structures the narrative so that the dialogue between Avraham and Nimrod is the longest in the whole story, perhaps because in this dialogue the pagan position is given its fullest, most brutal, and most explicit expression. If the reader has been lulled by the first part of the story into thinking that idol worship is primarily a foolish error, here he is shown that it is anything but innocuous.
<b>Haran’s Internal Dialogue</b>
In the next three sections of the story, we realize that the exchange between Avraham and Nimrod has taken place in the presence of an audience. Avraham’s brother Haran is there, as is Terah, and at least some of Nimrod’s followers (lines 28–32).
While Avraham is being brought to the furnace to be burned for his heresy, Haran is “standing there, divided” (line 28). Apparently, of all the people who are witnessing Avraham’s discussion with Nimrod, he alone is willing to consider the possibility that Avraham may be right. It is not clear what motivates Haran. Fraternal loyalty? Intellectual curiosity? A desire to see Nimrod bested? In any case, the language in which he couches his internal dilemma is highly significant: “<i>Ma nafshakh</i>? If Avraham <i>wins</i>, I will say, ‘I am with Avraham,’ and if Nimrod <i>wins</i>, I will say, ‘I am with Nimrod’” (line 29). Clearly, Haran is not motivated by anything like the strong conviction that supports Avraham. Furthermore, Haran’s mindset is still governed by the notions of power and competitiveness that prevail in his society; Avraham is right only if he wins, and Haran will side with him only on those grounds. Haran is very far removed from Avraham’s spiritual depth and great moral courage, but there is at least some independence of spirit in his willingness to entertain a possibility that no one else will even consider.
<b>The Reaction of the On-Lookers</b>
Possibly the most remarkable part of this story, as R. Hiyya has structured it, is the end (lines 30–32). Incredibly, the fact that Avraham survives his trial by fire seems to have no effect on any of the on-lookers at Nimrod’s court. This may be seen by their interrogation of Haran and their willingness to throw him into the fire when his answer places him in Avraham’s camp. They seem neither impressed by the obvious miracle that has taken place before their eyes, nor do they seem concerned that it might be replayed in Haran’s case.
Interestingly, the miracle, which could have been showcased as the most important part of this narrative, is given very short shrift by R. Hiyya himself. While Avraham’s dialogues with his various antagonists are carefully developed, the miracle of his salvation from a horrible death is recounted in only a few words (six, to be exact, in the original) in an adverbial clause that introduces Haran’s dialogue with his interrogators (line 30). Furthermore, in keeping with the chronology of the biblical text, R. Hiyya does not introduce God as a presence into this story, except by implication. “The God that Avraham worships” has come through for him, but the story gives us no reason to think that Avraham expects Him to.
Why does R. Hiyya craft the story in this way? Perhaps, he wishes to draw our attention to the true miracle of the story: not the Divine intervention that saves Avraham from a certain death, but faith, which places Avraham on a collision course with his society, and moral greatness, which makes him willing to die for his convictions. Those attributes distinguish Avraham from everyone else, including Haran. The society as a whole holds power to be the greatest good, and values expediency above principle.
In light of this, it is not difficult to understand why the great miracle of Avraham’s survival does not make a dent in the cynicism of Nimrod and his followers. As we have seen with Terah’s customers, and with Terah himself, whether something is true or right is totally irrelevant to Nimrod and his followers. In fact, they know that Avraham is right before the miracle has taken place; Nimrod, after all, has not attempted to refute Avraham’s argument on grounds of either logic or belief. God’s miraculous intervention on Avraham’s behalf does not tell Nimrod and his followers something they don’t already know. They are simply unwilling to change their minds, for to do so would require them to restructure their lives and their society in ways they are unwilling to explore. They don’t want to face the implications of Avraham’s faith so they ignore everything – logic, family loyalty, miracles – that threatens the comfortable status quo. This is reflected in the question Haran is asked: “<i>Whose</i> are you?” What matters in Nimrod’s court is not what Haran thinks about what has happened, but where his public allegiance lies: with Avraham, who represents the uncomfortable truth, or with the mainstream of society.
<b>Haran’s Death</b>
The manner of Haran’s death underlines for us the crucial difference between Avraham and Haran: “They took him and threw him into the flames and <i>his innards were scorched</i>” (line 31). Given that Haran, like Avraham, has shown himself willing to brave the wrath of society, the reader might wonder why Haran has not been miraculously saved as Avraham was. But the manner of Haran’s death, like the internal dialogue that shows us his decision-making process, tells us that Haran is far from Avraham’s spiritual level. Unlike Avraham, who is all of a piece, Haran is “divided.” He may look like Avraham superficially and indeed, his body is not burned – he is able to emerge from the furnace and die “on the face of Terah his father.” Internally, however, Haran is corrupt, and the fire scorches his insides. For Haran, as for the rest of society, expediency rules. What appears at first glance to be moral courage is merely the desire to side with the winner in a power struggle. Haran’s death is an inevitable consequence of the way he has lived his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Haran is the father of Lot. The midrashic portrayal of Haran here goes a long way toward explaining why Lot is not Avraham’s successor. Like his father, Lot is ruled by expediency rather than principle.</i>
By the same token, R. Hiyya understands Haran’s death as an inevitable consequence of the way Terah has lived his life. Haran’s death is for Terah not only the tragedy of a father who lives to bury his own son. It is also a rebuke, because the fate Haran suffers is set in motion by Terah’s religious hypocrisy and by his betrayal of a father’s role in handing Avraham over to Nimrod. By the time we get to the closing sentence of this narrative expansion, we re-read the biblical verse with a vivid and horrifying image of what it means: “They took him and threw him into the flames and his innards were scorched, and he came out and died on the face of Terah his father. <i>That is what it says, ‘And Haran died on the face of Terah his father</i>’” (lines 31–33).
<b>Interpretive Aspects of the Story</b>
Although we can understand the plain sense of Genesis 11:26–32 without recourse to this midrash, it is organically connected to the biblical text. Nothing in this narrative expansion contradicts the biblical story, and many details in the biblical text are nicely bound up by it. Foremost, of course, is the oddity of the phrase “on the face of Terah his father” (Genesis 11:28). But additional details are also better understood in light of this midrash. Why, for example, does Terah leave his home and set out for Canaan at a time when male members of society would leave their birthplaces only under extreme duress, such as situations of war or famine? Why does Avraham take Haran’s son Lot with him on his journey to Canaan after the death of Terah, and why is Lot apparently eager to accompany him (Genesis 12:4–5)? Finally, this midrash is one of many which fill a gaping hole in the Avraham story, namely the motivation for God’s choice of Avraham to carry His message to the world. As we noted in our discussion of the <i>mashal</i> of the passerby and the fortress (Chapter 3) nothing in the biblical account at the end of Genesis 11 prepares us for God’s call to Avraham in Genesis 12:1. In contrast to Noah, identified as a righteous man who has found favor in God’s eyes, Avraham is virtually a cipher at the beginning of his story. God’s choice of Noah as builder of the ark is comprehensible given what we are told about him; of Avraham we know only his place in his family constellation, that he is married to a barren woman named Sarai, and that he has accompanied his father on a migration to Canaan. This midrash helps us understand why God has chosen Avraham. The Avraham of R. Hiyya’s story has amply demonstrated worthiness both in his faith and in his character.

Chapter 10; Resolving a Discrepancy; Moshe and His Father's Voice

<b>Resolving a Discrepancy:<br>Moshe and His Father’s Voice</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Just then [as Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Yosef,] the image of his father came to him, appearing before him in the window....</i> (<i>Sota</i> 36b)</span>
The Amida opens with a blessing in which we address “our Lord, and the Lord of our fathers,” a phrase that links our individual connections with God to an ancestral heritage. The mechanism that transforms an inherited commitment into a personal one is mysterious and difficult to describe.
Chapters 3 and 4 of Exodus recount Moshe’s initiation into prophecy.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Exodus 3 in its entirety to facilitate understanding of the midrashic discussion.</i> Moshe’s encounter with God at the age of eighty follows many years of separation from his family, a consequence of his flight from Egypt as a young man. The two midrashim that follow explore the connection between Moshe’s readiness for prophecy and his father’s voice.
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
And He said, ‘I am the Lord of your father, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov; and Moshe hid his face because he was afraid to look at the Lord. (Exodus 3:6)
<i>Exodus Rabba</i> 3:1 comments:
(1) And He said, “I am the Lord of your father....”
(2) That is [the meaning of the verse], “A fool (<i>peti</i>) will believe everything…” (Proverbs 14:15).
(3) What is ‘a fool’? A lad (<i>naar</i>).
(4) For in Arabia they call a lad thus – <i>patya.</i>
(5) Another explanation:
(6) <i>Peti</i> is none other than an expression of enticement (<i>pituy</i>), as it says, “And if a man seduces (<i>yifateh</i>)…” (Exodus 22:15).
(7) R. Yehoshua the <i>kohen</i>, son of Nehemia said,
(8) “At the hour that the Holy One blessed be He revealed [Himself] to Moshe, Moshe was a novice in prophecy.
(9) The Holy One blessed be He said,
(10) ‘If I reveal Myself to him in a great voice, I will frighten him.
(11) If I reveal Myself to him in a subdued voice, he will take the prophecy lightly.’
(12) What did He do?
(13) He revealed [Himself] to him [Moshe] with the voice of his father.
(14) Moshe said, ‘Here I am (<i>Hineni</i>); what does Father request?’
(15) The Holy One blessed be He said to him,
(16) ‘I am not your father, but rather the Lord of your father.
(17) I came to you with an enticement, so that you would not be frightened.
(18) [I am] the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov.’
(19) Moshe rejoiced and said,
(20) ‘Oh! Father is counted with the Patriarchs,
(21) and not only that, but he is the greatest [of them] for he is mentioned first!’”
The conclusion of this narrative expansion appears several paragraphs later in <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 3:7 as follows:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>Exodus Rabba</i> follows the order of the passages in Exodus, there is a great deal of midrashic commentary on the intervening verses between the first part of this narrative expansion and its conclusion.</i>
And the Lord also said to Moshe, “Thus you should say to the children of Israel, God, the Lord of your fathers, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you; this is My name forever, and this is My remembrance in every generation” (Exodus 3:15).
(1) [God said to Moshe,] “Go and say to them,
(2) by My name, which is the attribute of mercy, with it I will conduct myself toward them, in the merit of their fathers [the Patriarchs]
(3) And know, [that when I speak about the merit of their fathers] I speak of the Patriarchs – Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov.
(4) That is [what it means when] it says, ‘God, the Lord of your fathers, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you.’”
(5) And when Moshe heard this, that [God] did not mention his father as He had done at the beginning,
(6) he said to Him, “Master of the Universe, are there sinners in the grave?”
(7) He [God] said to him, “No.”
(8) He said before Him, “In the past, You linked Your name with my father’s and now You have removed it.”
(9) He [God] said to Him, “In the beginning, I enticed you with an enticement.
(10) From now on, I will speak only words of truth with you.”
<b>The Interpretive Difficulty</b>
As we will see elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12.</i> the context in which we read a text may be narrow or broad. The same can be said of a textual problem; a word, phrase, verse, or textual unit might be comprehensible when read in its immediate context, but then become problematic when read in a larger one.
The midrashic commentators in <i>Exodus Rabba</i> read Exodus 3 with great sensitivity to both the local context (the use of an unusual phrase within the context of a verse) and the more global one (the absence of the same phrase where it might have been expected later in the chapter). The phrase in question, “I am the Lord of your father,” with which God identifies Himself to Moshe at the beginning of their long dialogue, requires comment for two reasons. First, the phrase is unusual, appearing only four times in the entire <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The first two appearances of the phrase are in Genesis. In Genesis 46:3, when God tells Yaakov to go down to Egypt and not to be afraid, He refers to Himself as “the Lord of your father.” In Genesis 50:17, the brothers of Yosef, in asking his forgiveness after the death of their father say, “…and now please bear the sin of the servants of the Lord of your father.” In both these cases, the father referred to is one of the Patriarchs. The third occurrence is discussed above. The last place this phrase occurs is in the first book of Chronicles 28:9 when David, addressing Shlomo, says, “And you, Shlomo, my son, know the Lord of your father…,” the father in question being, of course, himself.</i> Second, the phrase, which in verse 6 <i>precedes</i> the description of God as the Lord of Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov, is missing from verse 15 when God tells Moshe, “Thus you should say to the children of Israel, God, the Lord of your fathers, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you....”
The first midrash cited above offers an explanation for the presence of the words “I am the Lord of your father” in the form of a narrative expansion. The first part of the midrash (lines 1–6) is a <i>petihta</i>-like<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>petihta</i> is a biblical verse used to introduce a midrash. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the <i>petihta.</i></i> introduction which offers both textual proof and a psychological underpinning for the story that follows (lines 7–21).
<b>The <i>Petihta</i>: Setting the Stage for the Narrative Expansion</b>
In line 2 we are told that God’s introduction of Himself to Moshe as “the Lord of your father” illustrates a principle stated in Proverbs, namely that a fool <i>(peti)</i> will believe anything. The midrash then goes on to provide two definitions for the term ‘fool’: a fool is either a lad (line 3), or a person who has been enticed/seduced (line 6). Substantiation is offered for each of these possible readings. For the ‘lad’ reading, the supporting evidence is etymological – in Arabia a lad is called a <i>patya</i> (line 4). The Hebrew root <i>p-t-y</i> is related to its cognate root <i>p-t-y</i> in Aramaic<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The language of the time in Arabia was Aramaic, not Arabic. See the entry on Arabic language (Old Arabic) in the <i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>. See also <i>Sanhedrin</i> 110b for the use of the word <i>patya</i> as <i>yanuka</i> (child). This usage is attributed to inhabitants of port cities (<i>krakhei hayam</i>) and not to Arabians.</i> with a shift in meaning from ‘fool’ to ‘lad.’ For the enticement/seduction reading, the midrash gives us a prooftext. It relates the word <i>‘peti’</i> to a verse in Exodus that describes a situation of seduction (<i>pituy, yifateh)</i> (line 6).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This reading is grammatically sound as well because the roots for both <i>peti</i> and <i>pituy</i> are the same.</i>
While each of these definitions of <i>peti</i> are possible if read in isolation from the rest of the midrash, a first reading of lines 1–6 is puzzling, even provocative. It is hard to see, at first glance, how either of the meanings of <i>peti</i> can be said to apply to Moshe. At the time of his encounter with God at the burning bush, Moshe is eighty years old – hardly a lad – and there is no apparent enticement in this encounter.
<b>The Narrative Expansion</b>
The second part of the midrash (lines 7–21) resolves the questions that have been raised in the reader’s mind by lines 1–6 and reconciles the differing interpretations of the word <i>‘peti’</i> that are proposed there. This part of the midrash may itself be divided into two parts, God’s “dilemma” (lines 8–11) and its resolution (lines 12–21).
God’s “dilemma” is introduced as follows: “at the hour that the Holy One blessed be He revealed [Himself] to Moshe, Moshe was a <i>novice</i> in prophecy” (line 8). Although Moshe is an old man in chronological terms, he is only a ‘lad’ in terms of the prophetic experience. If God overwhelms Moshe with “a great voice,” Moshe may become frightened (line 10), but should God reveal himself in “a subdued voice,” Moshe may not take the experience of prophecy seriously enough (line 11). In either case, Moshe will be responding like a fool, and the root of his foolishness will be his lad-like inexperience, as the first explanation of the verse from Proverbs would have us understand.
<b>The Power of a Father’s Voice</b>
The resolution of God’s “dilemma” is to appear to Moshe “with the voice of his father” (line 13). A father’s voice is unmistakable and commands automatic respect without intimidating, because it is associated with our earliest experiences of both love and obedience. Hearing Amram’s voice would prevent two possible negative reactions Moshe might have toward his first prophetic experience: terror or indifference. In a loving father-son relationship, the sound of one’s father’s voice may inspire many emotions, but terror and indifference are not among them. The fact that Moshe responds instinctively with ‘<i>Hineni</i>, what does Father request?’ (line 14) indicates more than anything else that Amram’s voice has evoked precisely those emotions God wishes Moshe to feel. These emotions – love and obedience – are what compel us to make the ancestral connection to God a personal one. Moshe has taken on the yoke of prophecy even before he realizes it the instant he begins to associate his father’s voice with God’s.
The fact that Amram has long since died is irrelevant to Moshe’s instinctive response. A parent’s voice is so distinctive and so deeply embedded in the unconscious that logic plays no part in our reaction to it. Imagine, for example, being caught unawares by the tape-recorded sound of a long-dead mother’s voice. One might respond to the stimulus of that voice automatically before realizing that the voice heard could not possibly be that of a living person.
<b>Bringing the Narrative Expansion Back to the Text</b>
Here the narrative expansion reads Exodus 3:1–7 with great delicacy, beautifully resolving a subtle difficulty in the text. The sequence of events is as follows: Moshe sees the burning bush (verse 2), and he approaches to take a closer look (verse 3). In verse 4, God calls to Moshe from the bush and Moshe responds with the classic ‘<i>Hineni</i>’ of immediate compliance. God tells Moshe to remove his shoes because he is standing on hallowed ground (verse 5), and in verse 6, God finally identifies Himself as “the Lord of your father, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov....” Only then does the text tell us that “Moshe hid his face because he was afraid to look at the Lord.”
If God has been speaking to Moshe from the beginning of the chapter, why does Moshe hide his face only at this point? According to the midrash, the voice that has spoken until now is evidently not recognized by Moshe as the voice of God. The voice he hears <i>is</i> familiar to Moshe; we see this in his instinctively obedient response, “<i>Hineni</i>” (which the midrash understands to mean, “Here I am; what does Father request?” line 14). The midrashic claim that Moshe has heard his father’s voice meshes well with the sequence of events in the verses and explains why God identifies Himself only in verse 6. Only after Moshe says, “<i>Hineni,</i>” signifying that he has made the necessary transition to a receptive frame of mind, can God reveal Himself, and only then does Moshe realize that he is in the presence of God and hides his face.
Moshe’s “<i>Hineni</i>” elicits God’s rejoinder that He is not Moshe’s father, but rather the God of Moshe’s father, and that “<i>I came to you with an enticement so that you would not be frightened.</i> [I am] the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov” (lines 16–18). In telling Moshe that He is the God of Amram, God has provided Moshe with the identification necessary for making the connection between the Presence Who is addressing him and the ancestral God of his heritage.
The reader, forewarned by the introductory section of the midrash that a fool is easily enticed (line 6), is alerted to the warning implicit in the statement, “I came to you with an enticement” (line 17). The enticement referred to is, of course, the use of the phrase, “I am the Lord of your father” (verse 6), which is open to Moshe’s erroneous interpretation that his father is counted among the Patriarchs. (If this is not immediately clear to readers, it becomes retrospectively obvious when they read the concluding midrash.) Moshe, not surprisingly, assumes that the enticement referred to is the use of his father’s voice to call him and, ironically, demonstrates just how thoroughly he has been seduced by assuming joyfully that “Father is counted with the Patriarchs, and not only that, but he is the greatest [of them] for he is mentioned first!” (lines 20–21).
Righteous though Amram was, no unbiased observer would have concluded that he was of the stature of the Patriarchs. Moshe’s reaction clearly demonstrates that one of the roots of foolishness is the willingness to be seduced, as the second explanation of the term ‘<i>peti’</i> has clarified for us.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Moshe’s desire to believe that his father is in the category of the Patriarchs is entirely natural, given the partiality of any son – of whatever age – for his own father. In Moshe’s case this desire is especially poignant because of the unusual circumstances of Moshe’s upbringing in Par’oh’s house rather than his own.</i>
<b>The Concluding Midrash</b>
In the verses that intervene between verse 6 and verse 15 of Exodus 3, God tells Moshe to go to Egypt and save the Jewish people (verses 7–10), and Moshe attempts to evade the task God wishes to place on him (verse 11).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12.</i> God answers Moshe’s objections (verse 12), and Moshe then says, “Here I will come to the children of Israel and I will say to them, ‘The Lord of your fathers has sent me to you.’ And they will say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What should I say to them?” (verse 13). God offers three answers to Moshe’s question,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13.</i> culminating in, “Thus you should say to the children of Israel, God, the Lord of your <i>fathers</i>, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you; this is My name forever, and this is My remembrance in every generation” (verse 15).
In this description, Moshe – much like the author of this concluding midrash – is alerted to the absence of a phrase that was present at the beginning of his conversation with God in verse 6. Moshe expects to hear that the name with which he is to identify God to the children of Israel will be linked with the name of his father, and not only with the names of the Patriarchs Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov. The midrash makes the point that the absence of this phrase is explicit and intentional by elaborating God’s words to Moshe in verse 15 thus: “Go and say to them, by My name…with it, I will conduct myself toward them in the merit of their fathers [the Patriarchs]. And know, [that when I speak about the merit of their fathers] I speak of the Patriarchs – Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov” (lines 1–3).
Moshe realizes that his father’s name has been omitted from the name of God that will be used to identify Him to the Jewish people. He questions its absence thus: “Master of the Universe, are there sinners in the grave?” (line 6), which is Moshe’s way of asking if something since Amram’s death has altered his spiritual status. Since Moshe must know that there are no sinners in the grave, this question is meant to imply the reproach that is made explicit in line 8: “In the past You linked Your name with my father’s and now You have removed it.”
God’s answer is straightforward and unequivocal: “<i>In the beginning, I enticed you with an enticement.</i> From now on, I will speak only words of truth with you” (lines 9–10). These words bring us back to line 17 of the first midrash: “I came to you with an enticement, so that you would not be frightened,” words which now resonate completely differently for both the reader and Moshe. Moshe now realizes that the use of his father’s voice was not the true enticement, but rather the use of the phrase, “I am the Lord of your father.”
<b>Enticement and Truth</b>
The two related midrashim we have examined here are carefully structured to offer us both a finely nuanced reading of Exodus 3:6–15 and a plausible account of Moshe’s initiation into prophecy. At the same time, these midrashim offer an understanding of human ‘foolishness’ that extends well beyond the story of Moshe at the burning bush. Using the story of Moshe as object lesson, the authors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> demonstrate that ‘foolishness’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The terms <i>peti</i> and <i>hakham</i> (wise person) as they appear in the book of Proverbs (as well as elsewhere in <i>Tanakh</i>) are not meant to refer primarily to intellectual ability, but are expressive of a person’s moral intelligence. For this reason, the <i>hakham</i> of Proverbs is interchangeable with the <i>tzaddik</i> (righteous person) and is as often placed in opposition to the <i>rasha</i> (wicked person), as to the ‘fool’ (<i>peti</i>, <i>kesil</i> or <i>eveel</i>). Likewise, the terms <i>rasha, peti, kesil,</i> and <i>eveel</i> are effectively interchangeable in Proverbs.</i> is often a function of inexperience and/or vulnerability to enticement – <i>peti, patya,</i> and <i>pituy</i> are related both grammatically and conceptually. Moshe errs not because he is unintelligent, but because he is a novice in his relationship with God, and because – quite understandably – he would like to believe that his father is of the stature of the Patriarchs. The solution to both these problems comes when God tells Moshe that his initiation is over and that despite the comfort of enticement, only the truth has validity: “<i>In the beginning,</i> I enticed you with an enticement. <i>From now on</i>, I will speak only words of truth with you” (lines 9–10). In effect, God is telling Moshe that his inexperience and willingness to be seduced were necessary stepping-stones to arrive at the level he has now attained. These weaknesses must now be discarded because Moshe has already entered into the dialogue with God and no longer needs them. The moral message of these words has ramifications for the reader as well as for Moshe.

Chapter 11; Exploring the Significance of a Gesture; Moshe Hides His Face

<b>Exploring the Significance of a Gesture:<br>Moshe Hides His Face</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Seeing differs from looking, for seeing is with the visual sense, but looking means paying attention to something, and is not used to describe [merely] the seeing of the eye</i>.... (Malbim, Commentary on Torah, Exodus 3:6)</span>
When Moshe encounters God at the burning bush, he impulsively moves forward to “see this great sight” (Exodus 3:3). When God identifies Himself, Moshe then moves to hide his face: “And He said, ‘I am the Lord of your father, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov’; and Moshe hid his face because he was afraid to look at the Lord” (Exodus 3:6).
What is the significance of this gesture? <i>Exodus Rabba</i> explores the spiritual implications of Moshe’s reaction to the presence of the Divine.

(2) He said, “The Lord of my father stands here and I will not hide my face?”
(3) R. Yehoshua ben Karha, and R. Hoshaya [dispute this point]:
(4) One of them says, “Moshe did not do right when he hid his face,
(5) for had he not hidden his face, the Holy One blessed be He would have revealed to Moshe what is above and what is below, and what has been and what will be in the future.
(6) And in the end, he wished to see,
(7) as it says, ‘Show me please Your glory’ (Exodus 33:18).
(8) The Holy One blessed be He said to Moshe,
(9) ‘I came to show to you [what you are now asking to see], and you hid your face.’
(10) Now I say to you, ‘For no man will see me and live’ (Exodus 33:20).
(11) When I wanted [to show you], you did not want [to see].’”
(12) And R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi:
(13) “Even so, He did show him.
(14) In reward for ‘and Moshe hid his face (<i>panav</i>),’ [it later says] ‘And God would speak to Moshe face to face (<i>panim el panim</i>)’ (Exodus 33:11).
(15) And in reward for ‘because he was afraid (<i>ki yarei</i>),’ [it later says] ‘and they feared (<i>vayir’u</i>) to approach him’ (Exodus 34:30).
(16) And in merit of ‘to look (<i>mehabit</i>),’ [it later says] ‘and the picture of God he would see (<i>yabit</i>)’ (Numbers 12:8).”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In each of R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s prooftexts, the language of the verses cited as Moshe’s rewards shows a strong correspondence to the phrases quoted from Exodus 3:6.</i>
(17) And R. Hoshaya Rabba said:
(18) “Moshe did right when he hid his face.
(19) The Holy One blessed be He said to him,
(20) ‘I came to show you a friendly face, and you honored me and hid your face.
(21) By your life, in the future you will be with me on the mountain forty days and forty nights without eating and without drinking, and in the future you will have pleasure from the radiance of the Shekhina,’
(22) as it says, ‘And Moshe did not know that the skin of his face (<i>panav</i>) shone’ (Exodus 34:29).
(23) But Nadav and Avihu uncovered their heads and feasted their eyes on the radiance of the Shekhina,
(24) as it says, ‘And to the nobles of the children of Israel, He did not send out His hand…’ (Exodus 24:11),
(25) and didn’t they receive [a punishment] for what they did?”
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
At first glance the structure of this midrash seems straightforward – a dispute between R. Yehoshua ben Karha and R. Hoshaya Rabba about the significance of Moshe’s hiding of his face in the presence of God. In fact, line 3 prepares us to expect exactly that simplicity of structure. But as we read, we notice the interpolation of R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s commentary between that of R. Yehoshua ben Karha and that of R. Hoshaya Rabba, and the function of this commentary is not immediately apparent. To begin resolving this difficulty, we need to examine the structure of the whole paragraph.
A preliminary division of this midrash is as follows:
(1) The <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> (line 1)
(2) A narrative expansion of the phrase “and Moshe hid his face” (line 2)
(3) A comment about structure by the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> (line 3)
(4) R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s interpretation of the phrase “and Moshe hid his face” (lines 4–11)
(5) R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s commentary (lines 12–16)
(6) R. Hoshaya Rabba’s interpretation of the phrase “and Moshe hid his face” (lines 17–25)
<b>“<i>Yareh</i>”: Fear or Awe?</b>
Exodus 3:6 tells us that “Moshe hid his face because he was afraid (<i>yareh</i>) to look at the Lord.” If the biblical verse tells us why Moshe has hidden his face, wouldn’t that preclude the necessity of explaining this gesture? The verse, however, may be interpreted in more than one way; in biblical Hebrew, the word <i>yareh</i> (from the root <i>y-r-a</i>), may mean either fear (in the sense of fright/physical dread), or awe (in the sense of profound respect felt in the presence of the Divine or of greatness). Line 2 of our midrash interprets Moshe’s fear by voicing Moshe’s inner thoughts as, “The Lord of my father stands here and I will not hide my face?” The emotion conveyed in this formulation of Moshe’s reaction corresponds more with the ‘awe’ meaning than the ‘fright’ meaning.
At this point, we need to ask why the midrash prefers this reading of Moshe’s fear to the other possible reading. After all, nothing in the biblical verse privileges this interpretation over the other, and it would be reasonable in this context to understand Moshe’s gesture as an instinctive act of physical dread.
<b>R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s Interpretation</b>
In order to answer this question, we must see how this interpretation of Moshe’s gesture fits into the framework of the midrash as a whole. Our point of departure is R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s statement that, “Moshe did not do right when he hid his face” (line 4). In his view, God’s revelation to Moshe is an invitation of sorts, which Moshe improperly refuses. Had Moshe not withdrawn, God “would have revealed to Moshe what is above and what is below, and what has been and what will be in the future” (line 5). The proof that Moshe acted inappropriately, according to R. Yehoshua ben Karha, is that later, when Moshe asks God to, ”Show me please Your glory,” God refuses (lines 6–11). R. Yehoshua ben Karha interprets this as God’s way of showing Moshe, measure for measure, that he erred in hiding his face in his first encounter with God.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I hesitate to use the word ‘punishment’ to describe R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s understanding of God’s dialogue with Moshe in Exodus 33. A better description might be that, according to R. Yehoshua ben Karha, in Exodus 33, Moshe is forced to face the consequences of his mistaken action at the burning bush.</i>
<b>R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s Interpretation of Exodus 33</b>
R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s words, which follow those of R. Yehoshua ben Karha, do not address the spiritual significance of Moshe’s gesture at the burning bush directly. Instead, they challenge R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s interpretation of the dialogue between God and Moshe in Exodus 33. While R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s proof that Moshe acted wrongly is that “in the end he wished to see” (line 6) and was denied the opportunity, R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin asserts the opposite: “Even so, He did show him” (line 13).
R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin proposes an alternative reading of the events described in Exodus 3 and 33, juxtaposing phrases from Exodus 3:6 with verses from Exodus and Numbers that place a different, very positive, construction on Moshe’s hiding of his face (lines 14–16). Moshe hides his “face,” for example, and is later rewarded with God’s speaking to Moshe “face to face,” according to R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin (line 14). Each of R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s three prooftexts, in fact, describes the greatness of Moshe’s level of prophecy and the close nature of his relationship with God. The implication is clear: you, R. Yehoshua ben Karha, base your position that Moshe erred at the burning bush on God’s later refusal to show him His face. I, R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin, cannot accept your position. I maintain that Moshe was in fact shown all that any human being can be allowed to see of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin does not actually say so, God Himself makes that point to Moshe in refusing to show him His face: “And He said, ‘You will not be able to see My face, <i>for no man can see Me and live</i>” (Exodus 33:20). R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin may have chosen not to cite this verse because it contains the word ‘face,’ and could be used to counter-balance the positive citation of ‘face to face’ in verse 11.</i> Presented with R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s rebuttal of R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s proof, we can conclude that he disagrees with R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s evaluation of Moshe’s action, although he does not say so directly.
<b>R. Hoshaya Rabba’s Interpretation</b>
R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s comments are followed by R. Hoshaya Rabba’s explicit dismissal of R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s position: “Moshe did right when he hid his face” (line 18). R. Hoshaya Rabba understands Moshe’s gesture as an appropriate demonstration of respect. Although God is willing “to show [Moshe] a friendly face,” and would presumably have permitted Moshe to encounter Him without a covered face, it is fitting and praiseworthy that Moshe demonstrate modesty and humility by hiding his face in the presence of God (line 19).
R. Hoshaya Rabba offers two pieces of evidence for his position and presents each of them in a different framework. The first is incorporated into his narrative expansion of the verse as part of his description of God’s positive reaction to Moshe’s gesture: “The Holy One blessed be He said to him, ‘I came to show you a friendly face, and you honored me and hid your face. <i>By your life, in the future you will be with me on the mountain forty days and forty nights without eating and without drinking, and in the future you will have pleasure from the radiance of the Shekhina’”</i> (lines 19–21). Exodus 3:6 does not, in fact, record God’s reaction to Moshe’s gesture, but R. Hoshaya Rabba, like R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin, assumes that the extraordinary degree of closeness to God later attained by Moshe is evidence that the gesture of hiding his face is pleasing to God rather than otherwise. But while R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin painstakingly matches the language of his prooftexts with the phrasing of Exodus 3:6 (lines 14–16), R. Hoshaya Rabba offers the impressive nature of Moshe’s experience at Sinai as evidence that Moshe acted rightly in hiding his face. (We should note, though, that the prooftext R. Hoshaya Rabba cites (Exodus 34:29) also mentions Moshe’s face: “And Moshe did not know that the skin of his face (<i>panav</i>) shone.”)
The second piece of evidence that R. Hoshaya presents in defense of his position is addressed directly to the reader in lines 23–25: “But Nadav and Avihu uncovered their heads and feasted their eyes on the radiance of the Shekhina, as it says, ‘And to the nobles of the children of Israel He did not send out his hand…’ and didn’t they receive [a punishment] for what they did?”
<b>Nadav and Avihu</b>
R. Hoshaya Rabba is alluding to two incidents in which Nadav and Avihu, the sons of Aharon, feature prominently. The first occurs at the end of the story of the revelation at Sinai (Exodus 24:1–18).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Please read this episode in its entirety. Biblical commentators are divided on the question of the chronology of this narrative, the main question being whether it is part of the story of the Revelation at Sinai or a continuation of the narrative in the aftermath of the Revelation. See Rashi for the position that this episode precedes the giving of the Ten Commandments (Rashi on Exodus 24:1). The Ramban maintains that this story describes the aftermath of the Revelation at Sinai (Ramban on Exodus 24:1).<br>In either case, though, R. Hoshaya Rabba’s use of this episode as a proof for his position remains unaffected, since the critical point for him is that Nadav and Avihu saw more than they should have permitted themselves to see, regardless of when the incident occurred.</i> Moshe is told by God that he alone should approach God while Aharon, Nadav, Avihu, and the seventy elders (the “nobles of the children of Israel” referred to in verse 11) should remain at a distance (verses 1–2). Later in the episode we are told (verses 9–11): “And Moshe went up, and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. And they saw the Lord of Israel…And to the nobles of the children of Israel <i>He did not send out His hand</i>, and they looked at the Lord, <i>and they ate and drank</i>.”
Several sources in <i>Hazal</i> and some of the later biblical commentators understand these verses as critical of Nadav and Avihu, and the seventy elders. The criticism is derived from two phrases in verse 11. The first, “And to the nobles of the children of Israel He did not send out His hand,” is understood to mean that God, by rights, should have punished the nobles because, in looking at God, they had overstepped the boundaries set for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pesikta d’Rav Cahana</i> (<i>Aharei Mot</i>); <i>Tanhuma B’haalotekha</i> 16 (standard editions), and <i>Leviticus Rabba</i> 20:7–10. For contrasting interpretations of this episode, see Rashi and Ramban on verse 11.</i> God refrained from putting them to death so that the joy of receiving the Torah not be marred. Nonetheless, the fact that they deserved punishment is preserved in the biblical record by the use of this phrase in verse 11. The second phrase relevant to this interpretation is “and they ate and drank,” which is understood in this context to mean that they were so little awed by their experience, and so brazen, that they ate and drank even after experiencing their undeserved revelation of God’s presence.
Clearly, R. Hoshaya Rabba also maintains this understanding of the episode in Exodus 24, and connects it to the second incident in which Nadav and Avihu play a critical role: they bring a forbidden fire before God which results in their deaths (Leviticus 10:1–7). These two stories are seen as characteristic of Nadav and Avihu’s willingness to push beyond the permitted boundaries of closeness to God, and as such may be seen as a negative contrast to Moshe’s more seemly hesitation in the presence of God at the burning bush.
<b>The Editors’ Interpretation</b>
With this understanding of R. Hoshaya Rabba’s interpretation of Moshe’s gesture, we can now return an earlier question: Why do the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> favor the interpretation of Moshe’s gesture as an expression of awe in the presence of God rather than seeing it as an involuntary expression of fear? As we noted, no evidence either in the verse itself or in the immediate context would encourage one interpretation over another.
The redactors<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">‘Redactors’ is the academic term for editors of the midrash. See Chapter 8 for a discussion of redaction.</i> apparently find R. Hoshaya Rabba’s evaluation of Moshe’s behavior more convincing, and/or more spiritually correct, than R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s. This is evident in the way that they structure the paragraph to tip the balance in favor of R. Hoshaya Rabba’s interpretation, while weakening R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s argument. One way they accomplish this effect is by bracketing R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s position between the narrative expansion of line 2 (“The Lord of my father stands here and I will not hide my face?”) and R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s counterargument to his position, (“Even so, He did show him”).
A reading of Moshe’s gesture as an expression of awe is obviously more consistent with R. Hoshaya’s position than it is with R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s. After all, if Moshe is motivated to hide his face by fear, rather than awe, his gesture is closer to an act of cowardice than to a conscious moral choice. R. Yehoshua ben Karha takes Moshe’s action as an inappropriately timid response to God’s willingness to be approached. The ‘awe’ reading does not resonate well with his position.
Furthermore, we noted that R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s position relies critically upon the inference that God’s later refusal to show Moshe His face reflected His displeasure at Moshe’s having hidden his face at the burning bush. R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin’s counterargument to that contention is placed by the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> right after R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s position. This editorial decision serves to seriously undermine his interpretation of Moshe’s gesture. In short, while presenting both positions, the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> definitely take sides. They weight the scales in favor of R. Hoshaya Rabba’s interpretation.
<b>Presenting Both Positions</b>
Why, then, do the redactors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> present both positions? Familiarity with the literature of <i>Hazal</i> convinces us that this editorial decision has to do with the dialectical and process-oriented nature and style of rabbinic discourse. The conclusion of an argument is surely important, but for <i>Hazal</i>, the process of arriving at the conclusion is no less important. This may be because a thesis presented in isolation is never as convincing or as powerful as a thesis that has been arrived at by the consideration of other possibilities. More significantly, however, since <i>Hazal</i> view the act of Torah study as sacred in itself, and both the Oral and Written Torah as possessing multiple meanings, every exploration of textual interpretation is intrinsically valuable.
That said, we must note that R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s opinion is included for reasons independent of the conventions of <i>Hazal’</i>s discourse. The dispute between R. Hoshaya Rabba and R. Yehoshua ben Karha is profound in its own terms, and appears elsewhere in the thought of <i>Hazal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This difference of opinion surfaces in later trends in Jewish thought as well, reflected in differing approaches to Jewish mysticism from the Middle Ages onward.</i> It can be characterized, perhaps, as an argument about timing, limits, and opportunity in the relationship between God and the individuals who strive toward revelatory experiences of Him.
Although R. Yehoshua ben Karha doesn’t say so explicitly, his view of Moshe’s gesture at the burning bush is consistent with the conviction that one should strive for the greatest possible revelation of God, taking every opportunity for revelatory experiences, perhaps even risking a breach of the boundaries that set limits to such experiences. R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s language is very suggestive of such a view: “Moshe did not do right when he hid his face, for had he not hidden his face, <i>the Holy One blessed be He would have revealed to Moshe what is above and what is below, and what has been and what will be in the future</i>” (lines 4–5). Implicit in these words is the judgment that to know all these things is of paramount value and, as R. Yehoshua ben Karha goes on to say, Moshe – even after the experience of forty days and nights spent with God at Sinai – desires knowledge of these things very intensely. In this view, the strivings of Nadav and Avihu to come closer to God than they should have, might be seen in an almost heroic light.
R. Hoshaya Rabba’s view that one should accept the limitations set by God is obviously the more prudent position and, ultimately, the normative one. In giving R. Hoshaya’s position their tacit approval, the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> signal that his is the path to take. But by including R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s interpretation, even while undermining it, the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> indicate that it too expresses a truth that needs to be preserved and contemplated within the realm of Jewish spiritual strivings.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shalom Carmy referred me to a powerful analysis of this midrash in Rabbi J.B. Soloveichik’s article, “<i>Hayehudi mashul lesefer Torah,”</i> in <i>Bet Midrash Yosef</i>, Vol. 4, pp. 68–100. (The article was transcribed in the original Yiddish by Dr. Hillel Zeitlin; Hebrew translation by Rabbi Shalom Carmy.) Rav Soloveichik deals in particular with the reason Moshe chooses not to see what God would have revealed to him.</i>

Chapter 12; Interpreting Dialogue I; Moshe Resists His Mission

<b>Interpreting Dialogue I:<br>Moshe Resists His Mission</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>And the man Moshe was very humble, more than any other person on the face of the earth.</i> (Numbers 12:3)</span>
Of all the reluctant prophets whose stories the <i>Tanakh</i> records, Moshe is perhaps the one who balks the most. God must go to a great deal of trouble to persuade Moshe to take on the role of leader of the Jewish people, from orchestrating the spectacle of the burning bush to arguing with him at length about the details of his mission.
Exodus Chapters 3–4 tells the story of Moshe’s initiation and records the dialogue between God and the doubtful Moshe in unusual detail. After God explains the mission He wishes Moshe to undertake (Exodus 3:6–10), Moshe answers briefly, “Who am I, that I should go to Par’oh, and that I should take the children of Israel out of Egypt?”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Exodus 3:1–13 for a better grasp of the midrashic discussion.</i> (verse 11).
<b>The Interpretive Problem</b>
Moshe’s answer is a relevant reply in the context of the exchange that is taking place, and there is no obvious peculiarity or grammatical irregularity in his words. Nonetheless, while God obviously understands precisely what Moshe means by his rhetorical question, the reader is somewhat at a loss because the verse is opaque; Moshe’s reply to God may be understood in one of several ways. What exactly does Moshe mean by “Who am I…” and why does he expect these words to be an effective refusal of the assignment God has designed for him?
The midrashic commentary from <i>Exodus Rabba</i> (3:4) quoted below, offers three possible readings of the verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One further explanation is cited in this section of <i>Exodus Rabba</i>, but I have not included it because it is homiletical rather than interpretive.</i> As we will see, each reading assumes a different understanding of the context of Moshe’s answer, and each reading interprets – and thus punctuates – the verse differently.
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
<i>And Moshe said to the Lord, “Who am I?”</i> (<i>Mi anokhi</i>?)
(1) R. Yehoshua ben Levi said, “This may be compared to a king who gave his daughter in marriage
(2) and promised to give her a province and a <i>shifha matronit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A genteel servant, something like a lady-in-waiting or a lady’s maid.</i>
(3) and [instead] gave her a <i>shifha kushit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A common slave.</i>
(4) His son-in-law said to him, ‘Didn’t you promise me a <i>shifha matronit</i>?’
(5) Thus, Moshe said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(6) “Master of the universe, when Yaakov went down to Egypt, didn’t you say thus to him,
(7) ‘And I <i>(anokhi)</i> will surely bring you up’? (Genesis 46:4)
(8) And now you say to me, ‘Go and I will send you to Par’oh.’
(9) I <i>(anokhi)</i> am not the one [about whom] you said to him, ‘And I <i>(anokhi)</i> will surely bring you up.’”
(10) Another explanation:
(11) <i>‘Mi anokhi’</i>: R. Nehorai says, “Moshe said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(12) ‘You say to me, “Go, and take out Israel.”
(13) Where will I shelter them in the summer from the sun, and in the winter from the cold?
(14) Where will I get sufficient food and drink [for them]?

(16) How many pregnant women are there among them?
(17) How many infants are among them?
(18) How many types of food have you prepared for the women in confinement among them?
(19) How many types of delicate dishes have you prepared for the pregnant women?
(20) How much parched grain and nuts have you prepared for the children?’
(21) And where is the explanation of this thing?
(22) In the Song of Songs, as it says, “Tell me, one whom my soul loves…” (Song of Songs 1:7).
(23) The Holy One blessed be He said to him,
(24) ‘A kind of cake will come out with them from Egypt<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., matza.</i> [that will] suffice for them thirty days; [from this] you will know how I will lead them in the future.’”
(25) Another explanation:
(26) <i>“Mi anokhi”</i>: [Moshe] said before Him,
(27) “Master of the universe, how can I enter a place of robbers, and a place of murderers”; that is, “Who am I to go to Par’oh?”
(28) “and that I should take Israel out” – “What merit do they have in their hands that I should be able to take them out?”
(29) The Holy One blessed be He said to him, “Because I will be with you.”
(30) One doesn’t say “I will be with you” except to someone who is afraid.”
(31) “And this will be the sign to you that I have sent you…” – “and in this thing it will be recognized that you are my messenger,
(32) because I will be with you, and everything that you want, I will do.”
(33) “When you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain.” – “That which you said to me, ‘In what merit will I take them out of Egypt?’ you should know that in the merit of the Torah that they will receive in the future, by your hand, on this mountain, they are going out of there.”
<b><i>Hazal’</i>s Understanding of Biblical Dialogue</b>
Even a cursory reading of these three interpretations highlights the assumption they share about the nature of dialogue in the <i>Tanakh</i>: biblical dialogue is not a verbatim report of whole conversations, but a stylized synopsis of more elaborate exchanges which are only partially recorded in the text. This assumption is not unique to the three authorities cited here. We may gather from the widespread use of narrative expansion throughout the Talmud and midrash that <i>Hazal</i> viewed the dialogue – and indeed, other parts of the biblical narrative – in this way.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is not to say that <i>Hazal</i> saw either biblical dialogue or other details of biblical narrative as a fabrication. Rather, they viewed the biblical text as a <i>deliberately</i> incomplete recording of the factual.</i> Such a view of biblical dialogue both <i>authorizes</i> <i>Hazal</i> to interpret the text and even <i>requires</i> them to do so, since simply reading the words on the page is not enough to reach a proper understanding of their meaning.
<b>R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s Interpretation</b>
R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s reading of Moshe’s reply to God (lines 1–9) takes the form of a <i>mashal</i> (lines 1–3) whose <i>nimshal</i> (lines 4–9) is a narrative expansion. Following the methodology we have outlined in the first section of this book for analyzing a <i>mashal</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 2</i> we will first look at the <i>mashal</i> story as a narrative in its own right.
The <i>mashal</i> describes a king who has married off a daughter. In the marriage agreement, the king has promised to give his daughter a province and a <i>shifha matronit,</i> i.e., a well-born, highly trained servant. (We may reasonably assume that a servant of this type is expensive, and perhaps not so easily obtained. We may also assume that a king’s daughter would require a servant of this kind. If her father does not provide her with one, her husband will have to do so.) In any event, the king does not supply the promised servant for his daughter. Instead, he gives her a common slave. Not surprisingly, the king’s son-in-law objects, and protests to the king over his failure to fulfill the terms of the agreement.
Read in isolation, without reference to the <i>nimshal</i>, the <i>mashal</i> story seems fairly straightforward. That the king has not fulfilled his part of the agreement is not, in principle, a problem with the story since it is not all that unusual for people to fail to meet their obligations. More important for our purposes, within the admittedly narrow framework of the story, there is nothing illogical or particularly puzzling, and there are no internal inconsistencies. The key to this midrash is not, then, likely to be found here.
<b>Isolating the Elements of the <i>Mashal</i></b>
Our next step is to isolate the elements of the <i>mashal</i> as follows:
a king
the king’s daughter
the king’s promise
a province
a <i>shifha matronit</i>
a <i>shifha kushit</i>
the king’s son-in-law
the son-in-law’s objection
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
Next, we need to draw correspondences between the elements of the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i>:
a king / the Holy One blessed be He
the king’s daughter / Yaakov/ the children of Israel
the king’s promise / ‘And I <i>(anokhi)</i> will surely bring you up’
a province / -----
a <i>shifha matronit</i> / God
a <i>shifha kushit</i> / Moshe as God’s messenger
the king’s son-in-law / Moshe
the son-in-law’s objection / ‘Who am I? <i>(Mi anokhi?)’</i>
<b>A Doubling of Roles</b>
When we line up the elements this way, we notice that the principal characters in the <i>nimshal</i> – God and Moshe – play more than one role each in the <i>mashal</i>. Thus, God is both the king of the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>shifha matronit</i>; Moshe is both the son-in-law and the common slave. Quite apart from the startling comparison of God to a servant, to which we will return, we need to ask why the <i>mashal</i> is structured this way. We should also note that while God and Moshe play more than one role each in the <i>mashal</i>, the king’s daughter has two referents in the <i>nimshal</i>, i.e., Yaakov, and the children of Israel.
The gap in the <i>nimshal</i> is fairly easily filled; the “province” of the <i>mashal</i> is almost certainly Eretz Yisrael, and is in any event not critical to our understanding of the <i>mashal</i>.
<b>Time Frames</b>
Returning to the doubling of roles, it becomes clear that this feature is a function of the time frame of the <i>nimshal</i> relative to the <i>mashal</i>. The <i>mashal</i> story takes place within one continuous time frame, while the <i>nimshal</i> spans two separate periods of Jewish history. The original promise God (the king) made to Yaakov (the king’s daughter, within the earlier time frame), “I <i>(anokhi)</i> will go down with you to Egypt, and I <i>(anokhi)</i> will surely bring you up” (Genesis 46:4), has reached its time of fulfillment, four generations later. When God tells Moshe to go redeem the children of Israel (the king’s daughter, within the later time frame), Moshe (the son-in-law) protests; he assumes that God has changed the terms of the agreement. If God Himself (the <i>shifha matronit</i>) accompanies the children of Israel, the agreement is fulfilled; if Moshe (the <i>shifha kushit</i>) goes as God’s messenger, the agreement has been breached.
<b>Understanding the Significance of the <i>Mashal</i></b>
What does the <i>mashal</i> add to our understanding of this verse as R. Yehoshua ben Levi presents it? First, R. Yehoshua ben Levi has Moshe make a strong claim about the nature of God’s obligation to Yaakov and, by extension, to his descendents. The promise made to Yaakov, “…and I <i>(anokhi)</i> will surely bring you up,” places God in the position of “<i>shifha matronit</i>” relative to Israel at the time of the exodus from Egypt. This is a radical notion, and a powerful one. If we had only the narrative expansion of the <i>nimshal</i>, we would remain with the idea that God has an obligation to the children of Israel based on the promise made to Yaakov. The <i>mashal</i>, however, drives home the <i>force</i> of Moshe’s claim on behalf of the Jewish people, a force that requires a reply from God. Furthermore, the <i>mashal</i> framework enables R. Yehoshua ben Levi to sustain two contradictory views of God simultaneously: God is both king/father in his relationship to Yaakov and the children of Israel, and “<i>shifha matronit</i>,” bound by His obligation to them. The two images accurately reflect the complexity of the bond between God and the Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This bond is particularly complicated when we look at the central problem of the exile of the children of Israel to Egypt and their exodus – God is at one and the same time their Redeemer, and also the One Who sent them down to Egypt in the first place.</i>
The <i>mashal</i> framework also adds rhetorical force to the portrayal of Moshe as advocate and defender of the Jewish people in his very refusal to take on the task that God wants him to perform. The irony is striking – Moshe, the son-in-law of the <i>mashal</i> story, is “wed” to the children of Israel even as he tries to evade that role.
If we read the verse in keeping with R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s interpretation, we have to alter our translation. R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s reading punctuates the words thus: <i>“Mi ‘anokhi’?”</i> This is most accurately rendered in translation as: “Who is <i>‘anokhi’</i>? [certainly not me, Moshe!]” or “Who is the ‘I’ of the promise made to Yaakov, You [God] or me [Moshe]?”
<b>Context and Connotation as Factors in Interpretation</b>
Before we dismiss this reading as dissonant with the plain sense of the text, let us consider what might have caused R. Yehoshua ben Levi to read the verse this way.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Reconstructing another person’s thought process – especially that of a great talmudic sage – is always a highly speculative enterprise, and it would be the height of hubris to make any sort of definitive claim to have successfully done so. Nonetheless, taking R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s interpretation seriously requires us to try and make a good case for his position.</i> The first possible clue that the verse should not be translated simply as “Who am I…?” is the use of the word <i>anokhi</i> rather than <i>ani,</i> the more common Hebrew word for “I.” <i>Anokhi</i> has a connotation of formality, and is more likely than <i>ani</i> to be used in speech with a poetic tone or a higher social register<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Note that in this chapter, in identifying Himself to Moshe, God uses <i>anokhi</i> and not <i>ani</i> (verse 6).</i> If Moshe is merely voicing a humble refusal, one might expect him to phrase it as <i>“Mi ani,”</i> not <i>“Mi anokhi.”</i> Using <i>ani</i> rather than <i>anokhi</i> would accord with the description a few verses earlier of Moshe hiding his face when he realizes that he is speaking to the Lord (verse 6).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Later, Moshe will be described as “very humble, more than any person on the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3).</i> Perhaps, then, the word <i>anokhi</i> is not being used by Moshe to refer to himself, but is an allusion to someone else. Since the word is most appropriately used by God, it is not unreasonable to assume that Moshe is quoting God to Himself.
<b>Broadening the Context</b>
What might Moshe be quoting? To answer this question, we must examine the notion of context that governs our reading of biblical texts. When most of us study <i>Tanakh</i>, we think of context in rather narrow terms. What generally concerns us in determining the meaning of a word, a phrase, or a verse is its immediate, or local, context, i.e., the verse in which the element occurs, or some of the surrounding verses. Sometimes it becomes obvious that we must look further afield to understand a given problem, to the context of the topic or the chapter. For R. Yehoshua ben Levi, however, context is a far broader, more global notion.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This conception of context is not unique to R. Yehoshua ben Levi, by any means. It is highly characteristic of midrash in general.</i> The context of a biblical verse can be the entire <i>Tanakh</i>. According to R. Yehoshua ben Levi, in order to understand the dialogue between God and Moshe, one must read it in the context of what preceded it, namely the last few chapters of Genesis and the promise made to Yaakov there.
Looking at only the local context of the phrase “<i>Mi anokhi</i>,” the verse itself, we cannot possibly read as R. Yehoshua ben Levi does. Even within a slightly expanded framework, such as the immediately surrounding verses, or the entire chapter, it is hard to see what R. Yehoshua ben Levi is getting at. But the phrase resonates differently for R. Yehoshua ben Levi than it initially does for us because of the sensitivity with which he reads the text (picking up the difference in nuance between <i>anokhi</i> and <i>ani</i>), and because he reads within a more global context.
<b>Reading the Interpretation Back Into the Text</b>
Interestingly, once we have assimilated R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s interpretation, we are able to see God’s answer to Moshe in verse 12 as perfectly in keeping with this understanding of verse 11. According to R. Yehoshua ben Levi, Moshe has asked, “Who is <i>‘anokhi’?”</i> implying that it is not he, Moshe, who is required to save the Jewish people, but God Himself. In verse 12, God sidesteps that objection by telling Moshe, “Because I will be with you…” which can plausibly be understood to mean that God Himself intends to redeem Israel, but that He wants Moshe’s participation as well. R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s interpretation thus stands the test of being read back into the biblical context and providing a plausible possible interpretation of Moshe’s answer to God.
<b>R. Nehorai’s Interpretation</b>
The next interpretation offered in this section of <i>Exodus Rabba</i>, presented by R. Nehorai (lines 10–24), is a true narrative expansion. Unlike R. Yehoshua ben Levi, who uses the device of a <i>mashal</i> to clarify his interpretation, R. Nehorai explains Moshe’s words by expanding one short sentence into an extended speech whose meaning is laid out very elaborately. In R. Nehorai’s reading, “<i>Mi anokhi</i>” might be best punctuated as “<i>Mi? Anokhi?!</i>” (“Who? Me?!”). As portrayed in this narrative expansion, Moshe is overwhelmed by the thought of the logistical difficulties he would face were he to take on the task of leading Israel out of Egypt. R. Nehorai lists these in detail: the problem of providing shelter for a large population in harsh weather (line 13), the impossibility of providing enough food for so many people (line 14), and the many special needs of the population Moshe is meant to lead, due to the high proportion of vulnerable women and children (lines 15–20). This interpretation presents Moshe as saying, in effect, “How can <i>I</i>, one single human being, possibly take on such a huge responsibility?”
This reading of verse 11 seems at first glance closer to our conception of the plain sense of the text, perhaps because it does not require us to add a great deal of background information to the verse in order to understand it. This interpretation is also both psychologically plausible and relatively easy to identify with. After all, few of us can imagine criticizing God to His face, but most of us can conceive of how daunted we would feel if faced with a near impossible job. Nonetheless, it is worth asking why R. Nehorai reads Moshe’s words in this way and not, for example, as a conventional expression of humility.
<b>Reconstructing R. Nehorai’s Reading</b>
A closer examination of Moshe’s speech shows us that R. Nehorai takes the first two chapters of Exodus as the context for his reading of the verse. Chapter 1 of Exodus describes a population explosion of enormous proportions and Par’oh’s attempts to contain it by a series of vicious decrees. Chapter 2, which describes the birth of Moshe, also shows the effect of these decrees on the daily life of the Jewish people. In R. Nehorai’s version of Moshe’s reply to God, the needs of the many pregnant and child-bearing women and their small children feature prominently as reasons why Moshe feels that he cannot take on the mission of leading the children of Israel out of Egypt (lines 15–20). Reading the verse in this context makes it plausible that <i>Mi anokhi</i> is a cry of alarmed refusal triggered by the overwhelming nature of the task facing Moshe.
R. Nehorai offers a prooftext for his reading of <i>Mi anokhi,</i> a verse from the Song of Songs (lines 21–22).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazal</i> generally interpret the Song of Songs as an allegorical representation of the relationship between God and the Jewish people. Among the particular episodes of Jewish history that feature prominently in their interpretations are the periods of exile and exodus from Egypt, and the giving of the Torah. Please read Song of Songs 1:1–8 for the full quotation of the verse and for context.</i> R. Nehorai quotes Song of Songs 1:7 as an allegorized version of Moshe’s complaint to God. In this verse as represented by R. Nehorai, the beloved (Moshe) is addressing King Shlomo (God) and talking about the care of her flocks (the children of Israel): “Tell me, one whom my soul loves, where will you feed, where will you give rest [to your flocks] at noon; for why should I be [like] a mourner by the flocks of your friends.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi’s interpretation of the verse.</i>
<b>Biblical Quotation as a Factor in Interpretation</b>
The quotation from the Song of Songs, set in the context of R. Nehorai’s narrative expansion, does indeed resonate as he intends it to. In fact, Moshe’s speech may be said to be almost an extended paraphrase of the verse in the Song of Songs; both specifically mention the feeding and the sheltering of those who have been assigned to the care of a protector. This raises the question of what comes first: does R. Nehorai’s understanding of the Song of Songs motivate his reading of the verse in Exodus, or does the verse in Exodus cause him to interpret Song of Songs 1:7 as he does?
<b>Interpretation as an Unconscious Act</b>
One answer may be that the relationship between the two verses as they appear in this midrash is more complex than a simple causal connection. In order to determine what that relationship is we need to ask ourselves what happens when we read, and how we arrive at our interpretations of texts. The act of interpretation is not ordinarily the act of consciously weighing options. For most of us, the meaning of what we read seems self-evident. Asked to defend our interpretation of a given text, we can usually offer an argument in its favor, but in doing so we are engaged in the conscious reconstruction of a largely unconscious process. While reading, we don’t think about the reasons for our interpretations – we simply understand what we are reading.
To reconstruct R. Nehorai’s interpretation of the verse in Exodus, we could reasonably assume he understands <i>Mi anokhi</i> as he does due to the reasons outlined above: the difficulty of the task God assigns Moshe, and the placement of the verse (Exodus 3:11) in the textual context of Exodus 1 and 2. Reading <i>Mi anokhi</i> this way sheds new light on the verse in the Song of Songs for R. Nehorai, recasting it as an allegorical representation of Moshe’s complaint. Understood in this new light, Song of Songs 1:7 becomes in turn a piece of supporting evidence for R. Nehorai’s reading of <i>Mi anokhi</i>, and may also influence the form R. Nehorai’s interpretation takes. So while Exodus 3:11 helps R. Nehorai understand Song of Songs 1:7 as he does, Song of Songs 1:7 both supports his reading of Exodus 3:11, and shapes the story with which he communicates this reading to his listeners. The relationship between the verses and the way in which R. Nehorai uses them is thus more circular than linear.
<b>Reading the Interpretation Back into the Text</b>
Returning to the content of R. Nehorai’s interpretation of <i>Mi anokhi,</i> our next question must be, does it mesh with the biblical text? Reading the first few words of verse 12, we can assume that it does, since God answers Moshe, “Because I will be with you…” which we can take to mean that Moshe will not be expected to accomplish his mission, with all its difficulties, himself. It is interesting to note, however, that R. Nehorai appears somewhat troubled by the relationship between Moshe’s question and God’s answer. We see this in his alteration of God’s answer from its form in the biblical text. Without actually quoting verse 12, he expands it, making it an explicit response to Moshe’s worries: “The Holy One blessed be He said to him, ‘A kind of cake will come out with them from Egypt [that will] suffice for them thirty days; [from this] you will know how I will lead them in the future’” (lines 23–24).
<b>A Problem for R. Nehorai’s Interpretation</b>
Why does R. Nehorai add words to verse 12? At first glance, the verse appears to stand on its own quite well, but under closer examination we notice that, taken as a whole, it poses a problem for R. Nehorai’s interpretation. The verse reads as follows: “And He said, ‘Because I will be with you; and this will be for you the sign that I have sent you; when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain.’” (Exodus 3:12). The central difficulty is the phrase, ‘and <i>this</i> will be the sign for you that I have sent you.’ What does ‘<i>this</i>’ refer to? What <i>is</i> the sign that God has sent Moshe? Furthermore, while the first part of the verse (‘Because I will be with you’) fits nicely as an answer to Moshe’s speech, as we have noted above, the second part of the verse seems almost a non sequitur if we follow R. Nehorai’s interpretation.
<b>Contrasting Interpretations</b>
In comparing R. Nehorai’s approach to the problem with R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s, we notice that R. Yehoshua ben Levi does not quote God’s answer to Moshe in verse 12 or make reference to it at all, unlike R. Nehorai who partially rewrites it. R. Yehoshua ben Levi thus avoids the problem that verse 12 poses for his interpretation of <i>Mi anokhi</i>.
It may be that R. Yehoshua ben Levi sees no need to deal with the unclear referent in verse 12 because he understands only the first part of the verse as God’s answer to Moshe, and the second part as unrelated to it. An attempt to reconstruct R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s understanding of verse 12 might look something like this: “And [God] said [in answer to Moshe’s <i>‘Mi anokhi’</i>], ‘Because I will be with you. And [now, Moshe, moving on to the next topic], this will be the sign for you that I have sent you; when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain.’”
R. Nehorai, in contrast, appears to read the whole of verse 12 in relation to <i>Mi anokhi</i> and, not surprisingly, runs into difficulties. How does his narrative expansion of verse 12 resolve the problem? According to R. Nehorai, God’s answer to Moshe is, ‘A kind of cake will come out with them from Egypt [that will] suffice for them thirty days; [from this] you will know how I will lead them in the future’ (line 24). These words cannot be read as a paraphrase of the first part of the verse, “Because I will be with you,” since the first part of the verse needs no elaboration or explanation in order to serve as an answer to Moshe’s question as R. Nehorai understands it. Nor can these words be read as a paraphrase of the last part of the verse, “when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain,” because they bear no relation to it at all. Line 24 must therefore be R. Nehorai’s missing referent for the unspecified <i>‘this’</i> of verse 12. According to R. Nehorai, Moshe will know that God is with him and has sent him when he sees that the matza the Jewish people took with them when they came out of Egypt will suffice to feed them for a full month.
R. Nehorai’s gloss of verses 11–12 thus reads as follows: Moshe’s cry in verse 11, “<i>Mi anokhi…?”</i> expresses his fear that he cannot possibly fulfill the mission given to him by God. God’s answer to Moshe in verse 12 is, “Because I will be with you [and so you won’t have to meet all the people’s needs yourself], and [because ‘a kind of cake will come out with them from Egypt that will suffice for them for thirty days] <i>this</i> will be the sign for you that I have sent you [and that I am with you]. And [now, Moshe, to move on to the next topic], when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain.”
<b>The Third Interpretation</b>
The third interpretation offered in <i>Exodus Rabba</i> (lines 26–33) differs radically from the previous two. For one thing, this opinion focuses on the verse as a whole, rather than on the phrase <i>Mi anokhi.</i> For another, as we will see, this opinion operates from a much more local view of context than the preceding opinions.
According to this opinion, Moshe is actually asking two questions in verse 11. The first, “Who am I that I should go to Par’oh?” (<i>Mi anokhi ki elekh el Par’oh)</i> is an expression of Moshe’s fear for his physical safety (line 27). The second, “and that I should take Israel out,” is a question about the worthiness of Israel to be redeemed (line 28).
At first encounter, this reading may seem forced because it places the emphasis on the phrase “that I should go to Par’oh” (<i>ki elekh el Par’oh)</i> rather than on <i>Mi anokhi,</i> and it requires us to divide what appears to be one question into two. For this reading to be intelligible, words must also be added to the text. What, then, motivates this interpretation?
As opposed to the previous two readings of the verse, this interpretation is offered with an explicit statement of at least part of the reasoning behind it: “One doesn’t say ‘I will be with you’ except to someone who is afraid” (line 30). It seems, therefore, that this reading is based exclusively upon local context, i.e., God’s answer to Moshe in verse 12.
In fact, if we re-examine verse 12 from the perspective of this reading, we see that a strong case can be made for this position.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi evidently maintains this position as well. See his commentary on Exodus 3:11–12.</i> It is certainly plausible to read the first part of the verse as this commentator suggests: When Moshe says <i>Mi anokhi</i> he means that he is afraid and God’s reply to him proves this. (“The Holy One blessed be He said to him, “Because I will be with you.” <i>One doesn’t say “I will be with you” except to someone who is afraid”</i> lines 29–30). And, although this reading does not seem to be contingent on the story of Moshe’s flight from Egypt after killing an overseer (Exodus 2:11–15), it is consistent with it. Moshe has fled Egypt in fear for his life and now, understandably, is unwilling to return to “a place of robbers, and a place of murderers” (line 27).
More compelling, though, is the fact that this reading offers the most complete solution to the interpretive difficulties posed by the rest of verse 12: “and this will be for you the sign that I have sent you; when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain.” The two problems, as we noted, are the unclear referent of “<i>this</i> will be for you the sign that I have sent you,” and the seeming irrelevance of the end of the verse (“when you take the people out of Egypt…”) to Moshe’s question <i>Mi anokhi.</i> This interpretation solves the first problem by reading “<i>this</i>” as a reference to the first part of the verse (“Because I will be with you”): the sign that God has sent Moshe is that He will be with him which means “everything that you [Moshe] want, I will do” (lines 31–32).
The second problem can be solved by abandoning the assumption that verse 11 contains one question, an assumption this reading does not share. In this interpretation of verse 11, the last part of verse 12 (“when you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve the Lord on this mountain”) is <i>not</i> the answer to <i>Mi anokhi</i>; it is the answer to Moshe’s question about the worthiness of Israel to be redeemed. If this is the case, the last part of verse 12 is far from being a non sequitur: “That which you said to me, ‘In what merit will I take them out of Egypt?’ you should know that in the merit of the Torah that they will receive in the future, by your hand, on this mountain, they are going out of there’” (line 33).
<b>Redaction as Commentary</b>
Of all the possible readings of <i>Mi anokhi</i> that we can imagine, the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> select these three and choose to arrange them in the order that we see here. Of course, we can only speculate about the reasons for this selection and arrangement but it is worth noting that each of the opinions cited here addresses a different textual difficulty from a different angle.
When we re-read verses 11 and 12 from the widely ranging perspectives of these three interpretations, we become aware that these verses are far more complicated than we have assumed them to be on a first reading. For one thing, each interpretation must add words or background information so that the verses can be read coherently. Because each interpretation deals with only some of the difficulties of these two verses but not all of them, the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> may have included all three opinions to give us the benefit of a well-rounded picture.
Beyond that, however, the arrangement of these midrashim may be significant in itself as an indication of how the redactors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> wanted us to understand their relative weight or meaning. One possibility is that they want to draw our attention to the methodological differences between these three interpretations. Of the three, R. Yehoshua ben Levi uses the most global context to understand verse 11, and leaves verse 12 largely alone. R. Nehorai, whose use of context is narrower, attempts to account for some of the difficulties with verse 12, but his primary focus is verse 11. The final opinion, that of the unnamed commentator, operates from the most local context, constructing the meaning of verse 11 through the prism of verse 12. The arrangement by the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> may reflect the movement from global to local perspective.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In footnote 2, I noted that the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> offer yet another reading in this section, which I have not included because it is not interpretive in nature. The reading I have omitted uses the resonance of the word <i>anokhi</i> to link the first exile and redemption to the ultimate redemption. The editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> may have included this homiletical interpretation at the end of this section to remind us that while verses 11 and 12 can be understood from either more global or more local perspectives, these verses may themselves also provide a context for the understanding of other verses in the <i>Tanakh</i>, or even the events of Jewish history.</i>
<b>Who <i>is</i> Moshe?</b>
Of greater consequence, though, is that the readings reflect different pictures of the character of Moshe at the beginning of his leadership. In keeping with the plain sense of the biblical text, all of them recognize Moshe’s reluctance to take on the mission God wishes to impose on him, but their perspectives on Moshe’s motivation are different.
R. Yehoshua ben Levi sees Moshe as defender and advocate of the Jewish people even before he is willing to take on that position. Moshe’s reminder to God of His promise to Yaakov is in large part a maneuver for avoiding a task he does not wish to take on. Nonetheless, in effect, Moshe is demanding with no small degree of audacity that God fulfill his obligations to the Jewish people. It is a role Moshe will play repeatedly throughout the forty years of his leadership. R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s image of Moshe is thus a familiar one. The qualities we see here are ones we will see later as well.
R. Nehorai presents Moshe as a person overwhelmed by the enormity of the task he faces precisely because he knows all too well what it will entail. This view of Moshe reminds us that even before he becomes a leader, Moshe has been a shepherd – a person concerned with caring for a flock.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is also the image in the verse R. Nehorai cites from Song of Songs.</i> The leap from a flock of sheep to a human flock is enormously intimidating to Moshe and he tries with all his might to evade this task. R. Nehorai’s view of Moshe is as familiar as R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s, although it differs in focus. As we see Moshe here, worrying about the special needs of his vulnerable charges, we will see him repeatedly worrying for the safety, provisioning, and shelter of his people in the desert.
The third interpretation presents a very different Moshe, someone who is afraid for himself, and highly skeptical of the claims of the Jewish people to redemption. This picture of Moshe, paradoxically, is perhaps the most moving, because it shows us a man with real, human frailties. In this reading, Moshe seems fearful, focused on himself and not particularly enamored of the Jewish people. His refusal of the mission is not founded on the desire for God to fulfill His promise, nor is he thinking about the logistics of caring for a downtrodden nation of slaves. He simply does not want to go. And yet, this all too human Moshe will evolve into the strong, loving, father figure willing to lay down his life for his people.

Chapter 13; Interpreting Dialogue II; What is God's Name?

<b>Interpreting Dialogue II:<br>What is God’s Name?</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>To You, silence is praise…</i>(Psalms 65:2)</span>
Finding a way to address God is a paradoxical exercise in Jewish thought. Indeed, a theology that denies God any human attributes should make naming Him a logical impossibility. Nonetheless, the Jewish God is not an abstraction. We are obligated to pray to Him and we are encouraged to sense His intervention in our lives and in our collective history.
Moshe touches upon this issue directly when he asks God for a name by which to identify the One Who is sending him to the Jewish people (Exodus 3:13). As we will see, God’s reply to Moshe (Exodus 3:14–15) is highly enigmatic. The midrash we will explore below addresses the problem posed by God’s reply, interpreting the dialogue between God and Moshe and its implications for the naming of God.
The midrash is based on the following biblical dialogue:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Exodus 3 in its entirety for a clearer understanding of the midrashic discussion.</i>
(Verse 13) “And Moshe said to the Lord, ‘Here, I will come to the children of Israel, and I will say to them, “The Lord of your fathers has sent me to you,” and they will say to me, “What is His name?” What will I say to them?’ (Verse 14) And the Lord said to Moshe (<i>vayomer Elohim el Moshe</i>), “I will be that which I will be (<i>eheye asher eheye</i>);” and He said (<i>vayomer</i>), “Thus you will say to the children of Israel: ‘ “I will be” (<i>eheye</i>) has sent me to you.’” (Verse 15) And the Lord said again to Moshe (<i>vayomer od Elohim el Moshe</i>), “Thus you will say to the children of Israel: ‘God, the Lord of your fathers, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you’; this is My name forever, and this is my remembrance from generation to generation.”
<b>Defining the Interpretive Problem</b>
Moshe’s question is easily understood, but God’s answer is an enigma. For one thing, He appears to be offering three answers to Moshe’s single question. This leaves Moshe’s problem unresolved: Which of God’s three statements is the answer to Moshe’s question? Does God expect Moshe to repeat all three statements to the children of Israel? Based on the words of the text, how is he to know? Furthermore, the first two answers (in verse 14) are cryptic. What, we may ask, is Moshe supposed to make of a statement like, “I will be that which I will be”?
<i>Exodus Rabba</i> 3:6 reads Exodus 3:13–15 closely to address these questions. Each of the interpretations proposed is expressed in the form of an expanded dialogue which clarifies the author’s understanding of the exchange between God and Moshe.
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
The commentary from <i>Exodus Rabba</i> follows:
<i>And the Lord said to Moshe:</i>
(1) R. Abba bar Memel said,
(2) “The Holy One blessed be He said to Moshe,
(3) ‘You wish to know My name?
(4) I am called according to My deeds.
(5) Sometimes, I am called by [the name] <i>El Shaddai,</i> by [the name God of] Hosts (<i>Tzevaot)</i>, by [the name] Lord (<i>Elohim</i>), by [the name] God (<i>Hashem)</i>.
(6) When I judge humankind, I am called “Lord,”
(7) And when I make war against the wicked, I am called “[God of] Hosts,”
(8) And when I suspend [judgment for] a person’s sins, I am called “<i>El Shaddai</i>.”
(9) And when I have mercy on My world, I am called “God”’
(10) for God is none other than the quality of mercy,
(11) as it says, “God, God, merciful and gracious Lord…” (Exodus 34:6).
(12) That is [what it means when it says,] “I will be that which I will be”:
(13) “I am called according to My deeds.”
(14) R. Yitzhak says:
(15) “The Holy One blessed be He said to Moshe,”
(16) ‘Say to them,
(17) “I am the One Who was, and I am the One Who is now, and I am the One Who will be in the future to come.”
(18) That’s why it says ‘I will be <i>(eheye)’</i> three times.”
(19) Another explanation [for] “I will be that which I will be (<i>eheye asher eheye</i>)”
(20) R. Yaakov the son of R. Avina, in the name of R. Huna of Tzipori said:
(21) “The Holy One blessed be He said to Moshe,
(22) ‘Say to them,
(23) “In this enslavement, I will be with them,
(24) and they will go into enslavement [in the future] and I will be with them.””
(25) [Moshe] said before Him,
(26) “And thus I should say to them? It is enough [that they face] the [future] trouble in its time!”
(27) [God] said to him,
(28) “No, ‘thus you should say to the children of Israel, “I will be” has sent me to you.’
(29) To you, I am making it known; to them, I am not making it known.””
(30) Another explanation [for] “I will be” (<i>eheye</i>):
(31) R. Yitzhak in the name of R. Ami said,
(32) “In mortar and bricks they are standing, and to mortar and bricks they are going.”
(33) And thus [it says] in Daniel, “And I, Daniel, was broken (<i>nihiyeti</i>) and sick...” (Daniel 8:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on this verse.</i>
(34) [Moshe] said before Him, “And thus I should say to them?”
(35) [God] said to him, “No, rather [say to them] ‘I will be’ (<i>eheye</i>) has sent me to you.””
(36) R. Yohanan said,
(37) “I will be to those whom I will be (<i>eheye la’asher eheye</i>), with individuals
(38) but to the masses, against their will, whether or not they want it, when their teeth are broken, I will rule over them,
(39) as it says, “By my life, says God the Lord, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and rage poured out, I will rule over you” (Ezekiel 20:23).”
(40) Another explanation, that R. Ananiel the son of R. Sasson said:
(41) “The Holy One blessed be He said,
(42) ‘When I wish, one of the angels, which is a third [the size] of the world, stretches out its hand from the heavens and touches the earth,
(43) as it says, “And he sent the form of a hand and he took me by the fringes of my head” (Ezekiel 8:3).
(44) And when I wished, I made three of them sitting under the tree,
(45) as it says, “and rest under the tree…” (Genesis 18:4).
(46) And when I wish, His honor fills the whole world,

(48) And when I wished, I spoke with Iyov from the storm,
(49) as it says, “And God answered Iyov from the storm” (Job 38:1).
(50) And when I wish, [I speak] from within the thornbush.’”
<b>The <i>Vayomer Vayomer</i> Problem: Violation of a Biblical Convention</b>
As we have noted elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 12.</i> <i>Hazal</i> assume that biblical dialogue is only a partial recording of the actual conversations that take place in the <i>Tanakh</i>. Part of the function of midrashic commentary is to flesh out the dialogue in ways that clarify the meanings of these partially reproduced conversations. This approach to dialogue is particularly appropriate in the three verses we are examining here because of what might be called the “<i>vayomer vayomer</i> ” problem.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I first encountered this textual problem in a weekly Torah study class for teachers taught by Nehama Leibowitz.</i> This problem is described in the midrash with the following generalization: “R. Yohanan said, ‘Wherever it says <i>vayomer vayomer</i>, [the text] needs to be expounded.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> I Kings 220. See also, <i>Tanhuma Emor</i> 3, <i>Megilla</i> 16a: “<i>vayomer vayomer lama li?</i>” and <i>Leviticus Rabba</i> 26:8.</i>
The use of the word <i>vayomer</i> (“and H/he said”) to introduce direct speech is one of the most common conventions of biblical style. Typically, once a speaker’s words have been prefaced with <i>vayomer</i> the word is not repeated in reference to that speaker unless there has been intervening action in the narrative or intervening speech by another speaker. When <i>vayomer</i> is repeated with reference to an already mentioned speaker without intervening description or speech, then, the text “needs to be expounded.” The assumption is that our attention is being drawn to some action or reaction, verbal or otherwise, left unstated in the text.
In the verses we are analyzing (Exodus 3:13–15), the word <i>vayomer</i> occurs three times in succession without intervening speech or action on the part of Moshe (or, for that matter, intervening action on the part of God). Acting on the midrashic observation about this violation of biblical style, we need to assume that something is missing from the text. Furthermore, as we have pointed out, even without the <i>vayomer vayomer</i> problem, the exchange between God and Moshe in verses 13–15 is problematic. Moshe has asked a question, and God does not appear to be answering it in a way that we can actually understand. How are we to interpret God words?
<b>The Structure of the Paragraph</b>
The editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> offer six possible readings of God’s answer to Moshe:
(1) R. Abba bar Memel’s reading (lines 1–13)
(2) R. Yitzhak’s reading (lines 14–18)
(3) R. Yaakov the son of R. Avina’s reading (lines 20–29)
(4) R. Yitzhak’s reading in the name of R. Ami (lines 30–35)
(5) R. Yohanan’s reading (lines 36–39)
(6) R. Ananiel the son of R. Sasson’s reading (lines 40–50)
<b>(1) R. Abba bar Memel’s Reading</b>
R. Abba bar Memel (lines 1–13) addresses this problem by reading <i>eheye asher eheye</i> not as one of God’s names – and hence an answer to Moshe – but as a correction, or perhaps even a rebuke, to Moshe’s question. Moshe has asked God for a name to pass on to the children of Israel. In saying <i>eheye asher eheye,</i> God is telling Moshe that he has asked the wrong question: “You wish to know My name? I am called according to My deeds” (lines 2–3). Before giving Moshe the name that will legitimate his mission to the Jewish people, God wishes to make sure that Moshe understands the nature of the relationship between His name and His essence. God has many names (lines 5–11), but none of them answer the question of Who God is. It is important that Moshe not confuse the <i>name</i> of God with the <i>Being</i> it represents.
Bringing R. Abba bar Memel’s reading of the verse back to the biblical text, we see that it solves part of our problem. If <i>eheye asher eheye</i> is not meant to be the answer to Moshe’s question about what to tell the children of Israel, we have explained both the meaning of the phrase itself, and the repetition of <i>vayomer</i> in verse 14. <i>Eheye asher eheye</i> means God has told Moshe that his question is misconceived, and Moshe has presumably indicated by word or gesture his understanding of God’s correction, requiring the repetition of <i>vayomer</i> to indicate that there has been an interruption.
<b>Problems With R. Abba bar Memel’s Reading</b>
However, if we follow R. Abba bar Memel’s line of thought, we are still left with two problems. First, how are we to understand the second part of verse 14, “Thus you will say to the children of Israel, ‘I will be (<i>eheye</i>)’has sent me to you.’” Is Moshe actually meant to tell the Jewish people, “<i>Eheye</i> has sent me to you”? If so, why does God go on to issue very specific instructions about using a different name in verse 15: “Thus you will say to the children of Israel: ‘God, the Lord of your fathers, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you....’”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">One way to determine Moshe’s understanding of God’s words in verses 14 and 15 might be to check Moshe’s initial meeting with the children of Israel and see which name/s of God he actually uses in passing on God’s message to them. The problem is that Moshe’s first meeting with the Jewish people, recorded in Exodus 4:29–31, is described in very concise, third-person narrative with no direct speech. The issue of God’s name is completely absent from these verses.</i> Second, what are we to do with the third consecutive <i>vayomer</i> in God’s speech with which verse 15 opens?
R. Abba bar Memel’s interpretation does not address these problems. He appears to be concerned only with understanding the meaning of the phrase <i>eheye asher eheye</i>, and while his reading of that phrase is both textually plausible and theologically profound, he solves only the local interpretive problem, not the global ones we have outlined.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 12 for a discussion of local vs. global interpretation.</i>
<b>(2) R. Yitzhak’s Reading</b>
The next interpretation offered by the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i>, that of R. Yitzhak (lines 14–18), is somewhat broader in scope, because it relates to the whole of verse 14. In contrast to R. Abba bar Memel, R. Yitzhak reads <i>eheye asher eheye</i>, together with the second part of the verse, “’I will be’ (<i>eheye</i>) has sent me to you,” as part of God’s answer to Moshe, not as a correction of the question. In fact, he reads all of verse 14 as a message that God wishes Moshe to deliver to Israel: “Say to them, ‘I am the One Who was, and I am the One Who is now, and I am the One Who will be in the future to come’” (lines 16–17).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It might be argued that, in contrast to R. Abba bar Memel, R. Yitzhak reads the word <i>eheye</i> as a name of God and treats the three repetitions of this Name as a message whose meaning Moshe is intended to transmit to the children of Israel. I am not inclined toward this interpretation because in verse 15, God answers Moshe’s question with something that is unambiguously a name.</i> As R. Yitzhak himself points out in line 18, he derives this reading, from the three-fold appearance of the word <i>eheye</i> in the verse.
By casting <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as an answer to Moshe’s question, R. Yitzhak’s reading offers an alternative to R. Abba bar Memel’s view of these words as a challenge to Moshe’s question. In addition, R. Yizchak’s reading offers an interpretation of the second half of the verse (“<i>Eheye</i> has sent me to you”), since he reads the two statements as one overall message. The disadvantage of this interpretation is that it ignores the repetitions of <i>vayomer</i> in verses 14 and 15, and does not relate to God’s response to Moshe’s request for a name to tell the children of Israel in verse 15. Inarguably, R. Yitzhak’s interpretation is as theologically deep as R. Abba bar Memel’s reading, yet in a way, it is less successful in addressing the textual anomalies we have noted in verse 14. R. Abba bar Memel simply does not offer an interpretation of verse 14 as a whole, but R. Yitzhak does. In any case, our questions remain.
It is, of course, possible that R. Yitzhak does not maintain that, “Wherever it says <i>vayomer vayomer</i> [the text] requires interpretation.” In that case, his reading all of God’s words in verse 14 as one statement is perfectly justified. The editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i>, however, do not seem to view R. Yitzhak’s interpretation as satisfactory enough to preclude the need for other readings.
<b>(3) R. Yaakov the Son of R. Avina’s Reading</b>
R. Yaakov the son of R. Avina (lines 20–29) solves the <i>vayomer vayomer</i> problem, and the cryptic nature of God’s words in verse 14 by turning the verse into a dialogue. On his reading, <i>eheye asher eheye</i> does not mean ‘I will be that which I will be” but rather “I will be <i>with them</i> now just as I will be <i>with them</i> later” (lines 22–24).
R. Yaakov restructures verse 14 as follows: In response to Moshe’s request for a name to bring with him to the Jewish people, God says, “<i>Eheye asher eheye,</i>” which means, “Say to them, ‘In this enslavement I will be with them, and they will go into enslavement [in the future] and I will be with them’” (lines 22–24). Moshe is dismayed at the idea of telling slaves that, after their redemption, their descendents will be enslaved yet again, and answers, “And thus I should say to them? It is enough [that they face] the [future] trouble in its time!” God then answers that Moshe should tell the children of Israel, “<i>Eheye</i> has sent me to you,” which presumably means something like, “The One Who will be with you in your enslavement has sent me to you.” God has told Moshe the whole story, but he does not wish Moshe to tell the suffering children of Israel more than they need to know now (lines 28–29).
R. Yaakov’s reading is subtle, and offers an elegant solution to the <i>vayomer vayomer</i> problem. Like the opinions which precede his, R. Yaakov does not read either <i>eheye asher eheye</i> or <i>eheye</i> as names of God, and like them he sees these words as messages that need to be interpreted. Unlike them, however, by refiguring verse 14 as a dialogue, he makes the interpolation of <i>vayomer</i> in the middle of verse 14 coherent. There has been an interruption (Moshe’s objection), unstated in the text, but real nevertheless. To signal this, God’s words are prefaced with <i>vayomer</i>.
We should note that R. Yaakov’s reading requires us to add words to the text,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It could be argued that the very formulation of God’s answer virtually requires us to add words due to the open-ended nature of the verb of being. R. Yaakov, in effect, is reading “I will be” as “I will be….”</i> but this is true of all the interpretations in this midrash, and is indeed characteristic of this kind of midrashic exercise. The method by which the various midrashic authors explicate biblical dialogue is almost invariably by narrative expansion.
Does R. Yaakov’s interpretation square with what follows in verse 15? R. Yaakov does not address this question, but we might argue that it does, for although God’s dialogue with Moshe in verse 14 as R. Yaakov presents it is relevant to the larger discussion of Moshe’s mission, God has not actually given Moshe an answer to his question, i.e., what name to tell the children of Israel. The <i>vayomer</i> preceding God’s statement that He is to be identified as the God of the Patriarchs may well indicate that Moshe has reiterated his original question and then, in verse 15, been given the answer. Nothing in R. Yaakov’s interpretation would refute such a reading, and his treatment of verse 14 as a dialogue can be seen as giving indirect support to such an approach for verse 15.
<b>(4) R. Yitzhak’s Reading</b>
R. Yitzhak’s interpretation (offered in the name of R. Ami), which follows upon R. Yaakov’s (lines 31–35) appears to arrive at a place very close to his, but via a different route. R. Yitzhak reads <i>eheye</i> as derived from the root <i>h-v-h</i> with the meaning of trouble or evil (rather than <i>h-y-h</i>, the root for ‘being,’ which the other interpretations assume to be the derivation of <i>eheye</i>). The prooftext for this position (line 33) is from Daniel (8:27), where the word <i>nihiyeti</i> is probably best translated as “I was broken.”
R. Yitzhak then conflates both possible meanings of the word <i>eheye</i>. He understands God’s words to Moshe as follows: “In mortar and bricks they are standing, and to mortar and bricks they are going” (line 32). These words, a description of slavery that vividly conveys the physical hardships endured by the children of Israel, resonate with the ‘brokenness’ meaning of the prooftext from Daniel. When we read these words right in the wake of R. Yaakov’s interpretation – “ In this enslavement, I will be with them…” – we realize that R. Yitzhak’ construes <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as: “I, God, am with them where they stand in their state of brokenness (‘in mortar and bricks’), and I will likewise be with them in future enslavement.” This view of R. Yitzhak’s narrative expansion superimposes the connotation of ‘brokenness’ on the connotation of ‘being.’ Taken together, we understand R. Yitzhak’s reading of <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as an intensified version of R. Yaakov’s reading just before it.
Like R. Yaakov, R. Yitzhak has solved the <i>vayomer vayomer</i> problem by turning verse 14 into a dialogue, and like R. Yaakov, R. Yitzhak concludes that Moshe is not meant to tell the Jewish people more than they can bear at this point. In fact, lines 34–35 support the contention that we are meant to read <i>eheye asher eheye</i> with both meanings of ‘brokenness’ and ‘being’: “[Moshe] said before Him, ‘And thus should I say to them?’ [God] said to him, ‘No, rather [say to them], “I will be (<i>eheye</i>)” has sent me to you.’” Clearly, in this line at least, we are not meant to read <i>eheye</i> with the ‘brokenness’ meaning alone, but rather as, “Tell them that I will <i>be with them</i> in their brokenness and trouble.”
<b>Blurring the Lines Between Interpretation and Homiletics</b>
Readers unfamiliar with midrashic style might be inclined to ask at this point why R. Yitzhak doesn’t make his reading more explicit, and indicate in the words of his narrative expansion that he is reading <i>eheye asher eheye</i> using both meanings simultaneously. The simple, technical answer is that R. Yitzhak’s reading does not actually work grammatically. Whichever root meaning one would wish to assign it, <i>eheye</i> is a first person future conjugation of either <i>h-y-h</i> or <i>h-v-h</i> and, translated accurately, has to mean either, “I will be” or “I will be broken.” In R. Yitzhak’s reading, the ‘brokenness’ meaning is attributed to the children of Israel, not to God (“In mortar and bricks they are standing…”), even though the grammatical form of the verb in its textual context can only refer to God, and not the Jewish people.
Why, then, doesn’t R. Yitzhak associate the ‘brokenness’ meaning explicitly with God, and make the interpretation grammatically consistent? This could be accomplished by saying something like: “I am broken (troubled) with them in their slavery now as I will be in their future enslavements.” R. Yitzhak presumably does not expand the narrative in this way to avoid the theological difficulties that might arise from a problematic description of God. Ascribing weakness to God, as would the phrase “I am broken…,” might create new interpretive difficulties in verse 14, more formidable than the problems his interpretation solves.
Aside from this, though, the greatest difficulty with R. Yitzhak’s interpretation from a plain-sense-of-the-text perspective is that, in fact, it is less strictly interpretive than the readings before it. We noted the kinship between R. Yitzhak’s and R. Yaakov’s interpretations of verse 14. The critical difference between them is the method each uses to arrive at his reading, and R. Yaakov’s conflation of two layers of meaning. Both these differences involve making use of a somewhat counterintuitive root meaning for <i>eheye</i> (i.e., <i>h-v-h</i>). The advantage of R. Yitzhak’s reading, however, is that it enables him to deepen the emotional impact of verse 14, in a way that a strictly interpretive reading does not. R. Yitzhak’s version conveys, albeit indirectly, just how closely tied God is to the Jewish people in their suffering.
<b>(5) R. Yohanan’s Reading</b>
R. Yohanan’s interpretation (lines 36–39), which follows R. Yitzhak’s, reverts to the “I will be” reading of <i>eheye</i> we saw earlier, but takes a completely different view of the message to be conveyed. He reads <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as <i>eheye <b>la’asher</b> eheye</i>, “I will be <i>to those whom</i> I will be…”
R. Yohanan reading of verse 14 seems to be: When God says <i>eheye asher eheye</i>, He is telling Moshe, “I will be to those whom I will be, with individuals,” i.e., God’s relationship with individuals will be individually determined by their relationship with Him. (In other words, individuals can choose whether or not to accept God’s rule.) But when God says, “Thus you will say to the children of Israel: ‘<i>Eheye</i> has sent me to you,’” He is telling Moshe to transmit to the children of Israel (“the masses”) that “against their will, whether or not they want it, when their teeth are broken, I will rule over them.” R. Yohanan buttresses his reading with a proof-text describing a similar situation of God’s imposing His kingship over the Jewish people regardless of their will.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For the full force of R. Yohanan’s prooftext, read it in context: Ezekiel 20:33–38.</i>
If we are correct in understanding R. Yohanan’s narrative expansion as an interpretation of the whole of verse 14, and not simply of the phrase <i>eheye asher eheye</i>, we easily see how R. Yohanan’s reading solves the textual problems we have noticed. Like all the previous interpretations,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">With the possible exception of R. Yitzhak’s.</i> R. Yohanan understands God’s words to Moshe in verse 14 as a message, rather than as a name of God. And although he does not read verse 14 as a dialogue – giving us as he does only one side of the conversation – it is clear that his reading solves the <i>vayomer vayomer</i> problem by presenting a two-part message. The first part, “I will be to those whom I will be, with individuals,” is intended for Moshe alone; the second part, “against their will, whether or not they want it, when their teeth are broken, I will rule over them,” is to be passed on to the children of Israel by Moshe. The second <i>vayomer</i> in verse 14 would then indicate that Moshe has reacted to the first message. In response, God now tells him that only the second part of the message is meant for the Jewish people.
<b>A Change in Tone</b>
R. Yohanan’s reading is strikingly different in tone from the previous interpretations of verse 14. In the words <i>eheye asher eheye</i>, R. Abba bar Memel sees God as restating the terms of Moshe’s question. Taken together with the second part of verse 14, R. Yitzhak reads these words as a statement about the nature of God that also responds, in part, to Moshe’s request for a name to tell the Jewish people. Both R. Yaakov and R. Yitzhak (in the name of R. Ami) see <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as a message linking Israel’s present slavery with future enslavement by God’s willingness to be with the Jewish people in all their sufferings. R. Yohanan’s reading of verse 14 seems harsh, in contrast, especially as a first message to the children of Israel and in light of their terrible plight.
The rationale for R. Yohanan’s interpretation may reside in Moshe’s question in verse 13, “Here, I will come to the children of Israel, and I will say to them, ‘The Lord of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they will say to me, ‘What is His name?’ what will I say to them?” We could read this question as implying that Moshe views his impending mission as the beginning of negotiations between God and the Jewish people over their acceptance of God’s sovereignty. In effect, the dialogue in Exodus 3 as a whole savors strongly of negotiation, especially as Moshe bargains with God in his attempt to evade the task which God wishes to impose upon him. R. Yohanan’s interpretation may be a reaction to that aspect of Exodus 3. His reading of verse 14 suggests that God wishes to impose the terms of the relationship between Himself and the Jewish people quite clearly at the very outset. Moshe, perhaps, can take the liberty of negotiating the terms of his relationship with God since, with individuals at least, God “will be to those whom [He] will be.” In the case of the people, though, regardless of their questions, and regardless of the Name Moshe brings them, “whether or not they want it, when their teeth are broken, I will rule over them.”
<b>(6) R. Ananiel’s Reading</b>
The final interpretation offered by the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i>, that of R. Ananiel the son of R. Sasson (lines 40–50), brings us full circle back to the beginning of the paragraph. Our first impression is that R. Ananiel’s reading is essentially the same as R. Abba bar Memel’s. On closer examination, however, we realize that while R. Abba bar Memel reads <i>eheye asher eheye</i> in terms of God’s deeds, R. Ananiel reads it in terms of God’s manifestations – the forms through which God chooses to reveal Himself to people. In this sense, R. Ananiel’s reading is closest to the literal meaning of the text since he appears to be reading <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as “I will <i>be</i> that which I will <i>be</i>,” without the addition of any words to that phrase. (This in distinction to R. Yaakov’s “I will be <i>with them</i>” or R. Yohanan’s “I will be <i>to those whom</i> I will be,” for example.)
R. Abba bar Memel maintains that Moshe’s request for God’s name is mistaken, because God can be known only through His deeds, and the various names of God are merely labels reflecting God’s actions. Like R. Abba bar Memel’s reading of <i>eheye asher eheye</i>, R. Ananiel’s expansion of the narrative implies that he understands Moshe’s request for a name to tell the children of Israel as a veiled question about Who God is. The answer, however, as R. Ananiel conceives it, is that God can be perceived only through the revelations of Himself that He wishes to manifest. The phrase ‘when I wish/ed’ (<i>k’she’ani mivakesh</i>/<i>k’she’bikashti</i>) recurs five times in the course of R. Ananiel’s commentary, which strongly indicates that he views this sort of self-revelation as an expression of God’s will, something that human beings can perceive, but not something they can influence.
The examples R. Ananiel chooses cogently represent a variety of possibilities of Divine revelation. The first example, refers to a prophetic vision in Ezekiel (line 43) in which the prophet sees the form of a hand reach out from a fiery figure in the heavens and lift him by the hairs of his head to the Temple in Jerusalem. R. Ananiel emphasizes the vastness of this vision by representing this image as “one of the angels, which is a third [the size] of the world, stretch[ing] out his hand from the heavens and touch[ing] the earth” (line 42). The second example, the appearance of the angels to Avraham in Genesis 18, shows us God’s messengers reduced to human scale; this is indicated by Avraham’s initial perception of them as people and his invitation to them to “rest under the tree” (lines 44–45). Both these examples present angels – God’s messengers – as manifestations of Divine revelation, but the cases differ in critical ways. In the first example, the angel’s hand (this is R. Ananiel’s gloss of the verse from Ezekiel) is frighteningly vast, but is part of a vision; the prophet is not actually transported to Jerusalem in the physical world. In the second case, the angels whom Avraham encounters are scaled to human expectations and given concrete form in the physical world Avraham inhabits.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam’s position notwithstanding. See Rashi on these verses and the Ramban’s rebuttal of the Rambam’s argument that Avraham’s visitation by the angels was a vision and did not happen in the physical world.</i> While both cases can be subsumed under the category of revelation via messenger, it would be difficult to find examples more radically differentiated than these.
In R. Ananiel’s third example, Divine revelation in all its vastness is described in direct terms, and not as mediated through divine messengers, for when God wishes, “His honor fills the whole world” (line 46). To buttress this example, R. Ananiel quotes a prooftext from Jeremiah 23 (line 47). Its full effect is experienced when we read verse 24 together with the verse before it. As is clear from the context, the prophet is saying that God is powerful not only within close range, but also from far away. No one can hide from Him because He “fill[s] the heaven and the earth.” This use of the prooftext is particularly effective because it creates a strong contrast to the next two examples of Divine revelation, both of which are direct experiences of God’s immanent presence.
In the first, God speaks to Iyov directly “from the storm,” addressing (if not entirely answering) Iyov’s emotional struggles and intellectual speculations about his sufferings.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In other midrashic renderings of this moment, the word <i>se’ara</i> is read as though it is spelled with the letter <i>sin,</i> rather than <i>samekh</i>, which changes the meaning of the word from ‘storm’ to ‘hair.’ See <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 4:4: “Sometimes [God] speaks with a person from between the hairs on his head, as it says, ‘And God answered Iyov from the storm’ (Iyov 38:1) – from between the hairs on his head.” See also, along similar lines, <i>Bava Batra</i> 16a, and <i>Nidda</i> 52a–b (in both places, Rashi comments on the words “<i>Min ha’se’ara</i>”).<br>Clearly, this reading of God’s answer to Iyov “<i>min ha’se’ara</i>” intensifies, rather than diminishes the sense of intimacy conveyed by this example.</i> In the second case, God summons Moshe to him from within the thornbush. A storm is less earthbound and concrete than a thornbush, but in both cases God addresses the recipients of His revelation in language, and engages them in dialogue. In contrast, the image of God’s presence filling the world which precedes the storm and thornbush examples, is a diffuse revelation, directed at no particular, individual human being. The examples R. Ananiel chooses to represent the possibilities of God’s manifestation thus cover a wide range of experiences.
<b>Ordering as Commentary</b>
We might ask, at this point, what triggers R. Ananiel’s reading of <i>eheye asher eheye</i> – so similar, on one hand, to R. Abba bar Memel’s and yet so different. By the same token, we might explore why the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> choose to include both readings given their similarity, and why they place one to open the discussion and the other to close it. This question is particularly pertinent in light of two other similar readings, by R. Yaakov and R. Yitzhak, which are juxtaposed with one another, rather than separated. An answer to these questions must take into account the difference in scope as well as content between R. Abba bar Memel’s and R. Ananiel’s interpretations of <i>eheye asher eheye</i>.
As we noted above, Exodus 3 is characterized by frequent alternations in the name of God. This phenomenon comes to the fore most visibly in the verses that describe Moshe’s perception of the burning bush (Exodus 3:1–4):
(Verse 1) And Moshe was shepherding the sheep of Yitro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the sheep in the desert, and he came to the mountain of the Lord, Horev. (Verse 2) And <i>an angel of the Lord appeared to him</i> in a flame of fire from within the thornbush, and he saw, and here, the thornbush is burning with fire, and the thornbush is not consumed. (Verse 3) And Moshe said, “I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the thornbush is not burned up” (Verse 4). And <i>God</i> saw that he had turned aside to see; and <i>the Lord</i> called to him from within the bush, and said, “Moshe, Moshe,” and he said, “Here I am.”
Verse 2, in particular, raises many questions. How does the “angel of the Lord” appear to Moshe? It does not seem to be an entity separate from the bush, like the angel in the prooftext from Ezekiel or the angels in the Avraham story; indeed, the verse goes on to say that Moshe sees the thornbush burning without being consumed, and does not say that Moshe sees the angel of the Lord. (If Moshe had perceived an angelic figure as such, we would expect the text to record it. We might also expect that Moshe would address the angel.) Verse 4 further confuses us by telling us that <i>God</i> sees Moshe turn aside to investigate the burning bush, but that it is <i>the Lord</i> Who actually addresses him.
What emerges from these verses quite clearly is that God appears to Moshe and speaks to him from within the burning bush. <i>How</i> God does so remains obscure. The names of God that are used in these four verses complicate the picture rather than elucidate it. In light of this, when Moshe later asks for a name with which to identify God to the Jewish people, we may well conclude, as R. Abba bar Memel does, that God cannot be fully known through His names.
We many reasonably assume that R. Ananiel’s understanding of <i>eheye asher eheye</i> is influenced by these verses and that he is reading verse 14 from within the larger context of the chapter. R. Ananiel cites God’s speaking to Moshe from within the thornbush as an example of a revelatory manifestation of God. We might paraphrase R. Ananiel’s reading of <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as a message to Moshe (and, by extension, to the reader) as follows: “You, Moshe, have experienced My presence in a particular way, but that is only an expression of My will at this given moment. When I wish, I appear in other ways. You have asked for My name, but ‘I will be that which I will be.’ Don’t ask for My name. Ask how I reveal Myself.”
Both R. Abba bar Memel and R. Ananiel see <i>eheye asher eheye</i> as a warning to Moshe that in asking for a name of God to bring to the Jewish people, he has asked the wrong question. R. Abba bar Memel sees God’s names as potentially misleading because names only describe actions, not the essence of God, which cannot be defined by a name. For R. Ananiel, even manifestations of God’s presence are potentially misleading because they too change as a function of God’s will, and they too fail to convey the essence of God.
These two interpretations are arrived at from different places. As we noted earlier, R. Abba bar Memel appears to be reading <i>eheye asher eheye</i> within the very narrow context of Moshe’s question, and does not even attempt a resolution of the whole of verse 14. In contrast, R. Ananiel seems to be bringing Moshe’s question in verse 13 back to the incident that opens the chapter (his encounter with God at the burning bush), and possibly implying a connection between them.
The line that separates these two views is narrow, but critical. The redactors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> maintain the difference between these positions by structuring the paragraph as they do. In separating the two opinions, they force us to read them in isolation from one another and focus on the message of each individually. At the same time, they give us reason to compare the two views by bringing us back to the beginning of the paragraph when we think we have reached the end. Simply juxtaposing these two opinions might mislead us into thinking of them as variations of one another, as is the case in the opinions of R. Yaakov and R. Yitzhak, which are presented side by side.
Looking at the overall structure of this piece of commentary, we should note that none of the opinions cited in this paragraph solve all of the textual and theological difficulties posed by verses 13–15. Each of the opinions tackles one or more of these problems from a different place, and each offers only a partial resolution. Even taken together, the interpretations offered here do not answer all of our questions. Perhaps, also for this reason, the editors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> open with R. Abba bar Memel’s reading, and conclude with R. Ananiel’s. In different ways, both opinions make the point that God cannot be truly known. Exodus 3:13–15 is written in such a way that it raises more questions about the meaning of <i>eheye asher eheye</i> than we can answer. The redactors of <i>Exodus Rabba</i> want us to understand this, and so, the midrashic commentary reflects the ultimate mystery of the passage, rather than pretending to solve it, by bringing us full circle back to the beginning of our inquiry.

Chapter 14; The Meaning of a Chronological Problem; Connecting Yosef and Yehuda

<b>The Meaning of a Chronological Problem:<br>Connecting Yosef and Yehuda</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“<i>…The brothers were occupied with selling Yosef, and Yosef was occupied with his sackcloth and fasting. Reuven was occupied with his sackcloth and fasting, and Yaakov was occupied with his sackcloth and fasting, and Yehuda was occupied with taking himself a wife. And the Holy One blessed be He was occupied with creating the light of the Messiah</i>….” (<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 85:1)</span>
What makes a sequence of events meaningful rather than random? How does the biblical text choose to narrate events, and why? The midrash that follows uses the story of Yosef and his brothers – a long, complicated account woven of many strands – to address these questions.
<b>Defining the Interpretive Problem</b>
The Yosef narrative is marked by a glaring textual difficulty – the insertion of the Yehuda/Tamar episode at a critical moment in the description of Yosef’s sale into slavery. The events leading up to the sale of Yosef begin in Genesis 37:12.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read Genesis 37:12 through Genesis 39:1 for a complete grasp of the midrashic discussion.</i> Genesis 37:19–28 describes the brothers’ initial plan to kill Yosef and the discussion that leads first to their casting him into the pit, and then to the final decision to sell him. Verses 29–35 describe the aftermath of that decision and its particular effects upon Reuven and Yaakov. Verse 36 ends the passage<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Fortuitously for our purposes, in the case of chapters 37–39, there is agreement between the traditional Jewish divisions of the biblical text (according to <i>parasha</i>, indicated by the spacing in the Torah scroll) and the later Christian divisions (indicated by chapter and verse numberings).<br>The Christian numbering of chapters and verses is employed virtually everywhere in the Jewish world as a useful convention for ordering the <i>Tanakh</i>. In these three chapters at least, the chapter divisions reflect the Jewish tradition, which makes it easier to show the interpretive problems posed by the interpolation of the Tamar and Yehuda story into the Yosef narrative.</i> with the statement: “And the Midianites sold him [Yosef] to Egypt, to Potiphar, Par’oh’s chamberlain, the chief executioner.”
At this point, we would expect the narrative to go on with the portrayal of Yosef’s life in Egypt, but Chapter 38:1 opens with the following seeming non-sequitur: “And it was at that time, and Yehuda went down from his brothers, and he turned aside to an Adulamite man whose name was Hira.” The entire chapter that follows is a detailed account of the Tamar and Yehuda story, with the Yosef thread resuming only in the first verse of Chapter 39.
The interpretive problem is obvious. Why is the Yosef strand of the narrative, surely the dominant one, interrupted at this critical juncture by an apparently unrelated story? When, in fact, does the Yehuda/Tamar episode take place in relation to the Yosef story? Bearing in mind that both stories unfold over a period of years, what is meant by the phrase, “And it was at that time…” (Genesis 38:1)? Does Yehuda marry immediately after his role in the selling of Yosef or does this story begin at some earlier point in Yehuda’s life, as some of the commentators contend?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, ibn Ezra on this verse.</i> Even if the story of Yehuda’s marriage takes place immediately after the brothers’ selling of Yosef,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and Sforno, among other commentators, take this position.</i> why is the Yosef strand of the narrative interrupted so abruptly by this episode, when it might just as easily have been placed at a more natural break in the story?
<b>The Midrashic Commentary</b>
<i>Genesis Rabba</i> 85:2 discusses this problem as follows:
(1) “<i>And it was at this time</i>…”
(2) [But] shouldn’t the text have said “And Yosef was brought down to Egypt?”
(3) So why does it connect this portion [Yehuda and Tamar] to that [Yosef’s sale into slavery]?
(4) R. Elazar and R. Yohanan [each answer this question].
(5) R. Elazar said:
(6) “In order to connect descent to descent (<i>yerida leyerida</i>”).
(7) R. Yohanan said,
(8) “In order to connect ‘recognize’ to ‘recognize’ (<i>haker lehaker</i>”).
(9) R. Shmuel bar Nahman said:
(10) “In order to connect the story of Tamar to the story of Potiphar’s wife;
(11) just as this one [intended to act] for the sake of Heaven, that one [intended to act] for the sake of Heaven,
(12) As R. Yehoshua ben Levi said,
(13) ‘[The wife of Potiphar] saw in the stars that in the future, she would beget a child with [Yosef],
(14) and she didn’t know if it would be through herself or through her daughter.
(15) That is what [it means when] it says:
(16) “…those who predict at the time of the new moon something of what (<i>me’asher</i>) which will come upon you” (Isaiah 47:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">My translation of this part of the verse follows Rashi.

(17) R. Aibo said,
(18) ‘Something [of what will come upon you]’ and not ‘all that [will come upon you].’”
(19) And similarly [it says],
(20) “…and they were not ashamed” (Genesis 2:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The full quote is, “And the two of them were naked, <i>Adam</i> and his wife, and they were not ashamed.”</i>

(22) [But] shouldn’t the text have said, “And God, the Lord, made Adam and his wife clothes of skins and He dressed them?” (Genesis 3:21)
(23) R. Yehoshua ben Karha said,
(24) “To make known to you what sin<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The term “sin” is used somewhat anachronistically here, since the concept of sexual sin applies only after <i>Adam</i> and <i>Hava</i> eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

See the explanation of that term in the commentary Yad Moshe there. See also the commentary of the Maharzu on <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 18:6 <i>dibur hamat’hil: mitaskin</i> <i>b’derekh eretz.</i> (For a contrasting viewpoint, see the commentary of the Matnot Kehuna on the same source, <i>dibur hamat’hil: me’ezeh chettia</i>. Jastrow takes the same position as the Matnot Kehuna for this term.) Note, also, that in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 18:6, the text reads “that he saw them engaged in <i>derekh eretz</i> and desired her” (not them).</i> caused that wicked one to jump upon them,

(26) R. Yaakov of Kefar Hanin said,

(34) “In order to connect a wicked man to a wicked man, a destroyer to a destroyer, a haughty man to a haughty man.”
(35) R. Shmuel bar Nahman said,
(36) “In order to connect the interruption of a reign to the interruption of a reign.”
(37) And similarly [it says],
(38) “On that night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was killed” (Daniel 5:30).
(39) “And Darius the Medean…” (Daniel 6:1).
(40) And where is [the verse] “In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar…” (Daniel 8:1)?
(41) R. Huna said,
(42) “So that [people] will not say that [these verses] are story-telling;
(43) so that everyone will know that [Daniel] said [them] with Divine inspiration.”
(44) The Rabbis said:
(45) “In order to weave together (<i>lesareg</i>) the whole book as being said with Divine inspiration.”
(46) Even here, also, it is necessary to say:
(47) “And Yosef was brought down to Egypt”
(48) And it says, “And Yehuda went down from [being with] his brothers.”
(49) [Yehuda] said, “Come, let us scatter ourselves,
(50) for as long as we are gathered, the writ of debt may be found (<i>matzui</i>) for collecting.”
(51) The Holy One blessed be He said,

(54) they said, “…the Lord has found out (<i>matza</i>) the sin of your servants...” (Genesis 44:16).
(55) R. Yitzhak said,
(56) “The creditor has found (<i>matza</i>) occasion to collect his bill.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the creditor now has the opportunity to collect his bill.</i>
(57) R. Levi said,
(58) “Like someone who drains (<i>mematzeh</i>) a barrel and leaves the dregs.”
(59) The Rabbis say,
(60) “[The brothers said,] ‘Come let us provide for ourselves.
(61) In the past, [our father] had to marry us to wives.
(62) And now [that] he is occupied with his sackcloth and fasting, it is not proper that he occupy himself with marrying us to wives.’
(63) They said to Yehuda, “Aren’t you the head of us all?
(64) Get up and provide for yourself [a wife].””
(65) Immediately, “And Yehuda went down....”
(66) It was a descent for him that he married a non-Jew.
(67) It was a descent for him that he buried his wife and sons.
<b>Structure of the Midrash:</b>
Our first step in analyzing this midrash is to divide the paragraph into its constituent parts. Even a casual perusal of the paragraph shows us that it is structurally complex and that the connections between the various parts of this midrash do not immediately present themselves. The editors start with a <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> and the question it raises (lines 1–3). The question is followed by three possible answers: that of R. Elazar (lines 5–6), that of R. Yohanan (lines 7–8), and that of R. Shmuel bar Nahman (lines 9–18). We are then offered three more examples of chronologically problematic juxtapositions in the text of the <i>Tanakh</i>, one from Genesis and two from Daniel. Each case is questioned and answers are given (lines 19–45). Lines 46–48 bring us back to our original case (the interruption of the Yosef story by the Yehuda-Tamar episode). This is followed by two intricate narrative expansions of the verse, “And Yehuda went down from [being with] his brothers…” (lines 48–56, and lines 57–67).
A detailed mapping of the paragraph follows:
(1) the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> (line 1)
(2) the interpretive problem/question (lines 2–3)
(3) identifying the two opinions that offer answers to this question (line 4)
(4) R. Elazar’s answer (lines 5–6)
(5) R. Yohanan’s answer (lines 7–8)
(6) R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s answer (lines 9–18), which incorporates (7) and (8)
(7) R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s interpretation of the Potiphar’s wife story (lines 12–16)
(8) R. Aibo’s interpretation of the verse from Isaiah quoted by R. Yehoshua ben Levi (line 17–18)
(9) the chronological problem from Genesis (lines 19–22)
(10) R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s answer to the problem (lines 23–24)
(11) R. Yaakov of Kefar Hanin’s answer to the problem (lines 26–27)
(12) the first chronological problem from Daniel (lines 28–32)
(13) R. Elazar’s answer to the problem (lines 33–34)
(14) R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s answer to the problem (lines 35–36)
(15) the second chronological problem from Daniel (lines 37–40)
(16) R. Huna’s answer to the problem (lines 41–43)
(17) the Rabbis’ answer to the problem (lines 44–45)
(18) the connection to our original case, i.e., Chapters 38 and 39 of Genesis (lines 46–48). (Line 48 is also the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> for the following narrative expansions.)

(23) commentary on the narrative expansion (lines 66–67)
<b>Three Opinions, Two Citations:<br>the Significance of Line 4</b>
The first three lines of the midrash explicitly lay out the interpretive difficulty outlined above: Why does the biblical text interrupt the narrative flow of the Yosef story with the story of Tamar and Yehuda? Line 4 states that there are two different answers to this question, given by R. Elazar and R. Yohanan, respectively.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is a convention of the literature of <i>Hazal</i> in both halakha and agada. When we see the phrase “Rabbi X and Rabbi Y,” as the opening to a citation of a rabbinic statement, it means that two different opinions are about to be offered.</i> However, proceeding in our reading, we note that there are actually three answers to this question in the midrash, not two. For some reason, R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s opinion is not listed with those of R. Elazar and R. Yohanan as part of the introductory remarks of the midrash. To account for this, we need to examine each of the opinions and see how they compare with one another.
<b>R. Elazar’s Answer to the Midrashic Question (lines 5–6)</b>
Reading with the sensitivity characteristic of <i>Hazal</i>, R. Elazar notices that the Yehuda/Tamar story opens with Yehuda’s descent “from [being with] his brothers,” just as the resumption of the Yosef story in the following chapter opens with Yosef’s descent into slavery in Egypt. R. Elazar contends that the Yosef narrative is interrupted by the seemingly unconnected story of Tamar and Yehuda in order to draw our attention to this link between the two descents.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps he says this because the “descent” words appear in the <i>first</i> verse of each episode and thus stand out in a way they might not otherwise if the stories were ordered differently. See footnote 2.</i>
Because R. Elazar does not elaborate the meaning of the connection he has raised, we need to re-examine the relevant verses to determine the significance of the parallel being drawn.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is yet another example of techniques used by <i>Hazal</i> to engage the reader in interaction with their commentary and with the biblical text.</i> Yehuda’s descent is described in Genesis 38:1: “And it was at that time, and Yehuda <i>went down</i> from [being with] his brothers” (…<i>vayered Yehuda me’et ehav</i>). Yosef’s descent appears in Genesis 39:1: “And Yosef <i>was brought down</i> to Egypt…” (<i>veYosef hurad Mitzraima</i>).
Juxtaposing these verses, we are struck by two things. First, the verb that describes Yehuda’s descent is in the active form (<i>vayered</i>, “and Yehuda went down”) while Yosef’s descent is described by the same verb in the passive form (<i>veYosef hurad</i>, “And Yosef was brought down”). The reason for this is obvious. Yehuda has control over what is happening, unlike Yosef, who has been forced into slavery against his will. But there is another, more disturbing, difference between the two descents. Yosef’s <i>yerida</i> is physical, but Yehuda’s is spiritual. This is apparent both from the sequence of events in the biblical text and from the last two lines of the midrash. In the account that follows Yehuda’s “going down from his brothers,” we are shown his marriage to a non-Jewish woman, the death of his sons, and his dishonorable behavior toward his daughter-in-law. And while Yehuda redeems himself by his courageous self-exposure and repentance, the narrative shows us a great man in spiritual decline over a period of years.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It should also be noted that Yehuda’s spiritual decline appears to end at the point of his marriage to Tamar and the birth of their children, which is the end of chapter 38. When Yehuda next makes his appearance in the narrative (in chapter 43), he has clearly become the leader of his brothers and is a morally as well as physically courageous man.</i> The last two lines of the midrash give us part of this picture in a characteristically brief summary: “It was a descent for him that he married a non-Jew. It was a descent for him that he buried his wife and sons” (lines 66–67).
In contrast to Yehuda, after Yosef has been “brought down to Egypt,” we see him resisting Potiphar’s wife in an act of spiritual and moral greatness. His behavior is all the more impressive given that he is a young man, a slave, and alone in Egypt, without guidance or support. In light of the very real differences between Yehuda’s decline and Yosef’s descent, why does R. Elazar see a connection between them?
One possible answer is that R. Elazar wishes us to engage in exactly the exercise we have just completed, since contrasting is also a form of connection: juxtaposing elements can help determine what they have in common as well as their differences. Yehuda and Yosef each play a vital role in the narrative that follows. For a proper understanding of what follows, we need to consider carefully the events that shape these men and prepare them for their dramatic encounter at the climax of the story. Yosef comes to his encounter with Yehuda from a position of hardship – not of his own making – out of which he has risen to great heights; Yehuda comes to the same encounter with a spiritual depth he has reached through profound self-recognition attained in his experience with Tamar.
Another possible answer is that R. Elazar wishes to demonstrate a <i>midda keneged midda</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hazal</i> use the phrase <i>midda keneged midda</i> to describe a situation of poetic justice, i.e., a turn of events in which the punishment corresponds perfectly to the sin. See, for example, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 90a.</i> (“measure for measure”) relationship between the two descents. On this reading, the reason for Yehuda’s fall is that he was instrumental in causing Yosef to be brought down. Yehuda’s decline is thus either a punishment for his role in Yosef’s enslavement, or a natural result of his having lowered his own spiritual level by selling his brother.
Significantly, while R. Elazar alerts us to the link between the two narratives, he does not spell out for us explicitly how he wishes us to understand it. He grounds his commentary in the language of the text, thus giving it a solid interpretive basis. By making the connection without explicating it, however, he leaves open more than one avenue of interpretation and requires us to do the work of fleshing out his idea.
<b>R. Yohanan’s Answer to the Midrashic Question (7–8)</b>
R. Yohanan offers a different answer to the question of why the Yosef narrative is interrupted by the Yehuda/Tamar story. Where R. Elazar contends that the biblical text links Genesis 38 and 39 (i.e., the Yehuda/Tamar narrative and the continuation of the Yosef story), R. Yohanan maintains that the connection is being made between Genesis 37 and 38 (i.e., the brothers’ deceiving of Yaakov and the Yehuda/Tamar story).
R. Yohanan’s argument focuses on the use of the same word in two different contexts within the extended narrative of the Yosef story. The first place this word appears is when the brothers come to Yaakov to inform him of Yosef’s “death.” They do not actually tell Yaakov that Yosef has been killed. Instead, they “sent the striped coat, and they brought it to their father, and they said, ‘This we have found. <i>Recognize</i> (‘<i>haker’</i>), please, is this the coat of your son or not?’” (Genesis 37:32) The second use of the word occurs when Tamar, about to be burned for her “sin,” “…sent to her father-in-law saying, ‘By the man to whom these belong I have conceived’; and she said, ‘<i>Recognize (‘haker’)</i>, please, whose these are, the signet ring, the belt, and the staff.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The parallels between the verses do not end with the presence of the word <i>haker</i> (recognize) in both of them. The phrase in which the word occurs is identical in both verses: “Recognize, please…” and in both verses the objects to be identified are <i>sent</i> to the person being questioned.</i>
In the association he makes here, R. Yohanan highlights for us a clear case of allusion in the biblical narrative.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 85:11 for a more explicit version of R. Yohanan’s position (<i>dibur hamat’hil: haker na</i>).</i> The decisive point of the Tamar/Yehuda episode, in which Yehuda is forced to face the ugliest parts of his nature, is couched in the same language the brothers use to deceive their father about Yosef. The message is clear; in his encounter with Tamar, Yehuda is being punished for the leading role he played in selling his brother and betraying his father. He, along with his brothers, manipulates his father into a false “recognition.” Thus he will therefore find himself hearing virtually the identical words from Tamar as an accusation whose truth he will be forced to acknowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">It is interesting to note that the recognition motif recurs in the Yosef story at a later stage. See Genesis 42:7–8.</i> The insertion of the Yehuda/Tamar story at this unexpected juncture in the Yosef narrative compels us to notice this important connection. Had the Yosef strand continued without interruption, we might have missed it.
<b>R. Elazar and R. Yohanan vs. R. Shmuel bar Nahman</b>
Both R. Yohanan and R. Elazar are responding to <i>linguistic</i> cues planted in the text. In R. Yohanan’s case, the cues are explicit because the repeated phrase (<i>haker na</i> ) is exactly the same in both verses. In R. Elazar’s case, the correspondence is somewhat less obvious because the linguistic repetition is one of roots rather than identical words, but the connection is still very compelling. In contrast, R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s answer to the question of why the Yosef story is interrupted by the Yehuda/Tamar episode differs completely from this sort of approach. He finds a <i>thematic</i> association between Genesis 38 and 39 in the likeness he perceives between the actions and motivations of Tamar and Potiphar’s wife. What triggers R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s interpretation is the similarity between story lines, not linguistic cues.
Even before we examine the significance of R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s interpretation, we can see why the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> disassociate it from R. Elazar’s and R. Yohanan’s readings. By omitting R. Shmuel bar Nahman from line 4, they are signaling that there is a qualitative difference between the interpretations of R. Elazar and R. Yohanan on one hand, and that of R. Shmuel bar Nahman on the other.
<b>R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s Answer to the Midrashic Question</b>
R. Shmuel bar Nahman contends that the disruption of the Yosef story by the Tamar/Yehuda episode is intended to alert us to a similarity between Tamar (Genesis 38) and Potiphar’s wife (Genesis 39). He bases his reading on a tradition taught by R. Yehoshua ben Levi, that Potiphar’s wife was motivated to seduce Yosef because she believed – based on an astrological prediction – that she was destined to have children with him (lines 12–16). R. Yehoshua ben Levi points out that since astrology is an inexact discipline, Potiphar’s wife did not know for certain whether Yosef’s children would come through her or through her daughter.
In support of this point, he quotes a prooftext from Isaiah (47:13) and R. Aibo’s interpretation of it. The verse criticizes the Jewish people for their dependence upon the astrologers to whom they turn for reassurance about the future. The full quote is translated in two different ways by the commentators on the text. The first reading, which is more in keeping with the plain sense of the verse in the context of Isaiah 47 is: “You are wearied with your many advisers; let them rise up and save you – the astrologers, the stargazers, those who make monthly predictions – from what will befall you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of Radak and ibn Ezra.</i>
The second reading, which matches the context of our midrash, is: “You are wearied with your many advisers; let them rise up and save you – the astrologers, the stargazers, those who predict at the time of the new moon something of what (<i>me’asher</i>) will befall you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi and R. Yeshaya MiTerani read the verse in this way.</i> R. Aibo comments that those who make these predictions can only tell “something of what will befall you, and not all that will befall you” (lines 17–18). The point of the prooftext is that Potiphar’s wife errs in her calculations because she places her reliance in her reading of the stars. She decides how to act on the basis of a deterministic and unreliable “science” instead of making decisions on the basis of morality.
Although R. Yehoshua ben Levi’s teaching – the basis for R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s interpretation – may strike us as strange, we should note that it receives strong, if indirect, support from a number of other midrashic sources. For example, <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 87:4 tells us that Potiphar’s wife followed the contemporary custom of consulting astrologers about the purchase of slaves, and consulted an astrologer about Yosef. <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 86:2 states that Potiphar, Yosef’s master, is identical with Potiphera, the father of Asnat who becomes Yosef’s wife (Genesis 41:45). <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 89:2 repeats this tradition.
<b>Problems With R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s Reading</b>
Despite these midrashic supports, R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s interpretation of the connection between Genesis 38 and 39 seems counterintuitive, even shocking. For one thing, his reading makes Potiphar’s wife, rather than Yosef, the focus of Genesis 39. For another, the comparison between the selfless heroism of Tamar and the predatory actions of Potiphar’s wife – which culminate in disaster for Yosef – does not seem at all plausible. Certainly the plain sense of the verses in Genesis 39 appears to invalidate this midrashic teaching since the language of the chapter gives no hint of any motivation for Potiphar’s wife other than lust.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See, in particular, verses 6 and 7.</i> Finally, it is unclear why the biblical text would be wrenched out of chronological order just for the sake of teaching us something positive about Potiphar’s wife. Both R. Elazar’s and R. Yohanan’s interpretations demonstrate that the chronological disruption of the biblical text has great moral significance. R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s reading is hard to see in the same light.
Our difficulty with R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s reading is further exacerbated if we compare his statement here with another statement about Potiphar’s wife which is found in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 87:4. The full quote reads as follows:
“And she said, ‘Lie with me.’ (Genesis 39:7)
R. Shmuel bar Nahman said, “Cursed are the wicked. There, it says, ‘And you will spread the corner of your garment over your handmaiden’ (Ruth 3:9). But this one [spoke] like an animal [as it says], “And she said, ‘Lie with me.’””
In this midrashic commentary, R. Shmuel bar Nahman contrasts the behavior of Ruth and Potiphar’s wife, to the detriment of the latter. In chapter 3 of the Book of Ruth, Naomi has engineered an encounter between Boaz and Ruth in the hope of encouraging Boaz to marry Ruth and take action to redeem her dead husband’s fields. Despite the indelicacy of the situation – Ruth and Boaz are alone in a deserted granary – Ruth expresses herself with great sensitivity and modesty, employing a euphemism to convey what she wants Boaz to do for her. In contrast, as R. Shmuel bar Nahman points out, Potiphar’s wife uses blatantly explicit language in her attempt to seduce Yosef.
If this were R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s only comment on Potiphar’s wife, it would pose no difficulty. In conjunction with his comments above, though, it leaves us with a contradiction demanding resolution.
<b>Reconstructing R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s Interpretation:</b>
To understand R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s interpretation, we must first determine how he reached it. As we have seen elsewhere, interpretation is influenced by many factors, including one’s definition of context, and the perspective one brings to the text.
An examination of R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s commentary on a number of biblical stories shows us that he tends to approach the sins of righteous biblical characters with the assumption that the <i>Tanakh</i> describes these sins more harshly than the actual events warrant.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See his comments on Eli’s sons, David, Shlomo, and Yoshiyahu, in <i>Shabbat</i> 55b–56b.</i> Although it is difficult to make a definitive statement about how R. Shmuel bar Nahman arrives at this position, we can find two clues in citations of his position in <i>Shabbat</i> 55b–56b. First, R. Shmuel bar Nahman quotes an authority for his statements (R. Yonatan), which means that he anchors his position in an existing rabbinic tradition. Second, R. Shmuel bar Nahman bases his defense of sinful biblical heroes on what appears to him to be a textual inconsistency within the biblical descriptions of these characters. For example, in defending David, he asks, rhetorically, “Can sin have come to a person who [is described in the book of Samuel as] having the Divine Presence with him?” For R. Shmuel bar Nahman, apparently, the sinfulness of these characters is not only irreconcilable with received tradition – it is a <i>textual</i> problem as well.
Our analysis of the same biblical stories might lead us to disagree with R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s understanding of the sinfulness of biblical heroes; we could take issue with him on a number of grounds. For example, in response to his claimed basis in tradition, we might note that other sources in <i>Hazal</i> are highly critical of the sins of biblical heroes, even to the extent of magnifying, rather than minimizing them. It could even be argued that R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s view is less psychologically plausible than other, more critical rabbinic approaches. Nonetheless, we must recognize that R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s approach is not arbitrary. It rests on a perspective that is not universally shared, but is nonetheless internally coherent.
Assuming that our understanding of R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s view is correct, we can attempt to reconstruct the reasoning that leads him to his reading of the Potiphar’s wife story. We have seen that R. Shmuel bar Nahman is inclined to place a positive construction on the sins of biblical heroes. Although Potiphar’s wife hardly fits the category of righteous biblical characters, she is a person who will play an important role in Yosef’s life. Potiphar’s wife is not the mother of Yosef’s children, but she is the mother of his wife. Perhaps R. Shmuel bar Nahman cannot imagine that the wife of Yosef, the mother of Ephraim and Menashe, could have sprung from a woman totally devoid of all positive qualities. In addition, R. Shmuel bar Nahman has recourse to a tradition that attributes a positive motivation, however misplaced, to Potiphar’s wife’s actions. And, finally, R. Shmuel bar Nahman notes that the story of Tamar and Yehuda is interpolated into the Yosef narrative at an unexpected juncture. It seems plausible to him that the purpose of this artificial ordering is to juxtapose the story of Tamar with that of Potiphar’s wife.
Our attempt to reconstruct the reasoning behind R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s position has shown us that a case can be made for his position. Still, we are left with two problems. First, why should the chronology of the biblical narrative be rearranged just to tell us that Potiphar’s wife is not as evil as she seems? Compared with the answers that R. Elazar and R. Yohanan offer to the chronology problem, this one seems almost pointless. Second, how are we to reconcile R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s description of Potiphar’s wife here with his harsh condemnation of her in <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 38:7?
<b>Tamar and Potiphar’s Wife</b>
Perhaps the answer to these questions lies in re-examining the comparison R. Shmuel bar Nahman makes between Tamar and Potiphar’s wife. We initially assumed that R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s comment expressed his approval of Potiphar’s wife. Since both the biblical text and midrashic commentary present Tamar as wholly praiseworthy, and R. Shmuel bar Nahman explicitly compares Potiphar’s wife to Tamar, that assumption seemed quite reasonable. Closer examination of the comparison, however, shows us that it is not as straightforward as it appears. Although Tamar and Potiphar’s wife are favorably compared in their <i>motivations</i>, the biblical and midrashic verdicts on their <i>actions</i> differ radically. Tamar is presented as brave, self-denying, and humble, while R. Shmuel bar Nahman himself compares Potiphar’s wife to an animal.
As we saw in our discussion of R. Elazar’s interpretation above, comparing things also involves contrasting them. A careful look at R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s analysis of the Potiphar’s wife story reveals that he wishes not only to compare Tamar and Potiphar’s wife, but also to show us the differences between them. The message that emerges from this exercise is far more subtle and valuable than we imagined, namely, that intentions are not enough to determine the morality of a course of action.
Although both Tamar and Potiphar’s wife intended their actions “for the sake of Heaven,” the actions they take are not morally equivalent. Tamar consults no one but herself and makes her decisions on the basis of her own sense of right and wrong. She takes full responsibility for her actions, even to the extent of risking death rather than exposing Yehuda against his will. Potiphar’s wife, on the other hand, abdicates personal responsibility by relying on astrology, although she is aware that it is an imperfect tool. In addition, she ignores the potentially fatal effect of her behavior upon Yosef, a defenseless slave at his master’s mercy. And when she is spurned, she vengefully frames Yosef for a crime he did not commit, despite the knowledge that this will almost inevitably lead to his execution.
Viewed in this light, R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s commentary on the Potiphar’s wife story is full of meaning. Its focus on Potiphar’s wife makes sense when we realize that the effect of the commentary is actually to project our attention backwards to <i>Tamar</i> and the significance of her actions in the previous chapter. After all, she is a central character in that part of the narrative and her behavior warrants such close scrutiny. And while R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s comparison between Potiphar’s wife and Tamar may strike us as straying from the plain sense of the text, we cannot argue that his purpose is not interpretive. Our thinking may well be more attuned to R. Elazar’s and R. Yohanan’s linguistic perceptions than to R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s view of human nature, but his view is undeniably far more sophisticated and nuanced than we initially assumed.
<b>The Chronological Problem of the Yosef Narrative as Part of a Biblical Pattern</b>
After presenting us with three possible answers to the question of why the Torah “connects this portion [Yehuda and Tamar] to that [Yosef’s sale into slavery]” (line 3), the redactors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> complete the picture by contextualizing this particular case within the wider framework of the <i>Tanakh</i>. They describe three other cases of chronological difficulty similar to this one, and introduce a number of interpretive solutions to the problems posed. The word used to preface each of the cases, <i>udekhivatei</i> (“and similarly”) (lines 19 and 28), signals that this sort of interpretive difficulty is not unique to the Yosef stories.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Elsewhere this concept is formulated as “<i>Ein mukdam um’e’uhar baTorah.</i>” (“There is no ‘prior’ and ‘later’ in the Torah,” i.e., chronological order does not necessarily obtain in the biblical narrative.) See <i>Pesahim</i> 6b. There are many places in which this formula appears in midrashic literature, and it is quoted by many of the biblical commentators.</i>
<b>The Example From Genesis</b>
The first example (lines 19–22) is taken from Genesis.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">To follow the discussion, please read Genesis 2:21 to Genesis 3:21.</i> Genesis 2:25 states: “And the two of them were naked, Adam and his wife, and they were not ashamed.” The redactors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> contend that the event which follows this description is God’s clothing of Adam and his wife (Genesis 3:21), and that only after this clothing does the serpent approach Hava (Genesis 3:1). They maintain, therefore, that the <i>record</i> of the events as they appear in Genesis 2 and 3 does not correspond with the <i>sequence</i> of the events as they occurred: Genesis 3:1–20 (the sin and punishment of Adam and Hava) in fact follows Genesis 3:21 (the clothing of Adam and Hava) rather than preceding it.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi follows this opinion. Others assume that the events in this narrative are not recorded out of order, and that the clothing of Adam and Hava takes place only after they have sinned and been punished. See, for example, Sforno and Radak. Although a strong case can be made for the latter opinion, it does not invalidate the midrashic approach taken here, since the midrash makes its assumptions about the ordering of the text explicit and works from those assumptions.</i>
Why does the biblical text record the events out of chronological order? The editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> cite two possible explanations, one from R. Yehoshua ben Karha and the other from R. Yaakov of Kfar Hanin. R. Yehoshua ben Karha interprets this dischronology as an explanation for what motivated the serpent to approach Hava and tempt her to disobey God. Expanding the narrative, R. Yehoshua ben Karha explains that seeing Adam and Hava “engaged in <i>derekh eretz”</i> made the serpent “desire them” (lines 23–25). If the text had not linked the serpent’s advances to Hava and the nakedness of Adam and Hava – with all that their nakedness implies – we would not have understood what provoked the dialogue between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">I will not attempt to discuss this narrative expansion in depth, since it would necessitate a lengthy and detailed analysis of the first three chapters of Genesis, an exercise that is beyond the scope of this book. One thing, though, is self-evident about both R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s explanation and the narrative he is discussing: The serpent of Genesis 3 is clearly not an ordinary snake, and the relationship described here between serpent and human beings is not one that could be conceived of outside the unique setting of this biblical narrative. Both early and later traditional commentaries on Genesis 3 represent the serpent figure as an externalized Evil Inclination. By the same token, the act of eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is the internalizing of the Evil Inclination within the human psyche.</i>
<br>In light of this, the only reasonable conclusion is that R. Yehoshua ben Karha must be speaking figuratively when he says that the serpent “desired” Adam and Hava because he saw them “engaged in <i>derekh eretz</i>.” Perhaps one way to translate these words into a contemporary idiom would be to say that sexuality makes human beings vulnerable to the Evil Inclination. R. Yehoshua ben Karha’s commentary suggests that the chronology of the biblical text is rearranged to bring out this point.
<br>Obviously, the brief summary offered here significantly flattens out the subtleties of the different discussions of the Garden of Eden narrative, and is in no way intended to be comprehensive of all the various commentaries on this complex subject.
R. Yaakov of Kefar Hanin offers a simpler explanation for the dischronology in Genesis 2 and 3 (lines 26–27). He maintains that the text changes the order of events so that the Garden of Eden story will not end on a sour note. Had the chronology of events been preserved, the narrative would have concluded with the punishment of Adam and Hava, a bleak ending indeed. As written, however, the story finishes with a more hopeful image – God, in an act of loving-kindness, clothing Adam and Hava, even though they have sinned against Him. In R. Yaakov of Kefar Hanin’s view, an account which preserved chronology might have left the reader doubting the possibility of Adam and Hava’s continued relationship with God. The existing text leaves the reader with the sense that God still loves them, despite their sin.
<b>Examples From the Book of Daniel</b>
The examples from the Book of Daniel are particularly significant because they deal with subject matter that is specifically historical. This distinguishes them from the case in the Genesis narrative, in which the violation of chronological order is less obvious.
<b>The First Example:</b>
In the first example from Daniel (lines 28–36), the midrash cites three verses which refer to three kings. The first quote, Daniel 4:34 (line 29), concludes the story of Nevukhadnezzar’s reign; the second quote, Daniel 5:1 (line 30), describes the beginning of Belshazzar’s reign; and the third, from Daniel 6:1 (line 31), introduces the beginning of Darius’ reign. The midrash then asks, “And where is [the reign] of Ehveel Merodakh?” (line 32). This question arises because the <i>historical</i> sequence of Babylonian kings is Nevukhadnezzar, then Ehveel Merodakh, followed by Belshazzar, the last Babylonian king in the dynasty.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Both Ehveel Merodakh and Belshazzar were the sons of Nevukhadnezzar.</i> After Belshazzar’s death, the empire over which he ruled is split between Persia and Medea, with Darius the Medean taking over part of the Babylonian empire.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">For this information, which the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> assume we know, see Rashi and Maharzu on this section.</i> Ehveel Merodakh is mentioned in II Kings 25:27 and Jeremiah 52:31 as Nevukhadnezzar’s successor, where he is shown behaving benevolently to the imprisoned Yehoyakhin, king of Yehuda. In the Book of Daniel, however, his reign does not appear at all, a chronological anomaly that needs to be accounted for.
The midrash offers two reasons for this omission. R. Elazar’s explanation (lines 33–34) is that Ehveel Merodakh is left out of the narrative sequence to emphasize the link between Nevukhadnezzar and Balshezzar: “in order to connect a wicked man to a wicked man, a destroyer to a destroyer, a haughty man to a haughty man” (line 34). In R. Elazar’s view, the point of this narrative is not to chronicle the kings of Babylon, but to teach the moral lessons behind historical events. The reign of Ehveel Merodakh is omitted from the Book of Daniel because, as a righteous man, he does not belong in an account of wicked kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentaries of the Matnot Kehuna and the Maharzu on these words.</i> The likeness between the wicked, destructive, haughty Nevukhadnezzar and the equally wicked Belshazzar is what binds this story together, not the raw sequence of events.
R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s explanation (lines 35–36) is similar. He, too, sees Ehveel Merodakh’s exclusion as having the purpose of linking Nevukahdnezzar and Belshazzar, but he understands the parallel between them in a subtly different way. Ehveel Merodakh’s reign is skipped so as “to connect the interruption of a reign to the interruption of a reign.” Both Nevukhadnezzar’s and Belshazzar’s reigns end suddenly and violently.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Seven years later, however, Nevukhadnezzar is restored to the throne. See Daniel 4:31–34.</i> Daniel 4:26–34 describes how Nevukhadnezzar is driven insane, and reduced to an animal-like state. Chapter 5 of Daniel describes the night of Belshazzar’s downfall and assassination. In both cases, the text presents the curtailment of these reigns as a punishment for their arrogance and their failure to fear God.
R. Elazar’s and R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s approaches to the chronological problem in the text are clearly similar. Both of them see the omission of Ehveel Merodakh’s reign as designed to draw our attention to the link between Nevukhadnezzar and Belshazzar, and both of them view these kings in a negative light. More important, each of them understands the Book of Daniel as having primarily a moral and spiritual purpose, rather than a historical one. But where R. Elazar focuses on the likeness in the character traits of Nevukhadnezzar and Belshazzar, R. Shmuel bar Nahman wants us to see the similarity in their destinies. R. Shmuel bar Nahman’s teaching emphasizes that people like Nevukhadnezzar and Belshazzar do not go unpunished for their sins and that God, not kings, controls the reins of history.
<b>The Second Example</b>
The second example from the Book of Daniel (lines 37–40) is a case of true dischronology, rather than omission. Chapter 5 of Daniel ends with the death of Belshazzar, and Chapter 6 opens with Darius the Medean taking over part of Belshazzar’s empire. The narrative then goes back to the reign of Belshazzar in Chapters 7 and 8 (although the midrash mentions only Chapter 8). Here, the historical sequence is completely distorted. Why, the midrash asks, does “the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar” (Daniel 8:1) appear well after his death has been recorded (in Daniel 5:30)?
<b>The Artificiality of Chronology</b>
The first answer cited by the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> is unexpected, to say the least: “R. Huna said, ‘So that [people] will not say that [these verses] are story-telling; so that everyone will know that [Daniel] said [them] with Divine inspiration’” (lines 41–43). In other words, according to R. Huna, the blurring of chronological order in the Book of Daniel proves its veracity. This surprising statement is reinforced by the comment of the Rabbis, that the story is told out of sequence “in order to weave together (<i>lesareg</i>) the whole book as being said with Divine inspiration” (line 45). Rashi understands the Rabbis’ words to mean that the interweaving of chronological anomalies throughout the text demonstrates the Divine nature of the whole book, and not only of the chapters in which dischronology is found.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I have brought only part of Rashi’s argument. See the full discussion in Rashi in <i>dibur hamat’hil: gevtan legevtan</i> and <i>dibur hamat’hil: keday lesareg al hasefer kulo....</i> Note, also, the commentary of the Matnot Kehuna, <i>dibur hamat’hil: piyyutin</i> and <i>dibur hamat’hil: lesareg</i>.</i>
These statements are confusing, to say the least. We are inclined to view the preservation of chronological order in an historical account as evidence of its accuracy and not the opposite. Since we perceive events sequentially in time, it seems both natural and intellectually appropriate to record them as they occur – i.e., chronologically. R. Huna and the Rabbis disagree with this ostensibly common sense viewpoint, however. Their claim is that strict adherence to chronological order is a characteristic of fictional stories and not of true narratives.
In his commentary on this midrash,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>dibur hamat’hil: divrei piyyutin</i>.</i> the Maharzu paraphrases this claim as follows: “[Authors of fictional stories] are careful with ordering in their words [to preserve] what precedes and what follows, but words [written with] Divine inspiration do not preserve chronology for deep reasons….”
The Maharzu’s brief comment highlights the significance of R. Huna’s and the Rabbis’ words in a number of ways. First, implicit in his statement is the awareness that chronology is an artificial construct, a function of human perception, rather than an objective fact. Chronological ordering is a tool people use to make sense of the events they perceive in the world around them, sometimes at the expense of more meaningful ways of connecting experiences, such as causality or their spiritual and moral significance, for example. Since temporality is only one dimension through which we experience the world, the actual order in which events occur may be of relatively minor importance. Any specific event may be linked with happenings that precede or follow it in ways unexplainable by the organizational principle of chronology alone. Chronological ordering can thus obscure other levels of understanding that would help us grasp the deeper significance of a narrative.
Precisely because chronological ordering is a useful organizational tool, authors of fiction can, and do, employ it to construct fictional narratives. According to R. Huna and the Rabbis, though, the appearance of veracity created by the use of strict chronological ordering is actually a clear indication that we are reading an artificial story, not a real one. Only something artificially constructed can be encompassed by a rigid sequential organization. Reality is never quite that one-dimensional, uncomplicated, or neat. A narrative flowing from a Divine source cannot be confined to such a limiting organizing principle.
<b>Selecting Examples</b>
At this point, we need to consider how the redactors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> choose the examples they use to illustrate their argument about the chronological flexibility of the <i>Tanakh</i>. Given that instances of dischronology are quite common in the <i>Tanakh</i>, it is unclear why these particular examples should have been selected. This is especially the case since only the third example is truly analogous structurally to the chronological problem in the Yosef story, as we have noted. (The first example, Genesis 2–3, is not unambiguously an illustration of dischronology, and the second example, Daniel 4, 5, and 6, involves omission rather than disruption of sequence.)
<b>“In Order to Weave Together the Whole Book…”</b>
Re-examining the texts selected by the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i>, we are able to see that they are not only illustrations of dischronology. Each example has additional characteristics that add force to the argument the midrash constructs here. For one thing, the examples are selected from Genesis and Daniel – that is the first book of the <i>Tanakh</i>, and one of the last books. Jewish tradition puts these books in different canonical categories. The first section, the Torah (or Pentateuch), has the status of <i>mipi haGevurah</i> (dictated by God Himself); the second, <i>Nevi’im</i> (Prophets), has the status of <i>nevua</i> (written from a prophetic experience); the third, <i>Ketuvim</i> (Writings), is considered to have been composed with <i>ruah haKodesh</i> (Divine inspiration), the lowest level of Divine revelation. Genesis is the first of the five books of the Torah, while the Book of Daniel straddles the categories of <i>Nevi’im</i> and <i>Ketuvim</i>. The canonical tradition includes it within the <i>Ketuvim</i> category,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Batra</i> 14b.</i> although according to at least one stream of thought in <i>Hazal</i>, Daniel himself, the author of the book, is considered a <i>navi</i> (prophet).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, <i>Mekhilta d’Rabi Yishmael Parshat Bo</i>, <i>dibur hamat’hil: be’eretz Mitzrayim</i> from the words “<i>im tomar dan ani et haneviim…</i>. See also, <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> on Isaiah section 385.</i>
<br>For the opposite position, see <i>Megilla</i> 3a and the commentary of Rashi.
<br>Rabbi Shalom Carmy suggests that the book of Daniel was difficult to classify because, while the last six chapters of the book recount Daniel’s prophecies, the first six chapters (the narrative portion of the book) contain the visions of non-Jewish kings which Daniel interpreted. Drawing examples of dischronology from books that span the length of the <i>Tanakh</i> and cover all its categories has the effect of making a statement about the whole of the <i>Tanakh</i>, far beyond these specific cases. To borrow the Rabbis’ statement about the book of Daniel, illustrations are drawn from Genesis and Daniel “in order to weave together the whole” <i>Tanakh</i> as being ungoverned by strict sequential ordering.
<b>Thematic Connections</b>
The examples chosen by the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> are also thematically related to the Yosef and Tamar/Yehuda stories. Prominent, even integral elements in both stories are the motifs of royalty and sexual transgression. Thus, the Yosef narrative is in large part the account of Yosef’s rise to power, foreshadowed in his dreams and later brought to fruition. The episode of Potiphar’s wife, in which Yosef resists her attempts at seduction is part of the sequence of events which lead Yosef to his position as second to Par’oh. Similarly, the story of Tamar and Yehuda describes the establishment of the royal line of Israel, and the turn of events hinges critically upon the sexual sins of Yehuda’s sons, and Yehuda’s poor choice of a marriage partner.
The texts from Genesis and Daniel also touch upon these issues. The Genesis example, especially as understood by R. Yehoshua ben Karha, deals with the effect of sexuality upon the human decision-making process. The examples from Daniel describe the rise and fall of royal figures as a function of their moral stature. These instances, then, chosen by the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i>, mirror the Yosef narrative in both structure and content. This subtly illustrates that chronological order is not necessarily the most illuminating of connections that can made between narratives. Linkages of linguistic or thematic elements, to name just two, may well be more thought provoking and spiritually enriching.
<b>Implications for <i>Hazal’</i>s Approach to Interpretation</b>
R. Huna and the Rabbis have shown clearly that the <i>Tanakh</i> is not constrained by the organizing principles of a history text. The redactors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> now return us to our point of departure: “<i>Even here, also,</i> it is necessary to say: ‘And Yosef was brought down to Egypt.’ And it says, ‘And Yehuda went down from [being with] his brothers’” (lines 46–48). The midrash has contextualized for us the interweaving of the Yosef narrative with the Yehuda/Tamar story within the larger framework of the <i>Tanakh</i>. The interpretive problem with which we began – how to explain the chronological anomaly of these chapters – is now seen to be an illustration of chronological flexibility, a critical characteristic of biblical style. This flexibility with regard to chronology (among other characteristics of biblical style) leaves room for textual interpretation or, more accurately, <i>requires</i> us to engage in interpretation. If strict chronological ordering is not an absolute guiding principle in the structure of the <i>Tanakh</i>, and if it does not enable full understanding of the events recorded there, we become responsible for finding the critical connections and underlying meanings that tie the biblical text together.
By demonstrating this, the editors of <i>Genesis Rabba</i> justify the very interpretive enterprise in which they are engaged. Now they can return to the task of analyzing the connection between the larger Yosef narrative, and the Yehuda/Tamar section of the story.
<b>Returning to the Interpretive Task</b>
In lines 46–48, the midrash returns to the verses with which it began<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">We should note that in bringing us back to the verses they began explicating, the midrashic editors in effect bring us back to the first midrashic commentary on the link between the two stories, i.e., R. Elazar’s statement that the stories are juxtaposed to connect the two descents.</i>: “And Yosef was brought down to Egypt…” (Genesis 39:1) and “And Yehuda went down from [being with] his brothers…” (Genesis 38:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The order of the verses is reversed here, with the verse from Genesis 39 preceding the one from Genesis 38. Perhaps this is yet another subtle reminder that sequential ordering is not always the most important way to connect events.</i> The remainder of the midrash then presents two more perspectives on the connection between these verses.
The commentary in this part of the midrash takes the form of two narrative expansions which suggest alternate motivations for Yehuda’s departure from his brothers, the act which introduces the Yehuda and Tamar story. In the biblical text, Yehuda’s action is not accompanied by any explanation. We are told that he goes, but not why. In other words, the significance of his behavior as well as its connection to what precedes and follows, is left unspecified. The narrative expansions that make up the remainder of this midrash elucidate the meaning of Yehuda’s separation from his brothers by adding explanatory dialogue to the text. Both stories place Yehuda’s departure from his brothers after the selling of Yosef, and both see a causal connection between this sale and Yehuda’s separation from his brothers. And yet the narrative expansions offer strikingly different portrayals of the brothers’ emotional state in the aftermath of their selling of Yosef.
<b>The First Narrative Expansion</b>
The first narrative expansion (lines 49–54) has Yehuda telling his brothers, “Come, let us scatter ourselves, for as long as we are gathered, the writ of debt may be found (<i>matzui</i>) for collecting.” Having sold Yosef, Yehuda, as the leader of his brothers, becomes conscious that they have committed a wrong for which they will be made to pay a high price. In hope of eluding the punishment he knows they deserve, Yehuda suggests that the brothers disperse, so that the “writ of debt” will not be able to be collected because the “debtors” will no longer be a group.
God, commenting to Himself on Yehuda’s words, says, “[When] ten people have been found out (<i>nimtze’u</i>) for stealing, isn’t one person [who is caught] caught for all of them?” God rejects Yehuda’s metaphoric description of Yosef’s sale into slavery as the contracting of a collective debt, and calls it by its proper name: theft.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Kidnapping, in the classical sources, is called <i>genevat nefashot</i> (“stealing souls,” i.e., people).</i> The procedures for punishing thieves are not the same as those for punishing debtors. Even if only one of a group of thieves can be caught, he will be punished for his part in the crime.
As the midrash explains, the brothers themselves come to see the later events in Egypt as their punishment for selling Yosef: “And when they were found (<i>nimtze’u</i>) with [Yosef’s] goblet, they said, ‘…the Lord has found out (<i>matza</i>) the sin of your servants...’” (Genesis 44:16) (lines 53–54). The sin referred to is not that of stealing a goblet, but something the brothers believe this Egyptian ruler cannot possibly know about – the selling of their own brother into slavery. It is “the Lord” Who “has found out the sin,” and not the human ruler before whom they stand unjustly accused of theft.
This midrashic description of Yehuda and his brothers suggests that their guilt feelings for having sold Yosef, later expressed during painful experiences in Egypt, begin immediately after they have committed the crime. The idea of separating is initiated by Yehuda, but by leaving the brothers’ response unstated, the midrash implies that they agree with both the suggestion and the reasons for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shetika kehoda’a.</i> “Silence is like assent” (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 37b).</i> The explicitly stated motivation for this separation is the desire to avoid punishment – a clear indication that Yehuda and his brothers feel guilty for what they have done. But another possible explanation for this separation might be the brothers’ unacknowledged sense of shame. Perhaps Yehuda and his brothers are so uncomfortable with what they have done, that they simply cannot bear to remain together.
Whatever the reason for the separation, however, it is clear that Yehuda does not wish to look too squarely at what has happened. We see this in his attempt to downplay the nature of their crime by describing it as the contracting of a debt. God’s response to this description shows that Yehuda has not related properly to the magnitude of his sin. The brothers themselves, though, come to understand this fully much later. Only in Egypt do we see their first explicit signs of remorse. Taken in all its parts, the midrash depicts Yehuda and his brothers as people who feel a vague culpability but do not allow themselves to examine it too closely.
<b>Bringing the Commentary Back to the Text</b>
The narrative expansion discussed here creates a convincing bridge between chapters 38 and 44 in Genesis. By portraying the brothers as having guilt feelings, if not fully acknowledged remorse, very soon after selling Yosef, this midrashic commentary plausibly explains why they immediately see the connection between their cruelty to their brother and the ordeal they undergo in Egypt. Their awareness does not spring out of thin air; it has been growing since they committed the crime. In the same way, the narrative expansion is able to explain how Yehuda falls so far, so fast in Genesis 38. After selling Yosef, the midrash tells us, Yehuda is a man in a spiritually precarious position. He feels uneasy for his leading role in a sin that he does not fully admit to himself, and in such a state he is not likely to probe his actions very deeply.
This narrative expansion is clearly compatible with the plain sense of Genesis 38 and 44, but we should note two details. First, the actual speaker of the words “…the Lord has found out the sin of your servants…” is Yehuda himself, although in the midrash, the words are attributed to all the brothers (lines 53–54). Putting Yehuda’s words in the mouths of all the brothers is another mechanism enabling the midrash to claim that all the brothers, and not only Yehuda, experience feelings of unacknowledged guilt after selling Yosef. In doing so, the midrash is not radically altering the plain sense of Genesis 44 since, from Genesis 43:15, until Genesis 44:18, when Yehuda alone speaks, the brothers are shown acting and speaking as a unit.
<b>The Significance of “Finding”</b>
Second, when we re-read the midrash in the context of the biblical account, we notice that it picks up on the repetitions of the root <i>m-tz-a</i> (“find”) in Genesis 44. By featuring this root prominently in its own commentary, the midrash draws our attention to this element in the text. The root <i>m-tz-a</i> appears in the chapter in verses 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, and 17; in several of these verses, the root appears more than once. The midrash repeats several forms of this root (lines 50, 52, and 54) in its expansion of the narrative, and in the first of two comments that follow the narrative expansion (line 55). Even the second comment, which does not use a form of the root <i>m-tz-a</i>, relies on wordplay based on that root (line 58).
In his comment, R. Yitzhak ties the narrative expansion more closely to Genesis 44 by reminding us of what Yehuda says when he suggests that the brothers separate so that “the writ of debt” will not “be found for collecting” (lines 49–50). If the selling of Yosef is a debt, it cannot be collected without the presence of all the debtors. But now, all gathered in Egypt, and at the mercy of a powerful Egyptian lord, the brothers say, “…the Lord has found out (<i>matza</i>) the sin of your servants…” (Genesis 44:16). As R. Yitzhak observes ironically, a situation has been created in which “the creditor has found (<i>matza</i>) occasion to collect his bill” (line 56).
R. Levi’s observation is even more biting. Playing on the similarity in sound between the root <i>m-tz-a</i> (“find”) and the root <i>m-tz-h</i> (“squeeze, wring, drain”), R. Levi comments on the same verse, that God has “found out (<i>matza</i>)” the sin of the brothers “like someone who drains (<i>mematzeh</i>) a barrel and leaves the dregs.” The image is particularly ugly – the sin of the brothers has been exposed before all, like the slime at the bottom of a barrel.
Both these comments highlight the significance of Yehuda’s statement that God has “found out” the sin of the brothers. To say that something has been “found” or “found out” implies that it was lost or concealed. Clearly, the brothers hope that their selling of Yosef has been somehow forgotten or concealed, though in their hearts they must know that nothing is concealed from God. We see this in the contradiction implicit in Yehuda’s statement: “Come, let us scatter ourselves, for as long as we are gathered, the writ of debt may be found for collecting.” As we have seen, Yehuda would prefer to view the selling of Yosef as the contracting of a debt – a relatively minor offense – but his impulse to scatter the brothers shows that he is afraid and that his fear is inspired by guilt. By having God, unlike Yehuda, liken the selling of Yosef to theft, the midrash has shown us that the sin has never been “lost” or covered up, at least from God’s perspective. If God does not act to punish the brothers until this point, it is only because He has planned otherwise.
Both R. Yitzhak’s and R. Levi’s comments emphasize that the brothers’ sin has never been “forgotten” by God, or “lost.” R. Yitzhak tells us that the appropriate opportunity for calling in “the writ of debt” had not yet arrived. In other words, the seeming absence of God’s response to the selling of Yosef was just a matter of timing. R. Levi’s observation is harsher. He tells us that the sin has been there all the time, merely covered up, like the dregs in a barrel of wine. Everyone knows that the dregs are at the bottom of the barrel, but they are exposed only when the wine is drained.
<b>The Second Narrative Expansion</b>
The second narrative expansion (lines 59–65), presents a very different picture from the first. In the Rabbis’ version of the aftermath of Yosef’s sale into slavery, the brothers are portrayed as feeling no uneasiness at all about what they have done. On the contrary, they perceive their father’s terrible grief and mourning – the consequence of that action – as an inconvenience that prevents him from arranging marriages for them. They will have to “provide for themselves” because Yaakov “is occupied with his sackcloth and fasting,” which makes it “not proper that he be occupied in marrying us to wives” (lines 60–62). Unlike the first narrative expansion, in which Yehuda initiates the separation, in this account, the brothers take the lead in urging Yehuda to depart from them for the purpose of seeking out a wife: “Aren’t you the head of us all? Get up and provide for yourself [a wife]” (lines 63–64). “Immediately,” the midrash tells us, Yehuda does indeed “go down” and marries a Canaanite woman, the act that begins his decline.
On this reading, the brothers are so convinced that they have done no wrong in selling Yosef that they show no signs of remorse in the aftermath of that act. Their main concern is practical: How are they to go about finding wives without their father’s help? In this version of the events, then, only in Egypt do the brothers come to realize the enormity of their crime against their brother. In a sudden, dramatic realization they recognize their guilt – not of spying, as the Egyptian lord would have it, but of cruelty to their brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This reading may be derived in part from the odd locution of the verse in which the brothers first articulate their guilty feelings: “…but (<i>aval</i>) we are guilty concerning our brother…” (Genesis 42:21).</i>
Significantly, the selling of Yosef marks a change in the brothers’ attitude to their father. They have relegated Yaakov to the sidelines, and no longer see him as an authoritative and formative influence in their lives. Having plunged their father into terrible grief, they know that they must now “provide for themselves” but they seem unconscious of the problems they might encounter in doing so. When the children of Yehuda’s marriage prove to be unworthy, we see the disastrous consequences of a marriage made by providing for oneself.
Although we might expect Yehuda’s position to become stronger as Yaakov’s parental role weakens, in this narrative expansion at least, Yehuda seems a diminished character. He does not take the initiative in suggesting that he marry, or that the other brothers do the same. Even the manner in which the brothers address him implies that he has ceased to take charge: “Aren’t you the head of us all?” (line 63). If he is their head, as the brothers claim, it is odd that he needs to be reminded of this now. The betrayal of Yosef appears to have undermined Yehuda’s sense of leadership.
This picture of Yehuda squares well with what happens to him subsequently. As the concluding comments of the midrash tell us, “It was a descent for him that he married a non-Jew. It was a descent for him that he buried his wife and sons” (lines 66–67). That descent appears to begin with his leading role in the selling of Yosef. The connection is a cause and effect relationship and not only chronology.
<b>Interpretation and Context</b>
Now that we have examined the various part of this remarkable midrash in detail, it would be valuable to look at the midrash in its entirety with an eye to its function as an interpretive text. The explanatory power of this paragraph can be attributed, in part, to the broad context within which each section deals with the interpretive difficulties it encounters. Rather than explaining individual words, phrases, or even whole verses, each of the opinions relates the text to another part of the <i>Tanakh</i>, and shows the connections and disjunctions between them. The middle section of the midrash, lines 19–45 goes so far as to view the Yosef narrative within the context of the entire <i>Tanakh</i>.
This interpretive strategy shows us not only that <i>Hazal</i> saw the <i>Tanakh</i> as an interrelated whole, but also that they viewed comparison, connection, and contrast as intrinsically illuminating. This can also be seen in the way that the redactors of the various midrashic books organize the opinions they quote. As we see elsewhere, by juxtaposing contrasting opinions, or ordering them hierarchically, the editors of the midrash construct new meanings and readings out of the building blocks of different interpretations. The effect of this is to engage the thoughtful reader in a constant examination and re-examination of the midrashic text and of the biblical text itself.

Chapter 15; Portrait of a Biblical Personality; Exploring David's Heart in the Aftermath of Sin

<b>Portrait of a Biblical Personality:<br>Exploring David’s Heart in the Aftermath of Sin</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll">“<i>…and my heart is empty within me.</i>” (Psalms 109:22)</span>
<b>The Sin of a Righteous King</b>
Perhaps the only true failure of King David’s life was the sin of his illicit relationship with Batsheva.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read chapters 11 and 12 of II Samuel for context.</i> This disastrous episode, out of which so many of his personal tragedies flowed, is also one of the enigmas of the Book of Samuel. Although the sequence of events in II Samuel:11 is set out clearly by the text, the sin seems to materialize from nowhere, and happens with shocking rapidity. From the bare bones of the narrative, it is hard to fathom how King David – enamored of God and devoted author of Psalms who yearned to build the Temple – committed a sin of such gravity.
As we saw from the midrashic discussion of Yona,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 5.</i> the text of the <i>Tanakh</i> often leaves the thoughts and motivations of biblical personalities out of the narrative. This is the case in the story of David and Batsheva as well. To fill this gap, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 107a–b offers a long midrashic discussion of the events leading up to David’s sin and following in its wake. In this discussion, we are given a subtle and revealing analysis of the emotional and spiritual backdrop of David’s sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A technical discussion of the nature of David’s sin, may be found in <i>Shabbat</i> 56a. For two different approaches to this story, see the commentaries of the Abarbanel and Malbim.</i>
<b>The Midrashic Interpretation</b>
(1) R. Yehuda said in the name of Rav
(2) A person should never bring himself to a test,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., should never place himself in the position of being tested.</i>
(3) for, here, David, King of Israel, brought himself to a test, and failed.
(4) [David] said before Him,
(5) “Master of the universe, why do we say,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the Amida prayer</i> ‘The Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov,’
(6) and we do not say, ‘The Lord of David?’”
(7) He said, “[Because] they were tested by Me, and you were not tested by Me.”
(8) [David] said before Him, “Master of the universe, examine me and test me,”
(9) as it says, “Examine me (<i>behaneni</i>) God, and test me…” (Psalms 26:2).
(10) He said, “I will test you,
(11) and I will do something with regard to you [that I did not do for them].
(12) For I did not make known to them [what the test would be],
(13) but I am making known to you that I will test you in a sexual matter.”
(14) Immediately,
(15) “And it was evening time, and David got up from his bed…” (II Samuel 11:2)
(16) R. Yehuda said, “[This means] that he switched his nighttime bed to the day,
(17) and a <i>halakha</i> was concealed from him (<i>nit’alma mimenu halakha</i>) [namely]:
(18) ‘A man has one small organ.
(19) If he satisfies it, it [becomes] hungry; if he starves it, it is satisfied.’”
(20) “And he walked on the roof of the king’s house, and he saw a woman bathing on top of the roof [of her house]; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance” (II Samuel 11:2).
(21) It was Batsheva, who was washing her hair under a hive.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Rashi. For an alternative translation, see Jastrow, who translates it as ‘a loose wickerwork used for making beehives…screens, etc.’ The choice of Rashi’s translation will be clarified in the discussion.</i>
(22) Satan came, and [made himself] appear to [David] as a bird.
(23) [David] shot an arrow at [Satan, but] hit the hive [broke it open],
(24) uncovered [Batsheva] and saw her.
(25) Immediately,
(26) “And David sent, and inquired about the woman, and [the person of whom he inquired] said, ‘Is she not Batsheva, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?’ And David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her, and she was purifying herself from her impurity, and she returned to her house” (II Samuel 11:3–4).
(27) and that is what it says,
(28) “You have tested (<i>bahanta</i>) my heart; You have visited it at night; You have refined me and have found nothing; let no evil thought of mine (<i>zamoti</i>) pass my lips” (Psalms 17:3).
(29) [David] said, “Would that a muzzle (<i>zemama</i>) had come onto the mouth of the one who hates me, and he had not said such a thing!”
(30) Rava expounded:<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I have opted to translate the word <i>darash</i> as ‘expounded’ because the nature of the readings given for these texts is largely homiletical rather than strictly interpretive. We will see this in the discussion of the different readings. The effect of these homiletical readings is, however, interpretive in terms of the Book of Samuel since they serve to explain what is missing in our understanding of the David/Batsheva story.</i>
(31) “Why does it say, ‘To the chief musician, of David: I have trusted in God; how can you say to my soul, “Flee to the mountain, O bird.’”” (Psalms 11:1)?
(32) David said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(33) “Master of the universe, pardon me for that iniquity, so that they will not say, ‘The mountain among you – a bird moved it.’”
(34) Rava expounded:
(35) “Why does it say, “To You alone I have sinned, and I did evil in Your eyes, in order that You be justified in Your words, and merit in Your judgments” (Psalms 51:6)?
(36) David said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(37) “It is revealed and known before You, that had I wanted to suppress my [sinful] inclination, I could have suppressed it,
(38) but I said, let them not say, ‘The servant has bested the master.’””
(39) Rava expounded,
(40) “Why does it say, ‘For I am ready to limp, and my pain is before me always’ (Psalms 38:18)?
(41) [Because] Batsheva, the daughter of Eliam, was meant for David from the [time of ] the six days of Creation, but she came to him in a painful manner.”
(42) And similarly, the house of R. Yishmael taught,
(43) “Batsheva, the daughter of Eliam, was meant for David, but he partook of her [as an] unripe [fruit].”
(44) Rava expounded:
(45) “Why does it say, ‘And in my limping they rejoiced; and they gathered, the cripples<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Rashi. See also Ibn Ezra on this verse.</i> gathered upon me and I did not know; they tore at me, and were not silent’ (Psalms 35:15)?
(46) David said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(47) “Master of the universe, it is revealed and known before You, that if they were to tear my flesh, my blood would not well up.
(48) And not only that, but when they engage [in discussing] the four death penalties administered by the courts, they stop their learning and say to me,
(49) ‘David, a person who takes a married woman, by which [form of the death penalty] is he put to death?’
(50) I said to them, ‘One who takes a married woman is put to death by strangulation, and he has a portion in the World to Come,
(51) but he who embarrasses his friend in public has no portion in the World to Come.’””
(52) R. Yehuda said in the name of Rav,
(53) Even at the time of his illness, David fulfilled his sexual obligations to [his] eighteen [wives], as it says,
(54) ‘I am wearied with my groaning; at night I cause my bed to swim [with tears];<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Radak.</i> with my tears, I melt my bed’ (Psalms 6:7).”
(55) And R. Yehuda said in the name of Rav,
(56) “David wanted to worship idols, as it says,
(57) ‘And it was that David came to the head [of the mountain] where he would bow to the Lord…’ (Samuel II 15:32),
(58) and ‘head’ means none other than idol worship, as it says,
(59) ‘…and the image’s head was of fine gold…’ (Daniel 2:32).
(60) ‘…and, here, Hushsai the Arki came toward him, his tunic torn, and dirt on his head…’ (II Samuel 15:32).
(61) He said to him, “They will say that a king like you worshipped idols?!”
(62) He said to him, “A king like me – killed by his own son?!
(63) Better that he should worship idols, and that the Name of Heaven not be publicly desecrated.”
(64) He said to him, “For what reason did you marry a ‘beautiful woman’?”
(65) He said to him, “The Torah permits it.”
(66) He said to him, “And didn’t you interpret the connections between verses?
(67) For just after [the verses permitting marriage to a ‘beautiful woman,’ it says,] ‘And if a man will have a stubborn and rebellious son…’ (Deuteronomy 21:18).
(68) Whoever marries a ‘beautiful woman’ will have a stubborn and rebellious son.””
(69) R. Dostai of Biri expounded:
(70) To what may David be compared?
(71) To a Cuthean merchant.
(72) David said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(73) ‘Master of the universe, “who can understand errors…” (Psalms 19:13)?’
(74) He said to him, “They are pardoned for you.”
(75) [David said to Him,] “…and from hidden sins, cleanse me” (ibid).
(76) [He said to him,] “They are pardoned for you.”
(77) [David said to Him,] “Also from intentional sins, hold your servant back…” (Psalms 19:14).
(78) [He said to him,] “They are pardoned for you.”
(79) [David said to Him,] “…let them not rule over me <i>(al yimshelu bi)</i>, and then I will be whole…” (ibid), that is,
(80) let the Rabbis not talk about me.”
(81) [He said to him,] “They are pardoned for you.”
(82) [David said to Him,] “…and I will be cleansed of a great transgression…,” that is,
(83) let my ‘stench’ [sin] not be written.”
(84) He said to him, “That is impossible.
(85) If even the <i>yud</i> that I took from Sarai stood and wailed for years until Yehoshua came and I added it to him, as it says,
(86) ‘And Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun, “Yeshoshua”…,’ (Numbers 13:16)
(87) how much more so, this whole story.”
(88) “…and I will be cleansed of a great transgression…”
(89) He said before Him, “Master of the universe, forgive me for the whole sin.”
(90) He said, “In the future, your son Shlomo will say in his wisdom,
(91) ‘Can a man carry fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can a man walk on coals and his feet not be scorched? Thus is one who takes the wife of his friend; all who touch her will not be cleansed.’ (Proverbs 6:27–29)”
(92) He said to Him, “Shall this man be so sorely troubled?”
(93) He said to him, “Accept suffering upon yourself.”
(94) He accepted [suffering] upon himself.”
(95) R. Yehuda said in the name of Rav,
(96) For six months, David was a leper, and the Divine Presence left him, and the Sanhedrin separated from him.
(97) [We know that] he was a leper, because it says,
(98) “Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be purified; wash me and I will be whiter than snow” (Psalms 51:9).
(99) [We know that] the Divine Presence left him, because it says,
(100) “Return to me the joy of Your salvation, and Your generous spirit will support me” (Psalms 51:14).
(101) And [we know that] the Sanhedrin separated from him, because it says,
(102) “Those who fear You will return to me…” (Psalms 119:79).
(103) How do we know that it was for six months?
(104) Because it says, “And the days that David ruled over Israel were forty years; in Hebron he ruled seven years, and in Jerusalem he ruled thirty three years” (I Kings 2:11).
(105) and it says, “In Hebron he ruled over Yehuda seven years and six months…” (II Samuel 5:5).
(106) and those six months were not counted.
(107) We learn from this that he was a leper.
(108) He said before Him, “Master of the universe, forgive me for that sin.”
(109) [God said,] “It is forgiven to you.”
(110) [He said,] “Make for me a sign for the good, and my enemies will see, and be ashamed, for You, God, have helped me and comforted me” (Psalms 86:17).
(111) He said to him, “During your life I will not make it known,
(112) but I will make it known in the life of Shlomo, your son.”
(113) At the hour that Shlomo built the Temple,
(114) he wanted to bring the Ark into the Holy of Holies,
(115) [but] the gates stuck together.
(116) He said twenty-four songs, but was not answered.
(117) He said, “Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, O eternal openings, and let the King of honor come. Who is the King of honor? God, strong and mighty, God, the mighty in war” (Psalms 24:7–8).
(118) And it is said, “Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift up, O eternal openings, and let the King of honor come” (Psalms 24:9),
(119) and he was not answered.
(120) When he said, “God, Lord, do not turn away the face of Your anointed one, remember the kindnesses of David, Your servant” (II Chronicles 6:42),
(121) he was immediately answered.
(122) At that hour, the faces of David’s enemies turned [as black] as the edges of a pot,
(123) and all Israel knew that the Holy One blessed be He had forgiven him for that sin.”
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
In a text of this length, determining the structure of the midrash is no easy matter. As a first step, it seems reasonable to divide the midrash into three large sections, with the understanding that each of the sections contains subdivisions.
The first large section, lines 1–29, contains R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion of II Samuel 11:2–5 and his commentary on it. The second section, lines 30–68, lists a number of narrative expansions, based mostly on verses from Psalms, which comment further on the story. The last section, lines 69–123, describes the aftermath of David’s sin, providing what is essentially a narrative expansion of II Samuel 12.
The first section could be further divided as follows:
(1) R. Yehuda’s introduction to the story (lines 1–3)
(2) the first part of the narrative expansion: the dialogue between God and David that precedes the sin (lines 4–13)
(3) R. Yehuda’s comment on the first part of II Samuel 11:2 (lines 14–19)
(4) the second part of the narrative expansion of II Samuel 11:2–5 (lines 20–26)
(5) the third part of the narrative expansion which describes David’s thoughts in the aftermath of his taking of Batsheva (lines 27–29)
The second section could be further divided as follows:
(1) Rava’s interpretation of Psalms 11:1 (lines 30–33)
(2) Rava’s interpretation of Psalms 51:6 (lines 34–38)
(3) Rava’s interpretation of Psalms 38:18 (lines 39–41)
(4) the citation of the house of R. Yishmael’s position on this point (lines 42–43)
(5) Rava’s interpretation of Psalms 35:15 (lines 44–51)
(6) R. Yehuda’s interpretation of Psalms 6:7 (lines 52–54)
(7) R. Yehuda’s interpretation of II Samuel 15:32 (lines 55–68)
The third section could be further divided as follows:
(1) R. Dostai’s interpretation of Psalms 19:12–13 (lines 69–94)
(2) R. Yehuda’s description of the sufferings of David (lines 95–107)
(3) the conclusion of David’s dialogue with God (lines 108–111)
(4) the fulfillment of God’s promise to David in Shlomo’s lifetime (lines 112–123)
<b>R. Yehuda’s Introduction</b>
R. Yehuda introduces his narrative expansion of II Samuel 11 with a cautionary statement about the danger of placing oneself in a situation of being tested. Even David, King of Israel, he warns us, failed when he “brought himself to a test” (lines 1–3). The narrative expansion that follows shows us how David placed himself in a situation of being tested and how he failed.
<b>David’s Question: A Revealing Mistake</b>
The opening dialogue of the narrative expansion begins with David’s question: “Master of the universe, why do we say, ‘The Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov,’ and we do not say, ‘The Lord of David’” (lines 5–6). The question seems arbitrary. Why might David imagine that we <i>should</i> say ‘The Lord of David,’ in our prayers? The Patriarchs form a natural unit both historically and spiritually; neither David nor any of the other great spiritual heroes of the Jewish people appropriately fit within that unit. This is evident to us and should be evident to him. We do not, after all, say ‘The Lord of Yosef,’ or ‘The Lord of Moshe,’ or ‘The Lord of Shmuel,’ in prayer either. David does not seem to consider this obvious objection to his question. Furthermore, it is hard to understand what motivates David’s question. Why does he feel the need to have God’s name linked to his in prayer?
Significantly, this wish is expressed in the framework of a dialogue between David and God, with Whom no pretence is possible. David’s question, therefore, must be serious; he wants a real answer. This is no mere theoretical issue for David; we see this clearly from the fact that he pursues the question. Beyond the point of simply receiving an explanation from God, in requesting a test, he attempts actually to become like the Patriarchs. David is portrayed as totally unself-conscious and completely unaware of the problematic nature of what he has said, or the impression of arrogance it leaves. For this reason, David’s question is highly revealing of his frame of mind in the period preceding his encounter with Batsheva.
The opening dialogue of this narrative expansion seems intended to show us a man who is uneasy with himself and/or unhappy with the role in which he finds himself. Both David’s question and his persistence in playing out the scenario of the test imply that he wants to refigure his relationship with God to resemble the one he imagines existed between God and the Patriarchs. In asking why his name is not linked in prayer to God’s as theirs are, David is, in effect, asking why he cannot be someone else, someone like Avraham, Yitzhak, or Yaakov.
David’s question would be appropriate if it were simply meant to express admiration for the Patriarchs and an understandable wish to be as righteous as they were. The problem is that it really expresses dissatisfaction with himself and his own relationship with God; we see this from what he says at the end of the first section of the midrash: “Would that a muzzle had come onto the mouth of <i>the one who hates me</i>, and he had not said such a thing” (line 29). “The one who hates me” is, of course, David himself, and the thing he wishes he had not said is the request for a test. After the first rush of impetuousness in which David commits his grave sin, he is able to look back and see that his actions were triggered by self-hatred. David recognizes, with deep remorse, that he has been his own worst enemy.
<b>God’s Answer: A warning</b>
On one level, God’s response to David’s question might be read as an informative answer to a theoretical question: If you, David, want to know why the names of the Patriarchs are linked to Mine in prayer, it is because “they were tested by Me, and you were not tested by Me” (line 7). Interpreted in this way, God’s response is an explanation about the character of the Patriarchs and their special status. For David, however, this question is most emphatically not about gathering historical information, as God well knows. In light of this, God’s response is actually a warning: If you, David, are asking this question because you want to be like the Patriarchs, you must understand that part of what defined them was their having been “tested by Me.” I have chosen not to test you, because you are different from them, and My relationship with you is unlike My relationship with them.
The reader, who has been forewarned by R. Yehuda’s introductory statement, understands that David is being cautioned. However, David is concentrating on the goal of having his name linked to God’s in prayer, and he is not yet conscious of the problematic impulse which is driving him. He therefore interprets God’s answer as a challenge, and reacts to it with a request to be tested so that he too can enter the company of the Patriarchs (lines 8–9).
At this point, God issues another warning: “I will test you, and I will do something with regard to you [that I did not do for them]. For <i>I did not make known to them</i> [what the test would be], <i>but I am making known to you</i> that I will test you in a sexual matter” (lines 10–13). By telling David that He is handicapping the test in his favor – something He did not do for the Patriarchs – God is suggesting to David that it is folly for him to request a test. God presented the Patriarchs with trials that grew organically out of their lives as a function of their characters and their place in history and thus they did not know when they were being tested. David has not been tested in the manner of the Patriarchs because the challenges he needs to face are not the same as theirs. He is unlike the Patriarchs in temperament and he plays a different role in history. Even if God tests him, as he has requested, the test will be qualitatively different from that of the Patriarchs precisely because he has requested it. By the same token, the fact that he has been forewarned of the nature of his test, should make him aware that even “passing” will not put him in their company due to the different conditions of his test. His test will have been compromised by his expectation of it.
There is a further warning in God’s description of the type of trial David will have to overcome: “…I will test you in a <i>sexual matter</i>.” At this point, David should be asking himself why he is being tried in this manner and not another. For a test to be meaningful, it must challenge and stretch the character traits that make up the personality being tested. The Patriarchs underwent tests of faith and trust in God. In contrast, David will be faced with a test requiring self-control, a very different quality from those exercised by the Patriarchs in their trials. David is vulnerable to a sexual test because he is a deeply passionate person in every sense of the word. This trait defines his very nature, for his emotional intensity feeds both his fervent love of God and his vulnerability to sexual indiscretion. The passion that inspires David to compose the ardent religious poetry of Psalms is best left untried in the sexual realm; passionate emotion, by nature, is impulsive, strong, and difficult to control.
<b>Preparing for the Test</b>
“Immediately,” the midrash goes on to tell us, at the conclusion of David’s dialogue with God, “And it was evening time, and David got up from his bed…” (II Samuel 11:2) (lines 14–15). The word “immediately” is intended to describe a connection both chronological and causal; David’s dialogue with God effects a change in his life. R. Yehuda states that, having been informed of the nature of the test he is about to face, David “switched his nighttime bed to the day…” (line 16). Rashi explains R. Yehuda’s words as meaning that David begins to have relations with his wives during the day “so that he would be sexually satiated and would not think [sinful thoughts] about women the whole day.”
David has changed his customary behavior in preparation for the test of which he has been forewarned, reasoning that if he is sexually sated, he will not be drawn into temptation. By “switching his nighttime bed to the day,” David wishes to create a set of circumstances that will protect him from failure. There are, however, two problems with this strategy.
First, in his attempt to rig the outcome of the test in his favor, David is actually trying to circumvent it rather than pass it. Were his strategy to succeed, it would not be because he had faced sexual temptation and overcome it, but because he would never have allowed himself actually to experience it. This would mean that he had successfully <i>avoided</i> the test, not that he had passed it. If David wishes to be like the Patriarchs, this manner of undergoing a trial will get him nowhere. Instead of advancing him toward his goal, David’s mistaken strategy exposes his sense of insecurity about his ability to pass the test. In fact, David is attempting to evade the test he has called down upon himself because he fears it greatly.
The second problem with David’s strategy is that it is doomed to failure.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Rabbi Shraga Silverstein’s analysis of the David and Batsheva story in <i>The Antidote</i> (Feldheim, 1979) pages 58–64.<br>I was privileged to study with Rabbi Silverstein in high school and gained immeasurably from his approach to text study. He was one of the teachers who introduced me to the possibilities of a non-literal understanding of midrash, and his analysis of the first part of this midrash was particularly meaningful for me. When I encountered this midrash in full in later years, his analysis aided me greatly in developing my own understanding of it. The reader will see where my interpretation deviates from his. Any errors of understanding or misrepresentation of his position are, of course, my own.</i> R. Yehuda conveys this by telling us that “a <i>halakha</i> was concealed from him, [namely]: ‘A man has one small organ. If he satisfies it, it [becomes] hungry; if he starves it, it is satisfied’” (lines 17–19). Rashi explains that “one who satisfies his [sexual] organ with intercourse [makes it] hungry, and increases his sexual desire.” In other words, the way to quiet sexual desire is to starve it, rather than feed it. David has changed his sexual conduct in a mistaken attempt to satiate himself. The technique he employs, though, will actually increase his vulnerability to sexual temptation rather than strengthening his resistance to it.
<b>“Forgetting” a <i>Halakha</i></b>
How does David come to make such a fundamental mistake about human psychology? R. Yehuda hints at the answer to this question with his use of the phrase “<i>nit’alma mimenu halakha</i>,” translated above as “a <i>halakha</i> was concealed from him” (line 17). The phrase <i>nit’alma</i> <i>mimenu halakha</i> might also be translated as “a law eluded him” or “he forgot a law.” (In this context, it is clear that <i>halakha</i> means “a fact about human nature” and not a detail of Jewish law.) However, if we examine uses of this phrase elsewhere in midrash,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">All the examples of this meaning of the phrase <i>nit’alma mimenu halakha</i> to which I refer occur in discussion of biblical stories. I do not know if this generalization can be made with regard to the use of this phrase elsewhere in the literature of <i>Hazal</i> (i.e., in purely halakhic discussions which do not relate to biblical stories).</i> we will note that it often indicates more than a neutral forgetting. The phrase implies that the person who has “forgotten” the law would normally have been expected to know it. Furthermore, the cases in which this phrase is used to describe forgetting are often emotionally loaded or otherwise problematic.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, for example, in <i>Leviticus Rabba</i> 13:1, we are told that Moshe forgets a <i>halakha</i> because he became angry, and in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 82a, Moshe is described as forgetting a law in a situation where he is being personally attacked.<br>Similarly, in <i>Ruth Rabba</i> 4:9, Avner is described as having temporarily forgotten a law that is critical for determining David’s personal status. (The setting of this story is King Shaul’s court. In this context, the question of David’s personal status is of considerable import.)</i>
In light of this, we can see that R. Yehuda’s statement, “a <i>halakha</i> was concealed from him,” reveals a great deal about David’s state of mind at this point in the narrative. Facts and laws do not have the power to conceal themselves, but human beings often perceive and remember them selectively. R. Yehuda is suggesting that, at some level, David has chosen to “forget” a fact of human nature which we would reasonably expect him to know. We cannot say that David is <i>consciously</i> ignoring this fact because the text tells us that the “<i>halakha</i> was concealed from him,” but this phrase also implies that David <i>should</i> have remembered what he has forgotten.
R. Yehuda also makes it obvious that the “forgotten” <i>halakha</i> is of no small relevance to David because he needs to know it in order to pass the test he has so eagerly requested of God. People seldom forget what is truly important to them, and yet, R. Yehuda tells us, somehow David forgets this fact about human nature, and therefore conducts himself in a way that fatally undermines his chances of success.
In constructing this first part of the narrative expansion as he does, R. Yehuda portrays David as a profoundly conflicted person. On one hand, he is unhappy with himself and dissatisfied in his relationship with God. This can be seen from his desire to be like the Patriarchs and his request for a test that will qualify him to join their ranks. However, once his request is granted and he is faced with the test that will ostensibly change things for him, David reacts paradoxically. He seems to fear the possibility both of failing the test and of passing it. R. Yehuda shows us this in his description of David’s self-defeating behavior: he attempts to “prepare” for the test by changing his sexual habits and yet he “forgets” a basic fact about human nature that could have truly aided him in passing the test.
<b>Narrative Expansion as Allegory</b>
In the next part of his narrative expansion, R. Yehuda interweaves the account in II Samuel 11 with his own words. R. Yehuda quotes II Samuel 11:2 to the effect that David sees a beautiful woman bathing on the roof of her house (line 20) and then comments as follows: “It was Batsheva, who was washing her hair under a hive. Satan came, and [made himself] appear to David as a bird. [David] shot an arrow at Satan, [but] hit the hive [broke it open], uncovered [Batsheva] and saw her” (lines 21–24). R. Yehuda then quotes the rest of the story as it appears in II Samuel 11:3–4 (lines 26–27).
At first glance, it is hard to see what R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion adds to our understanding of the text. After all, the sequence of events in II Samuel 11:2–4 is very straightforward: From his vantage point on the roof of his house, David sees a beautiful woman bathing on the roof of her house.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the ancient Middle East, the roof of a house was utilized as living space and storage space, much as an attic might be used in a Western home. Even today, in Jerusalem’s Old City, one can see rooftops used in this way. Because houses are not uniform in height, it is possible for someone with the right vantage point to see onto another person’s rooftop, even when it is enclosed in some way.</i> He inquires about the woman and, having discovered who she is, sends for her, and has relations with her. She then returns to her home.
R. Yehuda’s narrative addition cannot be intended to solve a typical textual problem, such as a gap, a redundancy, or an ambiguity in the language of the text, since there are none. If anything, his account seems to muddy waters that didn’t need clarifying. As we noted earlier, the only thing missing from the verses in II Samuel 11:2–4 is an explanation of how the righteous, God-loving David falls so rapidly, and with so little apparent conflict, into committing such a grave sin. It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that this second part of R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion is an allegorized explanation of what caused David to stumble. Like the dialogue between David and God which R. Yehuda inserts before the biblical account, this addition is meant to shed light on the inner workings of David’s mind in his first encounter with Batsheva.
If we treat this allegory as a <i>mashal</i> of sorts, we can use parts of the methodology we have employed for understanding <i>meshalim</i> to get at the meaning of R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion.
Our first step is to look at the allegory in its own terms and in relation to the biblical verses. R. Yehuda’s allegory places Batsheva in apparent concealment under a hive, and David – out for an evening stroll on the roof of his house – with arrows in his hands. R. Yehuda also adds a character to the story in the form of Satan disguised as a bird. David aims an arrow at the bird but misses and, hitting the hive, breaks it open. Only then does he see Batsheva.
This version of the events described in verses 2–5 gives rise to a number of questions. First, why is Batsheva bathing under a hive – surely not the safest thing to do – and, given that most hives would not be a huge obstruction, why doesn’t David see her until the hive is broken? After all, II Samuel 11:2 describes David as seeing Batsheva right away. Why should David be carrying a bow and arrow on the roof of his own house when he has merely gone out for a walk? Where does Satan come from, and why does he take the form of a bird? And, in light of David’s remarkable abilities as a marksman (demonstrated in his defeat of Goliath with one stone from his slingshot), how does he come to miss his intended target, and hit the hive instead?
Our next step is to isolate the elements of R. Yehuda’s allegory, as follows:
a hive
Satan
Satan’s appearance as a bird
the arrow
David’s shooting of the arrow
the hitting of the hive
seeing Batsheva
Ordinarily, our next step would be to find correspondences for the elements in the allegory. However, because we are not dealing with an actual <i>mashal</i> here, we have no <i>nimshal</i> against which to match the elements. Moreover, in the case of a <i>mashal</i> that has no <i>nimshal</i>, we can often match the elements on the basis of the biblical text; here, we cannot because this allegory relates to the narrative expansion of the text, and not the biblical text itself. A further complication in our task is that what we have been calling an allegory is not actually a true allegory, since it mixes characters from the biblical text with symbolic elements. For all these reasons, our analysis cannot yield a neat chart as in the case of <i>mashal</i>/<i>nimshal</i> correspondences. Instead, we need to piece together the meaning of this interweaving of text and narrative expansion.
<b>A Psychological Portrait in Symbolic Language</b>
The easiest correspondence we can draw between the allegory and its interpretation is that both David and Batsheva are manifestly the David and Batsheva of the biblical story, and not symbols for something else. The “hive” concealing Batsheva is not, however, the actual screen behind which she presumably bathed, but a symbol for the possibilities inherent in David’s encounter with her.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The hive is given a different symbolic interpretation in <i>The Antidote.</i> See page 64.</i>
A hive holds both honey and bees that sting. A skilled beekeeper can extract honey from a hive without getting stung, but an unskilled person will be stung long before he can get to the honey. A properly conducted relationship with Batsheva – one in which he had waited for her marriage to be terminated before marrying her himself – would have been a sweet and fitting thing for David, as Rava and R. Yishmael say in the second part of the midrash (lines 39–43). The birth of Shlomo and his subsequent inheritance and stewardship of David’s legacy show just how fitting a wife Batsheva was for David. But, as David learns to his great sorrow, his manner of taking Batsheva makes the relationship a painful one with tragic consequences. David is stung because he breaks the hive open, instead of leaving it intact and extracting its sweetness with care.
The symbolic meaning of Satan is more easily assigned, because the Satan-figure appears often in midrash as the personification of an individual’s Evil Inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is in keeping with the statement in <i>Bava Batra</i> 16a: “He is Satan; he is the Evil Inclination; he is the Angel of Death.” See, for example <i>Genesis Rabba</i> 56:4.</i> In this narrative expansion, Satan’s appearance to David in the form of a bird signifies that David has incorrectly gauged his capacity for sexual temptation. On the conscious level, at least, he makes the mistake of seeing it as something fleeting and easily dispatched.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See the discussion of Rava’s reading of Psalms 11:1 (lines 30–33) below.</i>
The method by which David attempts to neutralize his Evil Inclination – source of the sexual temptation he so fears – is symbolized by his shooting the arrow at the bird. R. Yehuda’s earlier comments about the changes David makes in his sexual conduct tell us what shooting the arrow signifies, namely, David’s mistaken strategy of satiating himself sexually so that he will not be sexually tempted.
The arrow is a particularly apt symbol for David’s strategy because it is a weapon that David should be capable of handling with great ease, given his natural talents as a marksman. (An arrow is also a phallic symbol.)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, <i>Nida</i> 43a, where the male copulative act is described as <i>yore ka’hetz.</i></i> The weapon, though, misses the mark, and David hits the hive, rather than the bird. This “uncovers” Batsheva so that David sees her in the thick of his heightened sexual tension. The narrative expansion thus reiterates the point R.Yehuda made earlier: David’s mistaken strategy for ensuring that he passes the test virtually guarantees his failure. By interweaving this narrative expansion with the biblical text, R. Yehuda shows us that the factors leading to David’s failure are an integral part of the story, although they are not made explicit in the biblical verses.
On R.Yehuda’s reading, therefore, the answer to our initial question is clear. The righteous, God-loving David falls so far so fast because his psychological state before his encounter with Batsheva predisposes him to sin when he sees her. And, as R. Yehuda has made abundantly clear, David alone is responsible for this state of affairs.
<b>The Aftermath</b>
R. Yehuda concludes his narrative expansion with David’s remorseful cry in the aftermath of the episode: “Would that a muzzle (<i>zemama</i>) had come onto the mouth of the one who hates me, and he had not said such a thing!” (line 29). R. Yehuda bases this statement on a quote from Psalms (17:3): “You have examined (<i>bahanta</i>) my heart; You have visited it at night; You have refined me and have found nothing; let no evil thought of mine (<i>zamoti</i>) pass my lips” (line 28). The verse is aptly chosen for R. Yehuda’s purposes because it contains the root <i>b-h-n</i> (which appears in the verse quoted in line 9 as part of David’s request for a test), and because of the play on words between <i>zamoti</i> in the verse, and <i>zemama</i> in David’s statement.
R. Yehuda perceives David as having become conscious that his dissatisfaction with himself – which <i>preceded</i> his encounter with Batsheva – created a set of circumstances that made sinning almost inevitable. Significantly, R. Yehuda has David express anger at himself not for taking Batsheva from Uriah, but for having requested a test. In this way, R. Yehuda indicates David’s awareness that his real failure was the character flaw that set the stage for his sinning. To be sure, both the text of II Samuel and the book of Psalms<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, II Samuel 12:13 and 22–23, and Psalms 51.</i> are clear testimony that David feels both guilt and remorse for what he has done to Batsheva and Uriah. R. Yehuda, however, wants us to see that David’s self-recognition goes deeper even than his desire to repent for evil deeds. David knows that had he examined his motivations before encountering Batsheva, he would never have brought himself to sin.
<b>“Annotating” the Story</b>
The next section of the midrash consists of a series of brief narrative expansions that further illuminate the David/Batsheva story, although they interrupt the chronological flow of the narrative as a whole. The first and third sections of the midrash form a chronologically coherent, self-contained narrative, the first section ending with David’s regretful words immediately following his sinful behavior and the third section opening with R. Dostai’s account of David’s begging for forgiveness after having sinned. Taken together, the first and third sections of the midrash might be titled: “David before and after Batsheva.” In contrast, the narrative expansions in the second section, while clearly related to the David/Batsheva story, seem to have been placed here more to bolster the analysis presented in the first section of the midrash than to continue the narrative flow. This impression is heightened when we note that five of the seven narrative expansions in this section are based on verses from Psalms, in distinction to the first section of the midrash, which is based mostly on the verses in II Samuel 11 dealing with the actual David/Batsheva story. Perhaps R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion is intended to tell the David/Batsheva story from the perspective of II Samuel 11, while these brief commentaries treat the same story primarily from the perspective of Psalms.
In any event, because the midrashic comments in the second section interrupt the narrative flow, we need to see how these brief comments function within the larger context of the narrative expansion to build a coherent portrait of David.
<b>Rava’s First Commentary</b>
Rava’s first comment quotes Psalms 11:1 and presents it as a request by David for forgiveness from God. The relevant part of the verse reads as follows: “…I have trusted in God; how can you say to my soul, ‘Flee to the mountain, O bird’” (line 31). Rava paraphrases this as, “David said before the Holy One blessed be He, ‘Master of the universe, pardon me for that iniquity, so that they will not say, ‘The mountain among you – a bird moved it’’””” (lines 32–33).
Rava’s narrative expansion, like R. Yehuda’s description of the episode on David’s rooftop, uses allegorical elements. In this case, however, the allegory is particularly complex because the symbolic meaning of the bird-image is dependent upon the context within which it is viewed. To understand how the meaning of “bird” shifts, we must examine the bird image within more than one framework.
When we read the verse within the context of Psalms 11, it is clear that David is addressing unnamed enemies who see him as deserving exile and wish that he “flee to the mountain,” away from other people.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi and Ibn Ezra on this verse.</i> Within the context of the verse, the bird symbolizes David’s soul; this is evident from the way David addresses his detractors: “How can you say to <i>my soul</i>, ‘Flee to the mountain O <i>bird</i>.’”
In Rava’s reading of the verse, however, the bird reference brings us back to the image of Satan in the guise of a bird as he appears to David in R. Yehuda’s allegory. The mountain in Psalms 11:1 refers, in Rava’s mind, to David himself, the great king,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on the words <i>har shebakhem</i>.</i> and the verse, as Rava reads it, is David’s plea for forgiveness: “Master of the universe, pardon me for that iniquity, so that they will not say, ‘The mountain among you – a bird moved it’” (line 33). These words, however, have implications beyond David’s heart-felt desire to atone for his sin. They are also a subtle self-incrimination, and a confession that he fears public shame. After all, the great King David <i>was</i> moved to sin by a mere bird – as he himself recognizes – and he is anxious that others not know this of him.
<b>Association and Shared Elements</b>
Rava’s reading changes the plain sense the verse from Psalms has in its original context. It is important to note, though, that the power of his commentary depends critically upon our understanding of both the plain sense and its context. In his use of the bird symbol, Rava alludes to R. Yehuda’s story, and the reader experiences an almost dizzying shifting of meanings as he re-reads Psalms 11 in light of Rava’s and R. Yehuda’s narrative expansions.
Three details in Psalms 11 arouse associations with R. Yehuda’s story. In addition to the bird reference, the description in verse 2 of how the wicked prepare their bows and arrows to use against the righteous, reminds us of the arrow David shoots on his rooftop. The third detail, David’s statement in verse 5 that “God will test the righteous…,” takes us back to David’s request for a test. The associations to R. Yehuda’s story are unmistakable. The elements are all there in Psalms 11 – bird, arrow, test – although their order, weight, and meaning in R. Yehuda’s allegory differ from their plain sense in the psalm itself.
In expanding the psalm as he does, Rava is not attempting to explain its plain sense. By juxtaposing Psalms 11 with R. Yehuda’s story, though, he underlines the contradiction at the heart of David’s tragic mistake. This contradiction manifests itself in all three elements shared by Psalms 11 and R. Yehuda’s story. The bird, indeed, is both David’s soul <i>and</i> his own Evil Inclination – “Satan” disguised as a bird. His failure to recognize the “bird” for what it is leads him into sin. By the same token, although David’s avowed purpose in “shooting his arrow” at the “bird” is not intentionally wicked, in Psalms 11:2, David describes the wicked shooting arrows at the righteous. This description makes evident David’s awareness that arrows are dangerous things and need to be handled with care. In the wrong hands, they can have fatal consequences, something David learns when his own “arrow” goes astray. Similarly, as David knows from the stories of the Patriarchs, God tests the righteous. One might conclude that to be counted among the righteous, one must undergo tests. R. Yehuda’s story shows us that David learns to his great sorrow the terrible price paid for requesting a test, even if one hopes to attain through it a lofty spiritual goal.
The effect of these associations between Psalms 11 and R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion is to heighten our sense of David as a great man in a painful spiritual dilemma, whose confusion distances him from his goal rather than helping him attain it. David wishes to fit himself into the mold of the Patriarchs in a mistaken attempt to come closer to God. Instead, he turns himself from a solid “mountain” – a great king – into an insubstantial being moved by an impulse he now recognizes was a “bird” – a light thing easily banished.
The relationship between Rava’s reading of Psalms 11 and R. Yehuda’s expansion of the narrative in Samuel is not at all simple. Rava’s reading alludes to R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion and also reinforces it, while showing us the complexity of the factors that lead David to sin.
<b>Rava’s Second Commentary</b>
As we have seen, Rava’s first commentary (lines 30–33) uses the connections between the plain sense of Psalms 11 and R. Yehuda’s story. To get the full flavor of his message, we need to think associatively rather than literally, but the message itself seems a plausible reconstruction of David’s emotional state in the aftermath of his sin. In contrast, Rava’s second commentary (lines 34–38) is far easier to reconstruct in terms of the grammar of the verse cited, but presents us with a message that seems counterintuitive.
Rava bases his commentary on a verse from Psalms 51, written by David after the prophet Natan has rebuked him for sinning with Batsheva.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Please read the entire psalm for a better understanding of the discussion.</i> Verse 6, quoted by Rava, is difficult even within the context of the psalm for two reasons. First, David’s statement, “To You alone I have sinned…” appears to ignore the wrongs done to Batsheva and Uriah. Second, the grammar of the verse is problematic; this is more apparent in the Hebrew original than in translation. The syntax of the verse implies that David is claiming to have sinned for God’s sake, and not for his own gratification: “To you alone I have sinned, and I did evil in Your eyes, <i>in order that</i> (<i>lemaan</i>) You be justified in Your words, and merit in Your judgments.” Rava reads this to mean that “David said before the Holy One blessed be He, ‘It is revealed and known before You, that had I wanted to suppress my [sinful] inclination, I could have suppressed it, but I said, let them not say, “The servant has bested the master”’” (lines 36–38).
Our first reaction might be to interpret Rava’s narrative expansion as a way of portraying David in a negative light. On this reading, David’s words would be an expression of self-serving arrogance and/or dishonesty in the face of his failure. This reading, however, matches none of the other portrayals of David we have seen so far, whether in II Samuel 12, Psalms 51, or in the midrashic pictures drawn by R. Yehuda and Rava until this point. All the other sources available to us give a completely different impression of David. Thus, II Samuel 12:13 shows us David immediately assuming full responsibility for his sin, as soon as he is confronted by Natan, without any attempt at self-justification. Similarly, Psalms 51 can only be read as a completely sincere outpouring of abject remorse and desire for a renewal of David’s connection with God. Additionally, neither R. Yehuda nor Rava have portrayed David as a brazen, conscious sinner. And, perhaps most significantly, Rava frames David’s words as a statement made directly to God. As we have pointed out above, in such a context, no pretence is possible.
<b></b>
Re-examining a Paradox
On the assumption that Rava’s reading of Psalms 51:6 is not intended as an ironic comment about David’s self-deception and arrogance, we need to interpret the words attributed to him as a straightforward statement of fact. Read this way, David is making three assertions that require examination. The first assertion, that God knows David could have passed the test, contains the second – that David himself knows he could have passed the test (“it is revealed and known before You that had I wanted to suppress my [sinful] inclination, I could have…”). The third assertion is that David <i>chose</i> to fail the test so that others would not see him as having defeated God in some way (“but I said, let them not say, ‘The servant has bested the master.’”)
If we accept David’s words as an honest statement, these assertions enable us to understand something we have noted but not explained – why David appears to fear passing the test as much as he fears failing it. As we have seen from R. Yehuda’s re-telling of the verses in Samuel, David relates inconsistently to the test he has requested. On one hand, he so fears failing the test, and so much doubts his ability to pass it, that he tries to assure his success by changing his sexual conduct. This strategy, however, virtually guarantees he will fail the test; David would be expected to know this. R. Yehuda indicates as much by telling us that David has “forgotten” – i.e., unconsciously chosen to forget – a critical fact about human nature.
The paradoxical nature of David’s behavior becomes yet more evident when we consider that David himself, contemplating his failure in retrospect, is able to see that he could have passed the test had he truly wanted to. Rava has him say this explicitly here. This insight is also subtly apparent in Rava’s first narrative expansion, in which David represents himself as a mountain (i.e., a towering, immovable object), and the temptation to which he was subjected as a bird (i.e., something light and easily defeated). It seems reasonable to conclude on the basis of all this that David is ambivalent about passing the test, and that his ambivalence causes him unconsciously to sabotage himself.
<b>The Source of David’s Ambivalence</b>
In light of all we have said, there is no reason to doubt David’s claim that he could have passed the test. R. Yehuda’s analysis of David’s behavior implies as much. After all, David could have acted differently had he chosen to, leading the story to a very different outcome. Had David not “forgotten” the <i>halakha</i> and had he not changed his sexual conduct in preparation for the test, he might well have been able to face the temptation posed by Batsheva without yielding. But, we might ask, what then? What would David have become had he passed the test?
To answer this question we need to consider why David apparently wishes to be someone other than himself. In our analysis of R. Yehuda’s portrayal of David, we noted that David’s initial question, “Master of the universe, why do we say, ‘The Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov?’” (line 5) indicates his unhappiness with himself and his insecurity about his relationship with God.
The text of II Samuel gives us ample grounds for these emotions. From the moment he becomes king over all of Israel at the age of 37 until his encounter with Batsheva at age 56,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Seder Olam Rabba Hashalem</i>, with commentary by Weinstock, 1956, vol. 2, chapter 14, for a chronology of David’s life.</i> David suffers a series of hardships and rejections which seriously try him. To begin with, David has finally consolidated his kingdom after his persecution at the hands of King Shaul and following a painful transition period in the wake of Shaul’s death (Chapter 5). In gratitude to God, and as a symbol of his newly unified reign, he wishes to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. His first attempt ends in the death of Uzza, one of the celebrants accompanying the Ark. Three months later, his second attempt is successful, but is marred by his estrangement from his wife, Michal (Chapter 6).
During a stretch of peacetime after many experiences of war David concludes, erroneously, that his kingdom is now secure and asks the prophet Natan for permission to build the Temple. Natan gives his permission without first consulting God, but the request is rejected by God. The language with which David accepts this rejection indicates how intensely his love of God has motivated his request (Chapter 7).
The chapters leading up to the David/Batsheva story are filled with wars – this after David had hoped that he could finally stop fighting to secure his kingdom. The incident that precipitates the war Uriah goes off to fight is the shameful treatment of David’s ambassadors to Amon. David, in a gesture of friendship to the new Amonite king, has sent ambassadors who are publicly humiliated by the king of Amon and expelled in disgrace.
The war that follows is protracted and difficult, but David, atypically, has not accompanied his army to the front; rather, he is “sitting in Jerusalem…,” rising late for a stroll (II Samuel 11:1–2).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See the Malbim’s commentary on these verses. He contends that the text is criticizing David for behaving with uncharacteristic lack of zeal and concern for Israel in failing to go to war and in rising late. The Malbim’s contention accords well with the notion that David is not happy with himself at the point of his encounter with Batsheva.<br>Note also Uriah’s answer to David’s query about why he has not gone home after having come from the battlefield: “The Ark and Israel and Yehuda are dwelling in shacks and my master Yoav and the servants of my master [David] are camped on the face of the battlefield; shall I come home to eat and drink and lay with my wife?! By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do such a thing” (II Samuel 11:11). From Uriah’s words it appears that David’s uncharacteristic behavior has not escaped his subjects.</i> This is perhaps most significant in setting the stage for David’s failure to pass his test. David – usually the most responsible and majestic of kings – here lets his kingly conduct slacken.
Even a cursory perusal of Psalms indicates that David has not merely undergone many trials in his life, but has suffered through them with all the intensity of his ardent nature. Equally, the book of Psalms attests to the great love, devotion, trust, and desire for closeness that David feels toward God. David experiences both the pain and the joy of his connection to God wholeheartedly.
To be David is an unremitting struggle because he feels everything with such intensity and constantly holds himself to the highest spiritual standards. Until this point, David has waged his internal battles with great fortitude, while contending intelligently and courageously with all the external threats he has faced personally and as king.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">It is worth noting that David demonstrates enormous self-control as well as an impressive ability to improvise and think strategically, both before and after he becomes king. Thus, for example, when David finds himself in a position to kill Shaul (twice!) he refrains from doing so and prevents others from doing so on purely moral grounds. David is remarkably patient in waiting to consolidate his kingdom after the death of Shaul, and manages to prevent the kind of bloodbath that generally attended a change in dynasty in the ancient world. These are just two examples of David’s capacity for truly majestic behavior.</i> Perhaps at this stage in his life, with the beginning of old age, worn out from his struggles and suffering, and uneasy with his own conduct as king during this period of war, David would prefer to be someone other than himself. Viewing the trials of the Patriarchs from the comfortable distance of long-completed history, he may well perceive them as having attained the pinnacle of connection to God and the recognition of history with greater ease than has been granted to him.
R. Yehuda indicates that David’s initial motivation in requesting a test is linked to self-dissatisfaction; it is, after all, “the one who hates me” who has made this request. But having placed himself in the position of being tested, David is now faced with a disturbing choice. If he fails the test, he will have committed a terrible sin, and taken a step downward in his spiritual path. If he passes the test, however, he will be like the Patriarchs, and not like himself – or so he mistakenly believes. To pass would be to gain the spiritual status he covets, but in the process he would lose his own unique relationship with God, the most precious thing in his life.
At this stage, and under the pressure of a trial, David is not yet able to see how to govern his passion without erasing his identity, without becoming the “servant [who] has bested the master.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In later years, David is able to come to terms with this problem. He learns to channel his passion so that it serves him, and has no need to either choke off that part of his personality or give himself up to it without control. See the commentary of the Ralbag at the end of I Kings Chapter 2, <i>dibur hamat’hil: v’ulam hatoalot hamagiot mimena hem elu: ha-toelet hasheni.</i></i> This is not, however, what he wants to become, since of all things, what David most cherishes is his status as God’s servant; we see this in his reference to himself throughout Samuel and Psalms as the servant of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See, for example, the beautiful paradox of Psalms 116:16. Note also that in submitting to God’s refusal of his request to build the Temple, David refers to himself repeatedly as “Your servant” (II Samuel 7).</i> No wonder, then, that David is ambivalent about passing the test he has requested. And no wonder that in an emotionally charged situation, this passionate king is unable to think clearly about his reactions. Only in retrospect can David see that “had I had wanted to suppress my [sinful] inclination, I could have suppressed it.”
<b>The Public/Private Man</b>
Careful readers may have noted something odd in part of David’s declaration: “…but I said, <i>let them not say</i>, ‘The servant has bested the master.’” Who, after all, would know about the change in David’s relationship with God, or even the passing of the test, had David not failed? Neither R. Yehuda nor Rava has suggested that there is any sort of audience present in these intimate exchanges between David and God. David’s preoccupation with the unspecified “they” and their comments on his changed relationship with God seems misplaced.
This oddity is resolved if we consider the unusually public nature of David’s deeply personal relationship with God. Because of David’s role as king, and by virtue of his passionate, open nature, the state of his relationship with God is constantly exposed to others. As the author of Psalms, David gives expression to his most profound religious emotions in a form to which others have access. David’s most powerful religious impulses are thus often played out in the public arena, and the line between the personal and the public is frequently blurred for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Consider, for example, David’s open rejoicing upon bringing the Ark up to Jerusalem, and Michal’s reaction to it. Even before becoming king, David displays his profound connection to God in public settings in which it might not have occurred to others to do so. David’s battle with Goliath is one such explicit, public avowal of his faith and trust in God.<br>David’s personal relationships are also often given similarly public expression because the role of king requires this of David. Thus, David’s undoubtedly deeply felt personal grief over the deaths of Shaul, Yehonatan, and Avner is played out in a public setting.</i> In this light, we can understand why he fears not only a fundamental change in his relationship with God, but also that others might be privy to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Another possibility is that the intensity of David’s love for God makes public acknowledgement of that love important to him.</i>
<b>“To You Alone I Have Sinned…”</b>
Rava’s interpretation of David’s dilemma offers a key to solving the difficulties in Psalms 51:6. As we noted, the words, “to You alone I have sinned…” might seem to imply that David does not recognize the evils he has done both to Uriah and Batsheva. This understanding of the verse, however, does not square well with David’s reaction to Natan’s parable of the rich man and the poor man in II Samuel 12. A careful reading of the parable shows that the primary accusation David faces is his crime against Uriah. The accusation is spelled out explicitly in verse 9: “…Uriah the Hittite you struck with the sword; his wife you took for your own as a wife, and he you killed with the sword of the sons of Amon.” David does not attempt to deny his culpability or contest the punishment Natan describes to him. He evidently accepts the justice of the accusation and recognizes his guilt.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Couching his acceptance in the words, “I have sinned to God” (verse 13) does not necessarily mean that David fails to recognize his sinfulness toward Uriah. All sins are sins to God, even sins against other people.</i> That David also feels some degree of guilt toward Batsheva can be seen in his comforting her after the death of their baby,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">II Samuel 12:24.</i> and in his promise to her that Shlomo will inherit the throne after his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I Kings 1:13. Radak cites a midrash that understands this promise as compensation for Batsheva’s unwillingness to continue to be David’s wife after the death of her baby. See Radak’s commentary on II Samuel 12:24 and I Kings 1:13. The Abarbanel cites the same source in his commentary on II Samuel 12:24. I have not been able to locate the source of the Radak’s and Abarbanel’s citations.<br>Note also David’s recognition of Batsheva’s claim that if Adoniyahu becomes king, Shlomo’s life and her own would be endangered. Implicit in Batsheva’s claim is the awareness on the part of David’s sons that Shlomo was his intended successor.</i>
David’s willingness to accept responsibility for his actions would suggest that the words “to You alone I have sinned…” are not intended as a claim that David has not sinned against anyone else. Rather, these words indicate David’s recognition of the roots of his transgression. David sees that his sin was precipitated by internal character flaws that damaged his relationship with God. David’s desire to escape these character flaws by becoming like the Patriarchs, rather than dealing with the difficulty of being himself, alters the balance of his relationship with God. To prevent himself from becoming “the servant [who] has bested the master,” and thereby lose his unique relationship with God, David sins “<i>in order that</i> You be justified in Your words....” The grammatical anomaly we noted in the verse is resolved by Rava’s narrative expansion. In this reading, David’s sin is his misguided attempt to place God back in His position as Master so that he can return to the position of servant.
<b>Rava’s Third Commentary</b>
Rava’s third commentary (lines 39–41) underscores the tragic nature of David’s sin by telling us that “Batsheva, the daughter of Eliam, was meant for David from the [time of] the six days of Creation, but she came to him in a painful manner” (line 41). Like the symbolism of the hive in R. Yehuda’s story, Rava’s statement tells us that David’s desire for Batsheva would have been a good thing – the fulfillment of a divinely ordained plan – had it found its expression legitimately. Taking Batsheva as he does, David both causes and experiences pain.
Rava’s bases his commentary on Psalms 38:18. As in his first commentary, Rava’s reading of the verse is dependent upon <i>understanding</i> the plain sense of the verse in context while reading it <i>against</i> the plain sense. The psalm as a whole is a description of the sufferings experienced by David as a punishment for his sins, and a plea that God not abandon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This understanding of the psalm follows the Radak and ibn Ezra. For a different approach–one that reads the chapter somewhat metaphorically – see Rashi.</i> Verse 18 reads as follows: “For I am ready to limp (<i>le-tzela</i>), and my pain is before me (<i>negdi</i>) always.” In the context of the psalm, the plain sense of the verse conveys David’s sense of his own frailty and suffering.
Picking up on two words in the text, Rava gives the verse a twist of meaning consistent with his reading of the David/ Batsheva story. The first word, <i>tzela</i> (from the root <i>tz-l-a</i>), here with the meaning of the verb “limp,” connotes in other contexts the noun “side.”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The relationship between the two words becomes clearer when we realize that someone who limps favors one side of his body.<br>The vocalization of the two words differ. In Psalms, <i>tzela</i> is written with a <i>segol</i>, while in Genesis, it is written with a <i>tzeireih.</i></i> This noun first appears in the <i>Tanakh</i> in the description of the formation of Hava, the archetypal woman: “And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his sides (<i>mi-tzal’otav</i>) and closed flesh in its place. And God the Lord built the side (<i>ha-tzelah</i>) that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought it to the man” (Genesis 2:21–22).
Rava reads the word <i>negdi</i> in Psalms 38:18 as another allusion to the story of Hava’s creation. This word, too, features in the Hava story where, announcing his intention to create the first woman, God says: “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helpmate opposite him (<i>kenegdo</i>)”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The usual translation of the word <i>neged</i> is “opposite” or “against.” In translating the verse from Psalms, I use neither of these words for stylistic reasons. The difficulty of translating <i>neged</i> adequately is attested to by the fact that the verse in Genesis reads somewhat oddly in English. Although this is not readily apparent from the translations, the verses from Psalms and Genesis do use the same word with essentially the same meaning, so that the association between them is not at all difficult to make.</i> (Genesis 2:18).
Reading <i>tzela</i> and <i>negdi</i> as allusions to Batsheva who, as the mother of Shlomo, is David’s most important wife, Rava is able to restructure the verse so that David appears to be saying something like: “I was ready for my <i>tzela</i> (i.e., Batsheva, who was destined for me as Hava was destined for Adam), but because I took her in the wrong way, my <i>negdi</i> (the “helpmate opposite me”) became my pain.”
<b></b>
Citing the House of R. Yishmael
A similar point is made by the house of R. Yishmael: “Batsheva, the daughter of Eliam, was meant for David, but he partook of her [like an] unripe [fruit]” (lines 42–43). Unlike Rava’s statement, this opinion is not grounded in David’s words from Psalms. Instead, the house of R. Yishmael evokes an image that recalls R. Yehuda’s symbolic use of the hive. Here, too, the image of an unripe fruit implies that David’s relationship with Batsheva holds potential sweetness, but is not yet actually sweet. While the symbolism of the hive introduces a note of danger, the fruit image implies that the main problem with David’s action is its haste. Had David allowed the fruit to ripen – i.e., waited for events to unfold properly – David could have had a fitting relationship with Batsheva, rather than one that turned bitter. If God’s intention was that Shlomo be born of the relationship between David and Batsheva, that could have come about in any number of fitting ways. Uriah might have died naturally or in battle; David could have negotiated a divorce and remarriage. Ultimately, David’s haste is only destructive.
<b>Rava’s Fourth Commentary</b>
Rava’s fourth commentary (lines 44–51), a narrative expansion of Psalms 35:15, offers yet another perspective on David’s attempts to come to terms with the magnitude of what he has done. Addressing God, David says, “Master of the universe, it is revealed and known before You, that if they were to tear my flesh, my blood would not well up. And not only that, but when they engage [in discussing] the four death penalties administered by the courts, they stop their learning and say to me, ‘David, a person who takes a married woman, by which [ form of death penalty] is he put to death?’ I said to them, ‘One who takes a married woman is put to death by strangulation, and he has a portion in the World to Come, but he who embarrasses his friend in public has no portion in the World to Come’” (lines 47–51).
The context in which Rava places David’s words indicates that we are meant to read them as an honest expression of his feelings. Once again, David is speaking directly to God; his words must, therefore, be sincere.
David’s speech can be divided into two sections. The first relates to his personal relationship with God. David’s desire to repent and atone for his sin is so strong that it consumes him physically as well as emotionally. Having fasted and wept so much that he would not bleed if his flesh were torn, David expresses his trust that God knows his repentance to be genuine: “…<i>it is revealed and known before You</i>, that if they were to tear my flesh, my blood would not well up.”
The second section shows us David’s attempt to come to terms with the public exposure of his sin and his consequent humiliation. As we have noted, there is no clear separation between public persona and private man for David and, because he is king, his public image is of great importance. In light of this, David’s reaction to the mocking question of his critics is highly significant. Asked about the death penalty administered to adulterers, David replies, “One who takes a married woman is put to death by strangulation, <i>and he has a portion in the World to Come</i>, but he who embarrasses his friend in public has no portion in the World to Come.”
David’s connection with God is the bedrock of his existence. The World to Come represents his eternal relationship with God. The penalties he will incur as a result of his sin, including humiliation at the hands of his critics, are of far less moment to him than the knowledge that he has not lost his portion in the World to Come. David is even willing to accept punishment by strangulation if that is required, as long as he remains God’s servant. He rebukes his detractors by telling them that they endanger their own eternal connection with God by the very act of humiliating him for a sin he already bitterly regrets.
<b>Interpreting the Verse</b>
The verse on which Rava builds this narrative expansion is from Psalms 35, in which David requests of God that He protect him from the enemies who persecute him, and expresses his trust that God will do so. Verse 15, which Rava paraphrases, describes how David’s enemies rejoice over his frailty and gather around to tear at him: “And in my limping they rejoiced; and they gathered, the cripples gathered upon me and I did not know; they tore at me and were not silent.” The reference to limping is easily understood within the context of the psalm as a description of a physical wound on which David’s enemies focus. Within the narrative framework that Rava constructs, limping becomes an appropriate metaphor for the spiritual frailty of David in the wake of his sin. David has been weakened by his failure, and his enemies gloat over this, rather than sympathizing with him. Significantly, though, they too are “cripples” – sinners as David is a sinner though, as David points out, their sin is in some ways greater than his. Both David, who “limps,” and his enemies the “cripples,” are spiritually damaged. While David sees the common weakness they share, though, he also sees the critical difference between them: David is filled with remorse over his sin, to the extent that there is no blood left in him. His enemies are oblivious of their own sinfulness; they “rejoice” in David’s sufferings, they “tear at him, and are not silent.”
<b>R. Yehuda’s Commentary</b>
The next two sections of the midrash return to R. Yehuda’s commentary. His first comment (lines 52–54) that “even at the time of his illness, David fulfilled his sexual obligation to [his] eighteen [wives],”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yehuda is referring to the halakhic obligation of a husband to meet his wife’s (or wives’) sexual needs.</i> is an emphatic statement about David’s sexual capacity. It serves to reinforce R. Yehuda’s earlier portrayal of David as a person of strong passions and strong will.
R. Yehuda cites the supporting passage for this statement from Psalms 6, which expresses David’s sufferings, and his plea that God heal him. Verse 7 describes David’s weeping at night in his bed: “I am wearied with my groaning; at night I cause my bed to swim [with tears]; with my tears, I melt my bed.” Placed in the context of R. Yehuda’s statement, the verse seems to refer to David’s nighttime (i.e., sexual) activities and, within that framework, represents David’s fulfillment of his conjugal obligations as a hardship rather than a pleasure.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on the words <i>mitati</i> and <i>be-dim’ati arsi amseh</i>.</i>
R. Yehuda’s comment is significant because it describes David’s sexual capacity as powerful even in a situation where we would expect otherwise. Weeping ordinarily causes loss of desire and physical strength, but David is able to meet his wives’ needs, although it is difficult for him. Telling us this, R. Yehuda goes a long way toward explaining why a test of sexual self-control is likely to be so difficult for David – his unusual sexual prowess matches his uncommonly passionate nature.
Beyond that, however, R. Yehuda’s statement also indicates that David is capable of exercising this side of his nature in a self-denying and generous way. To meet his wives’ needs, David performs a mitzvah at considerable cost to himself. R. Yehuda’s comment thus also tells us that David has the ability to direct his sexual drive and use it appropriately.
<b>R. Yehuda’s Second Comment</b>
R. Yehuda’s second comment (lines 55–68) is a narrative expansion of the David/Avshalom story (II Samuel 15), which at first glance seems unconnected to the line of thought developed up to this point.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Please read the chapter in its entirety for context.</i> R. Yehuda opens his story with the startling claim that “David wanted to worship idols…” (line 56). He supports this claim by a reading of II Samuel 15:32 that bears no relationship to the plain sense of the verse in context. R. Yehuda draws a parallel between the word “head” in this verse and its use in the description of an idol in Daniel 2:32<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Here R. Yehuda uses is a technique known as <i>gezera shava</i>, the linking of linguistic elements to reveal hidden connections.</i> (lines 57–59). R. Yehuda’s use of this verse is not interpretive, nor does it rely on the tension between the plain sense of the verse and its use in another context. In these respects, R. Yehuda’s use of II Samuel 15:32 as a prooftext differs from most of Rava’s prooftext uses, and even from his own interweaving of text and narrative expansion in the first part of the midrash.
The explanation for the remarkable behavior R. Yehuda attributes to David emerges in a conversation between David and his loyal friend, Hushai HaArki. The conversation takes place as David is escaping from his rebellious son, Avshalom, who wishes to kill him and take over the kingdom. Hushai, seeing that David is about to perform idol worship, expresses shock at the idea that David would do such a thing: “They will say that a king like you worshipped idols?!” (line 61). David’s answer reveals his motivation: “A king like me – killed by his son?! Better that he should worship idols, and that the Name of Heaven not be publicly desecrated” (lines 62–63).
As R. Yehuda presents it, faced with the prospect of being killed by his own son, David worries that his death might result in the desecration of God’s name. He doesn’t believe he deserves to die this way and assumes that others, seeing a righteous king murdered by his own son, might conclude that God is unjust. To prevent the desecration of God’s name should he die, David decides to worship an idol, and thereby supply the missing justification for what has happened to him. Ironically, David’s attempt at idol worship is an expression of his love for God and not, as might be supposed erroneously, abandonment of Him.
Hushai, however, does not accept David’s confused reasoning and offers another interpretation of Avshalom’s rebellion: “For what reason did you marry a ‘beautiful woman?’”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">A ‘beautiful woman’ is a woman taken captive taken in wartime. See Deuteronomy 21:10–15.</i> (line 64). David does not understand what Hushai is getting at, and answers that, “The Torah permits it” (line 65). Hushai, who has a more objective view of the situation, retorts: “And didn’t you interpret the connections between verses? For just after [the verses permitting marriage to a ‘beautiful woman,’ it says,] ‘And if a man will have a stubborn and rebellious son…’ (Deuteronomy 21:18). Whoever marries a ‘beautiful woman’ will have a stubborn and rebellious son” (lines 66–68). Hushai is quite certain that if David dies at Avshalom’s hands there will be no desecration of God’s name. People will attribute David’s death to the obvious – his marriage to a ‘beautiful woman.’ A hasty wartime marriage founded on lust for a captive woman is unlikely to produce worthy offspring. Although the Torah permits such a marriage as a concession to human frailty, it cannot be claimed that the Torah approves of such a union, or encourages it. The connection between verses proves this, as Hushai points out.
<b>Intense Emotion and a Failure to See Connections</b>
R. Yehuda’s depiction of David in this narrative expansion is extremely illuminating. Many of the character traits that make up David’s personality are evident here. Foremost is his intense love of God. As R. Yehuda portrays him, even when his life is threatened, David’s greatest concern is God’s honor, not his own; he will throw himself into the breach – ruin his own reputation as a righteous king – rather than see God’s name desecrated.
But R. Yehuda’s story shows us David’s greatest weakness as well, i.e., the lack of clarity that sometimes affects his thinking when his emotions are engaged. This emerges in two details of the story. First, that David considers committing idol worship, even to “save” God, is astonishing. Surely he must know, as we do, that nothing justifies idol worship, one of the three gravest sins a Jew can commit. The only plausible explanation for this extreme breach is that deep emotion tends to confuse David’s thinking and inclines him to cross lines that should be inviolate. The second detail that supports this contention is Hushai’s observation that David doesn’t “interpret the connections between verses.” When his thinking is clouded by his feelings, David doesn’t see the obvious, and this is also the case in sexual matters.
The picture of David that emerges here echoes the first part of the midrash. There, too, David’s fervor and love for God cause him to cross a line. He wants to have his name linked to God’s in prayer as the names of the Patriarchs are. Instead of accepting the obvious – that he cannot actually be anyone other than himself – he ignores the warnings implicit in God’s answers to him, and asks for a test. And, as in the case of his reasoning in the Avshalom story, when it comes to sexual matters, David’s thinking is confused. He “forgets” a <i>halakha</i>, and conducts himself in such a manner that guarantees his failure.
R. Yehuda’s narrative expansion of II Samuel 15 shows us that David’s sinning with Batsheva is part of a pattern in his life. David’s passionate nature creates many conflicts for him. On one hand, it is his greatest strength, the source of his deep connection with God. On the other, it is his greatest weakness, a quality that consistently leaves him vulnerable to serious errors. David’s nature presents a difficult challenge. He must learn to channel his passion properly so that it does not rule him to his detriment. At the same time, he must not choke it off because to do so would be to kill the most vital part of himself. At the point of his initial encounter with Batsheva, David has not yet learned to regulate his passion.
<b>R. Dostai of Biri: David as a Cuthean Merchant</b>
The final section of the midrash opens with R. Dostai’s reading of Psalms 19 as a dialogue between David and God (lines 69–93). The psalm is a song of praise to the ways in which God’s perfection and justice are reflected in His world and in His law. The two verses (Psalms 19:13–14) around which R. Dostai constructs his dialogue are David’s request that God cleanse and save him from sin. As such, they fit the general motif developed throughout this midrash, although in two places, R. Dostai changes the plain sense of the verses to support extended narrative expansions.
R. Dostai opens the dialogue by comparing David to a Cuthean merchant. Rashi explains that Cuthean merchants bring their merchandise out bit by bit so that the buyer will not think he is spending a lot of money. When we look at the dialogue, the analogy is transparent. David has committed a grave sin and he wishes to obtain God’s forgiveness. Instead of broaching the subject directly, David “bargains” his way up to the critical question, hoping to pass it off lightly.
David begins by asking that God pardon him for “errors” (line 73), “hidden sins” (line 75), and even “intentional sins” (line 77), and God answers each request with the words, “They are pardoned for you” (lines 74, 76, 78). In keeping with the order of the verses, David moves from the least problematic category of sin to the most and, not coincidentally, from the most charitable description of his transgression to the most severe.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Each of the terms is, in some measure, an accurate characterization of David’s actions because his sin is so complex and involves so many factors. His initial vulnerability to wrongdoing evolves from a misconceived request for a test (“error”), which leads him into an illicit sexual relationship (“hidden sins”) and finally, causes him deliberately to target Uriah in an attempt to cover up what has transpired (“intentional sins”).</i>
<b>“Let the Rabbis Not Talk About Me”</b>
Following the order of the verses, David’s next request is that God “…let them not rule over me <i>(al yimshelu bi),</i> and then I will be whole…” which R. Dostai explains as “let the Rabbis not talk about me” (lines 79–80). For the purposes of his portrayal, R. Dostai is less concerned with the plain sense of the verse in its original context than with the role it can play in his narrative expansion. This reading connects to the verse by substituting one meaning of the root <i>m-sh-l</i> for another.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on these words.</i> The root <i>m-sh-l</i> has two basic meanings: (1) ‘to rule over’ and (2) ‘to serve as a parable or example.’<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In a broader sense, we could say that <i>mashal</i> means any ‘non-literal use of language.’<br>The two root meanings of <i>m-sh-l</i> are semantically connected. The ‘ruling’ meaning is extended to the ‘non-literal use of language’ or ‘example’ meaning. To use something as an example, to make a parable of it, or to change its base meaning (i.e., to use language or imagery figuratively) implies that one has control over it.</i> In Psalms 19:14, the plain sense of the phrase <i>al yimshelu bi</i> can <i>only</i> be ‘let them not rule over me.’ Not only would context dictate this; the grammatical form of the word does not permit the ‘parable/example’ meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">For the “example/parable” meaning, the form of the word would have to be <i>yamshilu</i>. Even then, the usage of the word in that phrase for that meaning would be awkward at best.</i> R. Dostai, however, chooses the second meaning of the root, reading the phrase <i>al yimshelu bi</i> as though David were saying, “let them not make an example of me,” rephrased as “let the Rabbis not talk about me.” This request, like the ones that precede it in the dialogue, is met with the words, “They are pardoned for you” (line 81).
R. Dostai’s reworking of the verse is intriguing for two reasons. First, it recalls other parts of the midrash in which David’s concern for his public image surfaces (such as Rava’s third interpretation). There, however, David is portrayed as disturbed at the loss of his good name in his contemporary setting, while here, R. Dostai introduces the notion that David is concerned about his reputation for posterity. David does not want to be the exemplar of failure to whom the Rabbis will point for all time.
<b>Intentional Paradox</b>
More thought provoking, however, is that R. Dostai’s interpretation of the phrase <i>al yimshelu bi</i>, while plausible in terms of his portrayal of David, is actually self-contradictory. David’s request that the Rabbis not discuss him and God’s acquiescence to that request is recorded in the Talmud. Readers cannot help but reflect, however, that R. Dostai’s commentary is, in fact, part of an extensive rabbinic discussion of David’s sin. This is the very thing David has requested not happen. All R. Dostai would have to do to remove the paradoxical effect of his reading is omit God’s answer from the discussion. And yet, God’s acquiescence to David’s request is included in R. Dostai’s version of the dialogue between them. What, then, does R. Dostai mean to convey by recording David’s request that the Rabbis not discuss him and God’s apparent agreement with this request in a context that makes the exchange between David and God effectively meaningless?
One answer may be that R. Dostai wants to stress the distance between David’s perception of his sin, and that of the Rabbis. David’s fear of having his sin discussed assumes a condemnatory stance on the part of the Rabbis. Given his justified guilt feelings, this assumption is perfectly realistic; R. Dostai, though, knows that the rabbinic attitude is otherwise. Rabbinic discussion of the David/Batsheva story, while unsparing in its clinical dissection of David’s sin, is largely sympathetic to David as a person. In discussing David, the Rabbis do indeed mean to use him as an example, but their emphasis is on the power and sincerity of David’s repentance, rather than on the magnitude of his transgression. Assuming David’s real request is actually that the Rabbis not discuss him in negative terms – rather than that they not discuss him at all – the spirit, if not the letter of that request, is essentially fulfilled.
<b></b>
Rabbinic Freedom
The paradox posed by R. Dostai’s reading may be approached in another way, one that leads us into the next part of this narrative expansion. Perhaps R. Dostai wishes to imply that even God “cannot” restrain rabbinic discussion. The life of David, King of Israel and author of Psalms, must be studied, discussed, understood, and learned from, no matter what David, the private individual, might have felt. David’s story is part of Torah (in the broadest sense of the word) even if God Himself would be willing to spare David this exposure of his failings.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Although this idea may seem radical, there are echoes of it in a surprisingly large number of contexts elsewhere in <i>Hazal</i>. The most relevant example is probably the story of <i>tanuro shel akhnai</i> in <i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b. See, also, <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 15:2, 20, 24, and 30. See also <i>Taanit</i> 23a (the story of <i>Honi Hame’agel</i>, in particular the words: <i>ata gazarta mi-lemata</i>…). Even these few examples indicate <i>Hazal’</i>s assumption that God’s relationship with the Jewish people is benevolent and not competitive. In <i>Hazal’</i>s view, God wishes us to master the Torah He has given us, and He takes pride in our accomplishment of that task.</i>
<br>Other teachings of <i>Hazal</i> indicate that we must accept certain intellectual limitations, and that we must know when and where it is inappropriate to question. Fear of God is a value of paramount importance for <i>Hazal</i>. See, for example, the midrash of the <i>rav</i> and <i>talmid</i> in Chapter 6.
<br>What is significant for our purposes, especially regarding R. Dostai’s narrative expansion, is the existence of both opinions side-by-side in the thought of <i>Hazal</i>. R. Dostai’s statement, then, is by no means as radical as it seems. The presence of the David/ Batsheva story within the canon both of the written and oral tradition means that R. Dostai can come down on the side of rabbinic freedom to discuss the life of David. By having David make his request – and having God agree to it – in the middle of a long midrashic analysis of the David/Batsheva story, R. Dostai is effectively able to demonstrate that this story is part of our Oral Torah and, as such, belongs to the Rabbis. Within that realm, the Rabbis have freedom to explore the implications of the story as they see fit, no matter what David, the individual, might have wished, and even in “violation” of God’s willingness to go along with David’s request.
<b>Recording the Sin</b>
R. Dostai repeats this idea in a slightly different form with the continuation of his narrative expansion (lines 82–94). Proceeding with the interpretation of Psalms 19:14, he reads the next phrase as follows: “[David said to Him,] ‘and I will be cleansed of a great transgression…’ that is, ‘let my stench [sin] not be written’” (lines 81–83). Although it would be difficult to identify with any certainty the linguistic hook on which R. Dostai hangs his interpretation, one possibility is that he is contrasting the word <i>niketi</i> (“I will be cleansed”) with the idea of sin as a ‘stench’ (<i>sirhoni</i>), i.e., something that needs to be removed through cleansing. In any event, the meaning of David’s request is clear. Echoing his plea that the Rabbis not discuss him, David asks that the account of his sin be left out of the <i>Tanakh</i>. Significantly, R. Dostai couches the terms of David’s two requests in language that reflects the difference between them. The Rabbis transmit Oral Torah and thus David requests that they not <i>discuss</i> him. The <i>Tanakh</i> is the Written Torah, thus he asks that his sin not be <i>written</i>. Here, however, for the first time in the dialogue, God does not acquiesce. His justification: “That is impossible. If even the <i>yud</i> that I took from Sarai stood and wailed for years until Yehoshua came and I added it to him, as it says,‘And Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun, “Yeshoshua”…,’ how much more so, this whole story” (lines 84–87).
The explanation God offers David for His refusal makes reference to two stories of name changes in the Torah. The first, the re-naming of Sarai as Sara, takes place after Avraham’s <i>brit milah</i>; Sarai’s name change coincides with God’s informing Avraham that he will have a child with her (Genesis 17:15). The second story is the re-naming of Hoshea bin Nun as Yehoshua: Moshe changes Hoshea’s name before sending him to the Land of Israel with the spies (Numbers 13:16). In the first case, the letter <i>yud</i> is removed from a name, and in the second, a <i>yud</i> is added to a name. R. Dostai’s narrative expansions connects the two stories with the image of the letter <i>yud</i>, having been removed from the Torah, crying out to be restored to its rightful place, and comforted only when it is added to Yehoshua’s name.
Generally, when inanimate objects appearing in a midrash are given a voice, that voice is often the expression of a rabbinic viewpoint or a way of presenting a question. We are not meant to take the image literally. In such a case, we need to ask why the story is constructed as it is, and what message the details convey.
<b>The Integrity of the Text</b>
<i>Yud</i> is the smallest of the Hebrew letters in size, and one might suppose that its absence from the text of the Torah would be a relatively insignificant matter. Yet R. Dostai tells us, the letter “cries out” to be restored to the text, and God heeds the “cry.” This suggests that the fundamental integrity of the Torah text is dependent upon the completeness of the written record, and this, essentially, is what God tells David. If the absence of even a letter from the Torah must be compensated for, how much more so the omission from the <i>Tanakh</i> of the entire David/Batsheva story, given all its moral weight, and its centrality to the life of David, servant of God. From the moment it happens, the story is an integral part of the <i>Tanakh</i>, and its omission is “impossible,” a violation of the integrity of the text.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This idea appears elsewhere in midrashic literature. Several versions of this midrash do not mention the David/Batsheva story at all; instead, in a variety of ways, they repeat the link between the Sarai and Hoshea stories, and the <i>yud</i> that needs to be restored to the text. Another set of powerful midrashim with a similar theme has the letter <i>yud</i> crying out against King Shlomo for attempting to abolish it from the Torah with his violation of the commandments a king must obey. God assures the letter <i>yud</i> that “Shlomo, and a thousand like him, will pass away before you are erased from the Torah.” See <i>Exodus Rabba</i> 6:1 for a version that alludes to both the Sarai/Hoshea story, and the Shlomo/<i>yud</i> story.</i> Even for David’s sake, God cannot do violence to the wholeness of the <i>Tanakh</i>.
<b>“Forgive Me for the Whole Sin”</b>
R. Dostai portrays David as apparently accepting the impossibility of having his request granted, and has him ask instead, “Master of the universe, forgive me for the whole sin” (line 89). The phrase within which R. Dostai anchors David’s words is the same phrase used immediately above: “…and I will be cleansed of a great transgression…” (line 88). In this part of the dialogue, however, the phrase can be understood in keeping with its plain sense, in contrast to its use above; David has, indeed, transgressed greatly, and he is in sore need of cleansing.
Nonetheless, the way R. Dostai puts together the dialogue, makes evident that David is not simply asking for forgiveness here. After all, if that were the case, his earlier pleas that God pardon his “errors,” “his hidden sins,” and “his intentional sins” – and God’s favorable responses to these pleas – would have obtained his desired end. Besides, if what David wants is God’s forgiveness, God’s answer to David’s plea is something of a non sequitur. To discover what David is really asking for, we need to examine God’s reply, and David’s reaction to it.
Responsing to David’s plea, God answers, “In the future, your son Shlomo will say in his wisdom, ‘Can a man carry fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned? Can a man walk on coals and his feet not be scorched? Thus is one who takes the wife of his friend; all who touch her will not be cleansed’” (lines 90–91). The verses from Proverbs quoted here use a vivid, concrete metaphor – burning and scorching – to describe the consequences of adultery. Like a person who has carried fire in his bosom, or walked on coals, the adulterer suffers the after-effects of his actions, even if God has forgiven him for his sin. While forgiveness truly can heal the relationship between God and the sinner, it cannot remove the memory of the sin from the adulterer’s mind, and it cannot undo the sequence of events set in motion by the choices he has made.
From the nature of God’s answer to David, it appears that David’s real desire is for God to undo the effects of his tragic errors and put everything back to where it was at the beginning. Only then, David believes, can he be truly “<i>cleansed</i> of a great transgression.” God’s use of the quotation from Proverbs, though, makes it clear that if David’s definition of cleansing is the erasing of memory and consequences, “<i>all who touch her will not be cleansed.</i>” Changing these things is as much an impossibility as omitting the truth from the <i>Tanakh</i>. This is not because God could not do so if He so wished, but because David’s very question betrays the problem with doing so, as we will see.
Interestingly, in God’s answer to David, R. Dostai has Him reiterate the point made above, i.e., that the integrity of the <i>Tanakh</i> is unassailable and eternal. Here, the point is made with particular force by the words that introduce the quote from Proverbs, “<i>In the future,</i> your son Shlomo, <i>will say in his wisdom</i>....” The anachronism is deliberate, a mechanism for conveying the idea that even what is not yet written in the <i>Tanakh</i> is already part of it. God can prove to David the fallacy of his thinking using the as yet unwritten words of his unborn son because they are part of the <i>Tanakh</i> and their wisdom is timeless, unbounded by the date of their physical transcription.
<b>Accepting Suffering</b>
David’s reaction to God’s refusal of his request is heartbreakingly poignant: “So much will this man be troubled?” (line 92). David has accepted his culpability for a sin that will have devastating consequences for him, as he knows. He has also begged for forgiveness, grieved, and fasted. He has even come to terms with facing public censure, and accepted the knowledge that his sin will be recorded in the <i>Tanakh</i>. And yet, David still feels a sense of failure, an awareness that he has not yet been cleansed of his sin, and that his relationship with God is not truly what it should be. He is painfully troubled.
God’s response to David’s sorrowful words immediately goes to the heart of the matter. If you truly want to be cleansed of a great transgression, God tells David, “Accept suffering upon yourself” (line 93).
At first, it is not apparent how these words solve David’s problem. For one thing, David <i>has</i> been suffering greatly since committing his transgression. For another, it is hard to see what God means by telling David to “accept suffering.” After all, in most lives, suffering just happens. We are inclined to think that acceptance is not a determining factor when it comes to suffering – to suffer is simply an unavoidable component of human existence.
It seems, though, that God’s brief instruction to David holds the key to the resolution of his sin. Furthermore, David appears to understand God’s message clearly, as can be seen from his response: “He accepted [suffering] upon himself” (line 94). This comprehension stands in stark contrast to David’s earlier failure to heed the warnings implicit in the first conversation described by R. Yehuda. When God describes the Patriarchs as worthy of having their names united to His in prayer because they had undergone tests, and when He tells David the nature of his test, His words are not perceived correctly because David is still unready to see his own failings. It is only in the period of painful self-examination that follows his sin that David is able to grasp the meaning of God’s words because his awareness that he has sinned makes him willing to change.
<b>Connecting the Pieces</b>
To comprehend the significance of God’s words for David, we need to look at the midrash as a whole, with an eye to seeing how R. Dostai’s story resolves issues raised earlier.
As we saw in R. Yehuda’s analysis of the process by which David comes to sin (lines 1–29), David’s first mistake is born of his unease with himself. David’s conduct in staying home from war was not in keeping with the standards of kingly behavior set by himself in the past. Perhaps for other reasons as well, David is not satisfied with the state of his relationship with God, as we have noted. However, instead of examining his dissatisfactions, and coming to terms with them, David seeks to eliminate his discomfort by trying to become someone else, i.e., by asking that he be like the Patriarchs. He wishes, in short, to bypass the source of his unease, rather than confront it squarely. As part of this ill-conceived strategy, he places himself in a situation of being tested. However, because he fears both passing and failing the test, David once again attempts to circumvent a difficulty. This attempt backfires, and he sins.
David has maneuvered himself into this painful position precisely because he has tried to avoid pain rather than face it. Ironically, his fruitless efforts to evade suffering have given rise to even greater pain than he would have encountered had he confronted himself and his dilemmas squarely.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Carl Jung, in a discussion of the difference between suppression and repression, points out that “neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.” This would suggest that the attempt to avoid suffering creates more problems than it solves. (<i>Psychology and Religion: West and East</i>, The Collected Works of C.G. Jung, vol. 11, translated by R.F.C. Hull, Bollingen Series XX, Pantheon Books, N.Y., 1958, page 75.)<br>To reduce the spiritual greatness of David and his magnificence as king to a term like ‘neurosis’ (which has become a facile staple of pop psychology) is both simplistic and anachronistic. Jung’s definition of the term is useful, however, as an analogy. To paraphrase Jung’s concept in religious terms we might say that “The attempt to avoid suffering may cause someone to sin.”</i> David himself is able to see this in retrospect, and says as much when he recognizes himself as “the one who hates me” and states that he could have suppressed his sinful inclination had he wanted to.
When God tells David to “accept suffering upon himself,” He is telling David that the root cause of his sin is the wish to circumvent suffering. If David truly wishes to “be cleansed of a great transgression,” he must address this underlying moral failing. It is not enough to atone for the sinful act of having taken Batsheva. A complete repentance involves changing himself fundamentally. By facing his sufferings squarely, David will be exercising the courage he failed to demonstrate earlier and can thereby make amends for his shortcomings.
<b>The courage to Face Suffering</b>
David’s response to God’s answer is remarkable. Apparently without questioning, complaining, or hesitating, “he accepted [suffering] upon himself” (line 94). The midrash sums up David’s decision in typically succinct style,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Only two words in the original: <i>Kibel alav.</i></i> but the implications of these brief words are huge. II Samuel 12 has already shown us David’s acceptance of full responsibility for the terrible crime of which Natan accuses him. David makes no attempt to explain or excuse himself. Instead, he faces the evil within himself with unsparing honesty. Here, too, as R. Dostai portrays him, David accepts the full weight of experiencing suffering without evasion. He will not try to outrun the punishment that awaits him, and he will not attempt to numb himself to the sufferings he faces. David will accept what awaits him with the awareness that in doing so he is correcting a deep flaw within himself.
David has undergone an impressive change of heart. The man who originally tried to hedge his bets by changing his sexual conduct so that he would not fail God’s test has become king over himself, and thereby even more completely a servant of God. It is significant that David does not ask God to tell him what his sufferings will be. He has grown beyond the need for guarantees. His decision to “accept suffering” is a profound turning point in his life. By <i>accepting</i> suffering, rather than merely undergoing it, David is truly able to redeem himself from his sin.
<b>The Sufferings of David</b>
Most of the rest of the book of Samuel is a catalogue of the troubles David experiences after his transgression. These include the death of Batsheva’s first child, the rape of Tamar, the death of Amnon at the hands of his brother Avshalom, and Avshalom’s rebellion against David, which culminates in Avshalom’s death. The first chapter of Kings continues this litany of woes with a description of David’s frailty in old age, and Adoniyahu’s attempt to seize the throne before David’s death. This list of tragedies tallies well with any definition of suffering one might expect David to have to undergo. Nonetheless, R. Yehuda goes on to expand the narrative with another list of sufferings experienced by David (lines 95–107). He tells us that “for six months, David was a leper, and the Divine Presence left him, and the Sanhedrin separated from him” (lines 95–96).
All of the prooftexts R. Yehuda employs to substantiate his statement mesh well with their new context in his restructuring of the story. Although the plain sense of these verses in their original context differs from their use in R. Yehuda’s story, the verses are not wrenched out of shape to create this effect.
Two of the four prooftexts are particularly apt since they are taken from Psalms 51, which describes David’s emotions upon being confronted by Natan after having sinned with Batsheva. Psalms 51:9, the prooftext for David’s affliction with leprosy, is a plea that God, “cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be purified; wash me and I will be whiter than snow” (lines 97–98). As Rashi points out, the fact that David requires cleansing with hyssop implies that he had become a leper.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Hyssop is one of the ingredients used in the purification ritual for a leper.</i> The second prooftext, in which David requests that God, “Return to me the joy of Your salvation, and your generous spirit will support me,” can be read as implying that the Divine Presence had left David, since he needs to ask that it be returned (lines 99–100).
The idea that the Sanhedrin separated themselves from David is supported by Psalms 119:79, in which David says that, “Those who fear You will return to me…” (lines 101–102). Once again, the implication is that if “those who fear You,” i.e., the Sanhedrin, need to return, they must have departed at some previous point.
R. Yehuda proves that the period of David’s sufferings must have been six months by referring to the discrepancy between the reckoning of David’s reign in II Samuel 5:5 and I Kings 2:11. Both accounts tell us that David reigned for forty years, and both accounts record the way in which the years of reign were divided – seven years in Hevron, and thirty-three in Jerusalem. The account in Samuel, however, says that David actually ruled in Hevron for seven-and-a-half years, while the verse in Kings rounds the figure down, and tells us that David reigned in Hevron for seven years.
The discrepancy between the two accounts is more apparent than real, as we know from the lack of precision with which the reigns of kings are generally calculated in the <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Probably the reason II Samuel 5 is so precise here is because it describes the transition from Hevron (and David’s reign over only the tribe of Yehuda) to Jerusalem (and his reign over all of Israel).</i> Furthermore, in the chronology of David’s life, the “missing” six months appear well before the story of his sin. The inescapable conclusion is that the discrepancy between the two accounts is being used as an <i>asmakhta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Asmakhta</i> is the quotation of a biblical text as a rhetorical or mnemonic device, rather than as an actual proof.</i> for R. Yehuda’s claim that David was a leper for six months. R. Yehuda’s use of this discrepancy succeeds in creating the impression that six months of David’s life have been effectively erased, as one would expect if he had become a leper, since “a leper is like a dead man.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Exodus Rabba</i> 1:34 <i>dibur hamat’hil: vayehi bayamim.</i> This phrase is also used in <i>Tanhuma</i> in connection with Miriam’s leprosy.</i> If David was indeed a leper for six months, he is, for all intents and purposes, akin to a dead man, and six months may be said to be missing from his life.
We must, however, ask ourselves why R. Yehuda expands the narrative as he does, given that the calamities of the latter half of II Samuel recount more than enough personal tragedy for one lifetime. One possibility is that R. Yehuda had a tradition that attributed these sufferings to David, in addition to the troubles which appear explicitly in II Samuel. Another possibility is that R. Yehuda wants us to see David’s sufferings as all-encompassing because the extent of David’s suffering magnifies the virtue of his willingness to accept the pain God sends him.
For six months, according to R. Yehuda, David has to survive the indignity of leprosy, the loneliness of isolation from the Divine Presence, and the shunning of the people he most respects. Thus, the sufferings David “accepts upon himself” without evasion, assault his physical well being, his spiritual sustenance, and his social self. It is hard to imagine anyone surviving such privations. For a man of great physical vigor with a strong need for connectedness to God and a vulnerable public position, these are virtually unbearable trials. Nonetheless, David accepts them.
<b>Resolution Deferred</b>
After David’s acceptance of suffering, he appeals to God once more: “Master of the Universe, forgive me for that sin” (line 108). The meaning of the request has changed since David last voiced it. He has come to terms with the fact that he cannot change the past and erase the effects of his sin. He has also grown to understand that his attempts to circumvent suffering were a serious spiritual failing. Now, David comes to God with a fitting request to be forgiven, and God acquiesces, telling David, “It is forgiven to you” (line 109).
There is, however, one final entreaty David voices to God: “Make for me a sign for the good, and my enemies will see, and be ashamed, for You, God, have helped me and comforted me” (Psalms 86:17) (line 110). Given the kind of connection David feels to God, his desire for vindication is certainly understandable. Furthermore, as we have noted, since David’s public and private selves are so thoroughly merged, public acknowledgment is of great importance to him. God’s response is therefore somewhat puzzling. Rather than fulfilling David’s request immediately, He says, “During your life I will not make it known, but I will make it known in the life of Shlomo, your son” (lines 111–112).
<b></b>
Opening the Gates
The last section of the midrash, a narrative expansion on the story of the inauguration of Shlomo’s Temple, tells us how David’s final wish is fulfilled (lines 113–123). The midrash recounts that when Shlomo “wanted to bring the Ark into the Holy of Holies” as part of the dedication ceremony after construction of the Temple was complete, “the gates stuck together” (lines 113–115). Shlomo, a great religious poet like his father, tries to compel them to open by singing twenty-four songs of praise, but he is not answered. Next, using the words of Psalms 24, he demands that the gates open for the sake of God’s honor. Even in the face of this, the gates remain closed. Finally, Shlomo invokes the name of his father, requesting that the gates open in remembrance of “the kindnesses of David, Your servant,” and he is “immediately answered. At that hour, the faces of David’s enemies turned [as black] as the edges of a pot, and all Israel knew that the Holy One blessed be He had forgiven him for that sin” (lines 121–123).
<b>Unanswered Questions</b>
As described here, David’s vindication is public, dramatic, and unmistakable. Furthermore, the graphic description at the end of the story makes it clear that the event has a powerful effect upon David’s enemies. Nonetheless, two issues remain unresolved. The first relates to a detail within the narrative expansion, namely, God’s deferral of David’s public vindication until after his death. While the midrashic story shows us how David’s desire for public absolution is gratified, it does not directly explain why his request cannot be granted in his lifetime.
The second issue arises when we compare the narrative expansion here with the account of the dedication ceremony that appears in II Chronicles 6 and 7. When we read the account, specifically II Chronicles 6:41–42, and 7:1–3, it is hard to understand why the midrash needs to change the biblical story as it does. Chronicles records Shlomo’s request that God “…remember the kindnesses of David, Your servant,” (II Chronicles 6:42) and follows it immediately with the miraculous descent of fire from Heaven and a description of God’s presence filling the Temple. The connection between Shlomo’s request and God’s willingness to inhabit his Temple is quite clear from the verses. The midrash might well have made its point by simply quoting these verses as they appear in Chronicles, perhaps with the addition of some commentary to underline the connection between Shlomo’s request and David’s vindication.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This is effectively what R. Yehuda does in his narrative expansion at the beginning of the midrash. He quotes extensively from the biblical account, weaving in extra elements where appropriate, but he does not rewrite the text where the verses are narratively straightforward.</i> What does the midrashic rewriting of the account in Chronicles adds to our understanding here?
<b>The Son of David and Batsheva</b>
In order to resolve these difficulties, we need to determine the significance of the gates’ “refusal” to open. As we pointed out above, midrashim anthropomorphize inanimate objects for the purpose of conveying different perspectives. Since gates cannot remain closed of their own volition, the “refusal” of the gates to open in the face of Shlomo’s exhortations must be emblematic of something else.
The gates in this midrash do not wish to admit the Ark, symbolic of God’s presence, into the Temple. The Ark’s entrance into the Holy of Holies would signify God’s approval of Shlomo’s construction of the Temple. As we have seen from God’s refusal to allow David to build the Temple, His willingness to have the Temple built is dependent in part on the identity of the builder. The refusal of the gates to open must, therefore, represent a perceived obstacle to the dedication of the Temple. In the minds of Shlomo’s contemporaries, and even perhaps in the minds of the readers of this midrash, there seems to be a problem with the idea of God’s presence in a Temple constructed by Shlomo. Although the midrash does not explicitly state what the obstacle is, we can argue plausibly that the closed gates are symbolic of the question that hangs over Shlomo’s legitimacy as king and his right to build a Temple for God, given that he is the son of Batsheva with whom David sinned. Neither Shlomo’s eloquence, nor even the presence of God waiting to enter the Temple can remove the obstacle symbolized by the closed gates. Only the remembrance of “the kindnesses of David,” God’s faithful servant, can open them. Shlomo’s lovingly constructed Temple is accepted by God for the sake of David, and at the dedication of the Temple this becomes evident to everyone.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">It is striking that throughout the dedication ceremony – both in the account in Kings and in Chronicles – Shlomo refers repeatedly to his father.</i>
In light of this, we can understand why David’s vindication must be deferred until Shlomo’s lifetime. Were God to show the world His forgiveness of David during David’s lifetime, we might erroneously conclude that the relationship between God and David had been repaired, but not the effects of his sin. While he lived, forgiveness for David would have been a personal matter with no implications for Shlomo as his successor. The truest, most complete vindication of David is God’s acquiescence to Shlomo’s reign, and God’s willing acceptance of the Temple – the fulfillment of David’s dearest wish – constructed by his and Batsheva’s son.
<b>David and the Ark</b>
Although the narrative expansion changes the details of the story,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Compare the midrash to I Kings 8 and II Chronicles 6–7.</i> it is faithful to the mood and the message of the account in Chronicles. In both accounts, David is indeed vindicated publicly at the dedication of the Temple, for God has clearly accepted Shlomo’s offering solely for his sake. Nonetheless, we are still left with the question raised earlier: Why change the account in Chronicles so that the sign of God’s forgiveness becomes the opening of the gates to admit the Ark, rather than the fire that descends from Heaven followed by God’s presence filling the Sanctuary?
One possibility is that the account in Chronicles makes the connection between “the kindnesses of David” and God’s acceptance of the Temple in too subtle a fashion. By streamlining the story, and focusing on a simpler image – gates refusing to open for the Ark – the midrash makes the same point as Chronicles, but more directly.
Perhaps, though, the midrash is picking up on an association between David and the Ark which relates to David’s wish to build the Temple. One of David’s first acts as king after the conquest of Jerusalem is to bring the Ark up to his capital city (II Samuel 6). Although his first attempt ends in disaster, David persists, an indication that the presence of the Ark in Jerusalem is of great importance to him. Furthermore, when David asks Natan for permission to build the Temple, the language in which he couches the request is significant: “See, please, that I dwell in a house of cedars, and the Ark of the Lord dwells among the curtains” (II Samuel 7:1). Clearly, the idea that the Ark is housed in a tent is disturbing to David; for him, the Ark is the heart of the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See the Radak on II Samuel 6:1–3.</i>
By reshaping the account in Chronicles so that the Ark is at the center of events, the midrash shows that David’s deepest yearnings have been fulfilled, albeit in his son’s lifetime. Through his son Shlomo, the child born of his relationship with Batsheva, David has been granted not only the public vindication he craved, but also the fulfillment of his most cherished dream – the Ark for which he wished to build a fitting setting has come to its resting place in the House built by his son.
<b>David and <i>Teshuva</i></b>
The spiritual magnificence of David, King of Israel emerges forcefully from this moving midrashic discussion. Paradoxically, the rabbinic analysis of David’s sin does not diminish him in our eyes. Instead, we find ourselves contemplating King David with awe as he emerges from his painful human struggle into true spiritual greatness.
Beyond the insights the Rabbis give us here into the character and struggles of David, we are also made to see that the process David undergoes has a larger application. The details of David’s story are particular to him because his temperament and his place in history are determining factors in the nature of his test and the ways in which he grapples with it. The essential message of <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) that emerges from this story, however, has universal significance. The Rabbis are keenly aware that the mechanisms of self-deception, struggle, and self-redemption operate in all of us. With forensic precision and great compassion, they dissect the process by which David sins and repents. Analyzing this particular case in depth, the Rabbis provide a framework for understanding how people sin, but also how they can come to terms with their failures, and return to God.
<b>A Collaborative Endeavor</b>
When we consider that this lengthy midrashic discussion is a compositional work,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For discussion of the compositional nature of <i>Hazal’</i>s work, see Chapter 8.</i> we can only marvel at its coherence and complexity. As we have seen, the midrash is made up of the teachings of different Rabbis which have been knit together over time within the framework of the oral tradition to form a consistent portrayal of David’s sin and repentance. Even if coherence were its only virtue, this midrash would be impressive, considering its length and the number of authors who produced it. However, as our reading of the text has shown, this midrash is profound as well as beautiful. To see so many minds working together harmoniously to produce such brilliance is awe-inspiring. It is even more remarkable to consider that this midrash is only one example of the compositional nature of <i>Hazal’</i>s vast body of teachings.

Chapter 16; Reading Between the Lines; Hazal "Rewrite" the Story of Hana

<b>Reading Between the Lines:<br><i>Hazal</i> “Rewrite” the Story of Hana</b>
<span class="poetry indentAll"><i>Rabbi Yitzhak said, “Why were our Patriarchs barren? Because the Holy One blessed be He desires the prayers of the righteous.”</i> (<i>Yevamot</i> 64a)</span>
<b>An Unfamiliar Perspective on a Familiar Story</b>
The story of Hana (I Samuel 1–2) is a striking example of a biblical text whose familiarity appears to be undermined by the midrashic commentary on it. Her story has a prominent place in the liturgy of Rosh Hashana, and is reminiscent of other narratives in <i>Tanakh</i> which describe important births, so we tend to feel that we know it well. When we encounter the midrashic commentaries on this text, though, we may find that our well-worn perceptions of the story are quite different from those of <i>Hazal</i>. The midrashim seem to radically rewrite the text.
In this chapter we will examine a range of midrashim on the story of Hana to see whether we can resolve the apparent contradiction between <i>Hazal’</i>s understanding and our own.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Please read I Samuel 1 in its entirety for a better grasp of the midrashic commentary.</i>
<b>An Overview</b>
To begin, we will explore a number of midrashim that appear together in <i>Berakhot</i> 31a–b. The midrashim collected below are presented in the order of their appearance in <i>Berakhot</i>, but without numbering, and with the intervening text removed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One midrash has been omitted from this list (<i>dibur hamat’hil: el hanaar hazeh hitpalalti)</i> because it deals with I Samuel 2, rather than with the chapter that is the focus of our study. Readers who check the original source will also note that I have not dealt with the intervening lines between midrashim because my goal is not to provide a reading of the whole talmudic discussion, but only the midrashim that relate directly to the Hana story.</i> I have organized the material this way in order to explore the cumulative effect reading these midrashim has on our understanding of the story of Shmuel’s birth. Even a cursory perusal of these sources shows us that they add up to an unexpected portrayal of Hana and her prayer. As we will see, this portrayal is not unique to the midrashim in <i>Berakhot</i>.
<b>(1) The Midrashic Reading of Verses 13–17</b>
R. Hamnuna said: How many important <i>halakhot</i> can one learn from this story of Hana! “And Hana, she was speaking on her heart…” (I Samuel 1:13). From here [we learn] that one who prays must direct his heart. “…only her lips were moving…” (ibid). From here [we learn] that one who prays must enunciate [the words] with his lips. “…and her voice was not heard…” (ibid). From here [we learn] that it is forbidden to raise one’s voice in one’s prayer. “…and Eli thought her to be drunk….” From here [we learn] that a drunkard is forbidden to pray. “And Eli said to her, ‘How long will you be drunk…’” (verse 14). R. Elazar said, From here [we learn] that one who sees something improper in his friend needs to rebuke him. “And Hana answered and she said, ‘No, my master…’” (verse 15). Ula said (and there are those who say that R. Yosi son of R. Hanina said this), she said to him, “You are not master in this matter, and the Divine spirit does not rest upon you, that you suspect me in this matter.” There are those who say that she said thus to him, “You are not a master; there is no <i>Shekhina</i> and no Divine spirit with you, for you judged me harshly and did not give me the benefit of the doubt. Don’t you know that ‘I am a woman of hard spirit and that wine and strong drink I have not drunk?’” R. Elazar said, From here [we learn] that someone who is suspected of something he hasn’t done, is obligated to make it known to [his accuser]. “Do not take your handmaiden to be a Godless woman (<i>bat belial</i>)…” (verse 16). R. Elazar said, From here [we learn] that a drunkard who prays is like someone who worships idols; it says here, “to be a Godless woman (<i>lifnei bat belial</i>),” and it says there, “…Godless men (<i>anashim b’nei belial</i>) went out…” (Deuteronomy 13:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here is to the description of <i>ir hanidahat</i> (a city that has gone over to idol worship). See Deuteronomy 13:13.</i> Just as there [the phrase refers to] idol worship, so too, here [the phrase] refers to idol worship. “And Eli answered and he said, ‘Go in peace…’” (verse 17). R. Elazar said, From here [we learn] that one who suspects his friend of something that is not in him, has to appease him. And not only that – he also has to bless him, as it says, “…and may the Lord of Israel give [you] your request…”
<b>(2) God of Hosts</b>
“And she vowed a vow and she said, ‘God of hosts….’” R. Elazar said, From the day that the Holy One blessed be He created His world, there was no one who called the Holy One blessed be He, HH ‘[God of] hosts’ until Hana came and called Him ‘[God of] hosts.’ Said Hana before the Holy One blessed be He, “Master of the universe, of all the hosts of hosts that You have created in Your world, is it so difficult in Your eyes to give me one son?” A parable: To what may this be compared? To a king of flesh and blood who made a feast for his servants. A poor man came and stood at the opening. He said to them, “Give me one piece of bread,” and they did not pay attention to him. He pushed and entered next to the king. He said to him, “My master the king, of all this great feast that you have made, is it so difficult in your eyes to give me one piece of bread?”
<b>(3) Drinking the Waters of the <i>Sota</i></b>
“If You will surely see…” (<i>im ra’oh</i> <i>tir’eh</i>) (verse 11). R. Elazar said, Hana said before the Holy One blessed be He, “If You will see (<i>im ra’oh</i>), it will be good, and if not, You will see (<i>tir’eh</i>)! I will go and I will conceal myself in the presence of Elkana, my husband, and once I have concealed myself, they will make me drink the waters of the <i>sota</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>sota</i> is a woman suspected of adultery. See Numbers 5:11–31.</i> and will You make your Torah a fraud?” As it says, ‘And if she is innocent, she will have seed…’ (Numbers 5:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The continuation of the discussion, which I have omitted, explains that this understanding of Hana’s words corresponds only with the opinion that a <i>sota</i> who has been proven innocent will become fertile. The text then cites other possible interpretations of the phrase “and if she is innocent, then she will have seed.”</i>
<b>(4) Three Repetitions of “Handmaiden”</b>
“…the suffering of Your handmaiden…do not forget Your handmaiden…and You will give Your handmaiden the seed of men…” (verse 11). R. Yosi the son of R. Hanina said, These three [repetitions of the word] ‘handmaiden,’ what do they mean? Hana said before the Holy One blessed be He, “Master of the universe, three proofs of death, You have created in a woman (and there are those who say: ‘three junctions of death’). They are: [the laws of] <i>nida</i>, [the mitzvah of taking] <i>halla</i>, and [the mitzvah of] lighting candles [for Shabbat]. Have I ever violated one of them?”
<b>(5) “…the Seed of Men…”</b>
“…and You will give to your handmaiden the seed of men… (<i>zera anashim</i>)” (verse 11). Rav said, [This means] ‘a man among men.’ And Shmuel said, [This means] ‘seed who will anoint two men,’ and who are they? Shaul and David. And R. Yohanan said, [This means] ‘seed that is equivalent to two men,’ and who are they? Moshe and Aharon, as it says, “Moshe and Aharon among their priests, and Shmuel among those who call His name…” (Psalms 99:6). And the Rabbis say, ‘the seed of men’ means ‘seed that is absorbed among men.’ When R. Dimi came, he said, ‘Neither too tall nor too short, too thin nor too heavy, too pale nor too ruddy, too wise nor too foolish.’
<b>(6) “…Speaking on her Heart…”</b>
“And Hana, she was speaking on her heart.” R. Elazar said in the name of R. Yosi ben Zimra: ‘On the concerns of her heart.’ She said before Him, “Master of the universe, of all You have created in a woman, You have created nothing in vain: eyes to see and ears to hear, nose to smell, mouth to speak, hands with which to do work, feet to walk with, breasts to nurse with. These breasts that You have placed on my heart, why should I not nurse with them? Give me a son, and I will nurse with them.”
<b>(7) Praying “on” God</b>
R. Elazar said: Hana hurled words toward Heaven, as it says, “…and Hana prayed to (<i>al</i> – literally ‘on’) God…” (verse 10).
<b>Supplication and Self-assertion: An Apparent Contradiction</b>
The majority of these midrashim from <i>Berakhot</i> are attributed to R. Elazar. He appears to view Hana as a forthright, even aggressive, personality and he supports his position through a variety of details in the story. For example, R. Elazar’s reading of Hana’s dialogue with Eli (1) shows us a woman who behaves without deference to the person who has misjudged her, although he is the <i>kohen gadol</i>. Similarly, his parable of the poor man at the king’s feast (2) portrays Hana as pushing her way into God’s presence. Even more disturbing is how R. Elazar reads the opening words of Hana’s prayer (3), which he presents as a threat to force God to give her a child by manipulating the ritual of the <i>sota</i> to her own ends. And while R. Elazar’s quotation of R. Yosi ben Zimra’s commentary (6) seems more like prayer of a conventional sort, his explicit statement that “Hana hurled words toward Heaven” (7) ensures that we understand the thrust of R. Elazar’s interpretation of the Hana story.
R. Elazar’s reading of Hana’s prayer is reinforced in somewhat milder terms by the other opinions cited. In the repetition of the word “handmaiden” (which appears three times in Hana’s brief prayer), R. Yosi the son of R. Hanina sees Hana rebuking God with the absolute justice of her request for a child (4). And in the Rabbinic discussion of the kind of child Hana requests (5), several of the opinions maintain that she feels herself entitled to an exceptional child, and not simply an ordinary, healthy baby, as might be expected.
Remarkably, while these midrashim depict Hana’s prayer as unconventional, to say the least, neither the opinions cited nor the surrounding talmudic text cast Hana in a negative light. Clearly, <i>Hazal</i> view Hana with approval. Even R. Elazar’s explicit statement that Hana threw her words at God is immediately followed by the statements that Eliyahu and Moshe did likewise.
<b>Interpretation or Homily?</b>
These midrashic readings would be easier to handle if we could place them in the category of homiletics and decide that they are not really intended as a commentary on the Hana story. On this assumption, the midrashim could be treated as an appropriation of the Hana story for the purpose of discussing something other than the story itself. Such an approach might work if there were fewer of these midrashim, or if they appeared in isolation in different contexts. But when seven midrashim dealing with the same biblical text in roughly the same terms are found in the space of one talmudic page, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the redactors of the Talmud wish to shape our understanding of the Hana story in a particular way. We are apparently meant to view Hana’s prayer as strongly assertive and to see this assertiveness in a positive light as <i>Hazal</i> appear to.
This trend in the midrashim raises questions about the source of <i>Hazal’</i>s reading of the Hana story. Is this reading an example of a <i>mesora</i> (oral tradition) associated with the text, or does the biblical story itself give rise to the midrashic material? In either case, why do <i>Hazal</i> appear to prefer such a disquieting interpretation of the Hana story, instead of encouraging a more conventional picture of piety? To answer these questions, we need to examine each of the midrashim individually.

<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
The structure of this midrash is determined by R. Hamnuna’s introductory statement: “How many important <i>halakhot</i> can one learn from this story of Hana!” (line 2). What follows is a phrase-by-phrase close reading of I Samuel 1:13–17. After the first verse, the identity of the speaker changes, and R. Hamnuna gives way to R. Elazar and Ula. The structure of the midrash is easily represented as follows:
(1) R. Hamnuna’s introductory statement (lines 1–2)
(2) R. Hamnuna’s reading of verse 13 (lines 3–10)
(3) R. Elazar’s and Ula’s readings of verses 14–17 (lines 11–28)
<b>R. Hamnuna’s Introductory Statement</b>
As we have noted, R. Hamnuna’s introductory statement gives this midrash its basic shape. While the statement is informative on one level, it might be somewhat misleading for a reader unfamiliar with the workings of <i>halakha</i>. This is because it is axiomatic in Jewish tradition that <i>halakha</i> can only be derived from the text of the written Torah, or from the Oral Torah, and not from other books of the <i>Tanakh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbinic legislation originates in a different way altogether.</i> Thus, when R. Hamnuna says that one can learn important <i>halakhot</i> from the story of Hana, he cannot mean that the laws of prayer (or any other laws) are actually <i>derived</i> from this story.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For example, the commandment to rebuke one’s fellow Jew for misdeeds is found in Leviticus 19:17 (<i>hokheah tokhiah</i> <i>et amitekha</i>). Eli’s actions do not give rise to the commandment; they exemplify it.</i> Rather, what R. Hamnuna means is that in the story of Hana one can see these <i>halakhot</i> played out in a real-life setting.
Significantly, R. Hamnuna is saying that the conduct of Hana in this situation is a demonstration of proper behavior that we can profitably study. Both his reading of verse 13 and the readings of R. Elazar and Ula demonstrate that Hana is viewed with approval here as a religious role model (as is Eli in his rebuking of Hana and his subsequent appeasement of her when he realizes that he has misjudged her).
<b>A Close Reading of the Verses</b>
In this midrash, R. Hamnuna, R. Elazar, and Ula interpret the behaviors that accompany Hana’s prayer, and Eli’s reaction to it. From verse 13, R. Hamnuna derives a number of requirements: praying with <i>kavana</i> (line 4), forming the words with one’s lips even when praying silently (line 6), the obligation to pray certain parts of the liturgy silently (line 8), and the prohibition against praying while intoxicated (line 10). Both the biblical text, and R. Elazar’s and Ula’s readings of the verses that follow indicate plainly that Eli is unaware of the obligation to pray silently, which is why he misinterprets Hana’s actions as drunkeness. As Rashi puts it in his commentary on I Samuel 1:13: “<i>And Eli thought her to be drunk,</i> for they were not accustomed to praying in a whisper.”
This is the first surprise in <i>Hazal’</i>s reading of the Hana story. How can it be that the righteous Eli, <i>kohen gadol</i> and foremost religious authority of his generation, does not know this fundamental law about prayer, while Hana does? And why does Eli seem to accept Hana’s unconventional mode of prayer without objection once he realizes that she has not been drinking?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since there is nothing in the verses or in the midrashic commentary here that appears to answer these questions, we need to look for answers elsewhere. I would like to suggest that the closest analogy to this particular aspect of the Hana story is the episode of Tzelafhad’s daughters. While these narratives differ in many respects, they share a core situation. In both stories, the central feminine figures have a grievance. Also, in each case, the central feminine figures seem to know intuitively what <i>halakha</i> requires, while this critical knowledge is hidden from the greatest religious authorities of the age. Finally, both narratives conclude with the acknowledgement by the authority figure that the female characters have intuited the <i>halakha</i> correctly.<br>In the case of Tzelafhad’s daughters, their particular situation has ramifications for society as a whole. Naturally, this necessitates a public discussion and adjustment of the <i>halakha</i>. By discussing and adjusting the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with their situation, Moshe is addressing the grievance of Tzelafhad’s daughters. In Hana’s case, however, the grievance is private, with implications only for herself. Her innovation in prayer is correct from the halakhic perspective and will come to be implemented, but it does not require an explicit verbal expression of approval on the part of Eli at that point. It is sufficient that he not rebuke her for it, which is a tacit acknowledgment of its correctness. However, in keeping with the requirement that he apologize for having wronged her, Eli also addresses Hana’s personal grievance by blessing her with the fulfillment of her wish.</i>
The second surprise in this close reading of the verses is how R. Elazar and Ula construe the dialogue between Eli and Hana. Eli has acted properly, as R. Elazar is at pains to point out. His question to Hana in verse 14 (‘How long will you be drunk…’) teaches “us that one who sees something improper in his friend needs to rebuke him” (lines 11–12). One might expect that Hana’s response to this appropriate question would be a courteous and deferential explanation of her behavior. And, as recorded in verse 15 of the biblical account, that is what her response appears to be: “No, my master; I am a woman of hard spirit; and wine and strong drink I have not drunk; and I am pouring out my soul before God.”
It is therefore rather disconcerting to read Ula’s revised version of her words: “She said to him, ‘You are not master in this matter, and the Divine spirit does not rest upon you, that you suspect me in this matter’” (line 15). An even more strident version of Hana’s words follows: “There are those who say that she said thus to him, ‘You are not a master; there is no <i>Shekhina</i> and no Divine spirit with you, for you judged me harshly and did not give me the benefit of the doubt. Don’t you know that I am a woman of hard spirit and that wine and strong drink I have not drunk?’” (lines 16–19).
Unexpectedly, R. Elazar does not see Hana’s words in a negative light at all. Instead, he cites them approvingly as evidence for the teaching “that someone who is suspected of something he hasn’t done, is obligated to make it known to [his accuser]” (line 20). R. Elazar goes on to justify Hana further by pointing out that Eli acts correctly in appeasing and blessing her because he must compensate her for having suspected her unfairly (lines 26–28).
<b>Clues in the Text: <i>Shifha</i> and <i>Ama</i></b>
What permits R. Elazar and Ula ostensibly to rewrite the story in this way? Presupposing that R. Elazar and Ula are engaged in interpreting the text, rather than in homiletics, we need to consider two possibilities. One is that they have a tradition guiding them in their reading of Hana’s words (although even then, we would expect the tradition not to pose such an apparently blatant contradiction to the text). The other possibility is that certain clues in the story compel them to read the dialogue between Eli and Hana against our expectations.
Although we cannot completely answer this question until we look at the rest of the midrashim, there is one small clue in the text which may shed light on Ula’s harsh reading of Hana’s words to Eli. Throughout the chapter, both in her prayer to God and in her dialogue with Eli, Hana uses the word <i>ama</i> (handmaiden) to refer to herself. Only after Eli has blessed her, does she refer to herself as <i>shifha</i> (maidservant). The two words are not interchangeable – they differ significantly in meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In his book, <i>Ima shel malkhut</i> (World Zionist Organization, 1974), Rabbi Yehoshua Bachrach uses the distinction between these two terms to explain the meaning of Ruth’s dialogue with Boaz at the threshing floor. I have extended his insight to the narrative here.</i> <i>Shifha</i>, which is always used to refer to a <i>shifha kenaanit</i> (non-Jewish maidservant) denotes a female slave. Although her master must treat her humanely and not abuse her, the weight of obligation in their relationship rests primarily upon her.
In contrast, an <i>ama</i> is a Hebrew handmaiden, a Jewish girl from an impoverished family taken into the master’s home as a child. When she reaches puberty, her master must either marry her, arrange a marriage for her with his son, or set her free with a dowry, presumably so that she can marry someone else. In this relationship, the weight of obligation rests more heavily upon the master than upon the handmaiden.
Given the difference in meaning between the two terms, we might have expected Hana to refer to herself throughout the narrative as <i>shifha</i>, because this term conveys a sense of humility and obligation to the person being addressed. Since Hana uses both terms to refer to herself, it seems fair to conclude that she is using each term intentionally. Therefore, when Eli mistakenly reproaches Hana for her supposed drunkenness, we can assume that she is defending herself quite firmly, designating herself by the term <i>ama</i>, which may be a delicate way of reminding him that he owes her an apology. Only when Eli has withdrawn his accusation and blessed her does she graciously ask to find favor in his eyes, using the more submissive term <i>shifha</i> to refer to herself.
Perhaps this subtle distinction in Hana’s language cues Ula’s reading of her words. And while we need not say that Hana actually verbalized the harsh sentiments he attributes to her, it makes sense to conclude that she thought them – and found a subtle way to convey her thoughts in the choice of her words and her tone of voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It is also worth noting here that Ula’s reading of Hana’s words does not involve violating the grammar of the sentence. If we punctuate Hana’s words <i>lo, adoni</i> (no, my master) as <i>lo adoni</i> (you are not my master), we in fact arrive at Ula’s reading.</i> By superimposing Ula’s version of Hana’s words on these words as they appear in the text, we get the sense of a highly fraught situation, in which the powerful emotions that Hana brings to her prayer spill over into her interaction with Eli.
<b>Inventing a Name for God</b>
Taken in isolation, the midrash we have just explored would have told us only that Hana is a strong woman whose halakhic sensitivities are so highly developed that she can intuitively divine how she should pray. Taken in conjunction with what follows, however, the midrashic reading of Hana’s character grows more complex.
The midrash that follows discusses the significance of Hana’s invention of a name for God:
(1) And she vowed a vow and she said, ‘God of hosts…” (<i>Hashem Tzevaot</i>) (verse 11).
(2) R. Elazar said, From the day that the Holy One blessed be He created his world, there was no one who called the Holy One blessed be He,HH ‘[God of] hosts’
(3) until Hana came and called Him ‘[God of] hosts.’
(4) Said Hana before the Holy One blessed be He,
(5) “Master of the universe, of all the hosts of hosts that You have created in Your world,
(6) is it so difficult in Your eyes to give me one son?”
(7) A parable: To what may this be compared?
(8) To a king of flesh and blood who made a feast for his servants.
(9) A poor man came and stood at the opening.
(10) He said to them, “Give me one piece of bread,”
(11) and they did not pay attention to him.
(12) He pushed and entered next to the king.
(13) He said to him, “My master the king,
(14) of all this great feast that you have made,
(15) is it so difficult in your eyes to give me one piece of bread?”
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
Like many of the <i>meshalim</i> we have seen, this midrash is simple in structure. It opens with a <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> from the chapter (line 1), which is followed by an introductory statement about the term <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i> (lines 2–3). The next part fills in the meaning of these words with a brief narrative expansion (lines 4–6). As we will see, this narrative expansion is also the <i>nimshal</i>. This is followed by a <i>mashal</i> (lines 7–15).
The structure may be mapped as follows:
(1) <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> (line 1)
(2) R. Elazar’s introductory statement (lines 2–3)
(3) narrative expansion (<i>nimshal</i>) (lines 4–6)
(4) the <i>mashal</i> (lines 7–15)
<b>Hana’s Innovation</b>
R. Elazar’s introductory statement tells us that Hana was the first person to use the name <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i> as a term for God.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The first time this name of God appear in the <i>Tanakh</i> is, indeed, in I Samuel 1:3. R. Elazar is saying that the first person in history to actually use this name of God (i.e., the person who coined the phrase <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i>) is Hana.</i> The narrative expansion that follows gives us some sense of the meaning of this name for Hana. To call God by this name is to recognize His role as Creator and Master of all the myriad beings He has created in His world. Out of the vastness and richness that God has engendered, Hana asks that He give her one son (lines 4–6).
Both R. Elazar’s introductory statement and his narrative expansion are so straightforward that we may well ask why we need the <i>mashal</i>. After all, this part of the midrash fits our original image of a supplicant humbly begging God for a child, at least at first glance.
<b>The <i>Mashal</i> as Story</b>
Closer examination of the <i>mashal</i>, however, alters this picture somewhat. Despite its narrative simplicity, the <i>mashal</i> is actually very problematic. In the <i>mashal</i> story, a king makes a feast for his servants. A poor man shows up and asks the servants for a piece of bread. They ignore him. He then pushes his way into the king’s chamber and demands that the king give him a piece of bread.
When we consider what the pauper has done, we immediately see that his behavior toward the king is brazen in the extreme. The king has made a feast for his servants, to which the poor man has not been invited. His first act of arrogance is to show up at a royal feast uninvited. Not surprisingly, when he begs the servants for bread they ignore him since the food at the feast is not theirs to give. That he then pushes his way in to the king and demands a piece of bread is completely shocking. A real-life enactment of this story might well have ended in the pauper’s death.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">One of our handicaps as readers of <i>meshalim</i> which use the image of God as king is that there is no modern counterpart to the king in contemporary society. To get the full thrust of a <i>mashal</i> in which God is represented as a king of flesh and blood, we need to remember that kings had virtually absolute life-and-death power over their subjects. The etiquette dictating proper behavior in a king’s presence was far more rigid than anything we might imagine.</i>
<b>Isolating the Elements of the <i>Mashal</i></b>
Following the methodology we have outlined earlier for the <i>mashal</i> genre, our next step is to isolate the elements of the <i>mashal</i> as follows:
a king
the feast
his servants
the poor person
(standing at the opening)
his request to the servants
a piece of bread
the servants’ ignoring of the poor person
pushing and entering next to the king
the poor person’s request/demand for a piece of bread
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
Next, we need to match the elements of the <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i> as far as we can. A good first approximation might be:
a king / The Holy One blessed be He
the feast / -----
his servants / -----
the poor person / Hana
(standing at the opening) / -----
his request to the servants / -----
a piece of bread / a child
the servants’ ignoring of the poor person / -----
pushing and entering next to the king / calling God by the name <i>Tzevaot</i>
the poor person’s request/
demand for a piece of bread / Hana’s prayer for a child
<b>Filling in the Gaps</b>
As we can see from this charting of the <i>mashal</i>, there are quite a few gaps in the correspondences between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>. The first unmatched element, “the feast,” is perhaps the easiest to fill in via analogy. If the “piece of bread” in the <i>mashal</i> is a child, “the feast” must be “all the hosts of hosts that You have created in Your world,” i.e., the world, with its vast collections of creatures which inhabit it.
The next gap in the <i>nimshal</i> can likewise be filled using analogy. If the “poor man” is Hana, who is childless, it seems reasonable to suggest that the “king’s servants” – the beneficiaries of the king’s feast – must be people who <i>do</i> have children. In the biblical narrative, the characters with whom Hana interacts directly are Penina, Elkana, and Eli, all of whom have children. We should note, however, that Hana’s dialogue with Eli takes place only after she has prayed, i.e., after the “poor man” has pushed his way into the king. The king’s “servants,” therefore, must be Penina and Elkana.
At this point, filling in the gaps becomes more complicated. We need to find correspondences for the poor man’s “standing in the opening,” and his “request to the servants.” Also, we need to understand what the <i>mashal</i> means to say in telling us that the servants “ignore the poor person.”
<b>Making an Interpretive Leap</b>
R. Elazar could have constructed the <i>mashal</i> story so that the servants would not have had any role, leaving the focus of the story on the pauper’s act of pushing his way in to see the king. The <i>mashal</i> might then have read something like: This may be compared to a king of flesh and blood who made a feast. A poor man came and stood at the opening. He asked for a piece of bread, but they would not let him in. He pushed and entered next to the king. He said to him, “My master the king, of all this great feast that you have made, is it so difficult in your eyes to give me one piece of bread?” Such a formulation would have been simpler, and would have made the essential point about Hana’s use of the term <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i> while avoiding speculations about the role of servants in the story.
Assuming that we are correct in including the “king’s servants” as necessary elements in the <i>mashal</i>, and that we have correctly identified the servants with Elkana and Penina, we need to fill the gaps in the <i>nimshal</i>.
<b>Drawing Conclusions</b>
I would like to suggest that our problem can be solved by viewing R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i> as a commentary on the whole of I Samuel 1, and not only on verse 11. The opening of the chapter (verses 1–7) describes a recurring event: year after year, Elkana brings his family to Shilo on the pilgrimage holidays, and year after year, Penina taunts Hana about her childlessness.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bava Batra</i> 16a which attributes to Penina a complexity of motives not immediately apparent from the text. (<i>Amar Rabi Levi: Satan uPenina l’shem Shamayim hitkavnu.</i>) Rashi’s comment on this passage indicates that Penina’s intention in tormenting Hana was to goad her to prayer so that God would give her children.</i>
<br>Although there is no obvious basis for this talmudic statement in the biblical text, the Abarbanel finds some evidence for this opinion in the setting of the story. He notes that Penina would torment Hana specifically at the times of pilgrimage to Shilo, a natural place for Hana to pray.
<br>Note also the subtle parallel the text draws between Penina and Elkana. Verse 7 tells us Penina angers Hana <i>ki sagar Hashem be’ad rahma</i> (because God had closed her womb) in almost the identical language verse 5 uses to tell us that Elkana gives Hana a goodly portion in compensation for her closed womb (<i>ki sagar Hashem rahma</i>). We would expect a different explanation for Penina’s behavior, such as an explicit statement that she is jealous of Hana – not words that describe her and Elkana as virtually identical in their reasons for relating to Hana as they do.
<br>Whatever the textual clues in the narrative, R. Levi’s reading of Penina’s character seems at least somewhat counterintuitive. Why, then, does R. Levi describe Penina in this way? Perhaps he wishes to provide a contrast with Hana’s character. Both women violate accepted norms of behavior, yet one is rewarded and the other punished. (See <i>Yalkut Shimonii</i> on I Samuel 89, <i>dibur hamat’hil: v’zeh she’amar hakatuv.</i> The relevant section begins with the words <i>v’rabbanan amri, hamisha yalda…</i>. This midrash also appears in <i>Pesikta Rabati</i> and <i>Midrash Shmuel</i>.)
<br>Two differences between Hana and Penina account for the different outcomes of their personal stories. First, while both act unconventionally, only Penina actually violates the dictates of <i>halakha</i>. Whatever one’s motivations, one may never verbally torment another. (Doing so violates the prohibition against <i>ona’at devarim</i> – oppressing someone with words.) Hana’s silent prayer turns out to be halakhically correct, despite Eli’s mistaken perception of it.
<br>The second difference is perhaps even more significant. Hana’s motives are pure. Penina, although motivated in part by a desire to help Hana, is also jealous of her. She does not appear to consider whether her cruelty to Hana is actually helping the situation, which has, after all, continued for many years. This may be because, unlike Hana, she is not sufficiently honest with herself, and does not thoroughly examine what is motivating her actions toward her rival. Hana’s reaction is always the same – she weeps and will not eat, classic signs of depression. On the occasion recounted in chapter 1, something changes. Elkana, grieved by Hana’s suffering, tries to console her (verse 8): “Hana, why do you weep, and why will you not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” Instead of quieting her, these words appear to galvanize her.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Kli Yakar suggests that Elkana’s question makes Hana realize that she wants to give, not receive. She does not want children so that they will be good to her, which is what Elkana offers as compensation for her childlessness – but so that she can give them to God. This idea is explored in <i>Midrash Shmuel</i>, as we will see.</i> Hana eats, drinks, and goes to the Sanctuary to pray (verse 9).
When we re-examine the chapter as a whole in light of R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i>, it becomes apparent that Hana is knotted up in her relationships with Elkana and Penina, the people closest to her who have what she so desperately wants. Like the king’s servants, though, they cannot give Hana what she needs. And, just as the servants’ ignoring of the pauper spurs him to take radical action, Elkana’s effort to persuade Hana to make peace with her situation rouses her to the realization that if she wishes to have a child she must go to the source; she must push her way into the King Himself.
Understood this way, the <i>mashal</i>’s use of the servants is a crucial element for helping us understand the narrative. Hana’s preoccupation with Penina’s cruelty and Elkana’s kindness is a barrier to true prayer because it confuses the issue. It entangles her emotionally, but brings her nothing. Elkana’s well-intentioned attempt to help her accept her fate becomes the moment of truth for Hana, the moment at which she realizes that she has been too tied up with others (either in fending them off, or in seeking their comfort) to address God directly. Suddenly Hana has the clarity to see God as <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i>, Who can grant her request if He but wishes. Only then can she confront Him with complete honesty.
Hana has been “standing at the opening,” but her new insight gives her the courage to “push her way in to the king.” Coining a new name for God is an act of daring,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Berakhot</i> 33b for a discussion of expressions forbidden in prayer. Among them are the adding of names or attributes to the description of God.</i> but in this case it expresses Hana’s deepest truth. Like the poor man at the feast who cannot understand why the king does not spare him a tiny portion of his largesse, Hana contemplating God’s vast world cannot understand why there is not room for a child of her own within it. The switch in perception which makes Hana aware that God is <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i> makes it possible for her to pray in a new, more authentic way.
<b>“…If You Will Surely See…</b>
R. Elazar’s next piece of commentary adds another facet to his portrayal of Hana’s prayer. This midrash takes the form of a narrative expansion, which radically alters the words of Hana’s vow:
(1) “…if You will surely see…” (<i>im ra’oh</i> <i>tir’eh</i>) (verse 11)
(2) R. Elazar said, Hana said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(3) “If You will see (<i>im ra’oh</i>), it will be good,
(4) and if not, You will see (<i>tir’eh</i>)!
(5) I will go and I will conceal myself in the presence of Elkana, my husband,
(6) and once I have concealed myself,
(7) they will make me drink the waters of the <i>sota</i>,
(8) and will You make Your Torah a fraud?”
(9) As it says, ‘And if she is innocent, she will have seed…’ (Numbers 5:28)
<b>Request and Vow or Demand and Threat?</b>
Verse 11, upon which the midrash is based, contains a request and a vow: “If You will surely see the suffering of Your handmaiden, and You will remember me, and not forget Your handmaiden, and [if] You will give Your handmaiden the seed of men, I will give him to God all the days of his life, and no other authority [but Yours] will come upon his head.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This translation follows Rashi.</i> Both the request for a child and the vow to give him to God seem conventional, if fervent, expressions of religious piety.
As portrayed in R. Elazar’s version of her prayer, however, Hana is not humbly requesting a child – she is demanding one. (“If You will see, it will be good, and if not, You will see!” lines 3–4.) Even worse, she seems to be threatening to force God to give her a child by manipulating the laws of <i>sota</i> to her own ends. As Hana points out, the Torah promises the vindicated <i>sota</i> greater fertility. Should God not give her a child, Hana will engineer a situation in which He will be forced to, for otherwise His Torah is a fraud. This depiction of Hana’s prayer makes her seem not merely assertive, but recklessly aggressive, even more than in Ula’s reading of Hana’s interaction with Eli.
On a first attempt, finding any textual basis for R. Elazar’s reading seems impossible.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Radak on I Samuel 1:11 <i>dibur hamat’hil: im ra’oh tir’eh</i>.</i> Even if we fall back on the idea that R. Elazar has a <i>mesora</i> that leads him to read verse 11 this way, it is hard to see what the point of such a reading could be. Surely, we are not meant to emulate a threatening or manipulative style of prayer.
<b>Finding Clues in the Text</b>
As is the case with R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i> of the pauper, his version of Hana’s request/vow does not make sense unless we view it within the context of the chapter as a whole. A careful reading of the chapter shows us that R. Elazar is not far off the mark in attributing aggressive emotions to Hana. For one thing, forms of the word “anger” (<i>ka’as</i>) appear four times throughout the story (verses 6, 7, and 16). For another, verse 10, which precedes Hana’s vow tells us that “she was bitter of spirit, and she prayed on God, and she surely wept.”
Verse 7 tells us specifically that Hana’s rival would anger her repeatedly “in order to provoke her.” That Penina succeeds in her aim is attested to by Hana’s weeping and refusal to eat. As we have noted, these are classic signs of depression, i.e., anger that has been dammed up. The text indicates a change in Hana’s mood after Elkana’s attempt at comforting her by telling us that she gets up to pray after having eaten and drunk (verse 9). Clearly, at this point, Hana is no longer depressed – she is fully, consciously angry, for when Eli mistakenly rebukes her for her drunkenness, she defends herself quite vigorously – almost rudely, according to Ula. Most significant, however, is that in verse 16, Hana herself tells Eli that she has been praying “from the great outpouring of my soul and my anger” (<i>me’rov sihi vekha’asi</i>). This self-description certainly implies that Hana is praying with an awareness of the strong emotions motivating her.
<b>Justifying Hana</b>
Still, we are left with a problem. Hana’s assertiveness in prayer, like her innovation of a new name for God, seems inappropriate in light of our notions of what prayer should be, or to the ways in which prayer is represented elsewhere in the <i>Tanakh</i>. Since it is highly unlikely that R. Elazar would view with approval the actually implementation of Hana’s threat, how are we to understand his apparent endorsement of her style of prayer?
The answer may lie in two central elements R. Elazar writes into his version of the story. The first is the nature of Hana’s threatened action, i.e., the idea that she would imagine manipulating the laws of <i>sota</i> to attain her goal. Considering what would be involved in carrying out such a threat – the violation of <i>halakha</i> by a pious woman, the social ostracism that would result, and the potential damage to her marriage – more than anything else, this threat shows us just how desperate Hana is to have a child. In this respect, R. Elazar’s narrative expansion is reminiscent of his <i>mashal</i>’s image of a beggar pushing his way in to confront the king. R. Elazar does not really believe that Hana would have gone so far as to carry out the threat he puts in her mouth. Rather, by expressing Hana’s emotion in such radical language, R. Elazar tells us that Hana’s need is so great, and is felt with such force that she is compelled to express her truest feelings directly to God in prayer.
The second element that tells us why Hana’s prayer is viewed with approval is a key phrase in the story: “…and will You make Your Torah a fraud?” (line 9). R. Elazar appears to see Hana as a person who is so utterly convinced of the justice of her case that she believes she can “convict” God by the standards of His own Torah. While R. Elazar does not explain <i>why</i> Hana feels this way,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See the passage from <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> below.</i> he does not appear to doubt the sincerity – or the accuracy – of Hana’s conviction. Whether or not Hana actually drinks the waters of the <i>sota</i>, she wants to tell God that denying her a child is as much a violation of His ultimate justice as if a guiltless barren woman were to drink the waters of the <i>sota</i> and then not be compensated with a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Interestingly, although he does not directly cite this particular midrash as the source of his reading, the Abarbanel, in his commentary on I Samuel 1:11 says essentially the same thing: “And, in my opinion, the statement ‘And You will give your handmaiden [the seed of men]’ means to say that if the blessed Lord would pay heed to her suffering and her shame, He would be obliged to give her the seed of men, and if He were not to give it, it would be out of not paying heed. And she said this is in order to point out that from the perspective of justice and fairness it would be worthy for the Lord to remember her in accordance with her suffering and oppression…Then, without a doubt, You will give your hand-maiden the seed of men…” The Abarbanel was unquestionably familiar with the reading of the Hana story in <i>Berakhot</i> since he quotes it at the end of the section along with several other midrashim. It seems clear that R. Elazar’s narrative expansion influenced his interpretation of verse 11.</i>
Understood this way, R. Elazar’s approval of Hana’s prayer is not an endorsement of aggression and manipulation. Rather, it is a statement that prayer must be a profoundly honest encounter with God, and the expression of our deepest feelings, and not simply the empty mouthing of conventional pieties. Hana’s personal struggle leads her to the kind of prayer described here. For someone else, an honest encounter with God might well result in the expression of very different emotions. In either case, though, for R. Elazar, true prayer cannot be the perfunctory fulfillment of a technical obligation. True prayer must be like the prayer of Hana – intense, focused, honest, and deeply felt.
<b>Accounting for Repetition</b>
The next midrash focuses on the repetitive language of Hana’s prayer in verse 11: “If You will surely see the suffering of Your <i>handmaiden</i>, and You will remember me, and not forget Your <i>handmaiden</i>, and [if ] You will give Your <i>handmaiden</i> the seed of men, I will give him to God all the days of his life, and no other authority [but Yours] will come upon his head.”
R. Yosi the son of R. Hanina comments:
(1) “…the suffering of Your handmaiden…do not forget Your handmaiden…and You will give Your handmaiden the seed of men…” (verse 11).
(2) R. Yosi the son of R. Hanina said, These three [repetitions of the word] ‘handmaiden,’ what are they for?
(3) Hana said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(4) “Master of the universe, three proofs of death<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., ways of checking if a woman deserves death.</i> You have created in a woman.
(5) (And there are those who say: “three junctions of death”.)<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., places through which death can enter.</i>
(6) They are: [the laws of] <i>nida</i>, [the mitzvah of taking] <i>halla</i>, and [the mitzvah of] lighting candles [for Shabbat].
(7) Have I ever violated one of them?”
<b>A Reproach</b>
R. Yosi reads a reproach into the threefold repetition of the word ‘handmaiden.’ Hana, in R. Yosi’s view, appears to be saying to God, “I have been a faithful servant to You, and I have fulfilled all my obligations to You. What reason have You to withhold from me that which I deserve?”
The textual basis for R. Yosi’s reading is fairly obvious. Hana’s brief prayer repeats the word ‘handmaiden’ three times where it would be more natural for her to refer to herself with a pronoun at least twice. Furthermore, as we noted above, the word <i>ama</i> (handmaiden) can be used to imply that the speaker wishes to remind the listener of an obligation. Taken together, these textual clues make R. Yosi’s interpretation of Hana’s words reasonable. His reading is also in keeping with the direction taken by the midrashim we have read thus far, since R. Yosi obviously sees Hana as assertive and demanding in her prayer. The difficulty with his reading is that the claim he makes for Hana is theologically problematic in the extreme.
<b>A Theological Problem</b>
As R. Yosi presents her, Hana seems to feel that her fulfillment of all the “women’s commandments” somehow entitles her to a child. I would suggest that this feeling is founded on a number of misconceptions. First, nowhere in Jewish thought can we find the idea that anyone is <i>entitled</i> to a child (or to anything else for that matter). Even the most righteous people may suffer for any number of reasons, and since we cannot know God’s intentions, we often do not know the true causes of suffering. Hana is unable know for certain why she doesn’t have a child, and so she cannot claim to be entitled to one on the basis of her obedience to God.
Second, while it may certainly be the case that Hana has perfectly fulfilled all of the commandments required of women specifically (at least as far as she knows), other <i>mitzvot</i> obligate her as well. R. Yosi does not have Hana claim perfect fulfillment of all God’s commandments. Why, then, is she not made to consider the possibility that she is barren for having failed to do God’s will in some other realm?
Finally, R. Yosi’s statement is based on the mishnaic teaching (<i>Shabbat</i> 31a–b) that three sins warrant women’s death in childbirth. (Hence his reference to them as “three proofs of death” or “three junctions of death.”) Nowhere in this mishna, or in the talmudic discussion on it, is it claimed that fulfilling these commandments guarantees women will have children. Why, then, does R. Yosi have Hana use this argument?
<b>Childbirth and Childlessness: Life and Death</b>
One possible resolution of this difficulty is to see R. Yosi’s reading of Hana’s prayer as an impassioned outpouring that throws theological correctness to the winds. In this view, Hana is speaking from her heart, not her head. As a righteous woman she must know that fulfillment of <i>mitzvot</i> does not guarantee a happy ending, but in the fervor of her prayer she is not constructing a theoretical argument. Instead, she presents herself to God as a woman who has fulfilled her feminine obligations to Him without having received the blessings of the feminine role.
Another possibility is that Hana has extended the association of childbirth and its attendant risk of death one step further. Women who have sinned in the ways described by R. Yosi are vulnerable to death in childbirth, but a childless woman is “like a dead person” (<i>Nedarim</i> 64b).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Tanhuma</i> Buber <i>Vayetze</i> 19, <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> 19: <i>davar aher: vayizkor…</i> which links this concept directly to the stories of Hana and Rahel.</i> If so, Hana’s words can be read as a challenge to God: “Do I deserve this living death (i.e., childlessness) if I have not violated the three ‘proofs of death?’”
However we understand it, Hana’s prayer is not rationally calculated; it is the communication of a personal truth to God. For Hana, the denial of the blessing of children is a life and death issue.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This motif reappears in the first of the midrashim cited in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>. See below.</i> Fighting for her very life, she cannot pray like a lawyer organizing a legal brief. By presenting Hana’s prayer in this way, R. Yosi tells us that part of what we must learn from Hana is to pray what we feel, and not only what we think.
<b>The Right to Have a Child?</b>
Beyond our interpretation of R. Yosi’s reading, another problem remains: Why do the midrashim in <i>Berakhot</i> represent Hana as absolutely certain of her right to have a child? This question is intensified by the midrashic discussion that follows.
<b>The Interpretive Problem</b>
The midrash here grapples with the meaning of the phrase ‘the seed of men’ which appear in verse 11. The context suggests that Hana is asking God to give her a child. But if so, we would expect her to say as much, using a common term for child or son. The unexpected phrase used by the text leads the midrashic commentators to assume that more is implied by these words than simply ‘a child.’ The discussion that follows offers several possible readings of the phrase.
(1) “…and You will give to your handmaiden the seed of men… (<i>zera anashim</i>)” (verse 11).
(2) Rav said, [This means] ‘a man among men.’
(3) And Shmuel said, [This means] ‘seed who will anoint two men,’
(4) and who are they? Shaul and David.
(5) And R. Yohanan said, [This means] ‘seed that is equivalent to two men,’
(6) and who are they? Moshe and Aharon,
(7) as it says, “Moshe and Aharon among their priests, and Shmuel among those who call His name…” (Psalms 99:6).
(8) And the Rabbis say, ‘the seed of men’ means ‘seed that is absorbed among men.’
(9) When R. Dimi came, he said,
(10) ‘Neither too tall nor too short, too thin nor too heavy, too pale nor too ruddy, too wise nor too foolish.’
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
The structure of this midrash is very simple; it is a list of interpretations of the phrase in question. There are five opinions which fall into two categories. The first three (lines 2–7) understand the phrase as a request for an exceptional child. The fourth and fifth opinions (lines 8–10) read the words as a request for a normal child.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The fifth opinion is actually an elaboration of the fourth. See Rashi on <i>Berakhot</i> 31b <i>dibur hamat’hil: she’muvla bein anashim</i>.</i>
<b>Asking for an Exceptional Child</b>
Significantly, the redactors of <i>Berakhot</i> place the “exceptional child” readings first. This is in keeping with the predominant tone of the midrashim we have seen. Like the interpretations of R. Elazar and R. Yosi the son of R. Hanina, these readings portray Hana as praying in a manner we would not expect, and demanding more than we might think reasonable.
Thus, Rav, picking up on the redundancy of the word <i>anashim</i> (men) reads it to mean ‘a man among men’ in accordance with the connotation of the word elsewhere, i.e., an important person<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Tosafot on these words.</i> (line 2). He maintains that Hana is asking for a special child, someone who will play a role among important people.
Shmuel goes further, adding words to the phrase so that it means ‘seed who will anoint two men’ (i.e., two important people) – the first two kings of Israel (lines 3–4). Shmuel’s interpretation implies that Hana, in anticipation of the coming monarchy, is requesting that her child be instrumental in founding that institution. Shmuel’s opinion seems more likely when we recall Hana’s prayer of thanksgiving in I Samuel 2:1–10. The prayer concludes with the prophetic hope that “…God will judge the ends of the earth and <i>give strength to His king, and lift the horn of His anointed one</i>.” If Shmuel is reading Hana’s first prayer in light of her second, his interpretation of ‘the seed of men’ as a request for a child who will one day anoint two kings seems far more plausible.
R. Yohanan offers perhaps the most dramatic interpretation, claiming that Hana is asking for a child who will be the equivalent of Moshe and Aharon (lines 5–7). His understanding of Hana’s request suggests that she is not content to have a child who will influence great men, or even play an important historical role. Hana wants a son who will himself be as great as Moshe and Aharon. R. Yohanan bases his understanding of Hana’s request on its actual outcome, namely, the son who will be so great that he comes to be compared to Moshe and Aharon in Psalms.
The remaining interpretations in the discussion understand the phrase ‘seed of men’ as a request for an ordinary child, one who, in the formulation of the Rabbis, will be ‘absorbed among men,’ meaning that he will fit into society without difficulty (line 8). R. Dimi spells out the particulars of this interpretation of the Rabbis, saying that Hana does not want a child who is in any way unusual, whether to his benefit or detriment (lines 9–10).
Following what appears to be the dominant interpretive strand of this midrash – the one that accords best with the midrashim we have seen so far – we find ourselves once again with a depiction of Hana as praying forcefully and insistently. This reinforces the question of why Hana is so convinced of the justice of her claim. Even more, this forces us to ask why <i>Hazal</i> view Hana’s attitude with approval, given their generally negative view of assertiveness and a demanding attitude, especially in relation to God.
A response to these questions appears in a parallel version of the midrashic discussion we have just seen. This version appears in <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> 2:7.
<b>A Crown for the King</b>
(1) “…and You will remember me” (<i>u’zekhartani</i>) – with male children (<i>bezekharim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The words ‘remember’ and ‘male’ share the common root <i>z-kh-r</i>.</i>
(2) “…and You will not forget Your handmaiden” – with female children.

(4) R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: ‘Men –
(5) that their faces should not be like a monkey’s or a eunuch’s.’
(6) Another explanation [of] “…and You will give Your handmaiden the seed of men”:
(7) understanding men –
(8) as it says, “Bring for yourselves wise and understanding men...” (Deuteronomy 1:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This verse describes the kind of judges that should be appointed to the judicial system.</i>
(9) men who are prophets –
(10) as it says, “And two men remained in the camp…” (Numbers 11:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase introduces Eldad and Medad who become prophets.</i>
(11) great men –

(13) righteous men –
(14) as it says, “And your people are all righteous…” (Isaiah 60:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This implies, by extension, that the definition of ‘men’ is righteous. Perhaps the author of this midrash was unable to find a more specifically appropriate quote.</i>
(15) They said to Hana,
(16) “Why do you ask for men who are wise and understanding and great and righteous?”
(17) She said to them,
(18) “Because they are for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He.”
(19) R. Levi said,
(20) [This may be compared to] one who sits and makes a crown for a king.
(21) Someone passed and saw him.
(22) He said to him,
(23) “What are you making?”
(24) He said to him,
(25) “I am making a crown for the king.”
(26) He said to him,
(27) “All that you can affix to it [in the way of] precious stones and pearls, affix.
(28) And why?
(29) Because it is destined to be put on the head of a king.”
(30) Thus, they said to Hana,
(31) “Why do you ask for men who are wise and understanding, great and righteous?”
(32) She said to them,
(33) “Because they are for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He.”
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
The above paragraph is made up of two midrashim. The first (lines 1–5) is a close reading of part of Hana’s prayer which portrays her as asking for many children, male and female.
The second midrash, which will be the focus of our analysis, concentrates on the phrase ‘seed of men,’ which we saw discussed in <i>Berakhot</i>. This second midrash may be mapped as follows:
(1) an interpretation of ‘seed of men’ with prooftexts (lines 6–14)
(2) a narrative expansion of the Hana story (lines 15–18)
(3) a <i>mashal</i> (lines 19–29)
(4) the <i>nimshal</i> (which is a repetition of the narrative expansion) (lines 30–33)
<b>Comparing <i>Berakhot</i> and <i>Midrash Shmuel</i></b>
The parallels between the midrashic discussion in <i>Berakhot</i> and this midrash from <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> are striking, although we will see some significant differences as well. In both texts, the phrase ‘the seed of men’ is interpreted in two mutually exclusive ways, i.e., the “ordinary child” reading and the “extraordinary child” reading. In <i>Berakhot</i>, the “extraordinary child” reading comes first, while in <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> the “ordinary child” reading precedes (lines 4–5). In <i>Midrash Shmuel</i>, the “ordinary child” reading is prefaced by a close reading of the repetitive phrases “and You will remember me and You will not forget Your handmaiden” which suggests that Hana’s request for <i>a</i> child is actually a demand for <i>many</i> children – male and female. Interestingly, the effect of this is to make even the request for normal-looking children (“that their faces should not be like a monkey’s or a eunuch’s”) seem like an excessive demand rather than a humble request. In <i>Midrash Shmuel</i>, then, Hana is once again portrayed as someone who feels entitled to have children, and not as a barren woman beseeching God for just one child.
<b>The “Extraordinary Child” Reading</b>
When we reach the second opinion in <i>Midrash Shmuel</i>, we find, perhaps not surprisingly, that it is even more elaborated and detailed than the “extraordinary child” reading in <i>Berakhot</i>. Hana is depicted as asking for wise, great, righteous prophets, and not only the one special child described in <i>Berakhot</i>. The author of this reading, moreover, goes to great lengths to substantiate each of the attributes he piles on to the list. For each of the special qualities that Hana is claimed to be requesting, there is a prooftext that links the word <i>anashim</i> (men) to that quality (lines 6–14).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The exception is the ‘righteous men’ quality for which the prooftext is somewhat forced. The fact that the author of the midrash includes it anyway indicates, perhaps, the extent to which he wishes to reinforce his reading.</i>
<b>Supplying the Missing Motivation</b>
After this point <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> deviates from <i>Berakhot</i> to offer us the information we’ve been missing – the critical answer to our question about Hana’s strong sense of entitlement to a child. The answer is supplied as part of a dialogue between Hana and an unspecified ‘they’ who question, “Why do you ask for men who are wise and understanding, great and righteous?” Hana answers: “Because they are for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He” (lines 15–18).
Upon consideration, this dialogue poses two problems. The first is the insertion of observers/questioners into the Hana story. The second is that Hana’s answer is rather cryptic. In this case, we quickly see the need for a <i>mashal</i> to help us make sense of the dialogue.
<b>The <i>Mashal</i></b>
The <i>mashal</i> story describes a person who is in the process of making a crown for a king. A passerby asks him what he is doing, and when he answers that he is making a crown for the king, the passerby advises him to use as many precious materials as he can for constructing the crown.
Taken in isolation as a story, without reference to the <i>nimshal</i>, the <i>mashal</i> is simple and clear.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In my experiences teaching this story, I have found that students from outside of Israel often raise the passerby’s unprompted interference in the crown-maker’s activity as a possible problem with the story. My response to this observation is that unprompted interference in other people’s business has been part of life in the Middle East since ancient times. Had this <i>mashal</i> been written in Sweden, the passerby’s unsolicited advice would be grounds for questioning the story.</i>
<b>Isolating the Elements</b>
Our next step is to isolate the elements of the <i>mashal</i> as follows:
the crown-maker
making the crown
the crown
the passerby
the passerby’s question (‘What are you making?’)
the crown-maker’s answer (‘I am making a crown for a king.’)
the passerby’s reaction (‘All that you can affix to it…affix.’)
precious stones and pearls
<b>Matching the Elements</b>
Our next step is to match the elements of the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i>. A first approximation looks something like this:
the crown-maker  / Hana
making the crown / -----
the crown / Shmuel
the passerby / -----
the passerby’s question / “Why do you ask for men who are
(‘What are you making?’) / wise and understanding, great and righteous?”
the crown-maker’s answer (‘I am / “Because they are for the sake of the
making a crown for the king.’) / Holy One blessed be He.”
the passerby’s reaction / -----
precious stones and pearls / the attributes of the special child
Re-reading this list, we can see that there is a definite problem with the correspondences we have made between the passerby’s question and that of the questioners in the <i>nimshal</i>, as well as between the crown-maker’s answer and Hana’s in the <i>nimshal</i>. While both the <i>mashal</i> and the <i>nimshal</i> contain questions and answers, the correspondence between them is purely formal, with no relation to their meaning. No real connection can be made between the question in the <i>nimshal</i>, ‘Why do you ask for men who are wise and understanding and great and righteous?’ and the passerby’s question in the <i>mashal</i>: ‘What are you making?’ By the same token, Hana’s answer in the <i>nimshal</i>: ‘Because they are for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He’ is hard to square with the crown-maker’s answer in the <i>mashal</i>: ‘I am making a crown for the king.’
We find, then, that the <i>nimshal</i> supplies fewer correspondences to the <i>mashal</i> than we had supposed, and our chart should more accurately look like this:
the crown-maker  / Hana
the act of making the crown / -----
the crown / Shmuel
the passerby / -----
the passerby’s question  / -----
the crown-maker’s answer / -----
the passerby’s reaction / -----
precious stones and pearls / the attributes of the special child
<b>Filling in the Gaps</b>
At least one of the correspondences is fairly easy to supply from our knowledge of the biblical story. If Shmuel is the “crown” of the <i>mashal</i>, and Hana the “crown-maker,” the act of “making the crown” must be Hana’s prayer since Hana’s prayer is what brings about the birth of Shmuel.
Identifying this element of the <i>mashal</i> solves one problem, but it leaves another, larger difficulty namely, the identity of the “passerby.” Our best guess is that the “passerby” of the <i>mashal</i> is identical to Hana’s questioners in the narrative expansion, but this does not solve our problem since we have not been able to determine who ‘they’ are. Also, as we have seen, there is a lack of correspondence between the questions and answers in the <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>.
As far as can be determined from the biblical account, there is no audience for Hana’s prayer, other than God and Eli. God cannot be the “passerby” because He is the king for Whom the crown is being made.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">It could also be argued that He would not need to ask why Hana is requesting wise, understanding, righteous prophets since He would surely know her motivations.</i> Eli cannot be the “passerby” because he does not hear the actual words of Hana’s prayer and only knows what she is praying for when she tells him. Who, then, is the questioner of the midrashic story and, presumably, the passerby of the <i>mashal</i>?
<b>Asking Our Question For Us</b>
Perhaps the best answer is that we, the readers of Hana’s story, are both the observers in the narrative expansion and the passerby of the <i>mashal</i>. Through the account in Samuel and the interpretations of <i>Hazal</i> we are privy not only to the words of Hana’s prayer as they appear in the biblical text but also to the hidden meanings that <i>Hazal</i> reveal to us.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">For another example of this device in a <i>mashal</i>, see Chapter 2.</i> As readers of the story from this omniscient perspective, we are empowered to observe far more of the story’s internal workings than even a bystander present at the time would have been able to see.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The strongest evidence of this is Eli’s initial reaction to Hana’s prayer.</i> And, as readers of this particular midrashic interpretation of the biblical story, we have been told that Hana is requesting far more than we would assume to be reasonable. Our question is only natural, and the midrash voices it for us: “Why do you ask for men who are wise and understanding, great and righteous?” Why can’t this barren woman be satisfied with a normal, healthy child?
<b>Letting Hana Answer for Herself</b>
The midrash resolves the matter by creating a story within which Hana is given a forum to address us directly, i.e., the narrative expansion/<i>nimshal</i> in which ‘they’ ask Hana our question and in which she responds. Her answer is that she wants exceptional children “because they are for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He.”
Even operating within the framework of the midrash, a critical reader might question whether Hana’s answer is sufficient justification for the <i>demanding</i> nature of her prayer. It is all well and good to want children for God’s sake, but surely it is for God to decide what kind of children He wants to give us. And while we might have sympathized with a meek pleading for an exceptional child, Hana’s prayer is made to seem excessive and importunate – even impertinent.
<b>Enlisting the Reader in the Midrashic Interpretation</b>
With exceptional skill, R. Levi defuses our objections by inserting us into the story. In constructing the <i>mashal</i> so that <i>we</i> are the interested passerby, he subtly shifts the focus of our question for us. Instead of observers who know what Hana is doing, and disapprove of it (or at least question it), we become the passerby who does not yet know what the crown-maker is doing. This rhetorical maneuver forces us to contemplate the meaning of Hana’s prayer afresh.
Hana is the crown-maker, and we/the passerby want to know what she is doing. When the crown-maker tells the passerby that he is making a crown for the king, the passerby inevitably becomes involved in the crown-maker’s task. It is self-evident to him that the crown-maker should affix as many precious stones and jewels as possible to the crown “because it is destined to be put on the head of a king” (line 29). In fact, the suggestion that the crown-maker pile on the precious materials comes from the passerby. The crown-maker doesn’t need to say anything.
This construction, which impels us to identify with the passerby, enables R. Levi to change our orientation toward Hana’s story. Our original, critical question (“Why do you ask for men who are wise and understanding and great and righteous?” (line 16)) becomes an endorsement of Hana’s prayer (“All that you can affix to it [in the way of] precious stones and pearl, affix” (line 27)). Like the passerby, we become enlisted in Hana’s endeavor. R. Levi believes that if we understand Hana’s prayer correctly, we will sympathize with her absolute certainty and sense of entitlement. He maintains that Hana’s prayer is the act of requesting a child who will truly be an adornment for God, which means that her wish for an exceptional child is not self-serving egotism, but rather a deep desire to do her utmost “for the name of the Holy One blessed be He.”
<b>Reconciling the Midrash and the Biblical Text</b>
<i>Midrash Shmuel</i>’s understanding of Hana’s motivation for wanting a child is profoundly moving and helps us understand why her prayer is viewed with approval in <i>Berakhot</i> despite its assertive – even aggressive – tone. The difficulty is, however, that once again, it is hard to see how this reading is grounded in the biblical story. Nothing in the text as we read it would seem to indicate a level of self-sacrifice so exalted that it would justify the demand for an exceptional child.
At least that is the case until we go back to the biblical story with the presumptions planted in our heads by this midrash. When we reread I Samuel 1:11 in light of R. Levi’s <i>mashal</i> of the crown-maker, we may detect something we have not paid sufficient attention to before. As we have noted, Hana’s prayer is both a request and a vow. We have minutely examined the request through the midrashic lens, but have barely registered the vow. When we focus on the vow, it seems almost unbelievable that we could have missed its enormous implications: “If You will surely see the suffering of Your hand-maiden, and You will remember me, and not forget Your handmaiden, <i>and [if] You will give Your handmaiden the seed of men, I will give him to God all the days of his life</i>, and no other authority [but Yours] will come upon his head.”
Hana alone, among all the barren women in the <i>Tanakh</i>, asks for a child only so that she can give him to God. With incredible strength, she is able to make the vow and also bring herself to fulfill it; as soon as the child is weaned she brings him up to Eli (I Samuel 1:19–28). Significantly, Hana sings her song of thanksgiving to God <i>not</i> after the birth of her son, but after Eli has accepted her child to serve in the Sanctuary (I Samuel 2:1–10). The implications are clear. Shmuel’s birth is not the complete fulfillment of Hana’s prayer; only God’s acceptance of her offering achieves what Hana has set out to do.
When we read <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> in light of Hana’s vow and her fulfillment of it, we see that the midrashic interpretation of “seed of men” as “extraordinary child” is not far-fetched at all. It is perfectly in keeping with the overall thrust of I Samuel 1–2. In this respect, the <i>mashal</i> from <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> is like sources we have seen from <i>Berakhot</i>. At first glance, these midrashim seem counterintuitive, but when we re-read the biblical text from their perspective we realize that we seem never to have read the text properly before.
<b>The Message in the Mismatch</b>
Significantly, the message of the <i>mashal</i> from <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> is centered on the very point that posed the greatest difficulty, i.e., the lack of correspondence between <i>mashal</i> and <i>nimshal</i>. Without the <i>mashal</i> we would have been unable to see the situation from Hana’s point of view. While the <i>nimshal</i> articulates our original stance, a critical questioning of Hana’s seemingly excessive behavior, the <i>mashal</i> makes us put ourselves in Hana’s shoes. By placing the <i>nimshal</i> both before and after the <i>mashal</i>, first in the form of a narrative expansion, and then in the form of the <i>nimshal</i>, the midrash shows us how our perspective changes when we view things from Hana’s position.
Using this <i>mashal</i> from <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> as our model, we can appreciate how carefully <i>Hazal</i> read the biblical text and with what subtlety they draw our attention to our own misreadings. Our initial sense that <i>Hazal’</i>s perceptions are somehow off kilter changes into the awareness that we are not sufficiently sensitive to the language of the biblical story. Confronting us with our preconceptions, <i>Hazal</i> engage us in a series of masterful pedagogical exercises. We emerge from them not only with new interpretations, but with a new perspective on how to read the <i>Tanakh</i>.
<b>“…Speaking On Her Heart…”</b>
Returning to <i>Berakhot</i>, we come to the last two midrashim on the Hana story. The first of them reads as follows:
(1) “And Hana, she was speaking on her heart” (I Samuel 1:13).
(2) R. Elazar said in the name of R. Yosi ben Zimra: ‘On the concerns of her heart.’
(3) She said before Him, “Master of the universe, of all You have created in a woman, You have created nothing in vain:
(4) eyes to see and ears to hear, nose to smell, mouth to speak, hands with which to do work, feet to walk with, breasts to nurse with.
(5) These breasts that You have placed on my heart, why should I not nurse with them?
(6) Give me a son and I will nurse with them.”
<b>Structure of the Midrash</b>
This midrash is a simple narrative expansion that can be mapped as follows:
(1) the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> (line 1)
(2) R. Elazar’s comment on the <i>dibur hamat’hil</i> (line 2)
(3) the narrative expansion, i.e., Hana’s words to God (lines 3–6)
<b>A Literal Reading</b>
The textual opening that invites R. Elazar’s reading is the phrase “she was speaking on her heart” (<i>medaberet al liba</i>). The phrase is unique in <i>Tanakh</i>; when the idiom “to speak on someone’s heart” (<i>ledaber al lev</i>) is used elsewhere, it means to appease or persuade someone, and the speaker is not the one whose heart is being spoken to. Based on our understanding of the plain sense of verse 13, we would have expected a different idiom such as, “And Hana, she was speaking <i>from</i> <i>(mi)</i> her heart....”
R. Elazar, noting this problem in the language and following the reading of R. Yosi ben Zimra, interprets this passage both figuratively and literally. In his comment on the <i>dibur hamat’hil,</i> he understands the words “on her heart” as “on the concerns of her heart” (<i>al iskei liba</i>). However, in his narrative expansion of the verse, he reads the words literally as a statement that Hana was speaking to God about her breasts, which rest upon the heart. Hana’s argument in this midrash is that everything God has created in a woman’s body has a purpose. She wishes to be given a child so that her breasts, like the other parts of her body, will fulfill the function for which they were created.
<b>A Window into Hana’s Theology</b>
This midrash opens a window into Hana’s personal conception of her Creator. Contemplating her body, Hana sees it as having been designed purposefully by the Master of the universe Who is also Master of detail. The argument she presents here is that her breasts have no purpose if she is childless: “These breasts that you have placed on my heart, why should I not nurse with them? Give me a son and I will nurse with them” (lines 5–6). In its straightforward expectation of reason and fairness, this line recalls the words of the poor man in R. Elazar’s <i>mashal</i>: “My master the king, of all this great feast that you have made, is it difficult in your eyes to give me one piece of bread?” The poor man’s question is itself a paraphrase of Hana’s words in the same midrash: “Master of the universe, of all the hosts of hosts that You have created in Your world, is it difficult in Your eyes to give me one son?”
Hana, it seems, expects God’s world to make sense, and her barrenness does not make sense to her. God <i>can</i> give her a child if He so wishes; why, then, does He not? All the other parts of her body have a purpose; shouldn’t her breasts fulfill their function too?
Before we dismiss Hana’s view of God and the world as simpleminded, we should recall that <i>Hazal</i> clearly do not view her this way. Building upon the biblical portrayal of Hana, they repeatedly demonstrate that Hana is by no means an uncomplicated person. For one thing, as we have seen, her prayer is the outgrowth of complex and combative emotions. Hana has a strong and assertive personality and she fearlessly addresses God with all its full force. Furthermore, as <i>Hazal</i> see her, Hana is so spiritually advanced that she is able to innovate an authentic name for God and intuitively divine that true prayer is silent. Beyond that, Hana is sufficiently learned that she knows the laws of <i>sota</i> well enough to exploit them in her argument with God. And, when we look at R. Elazar’s brief final word on Hana’s prayer – the last midrash from <i>Berakhot</i> on this page – we can only conclude that she stands among the truly great.
R. Elazar tells us that “Hana hurled words toward Heaven, as it says, “…and Hana prayed on God....” This statement is not accompanied by any censure of Hana. On the contrary, R. Elazar goes on to tell us that both Eliyahu and Moshe hurled words toward Heaven. Hana’s argumentative prayer is not evidence of a mindless rebellion against God, but of a relationship so close that she can speak to God as openly as she wishes. Whatever the source of Hana’s personal theology, it cannot be shallowness of character, or spiritual or intellectual weakness.
<b><i>Hashem Tzeva’ot</i></b>
To understand what motivates Hana’s theology, we need to re-examine how <i>Hazal</i> understand her name for God, <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i>. As we have seen, R. Elazar addresses the meaning of the term in his mashal of the poor man. <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> cites two more readings of the term <i>Hashem Tzevaot</i> from <i>Pesikta Rabati</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The citations in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> are from <i>Pesikta Rabati</i> 43, <i>dibur hamat’hil: vatidor neder vatomar Hashem Tzevaot.</i> There are minor differences between the versions that appear in <i>Pesikta Rabati</i> and <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>. I have opted for the versions from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> because they are likely to be more familiar to most readers.</i> By analyzing the different readings of this name for God, and contextualizing them within <i>Hazal’</i>s larger portrayal of Hana, we may be able to arrive at an understanding of Hana’s personal theology.
The commentary from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> II 78 follows:
(1) R. Yehuda said in the name of R. Simon:
(2) Hana said before the Holy One blessed be He,
(3) “Master of the Universe, there is a host on High, and a host below.
(4) The host on High do not eat and do not drink,
(5) do not increase and multiply,
(6) and do not die, but live in the world to come.
(7) And the host below eat and drink,
(8) and increase and multiply,
(9) and die, and do not live [forever].
(10) And I do not know of which host I am.
(11) If I am of the host on High,
(12) I should not eat, nor should I drink,
(13) nor bear children,
(14) nor die, but live forever.
(15) And if I am of the host below,
(16) I should bear children,
(17) and eat and drink.
(18) Another explanation:
(19) Hana would go up on pilgrimage and would see all of Israel.
(20) She said before Him,
(21) “Master of the universe, You have all of these hosts
(22) and I have not even one among them?”
<b>A Host on High and a Host Below</b>
The paragraph from <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> is made up of two narrative expansions, i.e., two versions of what Hana conveys to God by calling Him ‘God of Hosts.’ The first reading, that of R. Yehuda, takes a minimalist approach to the word ‘Hosts’<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In midrashic methodology, the minimum of a plural is often – though not always – two.</i> and understands it to be a reference to two hosts: the host of Heaven and the host of earth.
In this view, Hana sees God’s world as an ordered unit in which everything has its place. The host of Heaven is made up of immortal creatures who have no earthly needs and who do not reproduce: “The host on High do not eat and do not drink, do not increase and multiply, and do not die, but live in the world to come” (lines 4–6). The host of earth <i>needs</i> to eat and drink, <i>does</i> reproduce, and <i>is</i> mortal.
R. Yehuda’s linkage of these defining characteristics is not accidental. Heavenly creatures do not need nourishment because they do not have bodies. By the same token, they need not reproduce themselves because they are immortal. In contrast, human beings need to eat and drink to survive and they must have children to replenish the world when they die. It is a sign that all is not well with a person when he has no desire to eat and drink, as the account in I Samuel indicates by showing us that Hana does not eat or drink when she is in despair. It is likewise a sign that something is not right in God’s world when a mortal being cannot have children, at least in Hana’s view.
As R. Yehuda depicts her, for Hana, God is truly in the details. Hana’s conception of God is represented by the name she introduces for Him: God of Hosts, the God Who creates and controls vast groups made up of individual details. This conception of God echoes R. Elazar’s image of a king who prepares a great feast, and who may, if he so desires, give the beggar a piece of bread.
In R. Yehuda’s reading, Hana wants God to tell her where she, the individual, belongs in the larger picture of the inhabitants of heaven and earth. Because her vision of God includes both the larger picture and the detail, she fully expects God’s world to have room for her. If she is mortal, and her place is not among the inhabitants of Heaven, then God must give her a child, just as, in her view, all the parts that make up her body must find their function in the fulfillment of the purpose for which they were created.
<b>A Personal Relationship With a Personal God</b>
This understanding of God also finds expression in the second opinion cited in <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>. Here, Hana, contemplating the throngs of pilgrims coming to Shilo for the festival, asks God, “Master of the universe, You have all of these hosts and I have not even one among them?” (lines 21–22). Once again, Hana sees the larger picture, but she also knows that it is made up of distinct details. Among the vast crowds at Shilo, Hana wishes to see an individual face belonging to her which would connect her in a personal living link to God. In this rhetorical question, too, we hear the echo of the poor man’s reproach to the king.
Hana’s theology is far from simplistic. She has a powerful sense of both the larger picture and the details of which it is composed, and she is able to sustain these two views simultaneously. What ultimately makes Hana’s understanding of God so optimistic is that it is highly personal. She deeply believes that the God of all the vastness that is the world is also her personal God. This is what leads her to expect an answer to her prayer and this is what enables her to pray with such intensity and honesty. Hana is not naïve about the potential for suffering; she understands it all too well from her own painful experience. Rather she senses the immanence of the Divine in the world, and she believes that the God Who has constructed a vast world out of so many finely distinguished details cannot fail to hear her. She, too, is one of “the hosts of hosts that You have created in Your world.” If God but wishes, He will give her a child.
