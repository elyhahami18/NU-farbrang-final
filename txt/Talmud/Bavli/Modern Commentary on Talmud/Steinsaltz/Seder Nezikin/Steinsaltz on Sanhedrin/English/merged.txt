Mishna I: One law for monetary cases and one law for capital cases in inquiry and investigation [i.e. cross-examination] of the witnesses, as it is said: “One justice shall be to ye” (Lev. 24:22). That is to say, all proceedings of justice must be unified.
What is the separation between the monetary and the capital? Monetary cases judge according to three judges, and capital cases judge according to twenty-three judges. Monetary cases open their judgement between arguments for the acquittal of the defendant and claims for conviction, while in their capital cases they open to acquit, and do not open to convict.
In addition, in monetary cases, they [i.e. the judges] give iudicium (in current language, “hand down their judgement”) according to one judge['s majority] for acquittal or for conviction, and in capital cases, they give iudicium according to one judge['s majority] for acquittal and according to two [judges' majority] only to convict.
In monetary cases, if it is believed that the judges erred, they may return the case whether [the result of the case was] acquittal or conviction, but if in capital cases, they may return the case to acquit but [may] not return [the case] to acquit, even if they believe that the judges erred in their first decision of acquittal.
In monetary cases, everyone [may argue to acquit]—these are not only judges, but other intelligent students present in the place—they may teach [i.e. argue] acquittal and conviction, in capital cases, everyone may teach to acquit, but not everyone can teach to convict; this is for the judges alone.
In addition, in monetary cases, someone that was teaching conviction at the beginning of the judgement can now teach to acquit if they return to the case, and the one who teaches acquittal from the beginning may later teach to convict, but in these capital cases, it is not so—except that a teacher of conviction [i.e. prosecutor] may switch to a teacher of acquittal [i.e. defense counsel], but a teacher of acquittal may not return to teach conviction.
In addition, in monetary cases, they judge in the daytime but may finish [i.e. hand down] the decision of their judgement even at night; but in capital cases, they judge in the day and may finish in the day alone.
In monetary cases, they are finished in the day if they [i.e. the judges] have had enough of the examination of the witnesses and have arrived at a decision between innocent and guilty. In capital cases, they finish the decision during the day if they decide to acquit, but they wait until the next [lit. to that which is after it] to decide to convict. Therefore, because it is so that capital cases are made [i.e. designed] to continue for two days. They do not judge capital cases on Érev-Shabbat nor on Érev-Yom-Ṭov [that is, the figurative evening, i.e. the twenty-four hours preceding a Holy Day]. Thus, if there is a decision to convict, they must wait until after [the Holy Day in question] in order to finish the case, and it is forbidden to enact a death penalty on Shabbat or a Ħag.
Another differentiation: in monetary cases, as well as in cases of [ritual] impurity or purity, they commence [thus]: the burden and the gift [i.e. the duty] begins from the great among the judges. In capital cases, they commence from the side, like it is said: from the small among them, that he opine his decision first.
All are fit to judge monetary cases, but not all are fit to judge capital cases. Only Kohens [i.e. those of the priestly caste], Levites, and Israelites are worthy—those Israelites who[se lineages] are seen [to be fit] to raise up their daughters to the priesthood.
