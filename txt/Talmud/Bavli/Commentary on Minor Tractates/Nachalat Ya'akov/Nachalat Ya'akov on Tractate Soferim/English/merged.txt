Halakhah 10

Donkey driver, sailor, potter, etc.: This law appears in the Mishnah at the end of Tractate Kiddushin, but the Jerusalem Talmud adds further explanations, and the phrasing of this law here aligns with the Jerusalem Talmud. The reason one should not teach their son to be a donkey driver, sailor, etc., is explained in the Mishnah there: these professions often lead to theft. Rashi explains that when they travel on the roads, they take wood from vineyards and fruits. Additionally, they are sometimes hired by others and do not fulfil the conditions of their contracts.
Potter: This refers to someone who carries pottery from place to place.
Most sailors are pious: There is a difficulty here, as the first Tanna (Tannaitic authority) states that their professions lead to theft, yet Rabbi Yehudah says in the name of Rabbi Meir that most sailors are pious. I saw in the Maharsha in Chiddushei Aggadot that he writes, according to Rashi, we must say that Rabbi Yehudah, quoting Rabbi Meir, disagrees with the first Tanna. He adds: "Without Rashi's explanation, it would seem that donkey drivers, camel drivers, and sailors are not associated with theft, but rather their work takes them on long journeys far from home. The statement that their profession involves theft applies only to shepherds and shopkeepers—a shepherd grazes flocks in others' fields, and a shopkeeper is accustomed to deceit, such as diluting wine with water or mixing pebbles with grain. Thus, Rabbi Yehudah’s statement does not contradict the first Tanna but stands as its own matter." End of his words. Note that a clause is missing here—since in the Mishnah, the list begins with "camel driver," but this is not mentioned here. Additionally, the Mishnah concludes that most camel drivers are upright, but this is not stated here. Rashi explains that most camel drivers are upright because they travel in dangerous places with wild animals and robbers, which makes them fear for their lives and turn their hearts to God. Similarly, sailors face danger when traveling far and live in constant fear, more so than camel drivers.
The best of doctors goes to Gehinnom (purgatory): Rashi explains this is because they are not afraid of illness and do not humble themselves before God. Sometimes, they may cause death, or they may have the means to heal a poor person but refuse to treat them.
The most upright of butchers: Rashi explains that butchers often encounter cases of questionable "treif" (non-kosher meat due to defects). To protect their financial interests, they may sell it regardless. The Tosefot Yom Tov adds that butchers are often cruel, which aligns with the trait of Amalek.
Most mamzerim (children born from forbidden relationships) are clever: The Tosafot Yom Tov explains that this is because they resemble their fathers, who were cunning in seducing women and concealing their actions from others.
Most slaves are attractive: The Tosafot Yom Tov writes that this should read "arrogant," explaining that arrogance often arises from a degraded family background.
Bashful people: The Tosafot Yom Tov explains that these are people of distinguished lineage, and therefore, they are bashful, resembling their ancestors.
They resemble the mother’s brothers The Tosafot Yom Tov suggests that this is because a woman loves her brothers, and her thoughts are often focused on them. During intimacy, if her imagination is occupied with them, the child will resemble them. This aligns with natural philosophy, which states that imagery during conception influences the child.
Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught: It seems this should read: "Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught: The most upright among idolaters..." The Tosafot Yom Tov comments that the practical implication is not to trust them. The mention of "during war" may mean that one must be especially cautious then, as the idolater can easily justify their actions by claiming they intended to harm an enemy. However, in Rashi’s commentary on the verse "And he harnessed his chariot" (Exodus 14:6) and the Mekhilta, Rabbi Shimon's statement does not mention "during war." After writing this, I found in the commentary of Rabbeinu Bachya on the Torah that he explains as I did.
The best of snakes: The practical implication is that even if it is a trained snake, one should not trust it. Similarly, even the most upright woman cannot be trusted, as seen with the daughter of Rav Nachman in Tractate Gittin (according to the Tosafot Yom Tov).
Fortunate is one who fulfils the will of God: The Tosafot Yom Tov explains that this is stated because several "upright" individuals mentioned above are described negatively. It concludes by saying, "Fortunate is one who fulfils God’s will," as it is rare to find such a person. Alternatively, it may refer to those saved from the evil of women, as it says, "He who pleases God shall escape her" (Ecclesiastes 7:26).
