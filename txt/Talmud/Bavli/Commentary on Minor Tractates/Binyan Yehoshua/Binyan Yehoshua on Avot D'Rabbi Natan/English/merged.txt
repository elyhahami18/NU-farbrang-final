<b>withhold</b> this is the language of deduction. As it comes in Pesachim 118a "The Holy Blessed One does not withhold reward from any creature". And in the whole Talmud [...]. And so the explanation is, withheld the creatures from the urge to evil and from evil deeds, and brought them under the wings of the Divine Presence.





<b>You have bound yourself</b> that in the world to come, that you begot a <i>mamzer</i>. That this is from sin that it is not possible to mend, as it comes in Chagiga 9b.
<b>That a <i>mamzer</i> does not enter Jerusalem</b>. Even though it says at the end of Tractate Horayot (Horayot 3:8) that a learned <i>mamzer</i> precedes an ignoramus high priest. As it says (Proverbs 3:15) "She [wisdom] is more precious than rubies", from a high priest who enters within and beyond. Nonetheless, the holiness of Jerusalem is unable to bear him, since its holiness is very great -- one who does not have proper lineage, such as a <i>mamzer</i>, would not be able to have settlement in Jerusalem. And so it is written "And a <i>mamzer</i> shall dwell in Ashdod, etc." (Zechariah 9:6). Commentated.

<b>One who learns Torah in their youth</b> does not forget easily, as stated earlier that they are like fresh parchment. It turns out that when something is difficult in one place, they resolve it by means of a different topic elsewhere, for words of Torah are poor in one place and rich in another. If so, this one has in their hand healing medicine. However, the old person who forgets doesn't have this healing, only the scalpel to cut, for the difficulty is in a "poor place".
