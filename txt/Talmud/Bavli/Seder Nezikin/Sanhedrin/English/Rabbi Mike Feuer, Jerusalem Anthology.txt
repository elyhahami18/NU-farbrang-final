It was taught: R’ Yosi says  ‘Three commandments were given to Israel when they entered the land;  [i] to appoint a king; [ii] to destroy the seed of Amalek; [iii] and to build themselves the Chosen House (the Temple) and I do not know which of them comes first. When it is said “The hand upon the throne of the Lord, the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation,” (Shemot 17:16) we learn that 
the appointing of a king comes first, because ‘throne’ indicates a king, as it is written “Then Shlomo sat on the throne of the Lord to rule.” (Divre HaYamim I 24:23) 
But I still do not know which of the other two comes first, building the Chosen House or destroying the seed of Amalek. When it is written “and He will give you rest from all your enemies surrounding you, and you will dwell securely. Then it shall come to pass that the place which the Lord your God shall choose…” (Devarim 12:10-11) it means that  the extermination of Amalek is first. 
And so it says about David  “And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies,” and it is further written “That the king said unto Nathan the prophet; ‘See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within the curtains.’” (Shmuel II 7:1-2)

“For when the foundations are destroyed…”  Rav Yehudah and Rav Eina, one said ‘if Hezekiah and his supporters had been destroyed then what would the Righteous have accomplished?’  and one said  ‘if the Holy Temple were destroyed, then what would the Righteous have accomplished?’  Ulah said  ‘if the thoughts of that wicked man were not thwarted, then what would the righteous have accomplished? (Rashi: what would his award have been?)  
The verse makes sense according to the one who says it refers to the thoughts of the wicked one, that is why it says “for the foundations were destroyed.”
So too according to the one who says it refers to the Holy Temple, as it is taught,  there was a stone there from the time of the first prophets, and it was called shetiyah. 
But according to the one who says it refers to Hezekiah and his supporters, where do we find that righteous people are called foundation? 
It is written “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and He placed the world upon them.” (Shmuel I 2:8)  Or one can demonstrate it from here  “He gave marvelous counsel, made great wisdom.” (Isaiah 28:29) ...
R' Yochanan said,  why is it (the Torah) called wisdom (toshia)? Because it wears out (mateshet) one’s strength.  Another explanation:  because it was given in secret due to the accuser.  Another explanation:  formless words, on which the world rests.

R’ Chiya bar Aba said in the name of R’ Yochanan:  from where do we learn that the resurrection of the dead is taught by the Torah? As it says “The voice of your watchmen- they raised a voice, together they shall sing…” (Isaiah 52:8) It does not say ‘they sang’ but rather ‘they shall sing’ – from here we learn that the resurrection of the dead is taught in the Torah.  And R’ Chiya bar Aba said in the name of R’ Yochanan:  in the future all the prophets will sing a song with one voice, as it says “The voice of your watchmen- they raised a voice, together they shall sing…”

“To him who increases the authority, and for peace without end…” (Isaiah 9:6) R’ Tanchum said: Bar Kappar expounded in Tzippori  ‘why is every letter mem which is located in the middle of a word open at the bottom, and the one in this verse is closed?  The Holy One wanted to make Hezekiah the Messiah and Sancheriv Gog and Magog. 
But the aspect of judgment said before the Holy One:  Master of the World!  You did not make David, who said before You many songs and praises, the Messiah. Will you then make Hezekiah, for whom You did all these miracles and who did not sing before, into the Messiah?! Therefore it was sealed.

R’ Alexandri said:  All who engage in Torah for its own sake make peace in the household above and in the household below, as it says “If they would grasp My fortress, they would make peace for Me, they would make peace for Me.” (Yeshayahu 27:5) 
Rav said:  it is as if he built the palace above and below, as it says “And I placed My words into your mouth, and with the shadow of My hand I covered you, to plant the heavens and to found the earth…” (Yeshayahu 51:16) R’ Yochanan said:  he even defends the whole world, as it says “…and with the shadow of My hand I covered you…” Levi said:  he even brings redemption closer, as it says “…and to say to Zion [that] you are My people.” (Yeshayahu 51:16)

R’ Yochanan said:  Why did Yerovam merit to kingship? Because he rebuked Shlomo.  And why was he punished? Because he rebuked him in public.  This is as it says “And this was the matter [concerning] which he raised his hand against the king; Solomon built up the Millo and closed up the breach of the city of David, his father.” (Melachim I 11:27)  He said to him:  David your father made breaches in the wall in order that Israel could come up for the pilgrimage festivals, and you sealed them up in order to make forced labor for the daughter of Pharaoh?
