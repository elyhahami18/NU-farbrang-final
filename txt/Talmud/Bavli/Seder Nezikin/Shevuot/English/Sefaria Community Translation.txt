  What is the meaning of the phrase "they are one" It means that they were said in one utterance as we find in the Torah Whereas in (Exodus 20:7) it says "remember", its parallel (Deuteronomy 5:11) reads "observe." This is to teach that both words were said in a single utterance, one that human mouth can't utter, and one that a human ear can't hear.

 As our rabbis taught: (Deuteronomy 19:17) "then both the men shall stand" - Scripture is talking about witnesses.
You say it is about witnesses, but could it not be about litigants? When it says (Deuteronomy 19:17) "between whom the controversy is," the litigants are now mentioned. So, what do I do with "then both the men shall stand"? Scripture is speaking of witnesses. And if you are inclined to speak, [note that] that it says here "both," and it says later (Deuternomy 19:17) "both." Just like there, it is about witnesses, so here, it is about witnesses.
What if are inclined to speak? And of you would say: "Since it did not write '<i>and</i> between whom the controversy is,' the entire verse applies to litigants," [you should note that] it says here "both," and it says later (Deuternomy 19:17) "both." Just like there, it is about witnesses, so here, it is about witnesses.

that the whole world shook when God said at Sinai: 'Do not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.'
     
 
    
 

     
  
I only know (that it applies) to those who stood at Mount Sinai. From where do i know about future generations and future converts? It is stated (Deut. 29:14): And also with him that is not here..."
  

   
   
  
   
 
   
 
    
      ......
      
 (Leviticus 26, 37): "And they shall stumble one upon another". One upon his brother's sin -- teaching us that all of Israel are responsible for one another.
