 Every person that has fear/awe of the heavens, his words are heard, as it is said,  “The end of the word/matter/davar, everything is (has been) heard, fear Ha’elohim [and keep His commandments, for this is the whole human]” [Ec 12:13]
What is [the meaning of], “for this/zeh is the whole human”?...  R’ Elazar said:  The Holy One said: The whole entire world was not created except for the sake of this one / bish’vil zeh. 
R’ Abba bar Kahana said:  This one is equal to the whole world.  R’ Shimon ben Azai says: . . .  The whole entire world was not created except to join to this one / l’tsavot l’zeh.
