 Why is it written: “After YHVH your God you will walk”?—And would it be possible for a human to walk after the Shekhinah,  and wasn’t it already said, “For YHVH your God is a consuming fire” [Dt 4:24]? 
Rather  [it means] to walk after the Holy One’s qualities/midot. Just as He clothes the naked . . . so should you clothe the naked; just as the Holy One visits the sick . . . so should you visit the sick; just as the Holy One comforts mourners, so should you comfort mourners; just as the Holy One buries the dead . . . so should you bury the dead.
