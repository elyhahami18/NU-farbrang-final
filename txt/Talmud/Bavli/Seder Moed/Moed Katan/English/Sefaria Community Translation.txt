They said to him: What do you want here? He said to them: Because Father said to me: Go by them so that they will bless you. They said to him: May it be [His] will that you sow and not reap; take in and not take out; take out and not take in; may your home be desolate and your inn inhabited, may your table be tumultuous; and may you not see a new year.

"May your home be desolate and your inn inhabited" as this world is your inn (i.e. temporary) and that world (i.e. the next world) is a home (i.e. long term), as it is written: “Their inner [assumption is that] their houses are forever” (Psalms 49:12) - read it not as “their inner [kirbam]” rather as "their grave" [kivram]. (In other words, the blessing was that he should live a long life.)

 If one buries his dead three days before a festival, the 
restrictions appertaining to his seven days' mourning fall away; [if he  buries his dead] eight days before a festival, the restrictions of the  thirty [days] fall away, 10 because they [the sages] said that the Sabbath enters into count but foes not interrupt, while festivals interrupt and do not enter into count.

The Rabbis taught: From when do we turn over the beds? Our Rabbis taught: Formerly, they were wont to serve drinks in a house of mourning, the rich in white glass vessels and the poor in coloured glass, and the poor felt shamed: they instituted therefore that all should serve drinks in coloured glass, out of deference to the poor. Formerly they were
wont to uncover the face of the rich and cover the face of the poor, because their faces turned livid in years of drought and the poor felt shamed; they therefore instituted that everybody's face should be covered, out of deference for the poor.38 Formerly. they were wont to bring out the rich [for burial] on a dargesh39 aid the poor
