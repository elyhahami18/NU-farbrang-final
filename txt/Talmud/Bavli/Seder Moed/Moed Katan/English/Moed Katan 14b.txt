Daf 14b

A mourner does not deport
himself as one in mourning during a festival, as it is said: And thou shalt rejoice in the
feast. [For], if his mourning began before [the festival], a positive precept incumbent on the community overrides one incumbent on him as an individual; and if his mourning
began just then [during the festival], an individual's function cannot come and put off that of the public.
