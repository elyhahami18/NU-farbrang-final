Both the sinners of Israel and the sinners of the nations of the world descend bodily to Gehinnom and are judged there for twelve months. After twelve months their bodies are consumed and their souls burnt and the wind scatters them under the feet of the righteous, as it says “And you shall crush the wicked, for they will be as ash under the soles of your feet…” (Malachi 3:21) 
But the schismatics, the betrayers, the converts away from Judaism, heretics, deniers of Torah, deniers of the resurrection, those who separate from the community, those who ‘spread their terror in the land of the living,’ who sinned and made the masses sin like Yerovam ben Nevat and his fellows – these descend to Gehinnom and are judged there for all generations, as it says “And they shall go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against Me…” (Yeshayahu 66:24) Gehinnom will be consumed but they will never be consumed, as it says “…and their form will outlast the grave as his dwelling place (zevul).” (Tehillim 49:15) 
Why so much? Because they laid their hands on the dwelling place (zevul), as it says ‘as his dwelling place’ and dwelling place only refers to the Holy Temple as it says “I have surely built You a house to dwell in…” (Melachim I 8:13) Of all these Chana said “Those who strive with the Lord will be broken…” (Shmuel I 2:10) 
R’ Yitzchak bar Avin said:  their faces will be black like the bottom of a pot.  Rava said:  among them are the most beautiful of the inhabitants of Mechuza, and they will be called ‘the children of Gehinnom’.

From where do we learn that one should make a memorial for the Holy Temple?  Because the verse says “For I will bring healing to you, and of your wounds I will heal you, says the Lord, for they called you an outcast, that is Zion whom no one seeks out.” (Jeremiah 30:17) This teaches that she needs to be sought.
