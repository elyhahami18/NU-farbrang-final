R’ Yermiyah ben Elazar said:  there are three entrances to gehinnom. One in the wilderness, one in the sea and one in Jerusalem.  In the wilderness, as it is written  “They, and all they possessed, descended alive into the grave…” (Bamidbar 16:33) 
In the sea, as it is written  “…from the belly of the grave I cried out, You heard my voice.” (Yonah 2:3) 
In Jerusalem, as it is written  “…the word of the Lord, whose fire is in Zion and whose stove is in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 31:9)  It was taught in the school of R’ Yishmael: ‘whose fire is in Zion’ refers to gehinnom, ‘whose stove is in Jerusalem’ refers to the entrance to gehinnom.
