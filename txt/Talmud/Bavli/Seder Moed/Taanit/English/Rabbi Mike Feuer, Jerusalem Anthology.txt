R’ Nachman said to R’ Yitzchak:  What does this verse mean? “In your midst is the Holy One, and I will not enter a city.” (Hoshea 11:9) Because the Holy One is in your midst, I will not enter a city?!  He replied, this is what R’ Yochanan said:  The Holy One said ‘I will not enter Jerusalem above until I can enter Jerusalem below. 
And is there a Jerusalem above?  Yes, it is written “The built-up Jerusalem is like a city that was joined together within itself.” (Psalms 122:3)
