Daf 70b




Three words of aggadah:  one verse says “For I do not desire the death of him who dies…” (Yechezkel 18:32) and another verse says “…for the Lord desired to kill them.” (Shmuel I 2:25) One is when they repent and the other is when they do not repent. 
One verse says “…Who will show no favor, nor will He take a bribe,” (Devarim 10:17) and another verse says “May the Lord raise His countenance toward you…” (Bamidbar 6:26)  One is before the judgment is sealed, the other is after. 
One verse says “For the Lord has chosen Zion…” (Tehillim 132:13) and another verse says “For this city has aroused My anger and My wrath since the day they built it until this day…” (Yirmiyahu 32:31)  One is before Shlomo married the daughter of Pharaoh, the other is after Shlomo married the daughter of Pharaoh.
