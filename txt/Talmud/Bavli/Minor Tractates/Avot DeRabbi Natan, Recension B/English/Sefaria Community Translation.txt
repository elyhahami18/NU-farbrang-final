"And all of your deeds should be for the sake of heaven, like Hillel". When Hillel went somewhere, they would say to him "Where are you going?" "To do a mitzvah." “What mitzvah Hillel?” “I am going to the toilet!” “And is that a mitzvah?” He said to them, “Certainly, so that one’s body should not be damaged” “Where are you going?” “I am going to do a mitzvah” “What mitzvah Hillel?” “I am going to the bath-house!” “And is that a mitzvah?” He said to them, “Certainly, in order to clean one’s body. And you should know that this is so, for in the palaces of kings a person is paid a yearly salary to scrub and wash the icons there, and furthermore that person is esteemed amongst the dignitaries of the nation, regarding us humans then who are created in the image and likeness (of God) as is said, “For in the image of God he made humanity” (Genesis 9:6) all the more so." Shammai did not say thus, but rather, “Let a person perform his duties with this body.”
