The animal of a Jew is more appealing etc. It is possible with what is known that all the desires of the sitra achra and their cravings are to cling to holiness to engage in love of sparks of holiness because this is their life-force. Therefore, even the animal of a Jew, that (Jews) fulfil with it (the animal) many commandments: resting on the Sabbath, not ploughing, the seventh year, etc., for them (the Gentiles) to draw some kind of holiness in them (the animals), and even though they do not know and will not understand that their ministering angel puts in their minds to find appealing the animal of a Jew.
