Daf 13b


<b>And that which will be played in the days of the Messiah, "eight" (Psalms 12:1; Psalms 16:11):</b> With God's help, it appears to me that the reason is that after the arrival of the messiah, the fifty gates of understanding (<i>binah</i>) will be lit, which is the fullness of freedom, and there will be freedom from the angel of death and freedom from the subjugation of the [other nations]. And <i>binah</i> is the eighth sefirah. That is why the harp will have eight strings, as a hint to 'understanding.' And that hint is in the [word,] harp (<i>kinor</i>), which is (when moving the letters around) <i>ner kaf-vav</i> (light of 26) - such that the (four letter) name of His Existence, which has a numerical equivalent of 26, should shine completely.
