Elijah cannot come [on Friday, in order not to interfere with the preparations for the Sabbath], but the Messiah can. Why?? Because when the Messiah arrives, they will be many servants to the Jewish people." It seems to me that the reason is according to what our Rabbi the Ari, z"l, said in the verse (Isaiah 55:3), "And you shall not be redeemed with money." The redemption of Israel from Egypt was according to the attribute of kindness, which is the secret of money, but the redemption that will come in the future [soon in our days, Amen] will be according to the attribute of might, which is the secret of Isaac, see there. And it is known in the secret of the blessing that our forefather Isaac peace be upon him blessed our forefather Jacob peace be upon him (Genesis 27:28), “And God will give you of the dew of the heavens,” which is ten blessings corresponding to ten sefirot, and the blessing “May the nations serve you” corresponding to the sefira of might, and as mentioned in the Siddur of our Rabbi the Rashash z”l in the intentions of the verse mentioned will be mentioned there. Therefore, when the Messiah arrives according to the attribute of might, then the blessing “May the nations serve you” corresponding to the might will immediately take place. And it seems to me with heavenly help that the meaning of that which it says about the nations being servants for the Jewish people, the word "them," seems superfluous. But the intent is understood that those  who are called servants are of their own free will and not because of compulsion, and therefore immediately on Sunday they come to the attend, and all this at the end of "its time" (Isaiah 60:22).

Certainly, these anecdotes were not presented here in mere coincidence. Rather Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chanania arranged them in the style of parables to offer moral lessons from them. And Rabbi P. M. already explained these according to the teachings of Musar (Jewish Ethics). And it seems to me that [Rabbi Yehoshua] arranged these three parables to correspond to the three divisions of the soul known as NaRaN [Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama]. And the parable of the woman corresponds to the soul level of Neshama. The parable of the small boy corresponds to the soul level of Ruach. And the parable of the small girl corresponds to the soul level of Nefesh. For every person, even those [who appear to only have a lowly soul on the level] of Nefesh, actually contains the entire NaRaN and they enable the soul to teach knowledge and ethics to the body.
