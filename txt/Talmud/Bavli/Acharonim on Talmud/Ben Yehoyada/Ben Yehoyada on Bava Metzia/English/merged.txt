Rabbi Eliezer said: "If the law is as I say, let it be proven from Heaven!" A heavenly voice (bat kol) emerged and declared: "What do you have against Rabbi Eliezer, for the law always aligns with his opinion?" Rabbi Yehoshua then stood up out of respect for the heavenly voice. However, his words, which were addressed directly to the statement of the heavenly voice, argued decisively that the greatest honor to God is that we do not heed a heavenly voice when it contradicts a clear ruling in the Torah. The Torah itself states: “After the majority shall you incline” (Exodus 23:2). If we were to rely on a heavenly voice to overturn even a single Torah ruling, the entire Torah could, Heaven forbid, be nullified in the future. Alternatively, the phrase "Rabbi Yehoshua stood up" indicates that he advanced a decisive argument, demonstrating intellectual and spiritual "standing" on his feet. It is known that when a sage presents an idea in the study hall, and the other sages refute it, it is said that the presenter "could not find his hands and feet in the study hall" (i.e., his arguments were unsound). Here, the narrative highlights the strength and clarity of Rabbi Yehoshua's response, which was so compelling that he metaphorically "stood on his feet" with this decisive argument. Know this: all the miracles performed from Heaven to support Rabbi Eliezer, including the emergence of the heavenly voice, were divinely orchestrated. These events served as a profound lesson to establish a strong and enduring foundation for Torah. This foundation ensures that no sage, regardless of his wisdom or standing, can impose his own view against the majority. Such actions could lead to divisions and turn the Torah into “many Torahs.” It was revealed and foreseen by the Holy One, blessed be He, that the other sages were steadfast and committed to the truth. Therefore, even when they saw miracles and heard the heavenly voice endorsing Rabbi Eliezer, they refused to annul the principle enshrined in the Torah: “After the majority shall you incline.” For this reason, God decreed that all these miraculous signs and the heavenly voice would occur. Yet, they would not sway the sages to abandon the Torah’s principles. By doing so, a powerful and eternal precedent was established for future generations, ensuring that no one could annul even a single letter of the Torah. Who, hearing about these miraculous signs and the heavenly voice failing to override the majority, would dare to speak or act against the Torah? Who could bring similar signs or miracles to support their view? This monumental event, publicized and deeply impactful, was meant to be remembered for all generations. And though this caused great sorrow to Rabbi Eliezer, this event ultimately brought merit to him. It served as a foundation for the strength and endurance of Torah principles and the prevention of divisions. Of Rabbi Eliezer, it is said: "Good outcomes are brought about through those who are righteous." Now, if you examine the words of the heavenly voice carefully, you will see that it spoke not in absolute terms, but rather in the form of a question: “What do you have against Rabbi Eliezer?” If it had been God's will for the sages to accept Rabbi Eliezer's view as halacha in this case, the heavenly voice would have clearly stated: “The law is as Rabbi Eliezer says.” This was the case in the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, where the heavenly voice declared: “Both are the words of the living God, but the halacha follows Beit Hillel” (Eruvin 13b). Here, however, the heavenly voice used the language of a question: “What do you have against Rabbi Eliezer, for the law always aligns with him?” The phrase “What do you have” implies that the sages had a valid counterargument. It invited them to present their case, asking, "What do you have to say in response?" It was then that Rabbi Yehoshua stood up with the strength of a lion, presented his case, and declared his words.
"You have overcome Me, My sons, You have overcome Me, My sons." I believe, with God's help, that this repetition in the phrase is meant to express two distinct ideas: First, it refers to their disregard for the signs from the carob tree, the water channel, and the walls of the study hall. And secondly, it also refers to their disregard for the heavenly voice (bat kol). Know that even though I wrote earlier that initially, God did not want the sages to annul the words of Rabbi Eliezer—who was alone in his opinion and performed all the signs, including the heavenly voice—to establish a strong and firm foundation for the Torah for future generations, and as I mentioned, despite all this, He spoke these words, “You have overcome me, my sons,” out of His love for the sages, to honor and respect them. In this statement, God granted them favor and glory, recognizing that they did His will. By acting in this way, they ensured the establishment of a strong foundation for the preservation of Torah and the resolution of disputes.
