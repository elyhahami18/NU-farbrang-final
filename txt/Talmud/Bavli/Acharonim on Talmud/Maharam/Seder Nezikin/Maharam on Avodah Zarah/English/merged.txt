Daf 36b

Gemara: “Even in private (the prohibition applies).” This refers to the decree of the Hasmonean court (Beit Dino shel Chashmonai). For when Rav Dimi came, he said: “The court of the Hasmoneans decreed that one who has relations with a Gentile woman is liable due to Nashga [the acronym for niddah, shifchah, goyah, and eshet ish].” When Ravin came, [he explained further]. This is the correct text (katzar l’omra). See also in Tractate Sanhedrin, Chapter “Hanisrafin” (Sanhedrin 82a) for further clarification
Tosafot, beginning with “משום נשג”ז וכו’”: Indeed, it is difficult [to reconcile this] because we say in the chapter Kol HaAsurin (Yevamot 49b) that Abaye said: “If a Kohen has relations with a Gentile woman, even if she is a married woman, he does not incur lashes.” And Rava said: “He does incur lashes.” This implies that, according to Rava, it is a Torah-level prohibition (mide’oraita), since lashes are administered for it. The explanation follows Rava, as we rule in accordance with his opinion over Abaye.

Further in the text: We say in the chapter Asarah Yuchsin (Kiddushin 75a) that there is a dispute between Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov and Rabbi Yehuda, etc., and even Rabbi Shimon does not permit [relations with a Gentile woman]. And although Tosafot earlier (on this passage) wrote that it could be rejected because the case there [in Yevamot] involves a convert (giyoret), which is different, [nevertheless] there in the chapter Asarah Yuchsin, it is explicitly implied that regarding a Gentile woman (ovdeh kokhavim), even Rabbi Shimon agrees [that it is prohibited]. See there.

Daf 43b

The Gemara says: 'If that is so, then the image of a human face alone should be permitted, etc.' We must analyze: what is the question here? Why would it wonder that all forms of celestial servants would be prohibited? If so, it should also ask: 'If that is so, then all faces should be prohibited,' so why does the teaching say that all faces are permitted, etc.? And if so, even according to the initial thought, without this reasoning, the Baraita (teaching) would not align well with us. One could say that without this reasoning, we might say that the Baraita holds that although all images of celestial servants are prohibited, the images of other forms, such as an ox, lion, and eagle, are not prohibited because they are not considered as significant celestial servants, given that the entire lower world is filled with animals and creatures, unlike the image of a human, which is indeed significant. But now that it states, 'The Torah only prohibited the form of the four faces together,' it properly asks: 'If that is so, then the image of a human face alone should be permitted, etc.' And this is understood.
