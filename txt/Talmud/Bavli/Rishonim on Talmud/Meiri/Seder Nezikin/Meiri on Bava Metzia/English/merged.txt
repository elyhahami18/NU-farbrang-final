It appears from this sugya (discussion) that if someone separates terumah from property that is not their own, without the owner's permission or appointment as an agent, the separation is not considered valid terumah at all—even if the owner's intent was evident. This aligns with what is stated: "He was appointed as an agent; it is indeed logical to conclude this way," etc. Nevertheless, the great commentators ruled according to the plain understanding of this teaching, that if one separates terumah without permission, the separation is not valid terumah unless the owner’s consent is explicitly evident. How is this expressed? If the owner comes and says, "You should have taken from the better produce," then if there were better produce, the separation is valid terumah; if not, the separation is not valid, as the owner’s statement was merely out of anger. However, if the owner added to the separated amount afterward, in any case, the separation is valid terumah, because the addition reveals the owner's agreement with the action.Now you might ask: since the produce is already exempt from terumah due to what the agent separated, how can the owner subsequently add more? After all, it was said elsewhere: if one separated and achieved a ratio of one-sixtieth, the separation is valid; if he later added to it, the additional produce is subject to tithes. This implies that the status of terumah does not apply to the addition, making it non-terumah and subject to tithes like other untithed produce.To resolve this, the sages of France explained that whenever the owner separates terumah himself, any additional produce separated afterward remains untithed, because his initial intent was to separate sparingly (with a "stingy eye")—specifically at a ratio of one-sixtieth. However, when terumah is separated by another person, and the owner’s intent is to separate generously (with a "good eye"), any additional produce separated does not lose its status as terumah.Yet, I do not incline toward their view, for it was said: if one separated and achieved a ratio of one-sixtieth, this indicates that his intent was for more than that, and thus some have explained this as meaning that the agent had not yet completed the separation. If the agent had completed the separation, no addition would hold any significance. My teachers interpreted it as referring to a case where the separation was completed, but the designation of terumah applied only to what the agent separated and not to the addition.Thus, when it says here, "his separation is valid terumah," it refers to the primary separation. When it says elsewhere, "his separation is not valid terumah," it refers to the additional produce. Since the issue here concerns the primary separation—due to the fact that it was done by an agent—it needed to teach us that the primary separation is valid terumah. But in the context of Seder Zeraim (laws of agricultural gifts), where the issue is with the addition (and not the primary separation, which is undisputed), it only needed to address the addition and state that it is not valid terumah.This, to me, seems to be the correct understanding.
