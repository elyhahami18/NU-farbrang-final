A Noahide is commanded regarding the prohibition of blasphemy just as an Israelite is and is only executed by the sword, for most executions of Noahides are by the sword, as will be explained. Even if he did not blaspheme using the explicit Name but rather with one of the divine appellations that we mentioned above, which may not be erased, he is executed. This is unlike an Israelite, who is only executed if he blasphemes using the explicit Name. If he used one of the appellations, according to the opinion of the great commentators, he is not executed unless he used the explicit Name itself, as is the view of the other commentators. Some of the great rabbinic authorities hold that even without using the explicit Name or an appellation, one is liable, but if he blasphemed using an appellation, he receives lashes, as it is stated, “You shall not curse God” (Exodus 22:27), and the term "God" is one of the divine appellations. According to those who require the use of the explicit Name for an Israelite, regarding a Noahide, they rule that just as a Noahide is liable for blaspheming with an appellation, so too is he liable for cursing without using the explicit Name, since the rule of requiring the explicit Name applies only to Israelites. This also seems to be the understanding of the great commentators, even though they did not state it explicitly. Furthermore, this principle is derived from the verse, “When he pronounces the Name,” from which we learn that the rule of "as the stranger, so the native-born" applies to Israelites, excluding Noahides.

Daf 56b

The seven commandments that the Noahides were commanded, for each of which they are executed if violated, are: establishing courts of law, blasphemy, idolatry, sexual immorality, murder, theft, and eating flesh from a living animal. The first six were commanded from the time of Adam, and the prohibition of eating flesh from a living animal was added from the time of Noah, as it is stated, “But flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat” (Genesis 9:4). The prohibition of eating meat from a living animal includes all its flesh, but Noahides are permitted to consume the blood of a living animal. Likewise, castration, even though it is similar to removing a limb from a living creature, is permitted for them. Similarly, the pagan practices of divination, sorcery, and consulting the dead—even though these are idolatrous customs—are permitted for them, despite the verse stating, “Because of these abominations, the Lord your God is driving them out before you” (Deuteronomy 18:12). If so, why were they punished for engaging in these practices if they were not prohibited? Rather, it is because these practices are a gateway to idolatry, which is why they were punished. This is what was stated later regarding idolatry, that Gentiles are punished for engaging in these things.
Noahides are forbidden from crossbreeding animals of different species, as well as from grafting trees of different species. However, these are not included among the seven Noahide laws, and they are not executed for them. Other forms of forbidden mixtures are permitted for them.
A Noahide is not executed for idolatry unless he worships it in the manner that an Israelite would be executed for it—such as worshiping it in its customary manner, meaning the way it is traditionally worshiped, or by performing one of the four primary acts of worship (sacrificing, burning incense, pouring libations, or bowing). Even if the idol is not traditionally worshiped in that manner, as will be explained later in this chapter, if he did so, he is liable. However, if he worshiped it in a manner that is not customary and not one of the four primary acts—such as hugging or kissing it and similar actions that are not part of its normal service—he is exempt, though it remains prohibited for him just as it is for an Israelite. Similarly, he is prohibited from erecting a monument, planting an Asherah tree, or making images even for decoration, let alone for worship. However, if he only made them but did not worship them, he is exempt, since an Israelite is not executed for making them but only receives lashes, and lashes do not apply to Noahides. The principle that “their prohibition is their death penalty” applies only to those prohibitions explicitly commanded to them, not to those derived from Israelite law. Some explain the principle that “their prohibition is their death penalty” to mean that whenever the Mishnah states that Noahides are prohibited from something, it implies that they are liable for the death penalty, as it does not use the term "prohibition" in a general sense.
An Israelite is only executed with a court of twenty-three judges, with valid witnesses and prior warning. However, a Noahide does not require all of these; he is executed based on a single judge and a single witness, even if the witness is a relative, though not based on the testimony of a woman. It appears to me that he is also not executed based on the testimony of those disqualified from giving testimony under Torah law.
Noahides are obligated to establish courts of law in every district and in every city, just as Israel was commanded, so that they will have fixed courts to judge cases concerning these seven commandments and to admonish their people regarding them. Since they were commanded in this, if they see someone transgressing and do not judge him, they are all executed. This is the reason why the people of Shechem were liable to be killed—not because of sexual immorality, since the woman was unmarried, but because of theft. As it is stated, “Shall he treat our sister like a harlot?” (Genesis 34:31), and the great rabbinic authorities wrote in their commentaries that “like a harlot” means that he treated her as ownerless, meaning that he would not be liable for theft. Thus, Shechem was guilty of theft, and they saw and did not judge him. This is the opinion of the great commentators. However, some leading scholars of later generations dispute this, saying that the obligation to establish courts for Noahides is only a positive commandment, and when it is said that “their prohibition is their death penalty,” this does not apply to positive commandments. According to their opinion, the killing of the people of Shechem was unjustified, and this is why Jacob cursed them. However, in my view, the obligation to establish courts is included in the commandment of “justice,” which prohibits wrongdoing and violence, and thus it is a prohibition, not just a positive commandment. Jacob did not curse them for acting unjustly, but because he had made an agreement with them and wanted to maintain his word and their treaty, going beyond the strict letter of the law. A proof for my view is what is stated later, that a Gentile who rests on the Sabbath is liable for the death penalty, as it is written, “Day and night they shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22). The Talmud asks why this is not included among the seven commandments and answers that the list only includes prohibitions of inaction, whereas this is an active prohibition. The Talmud then questions why the obligation to establish courts is included, since it is an active commandment, and answers that it includes both an active and a passive prohibition, meaning preventing wrongdoing, as it is written, “You shall not commit injustice” (Leviticus 19:15). Any means that leads to enforcing justice is therefore included.
Noahides are commanded regarding both strict judgment and compromise, as it is stated, “To do righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). It has already been explained that "righteousness" refers to compromise. However, they do not have monetary fines, nor are they permitted to judge cases involving fines.
Noahides are warned against eating a limb from a living animal, whether from a kosher or non-kosher species. This is different from Israelites, for whom the prohibition applies only to kosher species, as we explained in Tractate Chullin. The prohibition of a limb from a living animal applies to domesticated animals, wild animals, and birds— for Israelites, it applies only to kosher species, but for Noahides, it applies even to non-kosher species, since those species are still considered "permissible" to them. However, the prohibition does not apply to creeping creatures (sheratzim), neither for Israelites nor for Noahides. An Israelite does not receive lashes for eating an entire limb from a creeping creature; rather, the prohibition applies only if he eats an olive-sized portion while the creature is alive and a lentil-sized portion after its death, as explained in Tractate Meilah. Even though creeping creatures are considered "permissible" to Noahides, it appears that the prohibition of a limb from a living animal does not apply to them. Some major scholars wrote that, in their view, a Noahide is not liable for execution for eating a limb from a living bird. However, this is puzzling, and other leading scholars believe this is a scribal error and that the original intent was to refer to a limb from a creeping creature. Even though creeping creatures are permissible to Noahides, an Israelite is not punished for eating flesh from a living animal unless he eats an olive-sized portion, whereas a Noahide is executed even for eating the smallest amount. This is because all measurements of prohibited food quantities apply only to Israelites. It was clarified in Tractate Chullin that if an Israelite slaughters an animal by cutting both of its simanim (the trachea and esophagus), but the animal is still convulsing, it is forbidden to Noahides under the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. However, for an Israelite, it is permitted since the animal has undergone proper ritual slaughter.

Daf 57a

The prohibition of theft is included under the category of robbery, and a Noahide is liable for execution whether he commits theft, robbery, or forcefully seizes property—whether he takes money or kidnaps a person, as we explained regarding Shechem. This applies even in the case of taking a beautiful woman in war. If a gentile does this to another gentile, he is judged for it, and all the more so if he does it to an Israelite. Among Israelites, this is forbidden except in the context of war, as will be explained in its proper place. However, if an Israelite steals from a gentile who does not observe the seven Noahide laws, it is permitted in cases where there is no desecration of God's name, since such a person is considered an idolater. But if the gentile observes the seven Noahide laws, then stealing from him is forbidden, because any Noahide who accepts upon himself the seven commandments is considered one of the pious among the nations and part of a religious community, having a share in the World to Come. A Noahide is not only liable for execution for outright theft but even for withholding a worker’s wages. Even if a laborer eats from his employer’s property outside the time of his work— even for an amount less than the value of a perutah—he is liable for execution.
Similarly, regarding forbidden sexual relations, if a gentile designates a maidservant for his slave and then has relations with her, he is liable for execution. Among Israelites, such a case is forbidden, and if there is partial freedom in her status, the offender brings a guilt offering for a "designated maidservant" (shifcha charufa). However, if a master designates a maidservant for his slave without any aspect of freedom in her status, he is completely exempt from punishment, because marital status applies only to Israelites or gentiles among themselves, but not between slaves or between a slave and an Israelite. Regarding the designation of a maidservant for a slave, the liability for execution applies only when her designation is publicly known to the extent that people refer to her as "the designated woman of so-and-so." She reverts to being permissible once she is separated from him and publicly removes her head covering in the marketplace.

Daf 57b

Similarly, regarding the prohibition of bloodshed, even if a Noahide kills a fetus in its mother's womb, he is liable for execution. This is not the case for an Israelite, who is not liable until the fetus is no longer considered a non-viable birth (נפל). Likewise, if a Noahide kills a person with a terminal condition (טרפה), ties someone up and leaves him before a lion to be killed, or kills a pursuer (רודף) when he could have been stopped by injuring one of his limbs, he is liable for execution. Among Israelites, these cases are also considered murder, but the Jewish court does not impose the death penalty for them. However, for Noahides, execution is required. Nonetheless, even among Israelites, the king has the authority to execute in such cases, as will be explained. Regarding an Israelite who kills a gentile: If the gentile does not observe the seven Noahide laws, the Israelite is exempt from punishment by a court of law, since such a person is considered an idolater. However, it is still forbidden to kill him. In such cases, Israelites do not actively cause the death of such gentiles, nor do they make efforts to save them. But if the gentile does observe the seven Noahide laws, he is considered part of a religious community and is protected under the law. Additionally, some of the great legal scholars wrote that withholding a worker’s wages violates the positive commandment of "On that day, you shall give him his wages" (Deuteronomy 24:15). Even though the logic of the Talmudic discussion on this matter may suggest otherwise, be careful not to misinterpret it.
Everything we have said that a Noahide is warned about applies equally to both men and women, with no distinction between them.

Daf 58a

The six forbidden relationships for Noahides are: 1) His mother, even if she conceived him in an illicit relationship, since she remains his mother. 2) His father’s wife, as it is written: "A man shall leave his father and mother", which is interpreted to include his father’s wife. This prohibition applies even after the father’s death. 3) A married woman, as it is written: "He shall cleave to his wife", excluding another man’s wife. 4) Homosexual relations, whether with a minor or an adult, as indicated by the exclusion of a male partner from the verse about marriage. 5) Bestiality, as it is written: "They shall be one flesh", implying that only unions capable of producing offspring are valid, thereby excluding relations with animals or birds. 6) Maternal sister, but not paternal sister, because Noahides recognize maternal kinship but not paternal kinship, except for the prohibition of his father’s wife, as seen in Abraham’s words: "She is my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife."
A Noahide is not liable for relations with a betrothed girl from among their own people, nor even with a married woman unless she has consummated her marriage. If she merely entered the wedding canopy but was not yet intimate with her husband, he is not liable, as it is written: "A woman who has known a man by lying with him." Thus, Noahide law does not recognize betrothal or partial marriage as binding. Additionally, liability only applies for natural intercourse. It also appears that mere sexual contact (ha'ara'ah, minimal penetration) does not constitute a capital offense for Noahides. However, if a Noahide has relations with a betrothed or married Jewish woman who has entered the wedding canopy but not yet consummated the marriage, he is judged by Jewish law, which imposes punishment even for unnatural relations and for minimal penetration. The penalties follow Jewish law: stoning for betrothed women, strangulation for those who entered the canopy but were not yet intimate, and execution by sword for fully married women, as per Noahide law. These punishments apply even without prior warning, with a single witness and a single judge, like other Noahide laws. For Noahides, since they do not have divorce through written documents, a married woman becomes permitted to another man once her husband has sent her away from his home, or if she has left his authority with the intention of not returning.
From what has been stated, it follows that a Noahide is permitted to marry his daughter, and all the more so his paternal or maternal aunt and other relatives. However, there is a strong basis to rule that he is prohibited from marrying his daughter since mother and daughter are considered equivalent in many laws. This interpretation is supported by the Talmudic discussion where Rav Huna states, "A gentile is prohibited from marrying his daughter." The halacha follows this opinion, despite some debate in the Gemara.
Regarding a convert to Judaism, he is considered as a newborn child (ger shenitgayr kekatan shenolad dami), meaning he has no familial ties from his previous life as a non-Jew. Therefore, if his relatives also convert, he is technically permitted to marry them. However, the sages forbade marriage with maternal relatives (but not paternal ones). If a convert had previously married his maternal sister or even his mother as a non-Jew, he must separate from them upon conversion. However, paternal relatives, such as a paternal sister or paternal aunt, remain permitted. Additionally, he may marry his brother’s widow (whether his brother was born before or after his conversion), his father’s widow, or his uncle’s widow, even if these women had married these relatives after converting. The prohibition applies only to maternal relatives. Likewise, if his daughter converted, she remains permitted to him. Similarly, he may marry his maternal aunt’s paternal sister, but not her maternal sister. He is also forbidden from marrying his maternal brother’s widow if she married his brother after conversion. However, if she married him while he was still a non-Jew, she remains permitted. The same applies to his father’s maternal sister. All these laws apply even to a convert who was conceived and born in Jewish holiness (i.e., if his parents converted before his birth). However, the Talmud in Yevamot clarifies that two brothers conceived before their parents' conversion but born afterward are still subject to the prohibition of marrying a brother’s widow. If a convert engaged in relations with his relatives while they were still non-Jews, and he later converted while they remained non-Jews, his actions are considered equivalent to having relations with a gentile, which is not subject to karet (spiritual excision) under Jewish law. If a convert married a woman and her daughter after they had all converted, he must divorce one of them, but he may remain with the other. The same applies to two maternal sisters who converted—he may only keep one. However, if he married a female convert and she died, he is permitted to marry her mother or daughter, since rabbinic prohibitions on such relationships do not apply after death. Similarly, two paternal sisters who convert remain permitted to him. It is thus clear that a convert is permitted to marry all secondary incestuous relations (shniyot) under rabbinic law, such as his maternal grandmother and similar relatives, if they have converted. This discussion is elaborated in Yevamot, in the chapter "Nose’in".

Daf 58b


A gentile who struck a Jew or caused damaged to him is liable to death at the hands of Heaven, but is not executed over it. And any Jew who raises his hand against another, even if he did not strike him is called "wicked" as it says "and he said to the wicked one: Why should you strike your friend?” [Exodus 2:13]. The phrase: Why did you strike, is not stated, but rather: “Why should you strike,” indicating that one who raised his hand to strike another, even if he ultimately did not strike him, is called "wicked".

<b>And these</b> are the ones that do not have a share in the world to come, but are rather punished for their evil for all generations; they will not be able to turn away from [their punishment]: One who denies the revival of the dead, or that he says about it that it is not from the Torah, meaning that it is not from the faith of the prophets. And likewise someone who says the Torah is not from the Heavens, even if he says so only about one verse alone, that Moshe, our teacher, wrote it on his own. And an <i>apikoros</i>, and that is a word that includes many things. And they explained about it that it is one who denigrates a Torah scholar. But behold, [also] included in this are the heretics - and they are those that deny God's existence or His oneness or His simplicity (as opposed to being composite); those who worship idolatry even through an intermediary; and those who deny prophecy or God's omniscience. However since all of these did not fit into this statement and it was not necessary to mention them, they explained about this, that it is the one who they needed to mention, that it is regarding one who denigrates Torah scholars and, all the more so, his teachers. As from denigrating the scholar, one will denigrate his words and his wisdom, and will deny everything that is fitting to believe. So it comes out that even one who denies the explanation of the Torah - and that is the Oral Torah - is included in this. And [also] one who is recalcitrant even about one sin and the denigrates the holidays, or he profanes the sanctified objects. For all of these things indicate an angle of denial, which is not by way of the [evil] impulse or from desire. And likewise one who leads the many to sin, even about light things; and likewise those who separate themselves from the ways of the community, and instead set up their own standards, even though he does not do sins; and likewise one who does sins with a high hand, meaning to anger [God] and publicly and in the way of heresy. And likewise those who put too much fear upon the community for [their own] glory or power, and not for the sake of the Heavens. And likewise one who denies the coming of the Messiah. As all of these cause the destruction of the Torah. And they are all in the category of <i>apikoros</i>, and that is what they said more generally - "'He denigrated the word of God,' that is an <i>apikoros</i>." And [also] one who reveals aspects of Torah, meaning incorrectly; and that is someone who explains the commandments metaphorically in order to uproot the commandment. Rabbi Akiva says, "Also one who reads foreign books," meaning to say, not in order to understand and to teach, but rather with the intention to follow their faith. And you already know about them that they only believe what investigation reveals and what logic proves.
