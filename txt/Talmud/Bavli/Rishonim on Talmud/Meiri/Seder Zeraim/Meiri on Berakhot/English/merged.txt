One should always be shrewd in their fear of Heaven, responding gently and increasing peace with one's brethren and relatives, so that they will be loved above (by God) and pleasant below (to others), and accepted by all creatures. This applies even to a non-Jew in the marketplace, meaning a non-Jew who does not know him personally but happens to encounter him in the marketplace. How much more so when the non-Jew knows him. It was said about Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai that he never failed to greet anyone with peace, even a non-Jew in the marketplace.
