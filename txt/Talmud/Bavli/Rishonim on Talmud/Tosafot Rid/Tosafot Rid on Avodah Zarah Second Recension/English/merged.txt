Daf 10a

<b>"In the diaspora, we only count according to the kings of Greece":</b> From here, it is shown that we are not concerned about the peace of the kingdom [in this context, to worry that it should be adversely affected by this]. And it appears to me that they would also count with the kings of Greece in bills of divorce, even though we learned [in a mishnah] in the chapter [entitled] HaZorek (Gittin 79b), "If he wrote it in the name of a kingdom that is not legitimate, in the name of the kingdom of Medea, or in the name of the kingdom of Greece," continuing to, "she must leave both this [first husband] and that [second husband....], and the child is a son born from an adulterous relationship [mamzer] from this one and from that one." And even the rabbis that argue with Rabbi Meir and say that the child is fit, concede that she must leave [the marriage]. Nevertheless, it is the custom to write according to the kingdom of Greece, and not to concern ourselves about the peace of the kingdom, since we see that are not concerned about it. And it should not be said that it is only speaking about contracts, and not about bills of divorce. As the whole reason for the matter is because of the peace of the kingdom, as it is explained in the chapter [entitled] HaZorek. And if they were not concerned with contracts, why should they be concerned with bills of divorce? Rather, it was customary to count from the kings of Greece for everything. And since the matter depends on the custom and we do not concern ourselves with the mishnah in Gittin, also that which we count from the creation of the world, both in divorce bills and in contracts, is fit, and we should not be concerned about any kingdom. And I found like my words written in a tosefta.

"We do not place an animal [in the inns of idolaters, etc.]" What does it mean by "the best of their money"? This refers to "the best of their money" in the Jerusalem Talmud. The verse states: "And Saul said, 'They have brought them from Amalek'" (I Samuel 15:15). One cannot derive laws from Saul’s actions because, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, "They were logs of sycamore wood." But isn’t it written: "And David purchased the threshing floor" (II Samuel 24:24)? He purchased it, but he did not offer sacrifices with it. And isn’t it written: "And Abner said to David, 'May the Lord your God accept you'" (II Samuel 3:36)? This refers to God accepting his prayer. And isn’t it written: "From the hand of a foreigner, you shall not offer as the bread of your God any of these" (Leviticus 22:25)? From "any of these," it implies that you cannot offer from such items, but you may purchase perfect animals from them and offer them. What does Rabbi Eliezer do with this? He interprets it to mean that you may purchase them with money and then offer them.
