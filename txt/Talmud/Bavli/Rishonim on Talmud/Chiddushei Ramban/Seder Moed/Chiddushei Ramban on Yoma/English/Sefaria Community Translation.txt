Daf 87b

According to the precise language, the referenced confession after eating is not the confession during the evening service, since it didn't teach, "Even though one confesses before they eat and drink, they also confess during the evening service." And they do mention [later on] the confession during "the evening service."  Moreover, when the Rabbis taught that "the commandment of confession is fulfilled on the eve of Yom HaKippurim, meaning with darkness . . ." this means after one eats and drinks, but the sages advanced this confession to before a person eats lest they become confused due to the meal.  Regarding this, they stated that even though they required one to advance the confession, the main confession was not taken from its place.  Therefore, one must confess after they eat and drink, meaning with darkness.  Now, this is not called "the evening service" in the teaching since the evening service is not proximate to when a person eats and drinks, and "the evening service" has a name to be called by [when they want to refer to it]. 
But rather this is what they mean to teach: The commandment of confession on the eve of Yom Kippur is in order to enter into the day in repentance, and this coincides with the onset of darkness, proximate to the day itself, such that there night be any time to sin between the confession and the day. But the sages were concerned lest someone become confused on account of the meal and fail, in drunkenness, to confess.  Therefore, they were stringent to require a person to confess before eating and repeat the confession in its proper time with the onset of darkness proximate to the start of the day itself, lest some sinful thing occur during the meal.  The confession of the evening service which is the confession of Yom Kippur itself is not mentioned at all in this teaching, for surely a person confesses on Yom Kippur, as it taught, "but a person confesses during the evening service, during the morning service . . ." and the entire day, lest some sinful thing happen during the course of the entire day, for Yom Kippur's onset with darkness atones.  This is the position of this baraita correctly stated . . . .
