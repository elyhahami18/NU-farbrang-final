Daf 61b








He collect half. The groom collects from her father one half. And here it is also expounded for we learn that the husband collects from her father from what the woman collects from the husband. And this is also according to the Yerushalmi Perek 4 Halakha 8, for we learn there in Ketuvot regarding this is expounded by Rav Elazar that the sons inherit and the daughters are supported, just like the sons...Also Hillel the Elder expounded from the Ketubah per the Baraita: the people of Alexandria...Rav Meir expounded common language...And we list all these sayings to teach us that we expound common language, as the expounding by Rav Elazar ben Azaria who expounded the conditions of the Ketubah as if it was biblical text, and learned from the conditions for sons to derive the conditions for daughters. And for this we see that we only expound common language from written text. This is clear, but otherwise not. And one may learn this from the Yerushalmi Halakha 3: Rav Yitzhak said that one in possession of other's money who fails to profit from it, is exempt. But in possession of other's field and fails to profit, owes his partner. The exemption by money we learn from the Baraita: to buy wheat and he does not, is only guilty of deceit. And this is meant by in possession of other's money who fails to profit from it, is exempt. And although here in this chapter we do not rule that one who gives money, does it with the same intent as we assume over there. We also rule that one who wastes the opportunity to profit from possession of other's field, owes damages. And derives it from this Mishna.  This is a difficulty for we learned just the opposite that the ruling applies when it is written, but otherwise he is exempt. But certainly all the cases of expounding common language apply to the conditions of a Ketubah, for which unwritten conditions are considered as written. And this also applies to expounding, saying that we follow secular customs and rule according to them, as if they were following the Sages. Because if they are widely spread customs, and everyone follows them, and anyone entering an agreement does so assuming common practices are followed, it becomes a rabbinical condition, even if it is unwritten it is treated as if it were written. And for this reason it is written in the Yerushalmi that one who does not make profit from other's field owes the other, even if there was no written clause, for it is the common custom. And it is asked in the Yerushalmi, what about his store or his boat? Since there was a custom to include a profit clause in the documents governing transfers of fields, would the same apply to stores or boats? This was also written by Rav Hai (Gaon) and Rabenu Chanan'el, to apply even if the conditions are unwritten. And Hillel the Elder even though he did not see his mother's Ketubah he ruled, and similarly the others. Therefore we learn from here that for all these common customs we consider unwritten clauses as if they were written. And if it is a custom that is followed in most places then it is followed in all places. And if it is only followed in a few places, then they only apply to those places. And that is why Rav Meir, Rav Yehuda, Rav Yehoshua ben Korcha and Rav Yossi made no mention of place, and Hillel mentioned Alexandria because the ruling only applies there.
