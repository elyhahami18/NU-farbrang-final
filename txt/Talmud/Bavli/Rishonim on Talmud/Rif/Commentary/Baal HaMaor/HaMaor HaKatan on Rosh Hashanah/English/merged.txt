[Side 2] […] You should know that the day and the night are not at the same time in every inhabited place, nor in all of the entire earth. As during all of the 24 hours of the day and night, at each hour, it is evening in one place and morning in another [… There are] four points corresponding to the four quarters of the day, which are the beginning of the day, the beginning of the night, the middle of the day, and the middle of the night [...] The first is the end of the East, and its inhabitants are those who dwell next to the Ocean to the East. And the second point is opposite it and it is at the end of the West, and its inhabitants also dwell next to the Ocean to the West. And the third point is the midpoint between those two first points on the face of the whole world and it is called the navel of the world. Its inhabitants are those who dwell in Jerusalem and in all of the ;and of Israel. And the fourth point, which is opposite it, is below the [dry] land. And it too is a midpoint between the first two points, and it is called the navel of the sea [...] And there is a distance of twelve hours on the face of the earth according to its rotation for each of these four points to the point across from it. And from each point to the point adjacent to it, there is a distance of six hours on the face of the earth according to its rotation. And the illustration of this is that when it will be morning for those that dwell in the East, it will only be morning for those dwelling in Jerusalem six hours after that [...] And this is the movement of the Sun in its orbit over 24 hours over these four points. And you should know that the count of the days of the week begins from the third point, which is the navel of the world, and that is the land of Israel. And the illustration of this is that when the first day of the days of the week begins for those who dwell in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel, it will only begin six hours after that for those who dwell at the end of the West [...]  and only eighteen hours after that at the end of the East [...] And this is the order in counting the days and the hours, even though the distance between those that dwell in Jerusalem and those that dwell at the end of the East is only six hours when you begin to count from the end of the East. And this is the order given to them from the six days of creation [...] And you should know that the foundation of the secret of the intercalation given over to us is from the holy mountains (alluding to Psalms 87:1), it is these two of the four points mentioned. The one is the land of Israel, and it is the holy ground within which is the holy city, and it is the place that God chose to place His name there, as it is stated about it: <i>to have [His name]; there you are to go</i> (Deuteronomy 12:5). And the other one is the End of the East, which is the beginning of inhabitation [the land mass], and it corresponds to what the prophet said: <i>And there, coming from the east with a roar like the roar of mighty waters, was the Presence of the God of Israel, and the earth was lit up by His Presence</i> (Ezekiel 43:2).
