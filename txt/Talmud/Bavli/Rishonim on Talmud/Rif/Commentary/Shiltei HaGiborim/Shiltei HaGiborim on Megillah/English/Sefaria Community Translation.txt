And they extend their hands and separate their [middle] fingers based on the Midrash: "He peers between the openings" — the divine presence is above their fingers, and He peers through the openings of their fingers. And they attempt to make five spaces: Between the two fingers and the two fingers [of each hand], there is a space, and between the fingers and the thumb [of each hand], there is a space, and between the two thumbs. [This is] to fulfill, "between the openings" [<i>hacharakim</i>, which can also be read as five openings].
