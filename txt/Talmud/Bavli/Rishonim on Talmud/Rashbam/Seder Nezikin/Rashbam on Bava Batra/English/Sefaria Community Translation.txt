Line 9

A rumor emerged concerning [Rava bar] Sharshom that he was profiting from land belonging to orphans - as it goes on to explain: it had been in his possession as collateral until now, when the years of the collateral have expired. Thus a rumor -- which was indeed true fact -- emerged, that from now on has been profiting from land belonging to orphans.
Collateral - collected from their father within the framework of the mortgage of Sura, in which they write this: "Upon the completion of these years [of the mortgage] this land shall leave [the creditor’s possession and return to its owner] without [the debtor paying any] money." [Bava Metzia 110a:8] [Rava bar Sharshom said:] I profited, during their father's life, for the years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership.

Daf 33a



Line 1

Other money with him - which he owed me, for which I did not have collateral. After the end of the mortgage term, I said [to myself], if I return the land to the orphans and ask them [to repay the other] debt that their father owed me, I would have to swear, as the Sages say that one who comes to collect, etc. Even if I would have a promissory note, they would require me to take an oath.

Line 2

 I will suppress - I will conceal it.
It is purchased - [which would be believable] since I profited from it for the years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership during their father's lifetime.
I would have been deemed credible - without an oath, since one does not take an oath concerning land; furthermore, the presumption of ownership after three years can take the place of a [sale] document.

Line 3

He said - [that is,] Abaye [said to Rava bar Sharshom,] that which you thought that if you had wanted to, you could have claimed that you had purchased it -- since it was known that [the land] was mortgaged, you cannot claim it was purchased, since it is common knowledge [i.e., a rumor based in fact constituting] testimony that the land belongs to the orphans, since now the term of the mortgage has expired. Since you knew that there was common knowledge that this land was mortgaged to you, and not purchased -- there is no "protest" [counterclaim of the original owner] greater than this, and you should have been careful about your [supposed] document [of sale]. Therefore go return the land to the orphans now, and when the orphans grow up -- that is, they become of age with regard to mitzvah observance, which iss from age thirteen and on when one is obligated in the commandments -- then litigate with them regarding the promissory note you have from their father. Swear and obtain payment according to the law of one who comes to collect from orphans' property: as long as they are underage, you may not go down to their property in order to collect from it, as was stated in Tractate Arakhin in the chapter of "Appraisal of the Orphans": "The court attends to the property of [minor] orphans only if the debt was accruing interest" [Arakhin 22a:6] and as Rava rules there, the <i>halakhah</i> is that we do not attend to the property of orphans, but if [the father] said "give" we give [Arakhin 22b:11]. Therefore we wait until they become of age, which is from age thirteen and on, as is made clear there. That which is stated in the chapter of "One who Died" that in order to sell his father's property he must be twenty years old [Bava Batra 156a:3] -- that applies when he is selling it for his own spending needs. But in order to pay his father's debts, the court may sell it from when he is age thirteen and onward. Similarly, if this had been a verbal loan [without a promissory note], litigate with them when they come of age, and swear and collect, as Rav Papa stated in the final discussion of our tractate: the <i>halakhah</i> is that a verbal loan may be collected from the heirs, providing that there are witnesses as to the loan and that [the creditor] swear that he had not been repaid -- then he may collect. [Bava Batra 176a:1]


Line 4

That man came and said, I am closer in relation - and since it is not known who is closer in relation, that man took possession of the land, since he was stronger. As Rav Naḥman said below: Whoever is stronger prevails [Bava Batra 34b:3] regarding one who said it belong to my ancestors and the other who said it belonged to my ancestors -- whoever is stronger prevails.
Ultimately - after a year or two.
He admitted to him - the one who took possession [admitted] to Rav Idi bar Avin.
Rav Ḥisda established it in his possession - of Rav Idi.

Line 5

He said to him - Rav Idi to Rav Ḥisda. 
Return to me - that man [should return to me] the produce that he consumed from that day until today -- from the day my relatives died -- since he consumed them unlawfully.
On whom are you basing your claim - in order to gain ownership of the tree?
On this - on his admission, that he is now admitting that you are the closer relative. From the fact that it was he who had been saying until now that he is the closer relative, and was consuming the produce according to the law of "whoever is stronger prevails", and it is he who is now admitting -- it is as if he is willingly giving you the tree even though you are not by law entitled to it.

Line 4

A concealed gift - a hidden gift, to be explained
We do not collect with it - because perhaps he already gave it to an other, or that he only intended to make the other feel indebted. 
Go and hide - hide yourselves
This is the text: And there are those who say that Rav Yosef said: It is referring to a case in which the giver did not say to witnesses: Sit outdoors in the marketplace. He did not instruct them to write it in the marketplace or streets, but he simply said to them write it. 
In the marketplace and outside - write it for all to see. 
The difference between the two versions is in a case where his instructions were without specification - For he said to them write it, and he did not say go and hide, and he did not instruct them to write it in the marketplace and outside. According to the earlier version of Rav Yosef the deed without specification is valid, and according to the second version it is invalid, for he has to say to them write it in the marketplace, sign it outside. And in the commentary of Rabenu Chanan'el   the text is that he told them not to sit in the marketplace or outside. But this cannot be correct for in that case both versions of Rav Yosef would imply that an unspecified deed is valid. 

Daf 41a



Line 1

What if the deed is unspecified - Because there are two versions of Rav Yosef, and there is a difference in that one implies that an unspecified deed is invalid, and the other that it is valid, we ask here, on which one do we rely in the case the deed is unspecified, he did not tell them to sit in the marketplace and outside, and he did not tell them to go and hide, is this considered a concealed gift or not. And there are commentaries that relate the question to...but I do not agree...
We are not concerned - for it is not concealed and therefore valid.
We are concerned - that it is concealed and therefore we don not collect with it. But if it used to collect the gift is not returned. There was such an instance. And that is the reason that that Rav Ashi does not say that we do not collect, but that we are concerned, since it is a doubt and the land should remain where it is. 
And the Halakha is that we are concerned - We do not collect with it, and therefore he has to write within the deed: and this is what he told us: write it in the marketplace and sign it outside. And even though he did not say this, but they wrote this in the deed, it is as if he said it, for he wanted the deed to be written according to rabbinical regulations.

If one was hung and sells- Someone hung him [e.g. on a tree] or antagonized him until he sold [something to him] and took money in return and said "I want [to sell this to you].
His sale is a sale- and he can't go back on it; and the reason will be explained later on.

But Samuel said, The law of the land is the law - All taxes, tariffs, and customs of the lawmakers of kings, who regularly lead their kingdom, it is the law, for all the citizens have accepted the king's statutes and laws of their own free will. Therefore, it is a complete law, and one cannot retain ownership over the money that belongs to his fellow according to the decree of the king, for that is theft.

Line 1

GEMARA: Stones on the sheaves - after they cut the sheaves they set them out to dry and place stones upon them so that the wind does not scatter them.
That are arranged - in the field in order to make a fence for the field.
Piled up - and even though they are not arranged, they are considered to be in fixed usage for the field, so that they are sold along with it.

Line 2

Here they interpreted stones on the sheaves - this is a kind of a "the master said" [i.e., a passage introduced by the words <i>Amar Mar</i>]: it returns to the topic in order to interpret it according to Rabbi Meir and according to the Rabbis.
According to Rabbi Meir - who states in Chapter "One Who Sells a Ship":  "if one sold a vineyard, he has sold the accoutrements of the vineyard." [Bava Batra 78b:6] We understand that he comes to disagree with the Rabbis and to say that even those accoutrements -- which, according to the Rabbis, are not sold along with a vineyard, since they are not fixed to it to such an extent -- are, according to Rabbi Meir, sold [along with the vineyard]. Therefore, we require an explanation for each of the accoutrements of the vineyard and field that are enumerated in our Mishna: how is it that they are included in the sale according to Rabbi Meir and not included in the sale according to the Rabbis. Thus, according to Rabbi Meir, these stones on the sheaves are sold along with the field, since they are prepared and available for the needs of the sheaves.
Even though they are not placed - that they were not placed within the field but rather outside the field. This corresponds with what Rabbi Meir had said, "he has sold the accoutrements of the vineyard" [Bava Batra 78b:6] -- to subordinate to the sale of the field even those accoutrements not placed within it, since they have been prepared for the purpose of the field. That which was stated earlier, "you may even say [that the Mishna is in accordance with the opinion of] Rabbi Meir: There [in the case of the vineyard, the reference is to utensils that are] fixed", [Bava Batra 65b:3] etc. -- these stones on the sheaves which have been prepared are called "fixed" even though they are not attached to the ground. Indeed, they are "fixed" for the use of this field, and it is not usual to carry them to a different field, nor to lend them out.
According to the Rabbis - who stated that not all the accoutrements of the vineyard are included in the sale, except for those which are especially set aside for its use -- [the stones] are only sold if they are placed within the field.

The time on the deed. For it is written at its beginning such and such day of Shabbat, Ploni asked us to witness and make an act of acquisition from me to Ploni my son, after my death. 
It supports it. That from time the gift started, for if you say otherwise, then the time in the deed was written for naught. But certainly it was written to tells us that it was acquired on that day. And thus the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi, for if he writes that he acquires it after death even though he does not write from today, for Rav says that the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi. And even though it is written in Gittin 85b, Rav made a ruling that divorces take effect when handed over, to exclude Rav Yossi who says it takes effect on the date on the deed. But it was not stated explicitly there in Gittin that Rav changed his mind from that which he stated that the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi.  But because it says that he made a ruling, it means that regarding divorces, since it does not involve an acquisition, for that reason he made a ruling to be more flexible because of the strict nature of sexual restrictions. But with regards to financial matters the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi. For one can say that Rav only said that the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi only for deeds that involve an acquisition. ...

Daf 136b



Daf 137a



Line 1

Here we prefer the text "it is a dispute between <i>tanna'im</i>" - and we don't prefer the text "but [the case of] 'after you' is also [a dispute between] <i>tanna'im</i>", which would imply that the answer that had been given earlier by Reish Lakish, that "[the case of] 'after you' is different" [Bava Batra 136b:11] is not [a sufficient] answer. Certainly, according to Reish Lakish, the answer of "after you is different", also used by Rav and Rabbi Hoshaya above, is sufficient, as it explains all the <i>baraitot</i> in accordance with the view of Reish Lakish -- whether according to the opinion that [the property] returns to the heirs of the giver or according to the opinion that [the property] returns to the heirs of the first -- all hold that, in general, ownership of the rights to use an item and the profits it engenders is not considered to be like the ownership of the item itself. Even that which [the <i>baraita</i>] states that [the property] returns to the heirs of the first is only because "after you is different". Rather, it is according to Rabbi Yoḥanan that the answer of "it is a dispute between <i>tanna'im</i>" is given -- that is, there are <i>tanna'im</i> who disagree about the acquisition of the profits of the first -- if it is considered to be like ownership of the item itself or not. [Rabbi Yoḥanan would say:] and I go according to [the <i>tanna</i>] who holds that it is considered to be like ownership of the item itself.
As it is taught, etc. - Rabbi holds that it is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. That <i>baraita</i> which stated that [the property] "returns to the heirs of the giver" [Bava Batra 136b:12] [conforms with the opinion of] Rabbi. Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel] holds that it is considered to be like ownership of the item itself; that <i>baraita</i> which stated that [the property] "returns to the heirs of the first" [Bava Batra 136b:9] [conforms with the opinion of] Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel]. [Since this is subject to a dispute among <i>tanna'im</i>,] I [Rabbi Yoḥanan am justified in] hold[ing] like [one of the disputants,] Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel]. Thus Rabbi Yoḥanan rules according to Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel]. On the other hand, Reish Lakish does not dispute the tenet that "ownership of the profits is considered to be like the ownership of the item itself". Rather, everyone agrees that it is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. This is what they dispute: Rabbi holds that [the case of the <i>baraita</i>, where one said] "after you" is also a general case of transferring ownership of the profits to the first person. Therefore the second person can repossess [the property] from the purchasers, and if the second person dies, [the property] reverts to the heirs of the giver, since ownership of the profits is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel holds in general that ownership of the profits is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself; here, however, the case of "after you" is different, in that both the property itself and the produce are acquired by the first person. Therefore, the second person only gets what has been left over by the first person. If the second person dies, [the property] reverts to the heirs of the first person. This is the correct explanation: at this point, one cannot ask [about a seeming contradiction] between one legal ruling [in the gemara] and another: why is it that, though we [in general] rule according to Reish Lakish that "ownership of the produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item" as was stated in the chapter "One who performs <i>ḥalitza</i>" [Yevamot 36a:15], we rule below like Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel], that in the case of "after you to so-and-so" the second person receives only that which the first beneficiary left? [Actually,] Reish Lakish would not disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan's ruling below. It is also possibly implied by Abaye's statement of "Who is a cunning wicked person? etc." [Bava Batra 137a:5] that he would agree. Similarly, later on, in the case of "a certain woman who had a palm tree on the land of Rav Beivai bar Abaye ... He then went and transferred it to his minor son" [Bava Batra 137b:6] according to the ruling of Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel], etc., up to "even Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel] says so only" etc. -- from there we can infer that the <i>halakha</i> is according to Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel]. Therefore we need to explain that Rabbi Shimon [ben Gamliel] holds, like Reish Lakish, that "ownership of the produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item", but that there is a particular reason here that [the case of] "after you" is different, and one should not ask about [the apparent contradiction] between two rulings of the <i>halakha</i>.
And the first entered [the property] and sold it and consumed - [the <i>baraita</i> is merely] choosing [to state the case in the form of] the usual way things take place: where he sells it and then spends the proceeds.
The second repossesses [the property] from the purchasers - after the first [recipient] dies, since the first's acquisition of the produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item; we do not, according to Rabbi, say "[the case of] 'after you' is different".
