Daf 11a



Line 1

<b>By those who were invited for that:</b> That the Nasi invited from the eve. 
<b>Bring me up</b> seven [men] tomorrow to the attic that is designated for the court to sit.

Line 2

<b>And I did not ascend to intercalate the year:</b> To join with you now.
<b>But rather to learn</b> from you - how you do [it].
<b>And it was due to embarrassment that he did [it]:</b> So that they would not recognize who ascended without permission and [that man's] face whiten (from embarrassment).

Line 3

<b>Who disturbed father:</b> As you ate the garlic and the smell wafted.
<b>God forbid</b> that I should eat garlic when he comes to his study hall. But it was rather so as not to whiten the face of the one who ate the garlic that I left, so that they would all leave and they would not know who he is. 

Line 4



Line 5

<b>From Shmuel HaKatan:</b> As we have said.
<b>We have broken faith:</b> But he did not marry a foreign woman. So he included himself in order to not whiten their faces. 

Line 6

<b>From Yehoshua:</b> From the story of Yehoshua, such that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not want to reveal to him who the sinner was and included them all, as it is stated, "Israel has sinned." This was in the story of Achan.
<b><i>Diltor</i>:</b> A talebearer.
<b>Do you refuse:</b> They were all included. But behold all of them did not go out to gather, but rather [just] some - as it is written (Exodus 16:27), "some of the people went out to gather, etc."

...Mishna: And these are the ones ineligible -- to be judges or witnesses
one who plays with dice -- All of these people listed are thieves who will become rashas and therefore cannot be witnesses or judges
And merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year - since lust after money is a sin from the Torah, he becomes like an evil, violent person, invalid to judge or bear witness, as he inclines after the ill-gotten gain (cf. Exodus 18:21)

Line 16



Line 17

when they have no trade but this -- people whose sole occupation is gambling are not involved in doing anything socially useful. As a result, they are unacquainted with basic business law and commerce, and have no aversion to illegal activity. However, one who engages also in some other form of occupation is not flawed in this way and remains eligible.

Line 18

Gemara: Asmachta (literally "reliance") -- term used in the Talmud for an agreement based on speculation. In general, an asmachta involves one party (or both) consenting to surrender to the other a certain sum of money, depending on the performance or outcome of a particular event. In each case, the individual obligating himself enters into the agreement "relying" that the outcome will be favorable and that he will not have to pay. Since a transfer of ownership requires that the object's owner give it willingly, an asmachta agreement is non-binding, because the obligated party never sincerely meant to obligate himself.
it is non-binding -- Rami bar Chama considers gambling an example of asmachta, because each player consents to the terms of the game only because he expects to win. Since the loser does not willingly surrender the wagered amount, the winner is considered to be stealing when he collects, and is thus ineligible as a witness or judge.

Line 19

any agreement such as this is not considered an asmachta -- a true case of asmachta involves a situation in which the man obligating himself has reason to believe that he will not actually have to pay. For example, one who contracts to work his neighbor's field and stipulates that if he does not live up to his agreement he will pay a fine, never really expects to pay, because he feels confident that he can do as promised. Another example: Reuven, a debtor, pays 50 zuz of the 100 that he owes to his creditor, Shimon. To assure Shimon that he will repay the remaining 50 zuz in a timely fashion, Reuven gives the note of indebtedness to athird party, Levi, and states that if he, Reuven, does not pay the balance by such-and-such date, Levi should return the note to Shimon, thus enabling him to collect the entire 100 zuz. Reuven does not really expect to have to pay the additional penalty, because he believes that he will be able to meet his obligation on time. Since both these cases are asmachta agreements, if the contractor is unable to work the field or the debtor is prevented from paying on time, he is not subject to the agreed-upon penalty. A wager, though, does not constitute an asmachta, because each player realizes that as skilled as he may be at the game, the outcome is nonetheless governed by chance. Therefore, he is resigned to pay if he loses, and the winner is thus not guilty of stealing.

Line 5

 
Neither one of them [became] a nazirite - Two men were sitting and a man passed by.  One said, “What’s-his-name who just passed is a nazirite!” and the other said “He’s not a nazirite! If he turns out to be a nazirite, I’m a nazirite!”  His fellow said, “If he turns out not to be a nazirite, I’m a nazirite!”  Both of them intended to take nazirite vows in the same way as one of them [intended to do so--which is to say, not at all]. Rabbi Tarfon said neither of them [became] a nazirite because his words were in jest and that is not a solemn vow; a person must make a solemn vow [to become a nazirite].  He [Rabbi Yehuda]  is explaining Rabbi Tarfon’s reasoning; that is to say, he’s laying it out even though [the opinion] is not his.  Even so, it is an asmachta [insincere and non-binding exchange] and they have not said enough for it to result in a legal acquisition.

Of Bayah the tax-collector - It once happened that Jewish tax-farmer, evil, and a great scholar died on the same day and in the same place. All the people assembled to attend the burial of the great scholar; at the same time the relatives of the tax-farmer brought his bier for burial. Enemies attacked the group, so they all dropped both biers and ran. One student however stayed there guarding the body of his rabbi. Some time later the town dignitaries returned to resume the burial of the great scholar, but the biers of the rabbi and the tax-farmer somehow got exchanged and the protests of the student were of no avail. So the relatives of the tax-farmer buried the great rabbi, which greatly distressed the student; nor could he explain to himself what great sin had caused the one to be buried in such a shameful way and what great merit in the other had brought about his interment with such honor. His rabbi appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be distressed. "Come and let me show you how greatly I am honored in paradise and let me also show you that man in hell with the hinges of the gates of hell turning through his ears. Once I heard people calumniating the sages and did not protest (and that is why I was punished); he once prepared a banquet in honor of a city dignitary who did not show up, and he distributed the food to the poor (and that is why he was rewarded)." The student asked how long the poor man was doomed to suffer such difficult judgment. "Until Shimeon ben Shatach dies," was the reply, "who will then replace him!" "Why?" asked the student; "Because there are Jewish women in Ashkelon who practice witchcraft and he does not subject them to judgment." The following day the student related his dream to Shimeon ben Shatach. The latter assembled eighty tall young men and distributed to each of them a jar with a cloak wrapped up inside (it was a rainy day). He also told them to make sure that they were always eighty in number. "When you come inside," he said, "one of you must raise his jar from the ground; from that moment the witches will have no further hold over you; if that does not work then we can never beat them." Shimeon ben Shatach went into the witches' hall and left the young men outside. When the witches asked him who he was he replied that he was a wizard who had come to test them with his wizardry. "What tricks can you do?" they asked. "Despite the fact that it is raining today I can produce eighty young men with dry talitot!" "Show us!" He went outside and beckoned the young men inside. They removed the talitot from the jars, put them on, and came in. They took each man one witch and carried them, and were able to defeat them, and hung them all up. The relatives of the witches were incensed. Two of them came forward and perjured themselves by testifying that Shimeon ben-Shatach's son had committed some crime that was punishable by death. He was condemned to death. As he was being taken out to be stoned he said, "If I am guilty of this crime may my death bring me atonement, and if I am innocent may it atone for all my other sins and the responsibility for my death will be on the shoulders of the witnesses." When the perjurers heard this they recanted their testimony and explained that they had only acted because of their animosity at the fate of their women-folk, and so he wasn't killed.

Rav Ashi says - decomposition of the flesh is not needed, rather a little of the affliction of the beatings of the grave. The reason is because they don't mourn because mourning takes effect when the grave is sealed as is explained in perek 'alu megalchin' (moed katan 3).

Daf 61a



Line 1

Prohibited - deriving benefit from the animal [is prohibited], even though its slaughter was not for idol worship. Even if its blood was not [ultimately] sprinkled for idol worship, it is forbidden. The reason for [this ruling regarding] slaughter of non-consecrated [animals] is as derived by Rabbi Yoḥanan analogously from [the law] of <i>piggul</i>, which is [likewise involving intention during] one act of service regarding another: one who slaughters the sacrifice with the intention of sprinkling its blood on the following day [when it must be done that very day], it is <i>piggul</i>.
And Reish Lakish says it is permitted - he does not derive [the law regarding] "outside" [regular non-consecrated animals] from "inside" [i.e., the law of <i>piggul</i>]: [for non-consecrated animals in the context of idol worship], intention from one service to another is irrelevant.

Line 2

This works out well - that the verse superfluously mentions slaughtering to teach a general principle [that only similar acts of service are punishable by death], and that we do not apply this exposition [of the verse's mention slaughtering being superfluous] as implying that one who has an intention from one act of service to another [renders the animal forbidden] -- works out well according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, since he derives its prohibition from [the law of] the intention of <i>piggul</i>. It is possible that one can derive the person's liability [to the death penalty for intention for idol worship in a different service while performing a service] from there as well. Thus one must say that [the verse's mention of] "slaughtering" is indeed superfluous.  But according to Reish Lakish, who does not derive [prohibition] for idol worship from <i>piggul</i>, let us say that this mention of "slaughtering" is in fact for the following purpose: that [one is liable] for intending to perform another act of service during [the present] act of service.

Line 3



Line 4

Those idolators who worship the mountains - it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> in Tractate Avodah Zarah [Avodah Zarah 45a:1] that deriving benefit from the mountains is permitted, as it is written: "their gods, upon the [high] mountains" [Deuteronomy 12:2] -- but [you are] not [obligated to destroy] the hills [themselves that are] their gods.
The ones who worshiped it by the sword - even though it is attached [to the ground], it is not forbidden; nevertheless, it is still idol worship. Here too, no verse is needed, since slaughter is necessary for the sprinkling of the blood, and this one intended during the slaughter to sprinkle [the blood for idol worship], he is therefore considered as one who performed an act of idol worship, since sprinkling [of the blood] without having slaughtered is not sufficient [as an act of service]. Therefore you are forced to concede that if [as Rava bar Rav Ḥanan proposed] "bowing down" is mentioned specifically [in the verse] to teach a general principle, it was not necessary to also write "slaughtering".

Line 5

"How do they serve" - implying that [if worshiped] in their usual fashion -- yes; not in their usual fashion -- no [this is not the subject of the verse's warning].
To exclude what - [to exclude which rite] that is not in the [idolatry's] usual fashion. Since we have derived from [the verse's singling out of] "bowing" that one is liable even for [those rites that are] not [also] services in [the Temple], [then what is meant to be excluded from the warning as a rite] that is not in the usual fashion? If we would say that it comes to exclude [worshiping] an idol with a degrading rite when its usual service is honorable -- for example, one who defecates before an idol which is supposed to be sacrificed to -- why would this verse [of "how do they serve"] be needed to exclude it?

Line 6

It is derived from bowing - which teaches the general principle that one is only liable for an honorable rite, like bowing.

Line 7



Line 8

But that which Rabbi Eliezer says: From where is it derived that one who sacrifices an animal - which is an honorable rite -- to Mercury, whose standard manner of worship is degrading (likewise for Pe'or) [is liable]? If Rava bar Rav Ḥanan is right that "bowing" teaches a general principle, why do I need this [Rabbi Eliezer's] verse [Leviticus 17:7]? It is derived from "bowing" [Deuteronomy 17:3]!

Line 9



Line 10



Line 11

To one who sacrifices in order to express insolence - and does not intend to accept it upon himself as a deity; this verse [brought by Rabbi Eliezer] teaches that he transgresses the prohibition.

Line 12

Lost his oxen - and he went to look for them.
One who says: I will worship - from the moment they seduced him and he acquiesced, he is liable to the death penalty -- as we derive later [Sanhedrin 61b:3] on from "You shall not approve of him, nor listen to him” [Deuteronomy 13:9] -- but if one approved of and listened to the inciter, he is immediately liable.
I will go and worship - though he has not yet gone, [he is liable,] even though it is possible to say as of this point that he has reconsidered [his intention of idolatry].
Let us go and worship - even though he has included himself with others, in that it is possible to say that since the others have not gone he will also not go.

Line 13

He said to him - the mishna is stating that if he [ultimately] worships it -- yes [he is liable, but if] he [only] says it -- no.
To one who states I only accept it upon myself - as a deity.
Only through worship - unless I worship it, since as long as he did not worship it, it does not constitute "approving of and listening". The latter citation [Sanhedrin 67a], which implies that he is liable as a result of a [mere] statement, is [referring to a case] where he accepts its divinity immediately; since he said "I will worship" the presumption is that he accepts it as a deity unless he has explicitly stated that he is only accepting it upon worshiping it.

Line 14

Come and worship me - he is making himself into an idolatry and is seducing people to worship him.
Deems him liable - to death, as an inciter.

Line 15



Line 16

Rabbi Yehuda says: Actually, one is not liable - for an utterance without an action except for one who is incited to idol worship, and "approves of and listens" and says "I will worship" or "I will go and worship". But in the case of one who says "come and worship me", he is exempt. It comes out that Rabbi Yehuda must have some other reason [for exempting] one who incites others to worship him, because one who is incited is liable for [mere] statements.


Line 17

One who incites to himself - with regard to one incites others to worship him, [Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree as to] if he is considered an inciter or not.
They do not listen to him - since he is a human being just like them, and even those who are liable to be seduced to worship other idolatries would not be seduced to worship a person.

A latticework of bricks: A row of tall bricks, one on top of another, with the fire on both sides. And they would pass him, but he would not burn. As it is learned later, "One who passes himself over is exempt." — hence he is alive after the passing. And that which we say (Sanhedrin 63b) concerning Hezekiah, that his mother rubbed him with salamander [blood], that was not to Molekh, but rather to the god of the Sepharvites. As there (II Kings 17:30), burning [and not passing] is written.

<b>But behold:</b> The matter of the gathering of cucumbers.
<b>Rabbi Akiva learned it from Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> By way of a question.
 <b><i>Kinuf</i>:</b> Four posts and a canopy draped over them, as we say in Sukkah (10a).

Line 2

<b>To remove the tefillin</b> of his father. As he held that Shabbat is not a time for tefillin. So it is [hence] forbidden to wear them, lest he go out with them to the public domain. 
<b>That father went insane:</b> And he is close to death. As if his mind was composed, he would have removed his tefillin.
<b>A prohibition [punishable by] stoning</b> - the lighting of a lamp and the insulation of hot water - whereas they are dealing with a matter that is only a rabbinic Shabbat prohibition. For there is no prohibition of work (<i>melakha</i>) in placing tefillin [on oneself] on Shabbat, and even if he went out with them into the public domain. As it is in the way of clothing, and it is an ornament for him on weekdays. 

Line 3

<b>At a distance of four cubits:</b> Because of the excommunication; for they excommunicated him during the disagreement about Akhnai's oven in Bava Metzia (59b).


Line 4

<b>What is his:</b> With what will be his death?
<b>Yours will be worse than theirs:</b> Because your heart is as wide as a hall; so if you had served me, you would have learned much Torah.


Line 5

<b>He raised:</b> Rabbi Eliezer [raised] his two forearms. 
<b>That are being rolled up:</b> Just like when a Torah scroll is being rolled up and the writing is concealed, so too is the Torah in my heart being hidden and concealed as I die. For they did not serve me and learn from me.
<b>And I have not taken away from my teachers, even like a dog lapping from the sea:</b> According to their wisdom, which was great, my learning only counts as having taken away and received a little wisdom from them, like a dog who laps from the sea. And likewise have my students not even taken away and received from my wisdom, to take away from the surplus of my wisdom over theirs, that which a paintbrush removes from a tube in one dip.
<b>And I have not taken away:</b> Meaning to say, I have not removed from their wisdom - such that they were greater than me at the beginning; and they are greater than me also now. For I only learned a little of their wisdom from them.
<b>A tube (<i>shifoferet</i>):</b> A tube into which one inserts blue dye. It is a cylinder of wood or of silver into which we stick a brush and dip into the blue dye and extract it.

Line 6

<b>With regard to a snow-white leprous mark:</b> With regard to the laws of the sightings of blemishes (<i>negaim</i>).
<b>With regard to the planting of cucumbers:</b> The laws of types of sorcery, through which a whole field is made full of cucumbers. 

Line 7



Line 8

<b>They said to him, "A ball and a last, etc.":</b> A ball is a <i>pelote</i> covered with leather and tightly stuffed with ram's wool inside it. And likewise their leather last was like a type of shoe filled with hair inside it, with its opening sewn [shut]. And they would make shoes on it, the way our cobblers do with a wooden mold.
<b>An amulet:</b> It is of leather, filled inside and one carries it on the neck for beauty.
<b>A small weight:</b> Like an ounce-weight that we make from lead and cover with leather, so that it not lessen (from wear). But it is not customary to cover a large weight with leather.
<b>And a string of a pearl:</b> We sew the pearl with leather and hang it on the neck of an animal for medication.
<b>What is it (its law):</b> For Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages disagreed about these in the Order of Tahorot (Kelim 23). And the Sages say [that] they cannot contract impurity, since a leather vessel cannot contract impurity unless it has a receptacle. For behold it is compared to sack. And these [items] - since their receptacle is made to fill permanently with a filling inside it - [are] not called a receptacle. But Rabbi Eliezer says [that] it does contract impurity, as a receptacle made to be filled is [still] called a receptacle. And they also disagreed about a ball and a last that tear and their hollow is visible: For the Rabbis conceded that they can contract impurity, as behold there is [now] a receptacle. But they argued about the matter of immersion. As the Sages say [that] what is inside separates [it from the purifying water], but Rabbi Eliezer says [that] what is inside does not separate, as it is all one vessel. And at the time of his death, they wanted to know if he reversed himself. So they asked him, "What do you say about those two disagreements?" He said to them [that] they are impure even intact and the impurity touches [them] from the outside.   
<b>And their purification is as they are:</b> That is to say if they tear - such that the Sages concede that they can contract impurity, but argue with me, saying that the filling separates - I stand by my words that the filling does not separate, so that we immerse them as they are. 

Line 9

<b>What is [the law with a] shoe that is on a last:</b> As they also argued about this in the Tosefta of Tahorot: The Sages say [that] since it is not lacking work that requires a craftsman - since an ordinary person can remove it from the last - it is already called a vessel. But Rabbi Eliezer renders it pure, since its work has not yet been finished [so it is not yet a vessel].
<b>The vow is permitted:</b> Since they had excommunicated him.


Line 10

<b>Between Caesarea and Lod:</b> As they were carrying his bier from Caesarea to Lod.
<b>He began in the row:</b> As they were making a row around the bier to eulogize [him]. 
<b>I have many coins</b> to exchange.
<b>But I do not have a money changer to sort them:</b> Meaning to say, I have many questions to ask, but there is no one to ask.

Do you [really] think that a wayward and rebellious son, on account of his sin, is executed - [a punishment normally given to someone] who we would require to be subject to the laws of punishment? Can it really be that he will be executed for his sin, on account of the fact that he ate a tarteimar [~ three ounces; Jastrow] of meat and drank half of a log [volume of six eggs; Frank] of wine [Rather,] as a result of his [eventual] outcome he is executed, as explained at the end of our chapter (page 72a): "...at the end, when he will [eventually] deplete his father's wealth, and will seek to maintain his [gluttonous] habit, but doesn't find [the means to do so]..." et cetera "...the Torah stated: better that he die [while still] innocent and not die [later while] guilty [of a capital crime].

<b>its head came out:</b> With a women that is experiencing difficulty giving birth and is in [mortal] danger. And it is taught in the first section [of this teaching], "the midwife extends her hand and cuts it up and extracts [the pieces];" as the entire time that that it has not gone out into the air of the world, it is not [considered] a soul, and [so] it is possible to kill it and to save its mother. But when its head came out, we cannot touch it to kill it, as it is like a born [baby]; and we do not push off one soul for the sake of another. And if you will ask [from] the story of Sheva ben Bichri - [wherein it is written] (II Samuel 20:21), "behold, his head is sent to you" - they pushed off one life for the sake of another; there, it was because even if they had not delivered him, he would have been killed in the city when Yoav would have seized it, and they would have been killed with him. But if he would have [otherwise] been saved - even though they would have been killed - they would not have been allowed to deliver him [to Yoav] in order to save themselves. And also (another answer) is that it is because he was a rebel to the kingdom, and so is it explained in the Tosefta (of Terumah).

<b>424</b> — the numerological value of "greyhound."
<b>Thigh-belted</b> — a word for the loins.
<b>Or the <i>tayish</i></b> — until it exhausts (<i>tashash</i>) its strength.
<b><i>Al-Qum</i> is with him</b> — all that arises is his.
<b> and Pinḥas didn't know </b> that the Holy Blessed One, referred to as the King <i>Al-Qum</i>, was with him, so he didn't need to wait until his strength was exhausted. And it seems to my eyes that this word is in Arabic, since all their words start with the prefix <i>al-</i>.

Crushed in the building - of the Egyptians, who put him into the building in the place of a brick as is explained in the aggadah. Moshe said to the Holy One 'You have done evil to this people! Now if they don't have bricks they place the children of Israel into the building!' The Holy One replied to him, 'They are wiping out the thorns, because it is revealed before Me that if these children lived they would be completely wicked. If you want, make a test and remove one.' Moshe went and removed Micah.
