Rashi on Bava Metzia



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

<b>Two are grasping the garment:</b> The mishnah is specifically talking about when the two men are grasping the garment, since they both have a claim to it and neither one has a stronger claim than the other. Because if only one person was holding it, the other person would have to bring a proof with witnesses that it is his; and he wouldn't be believed to take it with [just] an oath.
<b>This one said it is all mine:</b> The Gemara will explain why it taught it twice.
<b>This one swears:</b> The Gemara (Bava Metzia 3a) will explain why [he takes] this oath.
<b>That he doesn't have less than half:</b> The Gemara (Bava Metzia 5b) will explain why this oath was established with this phrasing. 

Line 2

<b>And that one says, "Half of it is mine":</b> He concedes that the half belongs to his friend, so we only judge about half of it (which is what he is claiming). Therefore, "This one says, 'It is all mine,' he swears, etc." like the first verdict (i.e.: the first case in the mishnah). [And regarding] that which they are judging about (the other half), they both take an oath that he has at least half of it, and each one takes his half.

Line 3

<b>There were two people riding, etc.:</b> It is coming to teach that riding and leading are equal in terms of acquiring an animal that was ownerless. 

Line 4

<b>When they concede:</b> The Gemara (Bava Metzia 8a) will explain [that with this,] it is coming to let us know that [in a case of] one who picks it up for his fellow, it is his fellow who acquires [it].

Line 5



Line 6

<b>Gemara - I saw it:</b> Before you picked it up.
<b>He acquired it through sight:</b> From that which it taught, "They divide it."
<b>"He teaches, "All of it is mine":</b> With complete control, since I picked it up first, and you grabbed it from my hands after I acquired it. 

Line 7

<b>But didn’t Rabbenai say:</b> In Bava Kamma (113b) in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel veMakhil.
<b>"Find it," implies it come into one's hands:</b> And even with this, [it states,] "your brother," and not an idolater. And you should not say [that] when [the Torah] excluded idolaters, it was when it did not come to the hands of a Jew; [that] that is when you are not obligated to be burdened by it and return it; but when it comes into his hands, he is obligated to return it, since his lost object is forbidden [for you to keep].

Line 8

<b>The teacher employed colloquial language:</b> Had the teacher not also said, "It is all mine," I would have said, "What is, 'I found it,' that the teacher taught? It is the language of people that the mishnah employed, and not the language of Scripture - and many people call it a found object from the time of seeing [it]. 

Line 9

<b>In general, when he teaches, "I found it":</b> In every place that we taught that one who finds a lost object, acquires it - I would have said that he acquires it from the time of seeing [it]. For no teacher made us understand that one only acquires it by picking it up. That is why we are made to understand this here from the extra [words in the] mishnah.

Line 10

<b>But doesn’t it teach, "This one,"  and, "This one":</b> Concerning, "I found it," it taught, "This one said"; and concerning, "It is all mine," it taught, "This one said." And if it was one, this is how it should have taught: This one says, "I found it and it is all mine."

Line 11

<b>About buying and selling:</b> I bought if from the hands of x. And it is only about buying and selling that we say [that] they divide [it] with an oath. For it is possible to say [that] both of them bought it and that the seller agreed to both of them. But [if] this one said, "I wove it," they would not divide it; for one of them would certainly be a swindler. So it would remain in place until Eliyahu comes.

Line 12



Daf 2b



Line 1

<b>As one can 'teach' and say:</b> He teaches himself a dispensation to grab it unjustly.
<b>He is not lacking anything:</b> He is not losing anything: It came to him for free, and even without exertion.
<b>But, buying and selling, where that cannot be said:</b> And even though this one also gave money to the seller - as we establish it later, that he took from both of them, one willingly and one against his will - and when they divide it, this one will take half of his money and that one will take half of his money; nevertheless it it a loss for him. For if he did not need it, he would not have sought it out, to buy it. And this one who is coming to divide [it] and to give half the money is unjustly causing him a loss. 

Line 2

<b>I gave money:</b> I want to give money.
<b>But a found item, where it cannot be said:</b> "Let me friend go and find another [like it]." This is certainly causing him a loss of money.

Line 3

<b>But let us see from whom he took:</b> Let us ask the seller from whom he took the money. As we learned (in a baraita) in Kiddushin (73b), "A seller is deemed credible to say, 'I sold to this one, and I did not sell to that one.'" And even though it ends, "In [which case] are these words said? When his item that is being purchased is [still] in his hand. But if his item that is being purchased is not in his hand, he is not deemed credible." For he did not pay so much attention to the thing, that he would remember; since they both pursued him with the giving of its value. [Nevertheless,] we establish [the case] there to be when he took money from both of them, from one willingly, and from the other against his will. As since it is not incumbent upon him to testify, he was not so exacting to be careful after they went away from him [to remember, from] which one he was willing and [from] which one it was against his will. But when he only received money from one, he would certainly remember him. 
<b>No, it is necessary - as he took money from both of them:</b> We follow this version: "And we do not know from which one he was willing and from which one it was against his will." And we do not follow the version: "And he did not know." As even if he did know, the seller is not deemed credible once they have gone, as it was established there (Kiddushin 74a).

Line 4

<b>Our mishnah:</b> That they are both told to swear, so one will swear falsely.
<b>Is not according to Ben Nannas:</b> In Tractate Shevuot (45a), concerning a storekeeper [relying] on his ledger, these and those come to the court in order to make an oath, one of them in vain: A homeowner says to a storekeeper, "Give my son a dinar of wheat and I will have to pay"; or "Give my laborers a sela in small coins, which I am obligated [to pay them] for their wages, and I will have to give [you] a sela." And [later the storekeeper] says, "I gave it"; but [the laborer] says, "I did not receive it." So they both make a claim against the homeowner. Both of them take an oath and take [the money they are claiming] from the homeowner. Ben Nannas said, "How is it that both these and those come to take an oath in vain? Rather, they both take [the money] without an oath."

Line 5



Line 6

<b>Say they lifted it together:</b> About a lost object, each one holds, "I lifted it first and it is all mine." So when they swear about half of it, they are swearing truthfully. And also regarding buying and selling, perhaps [the seller] agreed to both of them.

Line 7

<b>In accordance with Sumakhos:</b> In Bava Kamma (46a) concerning an ox that gores a cow and its fetus is found [dead] beside it.

Line 8



Line 9

<b>The burden of proof rests upon him:</b> With witnesses. But if not, he collects nothing. Whereas here, they divide [it] with an oath!
<b>We follow this version:</b> Granted, if you say [it is like] the Rabbis - there, where both of them are not grasping [it], the Rabbis say, etc.; here where both of them are grasping [it], they divide [it] with an oath. But if you say [it is like] Sumakhos - now, if there, where both of them are not grasping [it], they divide it without an oath; here, where both of them are grasping [it], is it not all the more so?
<b>Both of them are grasping:</b> So there is no claimant [to] remove it from his fellow here.
<b>They divide it with an oath:</b> Since it lacks collection, in that his fellow is grasping [it] - as this one is grasping all of it and that one is grasping all of it - the Rabbis do not establish [the law, such that] money may be extracted from its assumption of ownership with nothing, as we said there. [Hence] the Rabbis, who need a proof, would require them [to take] an oath.

Line 10



Line 11

<b>Uncertain and uncertain:</b> Like over there, as we learned, "The fetus was found next to it, and it is not known if it gave birth before it gored it, or if it gored it after it gave birth to it and the fetus did not die because of the goring, but rather on its own." And since each [side] is making an uncertain claim, an oath cannot be imposed on them.

Line 12

<b>Of Rabbah bar Rav Huna:</b> In the chapter [entitled] HaShoel below (Bava Metzia 100a).

Line 13

<b>A financial association:</b> A loss of money. For if this one pays unjustly, it will be a loss of money [for him]; and if we exempt him unjustly, it will come out that the [other] will be lacking the offspring of his cow. 

Line 14

<b>If there, where there is a financial association, etc.:</b> You cause a loss of money to whichever of them loses the half unjustly.

Daf 3a



Line 1

 <b>And it can be said it all [belongs] to one:</b> Moreover, per force, it is all [this] one's or all [that] one's. [Yet] in spite of this, we divide it without an oath. 
<b>Here, where there is no financial association:</b> Moreover, it can be said that both of them picked it up together.
<b>Is it not all the more so:</b> That we divide it without an oath.

Line 2

<b>And attack:</b> Grab.

Line 3

<b>Of Rabbi Yose:</b> Later in [the chapter entitled] HaMafkid (Bava Metzia 37a): Two people who deposited [money] with one person; this one deposited one hundred dinars and that one deposited two hundred dinars. This one says, "The two hundred is mine"; and that one says, "The two hundred is mine," So the first teacher said, "He gives one hundred dinars to this one and one hundred dinars to that one. And the rest of the money will remain (in keeping) until Elijah comes [to decide]." Rabbi Yose said, "If so, what did the swindler lose" - and why should he confess; behold he received his [money]. "Rather, all of it will remain until Elijah comes," so that the swindler will lose [something]. And here too, it should remain.  

Line 4

<b>As this is also comparable to the remainder:</b> As there, they were judging about the second hundred dinars, whereas [here] they are judging about the whole garment.

Line 5

<b>Belong to one of them:</b> Such that, "They divide it," may not be said.

Line 6

<b>Here, where it can be said that it all belongs to one of them:</b> And his fellow has no portion in it - is it not all the more so that he does not subscribe [to the position that] they divide it.

Line 7



Line 8

<b>What loss is there</b> to the one who does not have a portion in it, if it remains.
<b>To concede:</b> Since he does not have a portion in it, what does he take when he concedes? 

Line 9

<b>Buying and selling, what can be said:</b> Behold we establish it to be when he received money from both of them. So if we say [to] let the garment and the money remain, there would be a loss to the swindler; so he would confess the truth before he loses.

Line 10



Line 11



Line 12

<b>There, this is the reason,</b> both of them make an oath and take: Because the storekeeper can say to the homeowner, "I carried out your agency that you ordered me and gave the money to your worker."
<b>What [business] do I have with the hired laborer</b> to challenge [his claim]. 
<b>He is not trustworthy to me:</b> I do not trust him with an oath; I say that he is evil. And I do not have to trust a person with an oath against my will, unless I trusted him from the beginning, to deposit [something] with him or to make a stipulation with him.
<b>You trusted him:</b> And you are the one who fouled up, so I should not have to lose through your fouling up, such that my money should remain until Eliyahu comes.

Daf 4a



Line 1

Would you say - regarding the oath [imposed as a result] of the [two] witnesses, where he does not swear regarding that which they testified to, but rather regarding what they did not testify to. Would he swear regarding that which he denied, and not regarding that which they testified to? How can you justify being so stringent?

Line 2

From the extension of an oath due to the testimony of one witness - if he had been obligated to take an oath due to the testimony of one witness, as we have stated, and there was another claim against him for which no oath had been imposed, we may extend this oath onto him and make him swear to both of them. The extension of an oath is from Torah law, as is derived in Kiddushin [Kiddushin 27b:5] from "and the woman shall say: Amen, amen" [Numbers 5:22] -- one can be made to swear even regarding that about which the witness did not testify.


Line 3

That an oath leads to an oath - the witness only obligates him to take an oath regarding that about which he testified; it is the oath that leads to [the second] oath. Would you then say the same regarding these witnesses? They would obligate him to pay the fifty about which they testified, but there is no oath here that could be used to lead to another oath regarding the rest of the sum.


Line 4

One's mouth can prove - [that is,] one who admits to part of the claim -- he swears regarding that portion which he denied -- about which his mouth did not admit.

Line 5



Line 6

A claim and a denial - [one litigant] claims and the other denies -- those which are coming to court.

Line 7

Does not assume the presumptive status of one who [falsely] denies - he does not assume the presumptive status of a false denier because of what he denied -- maybe he has not [truly] contradicted him, since the [single] witness is not believed to render him [legally] contradicted and to cause him to assume the presumptive status of a [false] denier.
Would you say with regard to witnesses - due to the fact that he denied the entire [claim], and they testified about the fifty, he is presumed to be a [false] denier, and we shall not say that we will believe him if he takes an oath.

Line 8

One who denies a loan - whether the entire amount or a portion of it, and witnesses come and testify before he had a chance to swear.
Fit to bear witness - and we do not say he is a thief. The Torah states: "you shall not join hands with the guilty to act as a witness." [Exodus 23:1] Since loaned [money] is meant to be spent, maybe he needed to spend it, and thought "if I admit to him now, before I have the money, he will demand it from me immediately." But one who denies receiving a deposit, or even a portion thereof, and witnesses come and testify against him, he is rendered unfit to give testimony -- what right did he have to evade [the owner]? Perhaps you might say that he lost [the entrusted item] and is evading [the owner] until he can find it -- later on in our chapter we will establish that [we are dealing with a situation] where witnesses came and testified that [the bailee] has it in his possession right now.

<b>Mishna - <i>Elu Metziot</i>:</b> If he found scattered produce - their owners have abandoned them; so they are ownerless, as it says in the gemara.
Scattered coins - Since they do not have a clear identifying mark, he abandons [them], and they become ownerless. And this is the reason for all of [these items].
Bundles (<i>Kerichot</i>) - Small sheaves. [It is] like we translate "gathering bundles" (Genesis 37:7), [as] <i>mekarkhan kerichan</i> in the Jerusalem Talmud.
In a public area - as everyone tramples them. And if they had an identifying mark, it is surely destroyed.
Of a baker - All baker's bread is the same, but bread [from the kitchen] of a homeowner has an identifying mark.
From their state - As they are, when they are shorn like all of the the shearings in the state. [This is] to exclude those that come from the craftsman's home, as it is learned in the lower part (the next mishnah).
Flax stalks - <i>Ristes</i> in the language of Ashkenaz (Germany); and in our place (France), it is <i>popedes</i>.
Strips (literally, tongues) of purple wool - Combed and pulled wool, then dyed purple; and they are common.

Line 9

Found a round cake - of figs.

Line 10

<i>Anpurya</i> - it will be explained in the gemara.

Line 11

<b>Gemara:</b> And how much - is [still] considered scattered?
A <i>kav</i> - scattered in four [by four] cubits;  but in three [by three] cubits, it is not [considered] scattered. And the reason will be explained as we go.

Line 12

If in a manner of falling - If he found them in the manner of being dropped; [such] that it can be ascertained that they were not placed there internationally, but rather fell.
Even greater - than a <i>kav</i> as well; as there is no sign, [the owner] abandoned [them].
And if in a manner of placement, etc.  - he will return and take them in the future.

Line 13

The gathering on the threshing floor - At the time of the gathering of the threshing floors; and their owners thresh [the grain] and carry off the main part and leave these over.
Great exertion - to collect them.
Smaller than that -  If their scattering was in [an area] less than this.

Line 14

Because they are not of significant [value] - to him, the <i>kav</i> of produce, to exert himself for them with the exertion of gathering [them] over four [by four] cubits. 

Line 15



Line 16

Sesame [seeds] - are very small, so there is more exertion than [with] wheat; but their value is high.  

Line 17

Dates and pomegranates - are large, and there is no exertion in gathering them.

Line 18



Line 19



Daf 21b



Line 1

Despair (abandonment) that is not conscious - Something that in a standard case is abandoned when he knows that it fell from him; but when [the finder] found it, the owners did not yet know that it fell from them.
Is not [considered] despair (abandonment) - Their argument will be explained in its continuation.  

Line 2

That he ultimately despairs (abandons it) - after this one finds it. And the principle of abandonment is such as when he says, "Woe is me for the monetary loss" - as he reveals his thinking that he has despaired about [reclaiming] them.
In a prohibited [manner] that it came into his possession - For it is something that is not prone to be abandoned.

Line 3

By the tide (<i>zuto</i>) of the sea - Places on the seashore, where it is the way of the sea to return [to the shore] ten or fifteen <i>parsa</i> twice a day, so it sweeps away that which it finds there and goes. <i>Zuto</i> is an expression of largeness and expansion in the Greek language; like the sages wrote [in their Greek translation] to King Ptolemy, "and upon the exalted ones" (Exodus 24:11), [as] "and upon the zatuti" (Megillah 9a).
Or by the flooding (<i>sheluliyato</i>) of a river - when it expanded and overflows its banks and takes booty (<i>sholel shelal</i>) and sweeps away that which is found. 
The Merciful One permits it - and even when it comes to the finder before abandonment [by its original owner].
Below - in our discussion, "From where do we know that a lost object swept away by a river, etc."

Line 4

From now, that he despairs (it is abandoned) - For behold, it fell; and when he knows, his mind will no longer be upon it.

Line 5



Line 6

That is a deliberate loss - As it did not fall from him, and he knowingly placed them down [to be] ownerless.

Line 7

Prone to feel - So before this one finds it, it is known to the owners that they fell and they abandon it.

Line 8

Are heavy (literally, weighty) - A load that is heavy.

Line 9



Line 10



Line 11

"Elderly people who walk [with] a cane - Poor elderly men walk slowly with their canes, so they see each and every sheaf. And the expression, <i>nemushot</i>, is like [its usage], "shall not depart (<i>yamushu</i>)" (Isaiah 59:21) - since they feel and [then] they go. 
The gleaners after the gleaners - The expression, <i>nemushot</i>, is like [its usage], "not feel (<i>yamish</i>)" (Exodus 13:22) - as they take and feel everything from in front of them.

Line 12

And why - if abandonment without awareness is not [considered] abandonment.
Given that - concerning the poor people from here, it is abandonment with awareness; since they saw the <i>nemushot</i> walked through it. But the poor of another city do not yet know - so how is it that we are permitted it. Rather it is because their abandonment, when they do know, is [considered] abandonment from the time [the <i>nemushot</i>] left it. So it was permissible when it came to the hand of this one. 

Line 13

Dried figs - Figs that are cut off with a scalpel, such that their sap flows out; and we spread them out on the field to dry. 
And even in the side of a field of dried figs - A field in which we spread out figs to dry, as he knows that they came from them.
Permitted [regarding] robbery - Even though he did not know when they fell; since once he will know, he will abandon [them], the abandonment is from now - like Rava.
Exempt from tithes - like the law of ownerless property. As ownerless property is exempt form tithes.
In [the case of] olives or of carobs, it is prohibited - like Abbaye.

Line 14

Granted, the first clause [to] Abbaye - he can find to answer, that he knew from the beginning - as it continues to explain.

Line 15

As it teaches, olives or carobs are prohibited - And you would think it is because they are not prone to fall and it cannot be said that [the finder] knew that [the owner] abandoned [them]. So even though once he will know, he will abandon [them], it is not [considered] abandonment from now.
Its appearance proves about it - It is known whose it is from its appearance. Hence once its owner knows that it fell, he will not abandon [it]. For he will surely say, "Everyone knows that they are mine and they are not ownerless, so they will not take them."

Line 16

Becomes disgusting with its fall - Hence since he know that they fall, he abandons [them] from the beginning because of [their] disgust. As from when it falls, it is not significant to him and he renders it ownerless.

Line 17



Daf 22a



Line 1

The Jordan River -  And this is the case for other rivers. This sage (teaching the Baraita)  was sitting by the Jordan River. 


Line 2

Armed robber - He took it from him by force, and from the outset, the owner knew and despaired (of recovering it).

Line 3


They are his, etc. - The correct text is: 'They are his, because the owners have despaired.' For anything swept away by a river, like beams of wood and stones, the owners immediately become aware of it because it is something that creates a commotion (is widely known)."
This is the default case - But if it were another type of lost item, where we cannot assume that the owners were aware [of the loss], it would not belong to the finder. This presents a difficulty for Rava.

Line 4

Even if they are not chasing [after it], as well - because he relies on rescuing it tomorrow or the day after, and he does not despair [of recovering it].
Under pressure - And if they do not act quickly to rescue [the item], it will not be saved. Therefore, if they do not pursue it, as they have declared it ownerless, since they knew [of the loss] and did not save it.

Line 5



Line 6

Go to the better ones— you should have gone to the better ones to give from them to the priest.

Line 7

He did not know—thus, since when he finds out, it is acceptable to him, we say that retroactively it was also acceptable to him. And regarding the matter of despair , since when he finds out he would despair, retroactively it is also considered despair.

Line 11

Prone to being trampled - The place where the object is located is commonly trampled by people, and the object itself is low and likely to be stepped on.
It is not considered a distinguishing mark-  The owner does not rely on it as a mark. He assumes that any identifying mark has been erased due to being trampled by feet. 

Line 12



Line 13


This is the correct text: "If the lost object has no distinguishing mark and was found on private property, what would the finder announce"? - Meaning, when the finder makes an announcement that he has found a lost item, what exactly would he announce that would allow the owner to provide a distinguishing sign for it?

Line 14

He announces only the location and does not announce the specific lost item. Instead, he declares that someone lost an item in a particular place. [[The rightful owner]] will then come and specify what item was lost, saying, "I lost such-and-such an object there".

Line 15


How does Rabba explain this - Rabba, who explained that the reason for objects found in a public domain [belonging to the finder] is that they get trampled, how does he differentiate between large bundles [and regular bundles]....
And Rava, who establishes that tied bundles refer to cases where there is no distinguishing mark, what is the difference between these bundles and large bundles.

Line 16



Daf 23a



Line 1

Line 3



Line 4

 One may not pass by food and leave it lying on the ground  - One who finds food on the path is not allowed to ignore it and leave it there. Therefore, they are not trampled, because whoever finds them first picks them up.

They are concerned about witchcraft - they assume that the food was placed there due to witchcraft, intended to cause harm to those who step on it. And even though they do not pick them up, they also avoid stepping on them because of fear of witchcraft

Line 1

Three coins one atop another - what distinguishes them will be explained in the Gemara.


Line 2

GEMARA: The reason is that he found, etc. - it is there [specifically] that it is said that the produce belongs to the owner of the vessel.
But [if he found a vessel] and produce was before it - then this produce belongs to the one who finds it, even though the vessel goes to the one who identifies the distinguishing mark. [The finder] must return the vessel, but he can retain the produce; we don't say that it must have fallen out of this vessel.
Some is in the vessel, etc. - the situation proves that those [fruits] on the ground belong to this other one, and [the finder] is required to return them to whomever furnishes the vessel's distinguishing mark; similarly regarding money [that must be returned] to the owner of the pouch.

Line 3

We have as the text: If one found an item on which there is no distinguishing mark alongside an item on which there is a distinguishing mark - for example, money in front of a pouch.
He is obligated to proclaim - all of it; the money shall be given to the owner of the pouch.
The owner of the item with the distinguishing mark came and took his - [that is,] the pouch, and said that the money is not mine -- the other one [i.e. the finder] is entitled to the money.

Line 4

This [<i>baraita</i>] - in which it is stated "these belong to him".
To a container and flax - if a barrel is tipped over and flax is in front of it, it is certain that the flax did not fall out of the container, since if it had fallen out of it, there would be some remaining in it. The same goes for a pouch with money in front of it, for the same reason. That which it states that he is obligated [to proclaim his find] regarding a basket and produce, is because they will typically slide out, and all of it will fall out.

Line 1

Since from the time of the disciples of Shammai and Hillel, three generations before him [meaning Rebbi], there were great disputes regarding the meanings of the Torah and there arose the possibility of there being two Torahs amongst Israel, due to the oppression of the kingdom [Rome] and the evil decrees passed against Israel. Because of these [troubles] they [the scholars of Israel] were unable to clarify the differing opinions and settle them, until [came] the time of Rebbi. Then did the Lord give favor unto Rebbi in the eyes of the Roman emperor, Antonius, and the troubles subsided, and Rebbi was able to gather all of the scholars of the Land of Israel to him [in Beit She’arim and Tzippori]. Until his [Rebbi's] days, there were no ordered tractates [of the Oral Law]  but rather every student studied and reviewed lectures that he heard from the great men and he ascribed to them these teaching s-"this halachah  heard from this and this scholar." Now, when they all gathered together [at Rebbi's yeshivah], each of the scholars repeated what he had learned and together they worked to clarify the reasons behind disparate opinions and they settled as to which opinion was to be deemed correct. And then they ordered these opinions and decisions into tractates: the laws of torts by themselves, the laws of levirate marriages by themselves, the laws of the Temple service by themselves, [etc]. And they quoted the opinions and decisions of many scholars anonymously, for Rebbi agreed with their decisions and therefore quoted them anonymously in order to indicate that so is the halachah.

<b>If one cut [an earthenware oven widthwise] into segments:</b> An oven made out of segments. One fires [the segments] in a kiln in the way of all earthenware pottery, and then combines the segments and places sand between all of the segments.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer deems it ritually pure:</b> As this is not an earthenware vessel. Rather it is a structure like a dung vessel or a mud vessel, such that it is not susceptible to ritual impurity.
<b>And the Rabbis deem it ritually impure:</b> As they go after (base their decision upon) the segments. Their other ovens were made like big jugs with an opening above. And one fires it in the urn like other jugs and portables; except that he situates it on the earth or on a board. He then attaches plaster of clay all around it to make it thick, such that it can insulate and strengthen its heat.

And Rabbi Eliezer deemed them pure; but they brought them and burned them before him.

Line 7

<b>He wore black:</b> This is a matter (an indication) of distress and mourning.
<b>He too, rent his garments:</b> As one excommunicated is obligated to tear.
 <b>And removed his shoes:</b> Since one excommunicated is forbidden to wear shoes. This is in Moed Katan (15b).
<b>And he dropped:</b> From the chair.

Line 8

<b>Spoiled:</b> Went bad.
<b>Great anger:</b> A great plague.

Line 9

<b>Rabban Gamliel:</b> He was the leader (<i>nassi</i>). And [this] was done by his [command].
<b>So that disputes will not proliferate:</b> So that an individual will not accustom himself to disagree with the many.  

Line 10

<b>Imma Shalom:</b> That was her name.
<b>A full [month] and a deficient [month]:</b> She reasoned that it would be a deficient month and the ratification [of the incoming month] would be on the thirtieth day, so that he would not lower his head. But it was full and they did not ratify it until the thirty-first day; so she was not careful about him on the thirtieth day and he lowered his head.

Line 11

<b>From the house of the father of my father:</b> From the house of the patriarch of the family. As she was the daughter of leaders (<i>nesiim</i>), and they are from the House of David.
<b>Except for the gates of mistreatment:</b> Since [it refers to] the pain of the heart; and it is close to [causing] tears to come down.

We learned there - later on in Chapter "The Borrower" [Bava Metzia 88b]: If the borrower said to [the lender], send it to me with your slave or with your messenger.
And he sent it and it died - under normal circumstances, along the way, before entering [the borrower's] house.
He is liable - for accidents, because from the time [the lender] gave it over to his messenger according to the borrower's instructions, the borrower becomes liable for accidents. But if [the borrower] did not say "send it", but rather the lender sent it to him after the borrower said "lend me your cow" and [the lender] said "yes". He went ahead and sent it, and it died along the way -- [then, the borrower is] exempt.
And similarly when he returns it - if the borrower gave it over to the messenger in order to return it to its owner, and the the lender had not said "send it to me with so-and-so", and it died -- he is liable, since it did not reach the lender's domain.

Line 13

They taught only - that a borrower is liable until it comes back into the lender's hand
Only when he returned it during the period of its loan - where he said to him, "lend it to me until such-and-such time", and he returned it during that period. In that case, the loan does not expire until it returns to owner's hand.
But after the period of its loan, he is exempt - even if it dies in the borrower's house after the period expires, he is no longer [considered] a borrower of it.
And all those who said, etc. - the reason being, that he revealed that he no longer wants to be a bailee for it.

Daf 81a



Line 1

I completed it -- he is a paid bailee - and we do not say that the bailee is exempt since the owners knew that the term of the contract had expired and yet they did not send for and retrieve [the finished item]. Likewise regarding a borrower, even though the owners knew that the term of the loan had expired, he [would remain in the status of] a borrower.
No -  you should [not] deduce that if he said "I completed it" he would be a paid bailee; rather, the following is what you should deduce from it:
Give money - since he reveals that he insists upon his remuneration, he is [considered] a paid bailee.

But why [should be be obligated]? it is [a case of] watching with the owner: The owner of this object that was stolen was in the employ of the watchman, for also he [the guard] has a guard to him. And it is written: "If the owner is with him he shall not pay" (Shemos 22:14). And we expound later on "with him" [as] "in his employ". And even though this is written by a borrower, later we expound this also on every type of guard in Chapter "The Borrower" (Later, 95a)
And I will guard for you tomorrow: that he is not in his employ now.

Daf 89a



Line 1

Now, consider: All matters are included in muzzling - that is to say, you are forced to concede that "ox" is not meant specifically, but that all other animals are included in the <i>halakha</i> of muzzling, since we derive [a verbal analogy using the words] "ox" "ox" from [the laws of] Shabbat [Bava Kamma 54b:10]. It is written regarding [the laws of resting one's animals on] Shabbat: "or any of your cattle" [Deuteronomy 5:14]. Since "ox" is not meant specifically, why would the All-Merciful need to write it? Let it have written  [instead] "do not thresh with a muzzle."


Line 2

To juxtapose the one who muzzles to the muzzled - the man to the ox and the ox to the man, regarding that which workers are allowed to eat.


Line 3

At the time of the completion of its work - this [the time of threshing] is the time of its completion.
One who makes butter - types of cheese [I Samuel 17:19].


Line 4



Line 5

That is at the time of the completion of its work - and now is the time of the completion of its work. The <i>baraita</i> is referring to after the completion of its work, when [a worker] is not allowed to eat; for example, if the fig cakes have been spread out [to dry].
One who weeds - [at this point,] we assume that [this refers to] one who is uprooting those [garlic and onions] which are not good.

Line 6

He plucks the small ones - there are those stunted onions that will never grow large, which are called TzIB"S in a foreign language. They are uprooted from among the large ones to make more space for them to spread out. Now these would be placed into the owner's vessels, and would not be excluded [from that produce which a worker is allowed to eat] by "but you shall not put any in your vessel" [Deuteronomy 23:25], but must instead be excluded by "threshing". [The plucking of the small garlic and onions] is not during the time of the completion of their work; the main point of this activity is to improve the growth [of the non-stunted onions] since they remain attached [to the ground].


Line 7

One who separates dates and dried figs - which are stuck together; he separates them with a rake.


Line 8

To unripe dates - poor-quality dates that do not ripen on the tree. They are taken into storage in palm-frond baskets where they are wrapped tightly, heat up and ripen. [This <i>baraita</i>] refers to before they ripen; one who separates them is a worker who may eat from them, since their work has not yet been completed with regard to tithes.

Line 9

One who kneads - [that is,] once the water has been added and [the dough] rolled, it is liable for <i>ḥalla</i>, [even though] it still needs much kneading, smoothing and pounding.
One who smooths - spreads it out and coats it.
Let it be derived due to tithes - hasn’t its work already been completed for tithes? [A worker] should also not be allowed to eat during the grinding and sifting that comes before kneading.

Line 10

They were obligated in <i>ḥalla</i> but they were not obligated in tithes - From Sifrei, Parashat Shelach: As it is written, "upon your coming to the land whither I bring you there" [Numbers 15:17]. Scripture varied this "coming" from all the other "comings" in the Torah. For in all the other instances it is written "And it shall be when you come", whereas here it is written "upon your coming." [Sifrei Bamidbar 110:1]  When they entered the land they were [immediately] obligated in <i>ḥalla</i>, but they were not obligated in tithes until after inheritance and settlement, as is written, "You shall set aside every year a tenth part" [Deuteronomy 14:22] and subsequently is written "in the place where [God] will choose" [Deuteronomy 14:23] -- they were not obligated until Shiloh was chosen. That is, after the conquering and dividing as is written in Joshua.  Throughout the time of conquering and dividing, the Tent of Meeting was in Gilgal -- for fourteen years, as is stated in Zevachim. [Zevachim 118b:13]

Line 11

Is the obligation of tithes the decisive factor - to remove the workers from the law of being allowed to eat?
The completion of the work is the decisive factor - as is derived from "threshing", it makes no difference whether the time of the [obligation of] tithes has arrived or not, since tithes are not mentioned by Scripture in relation to a worker's right to eat.

Line 12

Ravina said: Combine and teach - the two <i>baraitot</i> quoted earlier are not meant to be taught individually. [That is, it is not meant] to be taught in the first quotation that "threshing" specifically implies something whose work is not complete with regard to tithes, because this would imply that if it were complete with regard to tithes [the worker] would not be able to eat; that would contradict the latter [<i> baraita</i>]. Rather, combine and teach them as one: Just as "threshing" [grain] is specifically something whose work is not complete with respect to tithes and <i>ḥalla</i> -- which are laws pertinent to [grain] -- likewise for anything whose work is not complete with respect to laws pertinent to it: if with respect to tithes alone, then for tithes; if with respect to <i>ḥalla</i>, then for <i>ḥalla</i> [as well]. This excludes one who is separating dates [from being allowed to eat], which are already complete with regard to tithes, and for which there is no later [task]. This [also] excludes one who kneads, since its work -- the latter [of work with respect to tithes and work with respect to <i>ḥalla</i>] -- has been completed.


Line 13

What about him singeing it in fire - [that is, singeing] the ears, where the fire sweetens it; and similarly with the grapes.

And if not, they will be unable to walk - There is no route for them on this side, and they are forced to go, on the other (second) bank, for in this situation, against their will, when they go alongside the forest of the non-Jew they walk on the other (second) bank, when they reach alongside me, why would they bother to cross the width of the water, and here they would find it necessary to return and re-cross to the other side when the trimmed part finishes:

Line 2

He saw a certain forest - The forest that was left (untrimmed by) Rabba bar Rav Huna, because the upper and lower (neighbours) and not  trimmed. And Rabba bar Rav Nachman did not that this was because the upper and lower (banks) belonged to a non-Jewish officer:
The hands of the princes and rulers - It is a verse in the book of Ezra (c9 v2):

Line 3

Should have his branches cut down - His children should die:

Line 4

For the construction of the city wall - Everybody contributes to the  fencing of the city walls and to erect its gates to prevent entering an hostile army :
Gates - Gates as in Berakhot (28a) lock the gates:
City gate - Sealing the city as we learnt in the Mishna above (25b) if one found behind the fence, chicks:
Do not require protection - His learning protects him as it is written (Proverbs c7 v22) when you lie down it (Torah) will guard you:
For the digging of a well - To dig a stream or ditches for drinking water:
And even from the Torah scholars - For behold they also need to drink water, and based on the name of the vessel used for drinking that is called Pasya in Aramaic it is called 'the digging of the well':

Are sold etc. - From here we see they are (considered) capital, for if they were considered produce, the Rabbis instituted that produce (belongs) to the husband:
And they grew old - Old age advanced (lit. jumped) on them before their time:


Line 2

Did we not already establish - in Tractate Ketubot Chapter 'A women who inherited assets' (79b):...
In another field - The land did not belong to her, the palm trees were in another persons field, her capital would  be entirely destroyed, if the husband would be allowed to take them:


Line 3

That document - A  document with a Syrian mortgage, (that states) 'with the completion of these years' and it does not specify the number of years:
This is the (correct) text. The creditor went ahead and consumed the produce - of the third year, before he was subpoena to court:
Land remains in in its owners' possession - Even though, he (the original owner) did not claim until after the consumption of the produce, we determine based on (ownership) of the land, and when we have a doubt,  as to who (has rights) this year, we establish the land (rights) to the (original) owner of the land and (judge) that the produce was illegally consumed:

Line 4

In the possession of the one who consumed it - Since he went ahead and consumed them, and he (the original owner) comes to extract (the produce) from him, bring a proof  that (the contract) was not for three years, as we follow (award, based on) the consumption of the produce:
Do we not establish the law is in accordance with Rav Nahman in (financial) legal matters - And Rav Nahman had said the the land is established to be in the possession of the original owner, regarding one who rented a bath house for twelve gold coins per annum, one dinar per month in (chapter) 'The borrower' (above 102b) and even if the renter came (to claim) at the end of the (13th) month, he says (Rav Nahman) the full rent (i.e. 13 gold dinar) is given to the renter in a leap year:

Line 5

This applies to a matter that will not be revealed - That means to say, we certainly follow ownership of the land, however this only applies to situation that will never (ever) be clarified, like that case [of rental in a leap year] where we are in doubt whether the first statement [12 gold coins for a year] is the applicable one, or whether the latter expression [1 dinar per month] is the applicable one:
But here the matter will be revealed - Ultimately when they bring the witness on the document to testify:
And we do not trouble the Court to (convene) twice - Perhaps the law will determine it belongs to the lender, and if we (now) extract from his possession, we will be required to retract and (re)claim from the borrower in the future:

Line 6

The lender says five years etc. - This is another case. A lender and borrower who come to court, the lender claims (says) [the land] is mortgaged to me for five years, and the document is not before us, the borrower claims (says) three years and you (the lender) have finished (consumed) your three years:
Since he could have claimed (said) it is in my hands as a result of a purchase - Outright (purchase for evermore), and I have occupied (consumed) the [three] years of (required), that establish [ownership for which thereafter no documentary proof is required] and I have lost my document:

Line 7

They do not hold of that which was stated by Rav Yehuda - And we do not say Migu [one is believed due to not making an advantageous claim], because the situation implies that he [the creditor[ is a liar, [by the fact] that he said the document was lost, as this document is not comparable to a document of sale.[The prime purpose[ of a document of sale is evidence that the land was sold to him, do we expect (to say to) a person for evermore to keep (be careful) with it [the document], the Rabbis say with regard to this, up to three years a person can be careful, beyond that they are not, [because a man will say] no (further) contention has arisen, but in this [case] he acknowledges that it is a mortgage document, the [purpose of which] is to evidence the number of years of  consumption of produce, and to claim the rights to [actually] consume the produce during those (for a number of) years, and [a person] would be very careful that it should not get lost until the years are completed and [in this case] the claim it was lost is not believed, for [all] he has done is [just] suppress [the document]:   

Line 8

Only now - The question is directed to Rav Yehuda, who stated 'if he wanted he could have claimed (said) I purchased it [that is why] it is is in my possession (hand)':
Here also [is it possible] that he is believed - Do the Rabbis enact a matter that will lead to such deceit:
The Rabbis instituted that the landowner pays (gives) the taxes - to the king:
And digs the trenches - Digs the ditch around the borders:

Before King Shapur -- It appears to me that this is the actual King Shapur who was King of Persia and was a legal expert. They said the teaching of Rabbi Shimon in the mishnah before him and he praised it, saying, 'אפריון נמטייה לר״ש' -- 'May [Rabbi Shimon] receive grace from us for this matter!' However, some say King Shapur here is [the sage] Shemuel, for in several places he is called this. However, this does not fit, for then what does it mean that 'they said [this teaching]'? If this refers to the teaching of Rabbi Shimon in the mishnah, did Shemuel not know the mishnah? And if this refers to the teaching of Ephrayim the Scribe, if Resh Lakish had not said that the law accord with Rabbi Shimon, did Shemuel not know the law well enough to praise Rabbi Shimon before hearing in the name of Resh Lakish that the law accords with him?
'Apiryon' (אפריון) -- 'our grace.'
