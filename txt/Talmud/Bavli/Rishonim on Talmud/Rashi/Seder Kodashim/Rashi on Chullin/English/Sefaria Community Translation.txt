Rashi on Chullin



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

<b>MISHNA: Everyone slaughters</b> - Everywhere that [the tanna] teaches "everyone," in each instance he brings the halacha from the beginning of tractate <i>Arakhin</i> and explains (Arakh. 2a:4), "Everyone  [makes valuations], to include whom?" And "everyone slaughters," which is taught in the Mishna, the <i>amoraim</i> argue about it in the Gemara to [ultimately] say, "to include an impure person [slaughtering an animal] for mundane use," and to say, "to include a Samaritan or a heretic."
<b>And all of them</b> - In the Gemara it is explained who are "and all of them."

Line 2

<b>GEMARA: 'And their slaughter is valid' -- after the fact</b> - This is a question (i.e., the Gemara is questioning whether "and their slaughter is valid" actually means "after the fact").

Line 10

<b>Ginai:</b> The name of the river.

Line 11

<b>The will of my Maker:</b> All the streams flow to the sea by decree of the King.
<b>It is uncertain [whether you] will perform:</b> Lest they not give you [the captives] for the ransom. 

Line 12

<b>As he is engaged in the commandment:</b> As it is written (Exodus 12:17), "You must guard the matzot" - as [the wheat] requires guarding for the sake of the matzah from the time of the grinding and the sifting.
<b>Who was with them:</b> He attached himself to them on the journey. 
<b><i>Tayya</i>:</b> An Arab merchant.
<b>That is what one does:</b> By way of a question. 
<b>To those who accompany</b> as part of the group. We leave them and go?  

Line 13

<b>Perhaps here too, one time:</b> Rather he was afraid, lest the waters return and flush down the [other] two. So he was speaking to the [water], that the river should wait for them.
<b>As Moses and the six hundred thousand</b> for whom the Red Sea had parted.

Line 14



Daf 7b



Line 1

<b>They threw it down:</b> They threw it down in a sieve to clean it. <i>Vaner</i> in [Old French]. And it should not be said that it is an expression of threshing, such that it was at first in its shells. As, if so, why did it not eat it at first? Behold, it did not become obligated for tithing until it is flattened on the threshing floor, as it is written (Deuteronomy 18:4), "The beginning of your grain." And it is taught explicitly (Peah 1:6), "One may feed domestic beasts, wild animals and birds [and be exempt from tithes] until he flattens (the threshing floor)." For any eating of animals is considered a casual eating (which is exempt from tithing).
<b>They separated it</b> manually from the stones and the chaff.


Line 2

<b>And is one obligated:</b> Did they at all decree <i>demai</i> on animal food purchased from an ignoramus? And even though if [the seller] certainly did not tithe it, [the buyer] would be obligated to tithe it; it was not decreed, however, when there is [only] a doubt. As it was taught, "One who purchases [grain in the market] for sowing or for feeding an animal" - even though seeds and animal food are included with all grain and are obligated for tithing - they did not decree <i>demai</i> upon them. As, in general, most ignoramuses tithe, so the Sages were not so stringent about <i>demai</i>.
<b>For hides</b> to process them.


Line 3

<b>And it is taught:</b> By way of a statement. And they initially bought this barley for a person. 

Line 4

<b>Rabbi heard</b> that Rabbi Pinchas was coming.
<b>Your desire is to dine with me:</b> Is it your desire to dine with me?
 <b>His face beamed:</b> He was happy, since Rabbi Pinchas was not accustomed to benefitting from that which belonged to others - as per the below.

Line 5

<b>He said to him</b> - Rabbi Pinchas - "And did you hold that deriving benefit from the Jewish people is forbidden to me by vow."
<b>The Jewish people are holy:</b> So it is fitting to derive benefit from them.
<b>But there is one who wants</b> to give benefit from what is his to others, but he does not have the ability in his hands. So I do not want to derive benefit from him, so that I do not burden him.
<b>And there is one who has</b> the ability in his hands to give benefit to others; yet even though he says, "Come and dine," his heart does not desire [it]. So I do not benefit from him on account of it being written, "Eat not the bread of him that has an evil eye."
<b>Eat not the bread:</b> Do not dine. Bread is a term for a meal, as it is written (I Samuel 20:27), "did not come [...] to the bread"; and it is written (Daniel 5:1), "King Belshazzar made a great bread."
 <b>As one who has reckoned (<i>shaar</i>):</b> It is as if you open a gate (<i>shaar</i>) in his stomach. But some say it is a term of bitterness, as in (Jeremiah 29:17), "like bitter (<i>shoerim</i>) figs."


Line 6

<b>I am rushing (<i>mesarheivna</i>):</b> It is an expression of frenzy and quickness. That is to say, I need to hurry and go to a matter involving a commandment, so I have no time to dine.


Line 7

<b><i>Kudneita</i>:</b> Mules, and they belonged to Rabbi.
<b>The Angel of Death:</b> Once it strikes, the wound cannot heal, as per the below.

Line 8

<b>And before the blind, etc.:</b> As just like they are forbidden to you, so too are they forbidden to others. And behold it cannot be said that he would sell them to idolaters, as we learned (Avodah Zarah 14b), "We may not sell them a large domesticated beast."

Line 9

<b>I will declare them ownerless:</b> I will send them away into any of the forests to be ownerless.
<b>You will thereby increase the damage:</b> As since they will not be guarded, they will increase their damage.
<b>I will remove:</b> So that they will not be able to kick. And there is no [violation of], 'do not destroy' - as they would [still] be fit for threshing. 
<b>I will remove:</b> He would remove their hooves, but they would still be able to walk.


Line 10

<b><i>Mevatash</i>:</b> Plead. And its colleague (another example) is in Shevuot (30b). We teach the version, <i>mevatash</i>, with a [letter], <i></i>, and not with a <i>kaf</i>.
<b>A mountain rose between them</b> and separated them.
<b>During their lifetimes</b> - of the righteous - the Holy One, blessed He, pays attention to their desires, so as not to change their minds. For He caused this thing, that he should enter by the gate of the mules, so that he separate and not change his mind from at first, as it is was not his way to dine from that which belonged to others - as per the below.  
<b>All the more so:</b> As behold, they are greater [after] their death than in the their lifetimes, as Rabbi Chama said.
<b>They were burying a man:</b> He was a wicked man, and he should not have been buried next to the righteous. 
<b>And as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived:</b> Yet in his lifetime, when he wanted to revive the son of the Shunamite woman, he needed to place his mouth over his mouth and his eyes over his eyes and request mercy.  

Line 11

<b>And perhaps it was to fulfill the blessing of Eliyahu:</b> For it would be insufficient if it was not fulfilled; as it is written about the righteous (Job 22:28), "You will decree and it will be fulfilled." So it was not for the sake of Elisha.
<b>A double portion:</b> Eliyahu revived the son of the Tzarfit woman and Elisha revived the son of the Shunamite woman. So he needed to revive still another.
<b>If so:</b> In order to fulfill the blessing of Eliyahu.
<b>This is that which was taught:</b> By way of a question. And if it was for the sake of Eliyahu's blessing, he should have truly revived him, like the one that Eliyahu revived. Rather is it not that we understand from it that it was for the sake of Elisha. And Elisha only needed to remove him from being next to him. So he revived him until he was removed from there. 

Line 12

<b>Please, let her not be as one dead:</b> This is written about the <i>tzaraat</i> (skin ailment) of Miriam. 

Line 13

<b>Why are their names called</b> - of the mules - <i>yemim</i>, as it is written (Genesis 36:24), "who found the <i>yemim</i>."
<b>None have asked me:</b> Rabbi Chanina was a physician. And in Tractate Yoma (49a:10) in [the chapter entitled] Hotziu Lo, they bring it from here (that he was a physician).
<b>And survive:</b> It is implied that the one struck dies.
<b>And healed:</b> [The verb] is in the feminine, and it is referring to the wound (and not the man), as the wound does not heal.

Line 14

<b>There is none else beside Him:</b> This is mentioned for on account of Rabbi Chanina (since he was just mentioned above).
<b>Even sorcery</b> is not beside Him, meaning to say, without His will. For if there is no decree upon a man, evil cannot be done to him.
<b>Try:</b> She was trying and applying herself that he not [notice].
<b>To take dust</b> and to do sorcery to him and to kill him.
<b><i>Keshafim</i>:</b> It is an anagram: <i>Makchishim pamaliya shel maalah</i> (Contradicting the retinue of the Above). As they did not decree about this man, that he should die through sorcery. 

Line 15

<b><i>Nokef</i>:</b> Hurt; <i>acoper</i> in [Old French].
<b>They declare:</b> They decree about him.
<b>Appeases:</b> Atones. 
<b>Right thumb:</b> Since it is hurt with power, so that one experiences much pain.
<b>With regard to a second wound</b> before the first wound is healed.

Line 16

<b>Broke [bread]:</b> The blessing of <i>HaMotzi</i> (over bread). As he did not want to eat [even] the measure of an olive (<i>kazayit</i>) from that of others.

Daf 108a



Line 1



Line 2

Mishna: A drop of dairy that falls upon a piece [of meat] - Inside the pot upon one piece [of meat among several] and it the pot is not stirred; it [the pot] will not acquire the taste of the drop, rather only the piece by itself.
If it [the drop of dairy] gives taste to a piece [of meat] - that is to say; [if] the piece of meat by itself is not 60 times larger, to nullify the drop, the piece is immediately forbidden.  And the remaining pieces in the pot are not discussed by the Tanna of our Mishna.  The Gemara argues if the piece returns and makes [all pieces] forbidden or not.
Stir the pot - Stir it immediately before the piece [of meat] receives taste from the drop [of dairy] because it will have been stirred, the drop, with everything.
If there is a drop of taste into the pot - That is to say; the drop has no strength to make everything forbidden, unless it gives taste to the whole pot.

Line 3



Line 4

That if you should think - in all other prohibitions [deriving from] its taste are from the rabbis ["derabanan"] and we do not learn them from [the Torah prohibition against] milk in meat.

Line 5



Line 6

Rav said - This is because we learned in the Mishnah "if a drop of milk falls on a slice of meat and imparts a flavor to it" it invalidates the whole pot, since that piece itself becomes entirely prohibited and prohibits the other pieces. Even if they consist of [enough volume] to nullify [the drop], they are all prohibited.
Because they are the same type of substance - Rav holds like Rabbi Yehuda who said that min b'mino does not nullify.

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9

In a thick broth - [with] finely [cut] meat [throughout], and fat [in it], such that the entire [broth] is [considered] a type of meat.
