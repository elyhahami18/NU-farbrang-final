The way of benches &gt; place of benches that merchants are sitting and there it has the name carmelit on it and it's not walking in the public domain. 
liable &gt; since you are not standing in the place of benches and not REST there with a rest on the ground but rather in the square

Line 10

where do we find a case as such &gt; there is another domain as INTERVAL in between and this makes you LIABLE? Perhaps the torah would only make you liable if you explcictely from a private to a public domain

Line 11



Daf 6a



Line 1

It's LIKE one who is carying the object into the public domain &gt; more than 4 amos and AS LONG AS that he doesn't put it down, he would be exempt and when he puts it down he is liable and even though IN BETWEEN (the two places) walking between (the place he picked it up) and between (the place he put it down).  

Line 2



Line 3

4 amos form beginning to end&gt; EXACT? amot

Line 4

if he would take it outside the 4 amot and put it here, that's moving it 4 complete amot ?

Line 5

on the side of the public domain&gt; from private domain to public domain for example a courtyard that is BROKEN UP (open) on one end to public domain that is the place where the wall would have been is considered sides of the public domain. They argued about it rebbi eliezer and the rabbi's in eruvin (perek col gaggot) and the rabbi's say because there is not considered like a reshut harabim and even so where you take out from private domain to public domain that way you are liable.

Line 6



Line 7


where they are stakes &gt; that you BANG small nails in front of the wall they should up against the waggons and the carriages and we don't want these vehicles to rub up against the wall and knock it down 

did you ever that he say that it is a reshus harabim where there are stakes/spikes and even if you TAKE out to the public domain through this way you are liable.

Line 8



Line 9



Line 10



Line 11



Line 12



LATER ON we ask on account of these sea, valley did we not teach carmelit already (by those) above)?

Not like the banners in the dessert (during the time of moshe)  as it was not MADE for the going of the PUBLIC 

Line 13

A lot of houses which are open to the courtyard and the courtyard is open to the public domain, and the occupants of the courtyard exit through the courtyard to the public domain
one end is closed and the courtyard is open to it and the occupants of the courtyard are exiting through the alley to the public domain
all the houses in the courtyard are TOGETHER (by an eruv) with bread and so in the subject of alley if it's the eruv chatzeirot that are open to the alley can be Together (in an eruv)

because of the house that is set aide for one OWNER and the courtyard is an DOMAIN for everyone and we find the carrying fropm domain to domain even though BOTH OF them private domain, to make FENCE around the torah to DISTANCE in order exit private domain to public domain and these things are part of the categorizing (divinding) the 4 domains because whether eruv or not it's private domain and carrying from inside to the public domain you are liable.   

Line 14

batel to the private domain and the public domain
as long as you are not taking etc &gt; you would treat the ossur of shabbos LIGHTLY lechatchila, to cause tohe carrying private domain to private domain and  it;s decreed against, perhaps i would come to be mekel and take out directly from private doain to public domain.

Line 15

end of our discussion
even though it's from the private domain as we said above in a fence of 10 high and 4x4 this will become a domain by itself and you can not take from the house to there and later on it will be explained 

Line 16

opposite sides of the public domain

Daf 6b



Line 1

a stick on each side &gt; on two corners of one of the houses (ie. the corners of house), to remind you MERELY. Because rabbi yehuda is holding 2 walls is already considered by the torah private domain and but in here there are walls that are very valid/good that are considered as walls of the two houses

Line 2

in the beraita they say we are allowed to make a eruv in the public domain this way TO MAKE private domain, this would apply to take IT SHOULD BE permitted to take inside like it was taught we can not make an eruv in the public domain in this way because it's decreed against because it's similar to a public domain
...and the name of private domain is on it
full fledged (the top of the wall in the beraita is only full fledged private domain), meaning to say it's completed in the counting of the walls of its house that has walls on every side , for example a ditch and so too a fence that we say in the four sides THE WALL GOES UP in front of the walls over its top and we find the head is encirceled on four sides and the open area in the middle is 4x4 but we would say to rebbi yehuda it doesn;t have complete walls and you don't have the full number of walls so it's not a private domain at all     

Line 3

Interposing (went in the middle)&gt; through the LITTLE WALLS in perek B in eruvin the SAGES are mekel because the people went up for the festivals in the waterpit in the public domain and the waterpit a private domain that has a depth of 10 and width of 4 and and if you fill up from it and place the water on the side of the pit you are liable and the sages were mekel  to make 4 little corners/walls in between which is 10 amot that is INSIDE a private domain to fill up from the pit and said rabbi yehuda if there was INTERPOSING, you move the public domain where the public comes from from between these walls, because IF YOU NOT It would nulify the walls and over there we are ask a stira on rabbi yehuda above that that you can put and carry in between two houses that over the public would go through and not nullify the walls (even if the  public goes through it is still private domain)  and we ask a stira from rabannan on rabannan (because here they allow it to carry 4 amot or more as it's a yachid even though the public passes and over there not) and the gemora gives an answer.

no need for it &gt; meaning that we teach is a publid domain but if the public goes between the corners of the little wall, not it would be public domain since and this is there 4 walls.

Daf 7a



Line 1



Line 2

ulla (עולא) &gt; because it says why is it called a private domain etc.? what's the reason he doesn't say that for example it has walls and it's a full fledged private domain what the BERAITA is saying. AND he GOES after his OWN SAYING that he says that if you throw into it you are liable
(ורב אשי) rav ashi &gt; to tell you that it teaches private domain. AND if it would have been A CARMELIT (ie. with no walls) the tana would not call it a private domain, 

Line 3

(אטו כולהו) Aren't they all&gt; these, the sea, the valley and the benches all carmelis that it's mentioned in the counting of domains? But it was taught not like private domain not like public domain, and you can't take out, etc..  we learn from this, it's the third domain 
(לא נצרכה) we only need to mention&gt; carmelit that is is taught rather to include another kind of carmelis for example keren zavis (corner) that the house enters into (the public domain) and he LEFT OVER some of his ground to be used a public domain
(לא ניחא תשמישתיה) not pleasant to use it &gt; that you not able to enter in it explicitely by the way of going. Alternatively the front of the house stands DIAGONAL that one of its's corners adjacent to the public domain and the second corner is pulling from the public domain and in front of the corner sticks out HOLDS BACK the public from GOING in explicitely (straight) to the area of the corner (that is pulled back)   

Line 4

(בין העמודים) between the pillars: that they are standing in the city square and hanging in them the merchants hanging on them their goods and also the benches are in front of them for the merchants to sit.
(לא מסתגי להו להדיא) they can not straight through: they are many pillars in the length and the width and not lined up together (this one next to that one).

Line 5



Line 6

(לבינה) to the brick, normal brick with width of length  of 3 tefachim and the thickness has no measurement. some of them are thick and of them are thin.

...(חייב) - if you throw four amot because it will be like it is resting in the public domain because anything below 10 tefachim is the public domain, ONLY if it should come to rest below 3 tefachim because it it will be like resting on the ground or in the air LIKE THIS case because it got stuck to the wall and like we say in the mishnah (100a) later on one who throws 4 amot in the walll below 10 tefachim it is like he threw on the ground and therefore he is liable 

Line 7



Line 8



...if you say that if it has a walls&gt; for example a valley that is surrounded by a fence and has more than two sea contained in it and it's not surrounded for someone to live there 



only 4 amos  &gt; since the walls have not a height of 10 tefachim it's a carmelis. we see it's the opposite of what we thought

Line 12

<b>[If] it becomes extinguished:</b> The Channuakah light.
<b>One is bound to it:</b> To fix it. Hence he needs from the outset to make it proper, lest he be negligent and not fix it [if it goes out].
<b>And it is permissible to use its light:</b> Hence it is forbidden on Shabbat, lest he tilt [it] (to prevent it from feeding fuel to the fire) for the sake of [another] use.

Daf 21b



Line 1

<b>One is not bound to it:</b> Hence it is permissible during the week.
<b>And it is for forbidden to use its light:</b>: Such that it be recognizable that it is the light of a commandment, and there is no concern about tilting. 

Line 2

<b>And he did not accept it:</b> Since they were not considered [reliable enough] to rely upon their words.
<b>Had I merited:</b> If I had merited to learn it, I would have have taught it when I heard it at first.
<b>The teaching of one's youth</b> is preserved better than that of old age.

Line 3

<b>For its measure:</b> That there should be this measure of oil in it. However if it was extinguished, he is not bound to it.

Line 4

<b>The traffic of the <i>tarmoda’ei</i>:</b> It is the name of a nation of wood collectors. And they stay in the marketplace after the people of the marketplace go to their homes after dark and light the fire in their homes. And when [the latter] need [more] wood, they go out and buy [it] from them.

Line 5

<b>A light for a person and his household:</b> One light on each night. And  it is sufficient for a man and all the members of his household with one light.
<b>And the <i>mehadrin</i> (those who seek to beautify)</b> the commandments do one light for every night for each of the members of the household.  

Line 6

<b>Corresponds to the incoming days:</b> Those that are to come in the future.
<b>The outgoing days:</b> That have already left; and the one in which he is situated is counted with the outgoing ones. 
<b>The bulls of the festival:</b> They continue to decrease in the sacrifices of Parashat Pinchas.
<b>We elevate in sanctity and we do not downgrade:</b> We learn this from a verse - in Menachot (99a) in the chapter [entitled] Shtei HaLechem. 

Line 7



Line 8

<b>On the outside:</b> [This is] in order to publicize the miracle. And it was not in the public domain, but rather in the courtyard; as their houses were open to a courtyard.
<b>And if he lived upstairs:</b> Such that he does not have a place in his courtyard, to place it there... 
<b>He places it</b> inside, in front of the window to the public domain.
<b>Of danger:</b> Since the Persians had a law on their holiday, that they should only burn a lamp in their house of idolatry, as we say in Gittin (Chapter 2 - Gittin 17b). 

Line 9

<b>Another light:</b> To make the thing noticeable.
<b>But if there is a bonfire:</b> A fire. [Then] there is no need for another light, since one will use the light of the bonfire, so it will be noticeable that the [Channukah} light is for the commandment. 
<b>But if he is an important person</b> who is not accustomed to using the light of a bonfire...
 <b>He must have another light:</b> For if not, it would not be noticeable. 

Line 10

<b>What is Hanukkah:</b> For which miracle did they establish it?
<b>With his seal:</b> Hidden and sealed with his imprint, so he recognized that they had not touched [the oil].
 <b>This is [the version] we should teach, "And made them holidays with Hallel and thanksgiving":</b> It is not that work is forbidden on them, as they were only fixed with regard to reciting Hallel and saying, <i>Al HaNissim</i>, in [the blessing of] thanksgiving (in the daily prayers).  

Line 11

<b><i>Gatz</i>:</b> A spark, <i>etincelle</i>.
<b><i>Patish</i>:</b> A large blacksmith's hammer.
<b>The camel owner is liable:</b> As he should not have made such a large load that it would enter into the store.

Line 12

<b>By the Channukah light, he is exempt:</b> [Meaning the] storekeeper. As he was allowed to place it there to publicize the miracle. 
<b>That is to say:</b> That which was taught, "By the Channukah light, he is exempt."

Line 13



Daf 22a



Line 1

<b>Invalid:</b> Since the eye will not master (notice) [things] above twenty cubits, and there will be no publication of the miracle. 
<b>Sukkah and alleyway:</b> Since we learned (in the Mishnah) explicitly in Eruvin and in Tractate Sukkah, that they are invalid.

Line 2

<b>It is a commandment to place it</b> in the courtyard or the public domain a handbreadth away from the entrance. As if he moves it further from the entrance, it will not be noticeable that the head of the household put it there. 
<b> On the right:</b> When he enters his house, it is to the right.
<b><i>Mezuzah</i>:</b> It is established for us, that it is on the right. For it is written, "your house" (<i>beitekha</i>) - [and expounded to mean,] the way you arrive (<i>biatekha</i>); and when a person raises his foot, he raises his right foot first.

Line 3

<b>To sort:</b> To count.
<b>With that which he spilled:</b> With his hand with which he spilled, and not with his foot.

Line 4

<b>Decorations of a sukkah:</b> Fruit hung in it for decoration.
<b>Master of Abraham:</b> It is an expression of wonderment.
<b>Depend:</b> Sukkah, which was taught explicitly in a baraita, as it will explain ahead [was made to depend...]
<b>On that which was not taught:</b> On the Channukah light, as it is [only] a statement of Rav Assi, and it is not a baraita.
<b>And decorated it with <i>keramim</i>:</b> He decorated it with colored curtains, that are called <i>ovrez</i>.
<b>He stipulated with regard to them:</b> In Tractate Beitzah (30b), [this case is] established to be about one who says, "I will not separate from them during all of the twilight of the sanctification of the first holiday," such that holiness does not latch on to them. But another stipulation does not work.
 <b>The paradigm of them all:</b> From which all of them are learned.
<b>Blood:</b> The covering of blood. For we extract it from a verse, "and he shall spill [...] and he shall cover." And there the reason is explained - that the commandments not be contemptible to him.

Line 5

<b>From one lamp to another lamp:</b> [Lamps] of Channukah, as its reason will be explained later. 
<b>Untie:</b> To take the <i>tzitzit</i> from an old cloak (<i>talit</i>) to a new cloak. And in Menachot, it explains the reason of the one that forbids [this].
<b>The law is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon:</b> Since he said [that] something that one did not intend is permissible, even though he made a ditch - which is a derivative of plowing or building. And because the law follows Rav regarding prohibitions in the whole [Talmud] except for these three, they are mentioned together.

Line 6

<b>All matters of the master:</b> (The master being) Rabbah bar Nachmani.
<b>We teach the version,</b> "To make a furrow."

Line 7

<b>The reason for Rav:</b> [He prohibits it] from one lamp to [another] lamp, due to contempt for the commandment. For he lights a wood chip that is not part of the commandment from a lamp of the commandment and lights the rest from it.
<b>He weakens it:</b> As it appears like one who is taking light and drawing away some of the vitality of its oil. 
<b>From lamp to lamp:</b> He brings one lamp next to the [other] lamp, and they are both of the commandment; and [he does] not [do it] with a wood chip.

Line 8



Daf 22b



Line 1

<b>Second tithe:</b> Dinar-coins through which he redeemed second tithe may not be weighed against mundane dinar-coins (as a counter-weight) to see that they are undiminished (that their weight is a complete measure).
<b>Granted, if you say [that] when Rav and Shmuel disagree, it is from lamp to lamp</b> in actuality and not with a wood chip, and it is about this that Shmuel permits, since he is not concerned that he weakens it; but with a wood chip, he concedes. Then this is no refutation. For the body of these dinar-coins of the mundane are not [of] a commandment. And even though they are needed for a commandment, they are similar to the wood chip. However if you say Shmuel also permits [it] with a wood chip - since it is [for] the need of a commandment - then it is a refutation. For [the Tosefta] forbade to weigh [the coins], even though it was for the need of a commandment.
<b>His weights not be precisely equal:</b> Lest he not find them to be good; or he find them to [weigh] more, and spare them and not redeem the tithe upon them. So it comes out that he showed contempt towards the tithe without a need.
<b>And render them unsanctified:</b> Meaning to say, he will leave them unsanctified, as they are. 


Line 2

<b>The western lamp:</b> According to the one in Menachot who says the branches were laying east and west, the second lamp from the outside which is on the eastern side (which is west of the lamp next to it) is called western. And according to the one who says that they were laying north and south, the middle one is called western, since its opening is towards the west, and all the other lamps are towards the middle [lamp], as it is written (Numbers 8:2), "towards the face of the candelabrum" - which is the middle - "they shall give light, etc." The ones of the north were facing to the south, and the ones of the south were to the north. Lamps are <i>loces</i> of gold, in which we place oil and wicks.
<b>Like the measure of the others:</b> Half a <i>log</i>. They measured it [to be sufficient] for the long nights of the Tevet season. And if it is [still] lit during the day (and the night) during the short nights, let it be lit. But not less, that it not become extinguished in Tevet at night - for the Torah stated (Exodus 27:21), "from evening to morning."
<b>And he would light from it</b> the lamps in the afternoon.
<b>And with it he would conclude:</b> This is the ordering (cleaning) of the lamps. As it lit the whole day and he does not order it until the evening. And this teaching is taught in Torat Kohanim. And it holds that they were laying east to west. And so was it taught before it (Sifra, Emor, Section 13:7), "'To raise a light always' - so that the western light [burn] continuously, as he would begin with it and end with it." And since it is not written, "to raise lights" - we understand from this that one lamp is fixed, to begin with it every day. And that is the western lamp - the second one from the east. And thus do we learn (Tamid 33a), "He entered. [If] he found the two eastern lamps burning, he would remove the ash from the easternmost lamp. But he would leave the western lamp burning, as from that lamp he would kindle the candelabrum in the afternoon. If he found that it was extinguished" - such as when Shimon the Just died -  "he would kindle it from the altar of the burnt offering." And it appears in my eyes that the Rabbis said that its being fixed was the second lamp, was because we do not pass over commandments. But when he came to the [Temple] chamber, he first encountered the first [lamp], yet he could not begin with it, since it is written, "shall arrange it [...] before the Lord." [Still] there needs to be one external to it. For, if not, we do not call it, "before the Lord." And thus do we say in Menachot (98b), "It is written about the western lamp, 'before the Lord.' This implies all [the others] are not before the Lord, etc." And he would finish the ordering with it. For he would order the rest in the morning, but he would order this one in the afternoon. And he would hold the old one in his hand or place it in a vessel until he would place the oil and wick and light, and [then] light the others from it. And that which we say in Seder Yoma (33b) - "The arranging [of the candelabrum] is five lamps before the two lamps," implies that he would arrange all of them in the morning; and it learns this from verses - that is when no miracle existed, and he would find that it had been extinguished. For the verse does not rely on a miracle. But all the time that Israel was beloved, it would burn the whole day. And that is its testimony.
<b>But isn’t it that here, since the lamps were fixed</b> in the candelabrum, and he was not able to remove the western lamp to light the others from it - perforce that which is taught, "he would light from it," cannot be that he did not use a wood chip. 
<b>And lit</b> the wood chip from the western lamp. And he would light the rest from that wood chip.

Line 3

<b>It was with long wicks:</b> All of the wicks went out from their lamps until they reached one another. So he would light the one next to it from it; and the others, one from another.
<b>Ultimately, according to the one who said, etc.:</b> As behold, according to him, from lamp to lamp is forbidden.

Line 4

<b>If kindling accomplishes the commandment:</b> If the commandment of Channukah is dependent on the lighting, we may kindle [from one to the other], as we find with the [Temple] candelabrum.
<b>But if placing the lamp  accomplishes the commandment:</b> So the main commandment is dependent upon the placement.
<b>We may not light from lamp to lamp:</b> Since kindling is not so much the commandment. 

Line 5

 <b>We teach the version, "As a dilemma was raised before them":</b> Meaning to say that this matter was already raised; and the resolution of that dilemma was resolved for us like this.

Line 6

<b>One who was holding a Hanukkah lamp</b> in his hand, from when he lit it to when it became extinguished.
<b>And standing:</b> Not necessarily, but this is the [Talmud]'s expression.
<b>For his need:</b> To use. So there is no recognition [that it is to commemorate] the miracle.

Line 7

<b>Inside:</b> In the house.
<b>And takes it out:</b> As it said earlier, that he needs to place it at the entrance to his house on the outside.
<b>Granted, if you say that lighting accomplishes the commandment - that is why he did nothing:</b> For since that is its commandment, it needs to be done in a place where he is obligated.

Line 8



Daf 23a



Line 1

<b>A lantern:</b> A large vessel of glass; <i>lanterne</i>, in the vernacular. 
<b>Burning:</b> As he kindled it for the commandment of Channukah on the eve of Shabbat.
<b>And kindles it:</b> For the commandment of that night. 

Line 2

<b>Were in that miracle:</b> Since the Greeks decreed upon all the virgins getting married to have intercourse with the high official first. And the miracle happened through a woman.

Line 3

<b>A lodger:</b> A guest.
<b>After I married:</b> But I was sometimes [still] a lodger [in order to go somewhere] to study Torah. 
<b>Upon me:</b> For my sake.
<b>On top of my house:</b> In my house.

Line 4

<b>Its light lasts:</b> It does not quickly end like olive oil [does]. 
<b>Its light is clear:</b> Clear and gives off light.

Line 5

<b>To mix:</b> I found in the responsa of the Geonim, that we smoke a glass vessel with the smoke of olive oil until it blackens. And one [then] rubs off the blackness and puts a little oil into it, mixes it, dries it in the sun and [then] rubs it into the ink.
<b>To smoke:</b> This is also as I [just] explained.
<b>Sap:</b> <i>Gome</i>.
<b>Balsam:</b> <i>Prunelier</i> of the forests; like that which we make from sap. 

Line 6

<b>One who sees:</b> One who is passing through the marketplaces and sees it lit in one of the courtyards. But I found in the name of Rabbenu Yitzchak ben Yehudah, who said in the name of Rabbenu Yaakov, that this blessing is only required for one who did not yet light in his house or for one on a boat. 
<b>One who sees recites two:</b>  'Who did miracles,' and 'who has sustained us.' For he should not recite the blessing, 'to light,' since he did not light.
<b>What does he omit</b> - the one who lights - on the other days? Which of the three does he omit?
<b>It is present on all the days:</b> For behold, they lit from the cruse all eight [days, in the Temple]. But [regarding the blessing about] time - from [the time] when He made us arrive to the beginning of the time (the first day of Channukah), He has [already] made us arrive. 

Line 7

<b>Where did He command us:</b> Behold, it is not from the Torah, but rather from [the Rabbis'] words.
<b>From, "You shall not turn aside</b> from the word which they shall tell you, etc."

Line 8

<b>One may use it to establish an <i>eiruv</i>:</b> The joining of courtyards and the joining of borders. 
<b>Establish the merging</b> in an alleyway. For if one wants, he can render his property ownerless and become poor; and [then the produce] would be fit for him. As we learn (in a mishnah), "We feed <i>demai</i> to the poor." Hence it is considered his. 
<b>And one recites a blessing:</b> <i>HaMotzi.  </i>
<b>And one invites [a quorum]:</b> This is the blessing of invitation.
<b>And one may separate it:</b> A person who is naked. Meaning to say that there is no need to recite a blessing upon it when he separates it.
<b>"Therefore shall your camp be holy</b> that He see no unseemly thing in you" - even the speech, of mentioning [God's] name, should see no unseemly thing in you.
<b>A definite rabbinic law:</b> Such as the Channukah lamp.
<b>An uncertain rabbinic law:</b> Such as <i>demai</i>. Since [the need for] its separation is only from an uncertainty.  

Line 9

<b>And it requires a blessing:</b> The sanctification (<i>kiddush</i>) of the day.
<b>Rava said:</b> An uncertain rabbinic law requires a blessing, but <i>demai</i> is not even uncertain. Rather it is just a mere stringency, since most ignoramuses do tithe.

Line 10

<b>A courtyard that has two entrances</b> That the house has two entrances opening on to the courtyard. [Hence it] needs two lamps - one lamp for each entrance - on account of suspicion, as the reason is explained. For the one looking would think that the house is divided, and it surely belongs to two people. So they will say [that] one is not fulfilling the commandment of the lamp. 
<b>From two different directions:</b> One in the north and one in the east.
<b>The suspicion of people:</b> The residents of another city, who pass through from there in the marketplace.
<b>Even facing the same direction as well,</b> they will think that the house is divided inside it.
<b>And if it is the suspicion of the residents of the city</b> who know that there is no division.

Line 11

<b>At the end of his field:</b> At the end of his harvest. As it is written, "you shall not finish" - it is implied [that it must be] at the time of finishing, and not that he should put it aside before then.
<b>Due to causing the poor to be idle:</b> And it explains all of [the reasons].
 <b>A time [it is] is unoccupied:</b> When the poor are not with him; and he will say to his poor relative, "Hurry and take [from] here before others come." But now that he leaves it to the end of the field's harvest, the poor see and come.

Daf 23b



Line 1

<b>And due to causing the poor to be idle:</b> Since they would not know when he will harvest them.
 <b>Due to suspicion:</b> As the passersby will see at the end of his harvest that he is taking everything. They will not know that he already gave it.
<b>Due to, "You shall not finish":</b> As it implies the time of finishing.
<b>Aren’t all of them:</b> Those that we said, are they not explaining the reason of, "You shall not finish" - how is the time of finishing different?
<b>Rava said, "Due to cheaters":</b> Those that transgress, "You shall not finish," and say, "We have already left it."

Line 2

<b>Two spouts:</b> As their lamps were of clay. And they were covered, so they made a hole on the sides of the cover to insert a wick into it, and that is the spout. And above, in the cover, there is [another] small hole; and there is also an empty space above the cover and he fills it with oil, and it enters through the [small] hole, little by little. If it has two holes from two sides, it counts for two people as beautified (<i>mehadrin</i>) - those that do a lamp for each person.
<b>Made it like a bonfire:</b> As the fire connects in its center and it is not similar to a lamp [any more].

Line 3

<b>A lamp for his home or a Hanukkah lamp:</b> A lamp for his home on Shabbat. And he is poor and does not have enough to buy oil for both lamps.
<b>Peace in his home:</b> And this is what we say later (Shabbat 25b): "And my soul is removed far off from peace" (Lamentations 3:17) - that is the [absence of the] kindling the Shabbat lights. As the people of his household will be pained to sit in the dark.

Line 4

<b>Children who are Torah scholars:</b> As it is written (Proverbs 6:23), "For the commandment is a lamp; and Torah is light" - through the lamp of the commandment of Shabbat and Channukah, comes the light of Torah.
<b>Of Rabbi Avin Nagra:</b> [<i>Nagra</i> means] a cutter of wood.
<b>With light</b> of Shabbat.
<b>Exchange and teach:</b> Pass by and teach, meaning to say he would always pass by.
<b>In the family's house:</b> [Of] his father; and some say, his father-in-law.
<b>Emerged from them:</b> For his son-in-law is like his son.

Line 5

<b>Would kindle late</b> the Shabbat lights, close to dark.
<b>Departed not:</b> This is an extra passage, that is why it was expounded. For it was [already] written (Exodus 13:21), "And the Lord went in front of them during the day [in the pillar of cloud … and during the night in the pillar of fire]."
<b>The pillar of cloud</b> of the day would complete the light of the pillar of fire. For the pillar of fire would come before the pillar of cloud would set. Hence this is the way of the world.
<b>Do it earlier:</b> When the [remainder of the] day is still long.
<b>It was learned:</b> I taught.
<b>To not make early:</b> Since it would not be noticeable that it is for Shabbat. 

Line 6

<b>Who is <i>racheim</i>:</b> Loves.
<b>Will have children who are Sages:</b> And his love for them will be like that of a father for his children.
<b>And if he is not capable:</b> As he is not accustomed to being involved with Torah.

<b>That <i>himru</i>:</b> They wagered - like, "That they <i>mamerin</i> with doves," in Sanhedrin (25b:6). 
<b>Who here is Hillel:</b> Is Hillel here at all? And this was demeaning speech towards a Nassi of Israel.
<b>Why are the heads of Babylonians oval:</b> <i>Besloncs</i> in [Old French]. That it is not round. Another [possibility], the heads of the Babylonians are circular, round. 

Line 2

<b><i>Terutot</i>:</b> Soft.
<b>Because they live among the sands:</b> And the wind blows and it enters their eyes. But in another place, it explains that <i>terutot</i> is an expression of the roundness of their sockets. And here too I say [that it is] so. And because they live among the sands, the Omnipresent changed them, that they should not be like the slits of our eyes - which are elongated - such that sand could enter it. And likewise the feet of the Africans are wide, so that they do not drown in the marshlands. But our Rabbis explained that they live in marshlands and walk barefoot, so their feet spread out; since shoes press the foot and holds its form.

Line 3



Line 4

<b>Hillel is worthy:</b> He is deserving of this.

Line 5

<b>He cast him out with reprimand:</b> As we learned in a baraita, "One who comes to accept the matters of scholarly association except for one matter; and likewise, a [gentile] who comes to convert and takes upon himself the words of the Torah except for one matter - we do not accept him." This is in Tractate Bekhorot 30b:4.
<b>He converted him:</b> And he relied on his [own] wisdom, that in the end he would accustom him to accept it upon himself. For he was not similar to [a case of], "except for one matter." As he did not deny the oral Torah, but rather did not believe that it was from the mouth of the Almighty; whereas Hillel was convinced that he would [eventually] rely upon him, after he would teach him. 
<b>He reversed it on him:</b> For example, <i>tav, shin, reish, kof</i>.
<b>Didn’t you rely on me:</b> From where do you know that this is <i>alef</i> and this is <i>bet</i>? Rather I taught it to you, and you relied upon me. [So] rely upon my words regarding the Oral [Torah] as well.

Line 6

<b>Builder’s cubit:</b> A stick that was a cubit long. And they would measure the length of a building with it. For they would settle a price with the craftsmen - so and so cubits, for such and such money.
<b>That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow:</b> "Do not forsake your friend or your father's friend" (Proverbs 27:10) - this [refers to] the Holy One, blessed be He. Do not violate His words, for it is hateful unto you when a friend violates your words. Another [explanation]: Your fellow, literally - such as [with] robbery, theft, kidnapping, adultery, and most of the commandments. 
<b>The rest:</b> The other words of the Torah.
<b>Its interpretation:</b> As there is substance to knowing which thing is hateful. Go study and know [it].

Line 7

<b>A <i>sofer</i> (lit., a scribe):</b> A teacher of children.

Did you expect salvation - according to the words of the prophets.

 <b>He shall be elevated:</b> To be the head of the speakers.

Line 6

<b>A carob tree was created for them,</b> to eat its fruits; and "a spring of water," to drink.

<b><i>Karvi</i>:</b>Plowing.
 <b>And engage in temporal life:</b> As it it possible [for it to be accomplished] through gentiles; and the Holy One, blessed be He, distributes provisions and comfort to those that fulfill His will. 
<b>The judgment of the wicked in <i>Geihinnom</i> lasts for twelve months,</b> as it is stated (Isaiah 66:24, 23), "Nor their fire be quenched"; "And new moon after new moon, and Shabbat after Shabbat, all flesh shall come" - this implies even those condemned to it: Just like Shabbats are according to their count, so too are months according to their count. And this is certainly speaking about the sinners of <i>Geihinnom</i>, since written (above) [below] it is, "They shall go out and gaze on the corpses of the men who rebelled against Me." So is it taught in Seder Olam (Chapter 6).
<b>It suffices for the world:</b> You and I, as those occupying themselves with Torah [study].

<b>He established (<i>tikken</i>):</b> These are things of grace (<i>chen</i>) and giving (based on the word, <i>vayichan</i>). But it appears that it is from [the next verse, Genesis 33:19], <i>vayiken</i>, which is an expression of establishing (<i>tikkun</i>).


Daf 34a



Line 1

<b>And they are troubled in circumventing it:</b> Since that marketplace that had the doubt was a thoroughfare of the city for the public; and the priests were not able to enter there because of impurity and had to circumvent [it, by way of] another long path.
<b>Is there someone who knows that there was a presumption of purity</b> in this marketplace from [all of] his days; such that it was not a definitive graveyard and was not given to having it cleared away.
<b>Here ben Zakkai cut:</b> He planted them and pulled them out after their growing. 
<b>The <i>terumah</i> (priestly tithe) of lupines,</b> which require guarding from impurity. And he himself was a priest - as we say in [the Tosefta of Parah] (Chapter 3), "If I have forgotten what my hands did."
<b>He also did so:</b> He cut lupines and threw them there; and a miracle occurred and the corpse rose [to the surface] in the place where he was. So they marked the place of the grave. So is it explained in the Pesikta in the Passage of the Omer; and in the Order of Zeraim in the Yerushalmi. 


Line 2

<b>You been</b> in the proceedings.
<b>And counted:</b> You agreed with our opinion to be from those counted.
<b>Adorn each other</b> the hair of her colleague, to be fine.
<b>A pile of bones:</b> Like a corpse, whose flesh has rotten and fallen away a long time ago.

They could therefore see that the Jews were lighting fires, but they had made a decree not to light fires. Or perhaps it was one of their festivals, and they had forbidden lighting fires anywhere except for houses of idolatry.

They teach in the Mishna: to exempt with only one sin offering.  An infant who was captured: and who never knew anything about Shabbat.  But one who was familiar [with Shabbat] and ended up forgetting: he is like one who forgets that the day is Shabbat while knowing the essence of Shabbat, and is obligated for each and every Shabbat.  That it was forcibly forgotten from him: he never knew.
Let it teach "one who was familiar and ended up forgetting:" that he is obligated even though one can't declare that during the days in between [one Shabbat and the next] he had awareness to divide [one violation from the next]; and how much more so would one who does have awareness to divide [between one Shabbat and the next] [be obligated for each and every Shabbat he violated].

Line 9



Daf 68b



Line 1



Line 2

Exempt: as Rabbi Yochanon and Reish Lakish reasoned, it is said to be permitted [because] he was coerced; it was not merely an accidental transgression.
Obligated for the blood: which he ate all his life [he is only liable for] one [sin offering]; thus it is for all transgressions in the Torah [in which an intentional violator is liable for] excommunication.

Because all the seasons are according to the movement of the sun in its astrological domicile by Zodiacal sign and its ingress by Zodiacal sign determines everything, according to the hour that the sun begins to function with it ingress into the astrological sign.

WHAT IS THE HALAKHA WITH REGARD TO TAKING THOSE STONES UP WITH HIM TO THE ROOF — if he went up there to defecate. [The question is] whether we are concerned for excess effort or not.
AS IT OVERRIDES A PROHIBITION IN THE TORAH — As it is written (Deut. 22:1) "ignore it," which excludes an elderly person where (returning the lost object) is not in keeping with his dignity [see Bava Metzia 30a]. Here, too, moving [the stones] is a rabbinic prohibition that the Sages created on the authority of [the verse] "you must not deviate" (Deut. 17:11); and [this prohibition] is pushed aside where it is in conflict with human dignity

Line 5

<b>At the lowermost (<i>tachatit</i>) part of the mount:</b> Literally under (<i>tachat</i>) the mount.
<b>Tub:</b> A vat in which we put ale.
<b>A substantial caveat:</b> As if they are called to judgment [as to] why you (the Jews) did not fulfil what you have accepted upon yourselves, they have an answer: They accepted it under duress.
<b>In the time of Ahasuerus:</b> From love of the miracle that was done for them.

Line 6

<b>Sentence:</b> Torah.
<b>At first:</b> Before Israel said (Exodus 24:7), "we will do and we will hear."
<b>Feared:</b> Lest they would not accept it and the world will return to  chaos and disorder, and like Resh Lakish.
<b>And in the end:</b> When they accepted it.
<b>The sixth day:</b> What is different, that it is written, "the," with the day of finishing the creation story?
<b>It teaches that He established a condition, etc.:</b> The sixth implies the sixth specified in another place. It is like we say in general, "the thigh" (Genesis 32:33) is [referring to] the most important thigh. Here too, "And there was evening and there was morning" (Genesis 1:31) of the end of creation, was dependent on the sixth day; and that is the sixth of Sivan upon which the Torah was given. This is also expounded from the inclusion of the [letter,] <i>hey</i> (the definite article, the).

Line 7

<b>Two crowns:</b> From the radiance of the Divine presence.
<b>One hundred and twenty:</b> Each and every one took a crown.
<b>They put on:</b> The crowns. And such is implied [by], "their ornaments" [that they had] "from Mount Horeb."
<b>At Horeb they removed them:</b> As it also implies, "and they [...] removed their ornaments from (when they were at) Mount Horeb."
<b>"And Moshe would take":</b> That ornament. A different thing (another explanation) - "the tent" (<i>ohel</i>) is an expression [related to], "When His lamp shone (<i>hilo</i>)" (Job 29:3). And that was the shining of the skin of his face.


Line 8

<b>"That fulfill His word, hearkening":</b> They are prepared to do [it] before they hear [it]; and not like other servants that first hear the thing to know if they are able to accept it upon themselves or not.
<b>Its fruit grows before its leaves:</b> This is its way; and it is different from other trees - the blossoming of their fruit is before their leaves.

Line 9

<b>His fingers:</b> The fingers of his hands.
<b>He was squeezing them:</b> He was crushing them with his legs, but he did not comprehend [it] due to [his mental] exertion.
<b>Impulsive nation:</b> Hurried.
<b>Who accorded precedence to your mouths over your ears:</b> Before you heard it - how difficult it is, and if you would be able to withstand it - you took it upon yourselves to accept it.

Daf 88b



Line 1

<b>Who proceed (lit., for whom it is enough) with wholeheartedness, it is written:</b> We walked with Him with an innocent heart, in the way of those who act from love; and we relied upon Him not to burden us with something that we would not be able to withstand. 

Line 2

<b>You have ravished my heart:</b> You have brought me close.
<b>At first:</b> With the acceptance that you accepted, it is one with them. But at the end, when you performed [the commandments], there are two.
<b>Insolent (<i>aluvah</i>, which is usually translated as forlorn):</b> Audacious, as <i>ulbana</i> is an expression of audacity. And so did it say in Tractate Gittin. 
<b>Who is promiscuous under her wedding canopy:</b> Like Israel, when they stood at [Mount] Sinai and made a calf.
<b>At his table (lit., at his feast):</b> At his wedding.
<b>But the affection is still upon us:</b> Even though Scripture is recounting our disgrace, it showed us an expression of love; as it did not write, "reeked."
<b>Gave:</b> He left his good fragrance for others.
<b>Those who are insulted (<i>aluvim</i>) and do not insult:</b> Others come to them with audacity; but not they, to others.
<b>Who act out of love of the Omnipresent and are joyful in suffering:</b> Regarding the insult (audacity) that comes to them.

Line 3

<b>A great host:</b> All of the nations.
<b>Just as a hammer:</b> The rock divides through it into several fragments.

Line 4

<b>To those who are right-handed:</b> Who are occupied with all of their strength and exerting [themselves] to know its secret, like someone who uses his right hand, which is the main one.
<b>Two crowns are tied:</b> To the utterance, which had substance and was seen - as it is written (Exodus 20:16), "saw the sounds."
<b>Even though my beloved causes me suffering and bitterness:</b> With the calf, when He said, "Remove your ornaments."
<b>He lies between my breasts:</b> He said immediately to make Him a tabernacle, to make His Divine Presence contract between the two poles which appeared - in the first Temple - like two breasts pushing and protruding into the curtain across from the opening.
<b>Ein Gedi (lit., Spring of the Kid):</b> The iniquity (<i>avon</i>, the spelling of which is similar to Ein) of the calf, which is a type of domesticated beast. A different thing (another explanation): It is an expression of idolatry (as in Isaiah 65:11) - "who set a table for Luck" (<i>Gad</i>, a deity).
<b>That I collected:</b> That I gathered, to lust after many gods - as it is written (Exodus 32:4), "These are your gods. O Israel."
<b>That <i>koremim</i> upon it:</b> Upon which we gather clothes. And it is a long plank with many holes piercing it; and one places the incense under it and the clothes become fragrant through the holes. We follow the version [that has], "a term of gathering." 

Line 5

<b>Pass one [at a time]:</b> To the Garden of Eden.
<b>Flowing myrrh:</b> From His passing them.

Line 6

<b>A bountiful rain:</b> It is written in the book of Psalms regarding the giving of the Torah.
<b>Twelve <i>mil</i>:</b> This was the measure of their camps. So the ones closest to the utterance would retreat from fear of the sound to the end of the camp.
<b>Walked them:</b> They assisted them to come close a little at a time, as they were weak. This is like a woman who walks her child at the beginning of his walking.
<b><i>Yidodun</i>:</b> This implies they were walking themselves.
<b><i>Yedadun</i>:</b> Walking others.

Line 7

<b>974 generations:</b> In the two thousand years that the Torah preceded the world, these generations were destined to be created, as it is stated (Psalms 105:8), "the word He commanded for a thousand generations." But the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that the world did not survive so well without Torah, so He passed them up and did not create them, but gave it to the twenty-sixth generation. So behold that 974 were missing from the thousand.
<b>How glorious is Your name:</b> It is too glorious in the Earth, so it is not appropriate for You to place Your majesty there, but rather upon the heavens.

Line 8

<b><i>Pires Shaddai meZiv</i> (God spread His radiance):</b> It is an acronym of <i>parshaz</i> (spreads).

Daf 89a



Line 1

<b>Is there jealousy among you:</b> Such that you come through it to murder.

Line 2

<b>Passed something to him:</b> Taught him.
<b>"Of man." In reward:</b> Since they insulted you and called you, "Man (<i>Adam</i>), created from the ground (<i>adamah</i>)" - an expression of lowliness. 
<b>Gave him his secret:</b> To burn pans of incense at the time of a plague and to stand between the dead and the living.
<b>And if it were not that he told him:</b> The angel of death.
<b>Would he have known:</b> Is it not that it is not written in the Torah?

Line 3



Line 4

<b>You are a fabricator:</b> As a question (Are you a fabricator).

Line 5

<b>Tying crowns:</b> Such as those [about] which we say in the chapter [entitled] HaBoneh (Shabbat 104a), "The crown of the <i>kuf</i> is turned toward the <i>reish</i>." And likewise, <i>shatnez getz</i>, such that each letter [in these two words] requires three crowns, as we say (in Menachot 29b). The head of the <i>zayin</i> is stretched a little to the right and to the left on its roof. And likewise the head of the <i>shin</i> on the left; and likewise the heads of all of these seven letters in any place that they are. 
<b>Is there no greeting:</b> Is it not the way to greet [others]?
<b>In your city:</b> In your place.
<b>Assisted Me:</b> To say, "Your work should be successful."
<b>Immediately:</b> In a different ascent, he said to Him (Numbers 14:17), "may the power of the Lord be great."

Line 6

<b>When Moses ascended:</b> To the mountain. He said to them, "I will come at the end of forty days within the [first] six hours." They reasoned that that day that Moses ascended was from the tally; but he said to them forty complete days - the day and the night with it, but the night was not with the day that he ascended. Behold, he ascended on the Seventh of Sivan, [so] it comes out that the fortieth day was the Seventeenth of Tammuz. On the Sixteenth, Satan came and mixed up the world and showed an image of darkness and obscurity, an image of cloud, mist and disorder. He was saying, "Moses certainly died; as the six hours have already passed, and he has not come." And it is impossible to say that they only made a mistake between before midday and after midday on a cloudy day. As behold, Moses did not descend until the next day, as it is stated (Exodus 32:6), "They arose early the next morning, etc." 
<b>Satan came:</b> He is the evil inclination that makes a person sin, he is the one that ascends and accuses. [And the one who says] that he is the trait of strict justice is not correct in my eyes.
<b>Six hours [have] arrived:</b> That which he fixed with you.

Line 7

<b>Hatred  for idolaters (the nations of the world):</b> Since they did not accept the Torah.

Daf 89b



Line 1

<b>Because the Jewish people were fruitful and multiplied:</b> Since everyone's wife became pregnant with a male from the commandment of, "Return to your tents" (Deuteronomy 5:26). But I do not know where it is hinted to.

A PROHIBITION IN THE TORAH — the negative commandment of "you must not deviate" (Deut. 17:11), as it does here.
