Daf 15b



Line 1

Our Mishna, On Yom Tov the initial cooking – The initial cooking on principle should be for Shabbat, rather than the initial cooking being for Yom Tov. The remainder can be for Shabbat, as we go on to teach, you can cook for Yom Tov without using a loophole, as taught later on. 
Make a dish - for the purpose of the eruv. 

Line 2

And the egg upon it – the egg was on top of the fish when they fried it 

Line 3

Ate or lost – before he cooked all that was necessary for Shabbat
Rely on it – to cook for himself

Line 4

From where are these words derived? – Not precisely learned from Scripture, the mixing of dishes is from the Rabbis. This is what the question is saying: What did the Rabbis cause it to rely on?
Remember – You only remember things that are liable to be forgotten. 
From another that comes to make it forgotten – When Yom Tov falls on erev Shabbat, and it's close to Shabbat and will be forgotten because of Yom Tov, because you will be preparing a lot for the meal of the day, this doesn't allow for Shabbat to be honored, and the Scripture warns you to remember it (Shabbat). When you mix the mixed dishes, it turns out you will remember. You only do this for Shabbat. 

Line 5

What is the reason? – Why did (the Rabbis) ordain the eruv? The verse is certainly not speaking about the eruv, and the eruv is not heard from them, it is a mere support. When the verse comes, it teaches about saying Kiddush as it is taught in Masechet (tractate) Pesachim, remember Shabbat over wine. The eruv is from the Rabbis. What did they see to ordain this?
Rava said: select the choice portion – Since in the west, remember Shabbat and do not let Yom Tov consume everything. Choose a portion for this and a portion for that. 

Line 6

Rav Ashi says – They ordain it not on account of the honor of Shabbat, but rather the honor of Yom Tov. 
So people will say "do not bake on Yom Tov for Shabbat" – unless the person begins to cook when it is still day, because then it is finishing what you started, but you cannot start.

1- "We don't trap fish" even though slaughtering, baking and cooking are major categories of labor [which are prohibited on the Sabbath], and those labors are permitted for the needs of the holiday, the reason there [for permitting those labors] is that it would be impossible [to do these labors] before the holiday, because with slaughtering we are concerned that the meat will spoil. However, with trapping you can trap the fish while its still the day [before the Holiday], and put it aside in water and it wont die, and on the next day [i.e. the holiday] you can take it from the water.

On account of buying and selling - that buying and selling is similar to take out from his domain and transfer the object to the holy domain [the Temple].  This action is forbidden by Torah which states "[honor the Sabbath by not] seeking out your personal desires, nor discussing [forbidden] matters." (Isaiah 58:13).  Or alternatively, buying and selling will cause someone to write a bill of sale.    And if you would say...
