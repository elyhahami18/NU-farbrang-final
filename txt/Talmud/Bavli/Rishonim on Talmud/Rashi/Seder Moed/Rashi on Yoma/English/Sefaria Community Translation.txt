Line 8

It was taught in the Mishna a pregnant woman who smells - The fetus smells the smell of the broth and craves it, if she doesn't eat, the two of them are in danger 
According to experts - If two doctors say that he is in danger, he should eat 

Line 9

(Gemara) Reed - reed (another translation), she inserts reed into the juice of the meat and she sucks it  

Line 10

Why do we say "with all your might," etc – Let him say the most precious among everything and how much the more so less precious 

Line 11



Line 12

When a man rises – written about betrothed woman
What do we learn from murderer about betrothed woman – the judgement in the case of the murderer is the same as the other matter (the rape)

Line 13

Just as with the pregnant woman, permission is given – to the savior to save her from this rape with the life of this rapist. Kill him only until he comes upon her, as it is written: there is nobody to save her, and if there is a savior, they should save her any way possible. 
Let the murderer be killed and not transgress – if they said to him kill your fellow, and if you don’t I will kill you, let him be killed and not transgress as it is explained later (in the text)
So too a betrothed woman – if they say “rape the woman who is engaged to your fellow or you will be killed," he should be killed. But she is not commanded to give up her life, because she does nothing. She is merely like the ground, the proof of the matter is Esther.

Daf 82b



Line 1

Murderer himself, from where do we derive this? – Let him be killed and not transgress. 
Master of the Village – Government of the village that I live there
What do you see (why do you think) that your blood is redder? – In other words, why do you think this thing is permitted? Because of "and live by them" and do not die by them. The reason for the matter is that the lives of the Jewish people are more beloved to God than the mitzvot. HaKodesh Barechu said, "Cancel the mitzvah and let him live." But now there is a Jew killed and the mitzvah is cancelled. Why is it better in the eyes of God to transgress the commandment? Why is your blood more precious to God than the blood of your fellow Jew?

Line 9

Mar Bar Rav Ashi said – Do not explain the end of the Mishna that way. Where (the ill person) says, "I need (food)," When there are two (doctors or experts) who say he does not need (food), we do not listen to him. We don't say that. When he says "I need" and even if 100 (doctors or experts) say he doesn't, we listen to him. What is the reason? The heart knows the bitterness of the soul.  

Line 10



Line 11

Our Mishna, he who is seized by bulmos (a disease) – This sickness seizes a person on account of hunger, his eyes become dim and he is in danger of death. When his healthy appearance returns, we know he is healed. 
Mad dog – Explained in Gemara. 
Do not eat the lobe of his (the dog's) liver – Even though doctors practice this cure, it is not fully effective and would not allow a person to eat an impure animal. 
Rabbi Matya ben Harash permits – He thinks this is a complete cure.
