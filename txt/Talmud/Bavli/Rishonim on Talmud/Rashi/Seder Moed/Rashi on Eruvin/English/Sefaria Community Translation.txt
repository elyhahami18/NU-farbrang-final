Daf 2b



Line 1

"That [verse] is written regarding the Ark" - which is the burden of the sons of Kehath, and because it is holier than the other burdens, it is called "Mikdash" (Sanctuary).

Line 2

"They learn from the doorway of the courtyard gate" - He objects regarding the width, as we learned in the Mishnah, "and the width [must be] less than ten cubits." Now, we find the doorway of the courtyard, which was twenty [cubits] wide, and it is called "doorway," as it is written, "and the curtains of the courtyard, and the screen for the doorway of the courtyard gate," written in the section of Naso. But regarding the height, to disqualify [a doorway] with a height greater than five cubits, he cannot object, for we find the doorway of the Temple, which was twenty [cubits] high, and it calls it "doorway."
The width of the courtyard of the Tabernacle was 50 cubits.  Now, as for what is written "fifty by fifty" in the second chapter (Exodus 27:18), it explains it: and its entrance was in the middle of its width, and they closed it with curtains, 15 cubits on this side of the entrance and 15 cubits on that side of the entrance, leaving 20 cubits of width in the middle, as it is written, "fifteen cubits of curtains for the shoulder," and "shoulder" is the side of the entrance.
"Just as below" - [meaning] a height of five [cubits], for all the curtains of the courtyard surrounding [the Tabernacle] were no taller than five [cubits], as it is written (Exodus 27:18), "and its height was five cubits."

Line 3



Line 4

"It is regarding its height that it is written" - that the height of the eastern curtains on both sides of the entrance was 15 cubits more than the other curtains of the courtyard, which had a height of 20 [cubits], and no measurement was given for the width.

Line 5


"From the edge of the curtains and downward" - Below those 15 [cubits] that were added on this side and that side of the entrance, there were another five [cubits] of height, equal to the other curtains, and upon them were added 15 in height on both sides of the entrance, making them 20 [cubits high]. Another interpretation: "It is regarding its height that it is written," that the height of all the curtains of the courtyard surrounding [the Tabernacle] was 15 cubits, but we did not learn a measurement for the width of the entrance. And according to this interpretation, we read in the conclusion, "that [verse] is from the edge of the altar and upward," since the altar's height was ten [cubits], and the curtains were five [cubits] higher than it, making them 15, so that a priest would not be standing on it with the [sacrificial] service in his hand, and all the people seeing him from outside. And I have heard both [interpretations], and this [second one] is the main one, and so it is explicitly stated in Zevachim in the chapter "Kodshei Kodashim" (Zevachim 59a). And the one who explains according to the first interpretation is mistaken, for he assumed that the one who objects, "Let us learn from the doorway of the courtyard gate," objects regarding the height, to disqualify a height greater than five cubits. And for this reason, he turned back to establish the courtyard gate at a height of twenty [cubits].

Line 2

"Not! For [according to] the whole universe that is allowed. Rather, this is that about which they argued: One master reasoned 'beam" -- As the Sages had decreed in the case of an alleyway on the basis that it is an obvious delineation of private space, QED! Thus is a delineation in entrances analogous to "utilization beneath the beam."
And the one who says four cubits [is the minimum width for a valid 'lechi'] - he holds that the beam which permits carrying in an alleyway is effective because of [the principle of] a partition, as we say, "the outer edge descends and seals." And the Rabbis said that regarding more than twenty cubits, we don't say "descends and seals." And since it is not a reduction of four [cubits], it is a partition made less than four [handbreadths]. And it is established for us in every place that a partition which is not suitable for four [handbreadths] is not a partition, for there is no private domain less than four handbreadths, even if it is surrounded by a partition of ten handbreadths. And in the case of the balconies of Chananiah ben Akavia, we also say the same thing, that there are no partitions unless there are four [handbreadths] within the space, as [stated] in the chapter "How do they share?" (Eruvin 60b).

"Lest you omit a letter"--"HaShem, our God, is faithful [emet]".  If you were to omit the aleph (in the word emet), behold you would destroy everything (for the verse without the aleph would then read HaShem, your God, is dead).  Regarding an extraneaous letter, take a look at the verse "And God said"...if you were to add a single letter, it would read "And the gods said" which would also destroy everything.

They studied their own rulings and those of Beit Shammai - When Beit Shammai would bring proof to their rulings from the Torah and Beit Hillel would bring proof from another verse, and Beit Hillel would expound the verse of Beit Shammai to show its relevance, and it was not light in their eyes, as they studied in Tractate Berakhot (Berakhot 10b), "Beit Shammai say, In the morning, every man should lean and read [Kiryat Shema'] and in the morning he should stand as it says, (Devarim 6:7) 'When you lie down and when you arise'; and Beit Hillel say, Every man should read as he is, as it says, (Ibid.) 'When you are on the way'. If so, what does it say, 'When you lie down and when you arise'? - [Recite] at the time that people normally lie down and at the time that people normally arise [i.e., in the evening and in the morning]."
They mention the actions of Beth Shammai before theirs - As they first said in the story that the "elders of Beth Shammai went" and subsequently, the "elders of Beth Hillel".

Daf 44a



Line 1

Or perhaps he [Rav Chisda] is asking whether the law is like Rabbi Eliezer, who said in our Mishna (ahead on 52b) that someone he went outside the Shabbos boundary 2 hand-breadths [or less], can go back inside [the boundary].

Line 2



Line 3

Also it is precisely stated: that it is a case where there were not enough people [to form a complete enclosure extending all the way back to the Shabbos boundary]...
Because he said to him: Rav Nachman [said] to make for him [Rav Nechamia] a wall of people, and [then] he will "enter".  Why would he need to add the word "enter" [if the wall already extended his path inside the boundary]?  Rather, what it means to say is: he [Rav Chisda] should make an enclosure (until) 2 hand-breadths [of the boundary], and then he [Rav Nechemia] would walk in on his own [passing through a 2 hand-breadth space outside the boundary] with no enclosure.

Line 4

It's wall fell -- of a Sukkah
And he should not stand up a bed frame: That he has in the Sukkah [to stand] in place of the gap [in the wall]. And even though it does not look like a [prohibited] act of building [on Yom Tov] -- because it appear as if he is [simply] intending to clear out space in the Sukkah -- even so, it is prohibited.  And this presents a difficulty to [Rav Nachman's instruction] which allows making a wall of people on Shabbos.


Line 5

In order that he can eat, drink and sleep:  The main Mitzva of Sukkah is [performed through] these 3 things.
And he can stand up a bed frame: Therefore we see that it is permitted [to set up something to create a wall on Shabbos].  And the Gemara is going to investigate the contradiction between these two Baraitot.

Line 6

And if [it is] not [attached and hanging on the building], one may not use it to shutter [the window], because it is similar [to the prohibited act of] building -- since he is increasing the enclosure of the room.  And even though it is only temporary -- because he will go back and open it up again. 

Line 7

But has it not been stated - that even the Rabbis only permitted to add [to an existing structure], for example,  by shuttering a window, which is merely adding. But the Baraisa permits to make a wall from scratch.


Line 8

Rabbi Meir invalidates - it is explained in Tractate Sukkah -- lest the animal runs away [which is Rabbi Meir's reason for invalidating using an animal as a Sukkah wall].

Line 9

Because he did not do anything - since  [the wall] does not complete a Sukkah -- even though it is making a enclosure [Ohel] -- it is permitted.  He [Rabbi Meir] is holding that we do make temporary enclosures [on Shabbat] -- since he is not completing a Sukkah it is only a temporary enclosure -- and is permitted.  
But still, there is a lot to ask on [this explanation], because the the Baraisa is stating "in order that he can eat, drink, and sleep".  We see from this that indeed this wall is coming to complete the Sukkah.  The Gemara will continue to question this explanation until it is [eventually] removed from the [final] explanation.

Line 10



Line 11

Say that you hear from Rabbi Meir - that he invalidates
An animal - because [of the reason] lest it will run away
A person - who has the awareness to stand [in place], or utensils, which do not move from their place -- have you heard him teach that?  And this Tanna [in the second Baraisa] is stating that a person and utensils [are allowed, even though they may also be valid Sukkah walls], saying: one makes his friend into a wall, and stands up the bed frame.
