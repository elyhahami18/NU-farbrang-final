<b>And his bed was placed, etc.:</b> The legs of his bed were placed in buckets full of water so that ants should not climb onto him via the legs of the bed. As he was an amputee; and if they would climb upon him, he would not be able to take them with his hands and throw them [off].

Line 9



Line 10



Line 11

<b>That occurred to him:</b> Everything that happened to him, even the bad.
<b>He slept in a certain lodging:</b> He lodged one night at that inn.

<b>Abba <i>Umna</i>:</b> Bloodletter.
<b>Greetings from the Firmament:</b> A Divine Voice would say to him, "Peace unto you."

Line 15

<b>When he would perform a matter:</b> When he was letting blood from people.
<b>And from the women by themselves:</b> For modesty.
<b>That had a horn:</b> <i>Ventose</i>. As the horn with which he let blood was fixed in it. And he would clothe the women with it.
<b>And he was not embarrassed:</b> Since after he struck (let the blood), he did not know who put coins (in its slit) and who did not put [them there].


Line 16

<b>Health your spirit:</b> Heal yourself.
<b>To investigate him:</b> To investigate him by his deeds.
<b>He spread out mats (<i>bistarki</i>) for them:</b> He folded wool ornaments under them - <i>traped</i> in [Old French] - to sleep in them.

Daf 22a



Line 1

<b>In the morning, they rolled them up:</b> The rabbis [rolled up] Abba the Bloodletter's mats and brought them to the marketplace to sell them. 
<b>They said to him,</b> to Abba the Bloodletter, "Let the Master appraise them and give us their value." And they were examining him, whether he would suspect them as robbers, or whether he would appraise [the mats for] less than their value. 

Line 2

<b>What did you suspect us of</b> when we took them. 
 <b>And it embarrassed</b> you to tell me the matter immediately, to give them [to you]. And that is why you came to sleep with me, to do all of this.
<b>Let the Master take them:</b> As we only wanted to test you.

<b><i>Ugah</i>:</b> A circular line; like a cake, which is round.
<b>In the manner that Habakkuk did:</b> As is explained in the Targum on Habakkuk on, "I will stand upon my watch" - he made a type of prison and sat [there].

<b>We have seen you, but we shall not die:</b> "We have seen you, but we shall not die," is as a statement: Take efforts that we shall not die from hunger due to the stoppage of the rain.

<b>A bull of <i>hodaah</i>:</b> Upon which to confess [sins]. He leaned upon it; and they brought peace-offerings. And Choni [lived] at the time of the Temple.
<b>Truffles and mushrooms:</b> <i>Boleiz</i>, in [Old French]. As they come out from the dampness of the rain, and they knew that it was rains of blessing.

Line 9

<b>If you were not Choni</b> and a great man.
<b>For ostracism:</b> As we ostracize [somone] on account of the honor of the master. And he cast [irreverent] statements and said, "I did not ask for this."
<b>For were these years like the years of Elijah:</b> [A time of] a decree on the stoppage of the rain.
<b>And the key for rain was in Elijah’s hands:</b> We teach [this version of the text].
<b>Wouldn’t the name of Heaven have been desecrated:</b> By way of a question. As Eliyahu had sworn (I Kings 17:1), "As the Lord lives [...], there will be no dew or rain  except by my word"; and you swore that you would not move until rain falls.
<b>Wouldn’t the name of Heaven have been desecrated:</b> As one or the other would come to a vain oath. 

Line 10

<b><i>Mitchateh</i> (Nag):</b> It is an expression of sin; meaning that he was continuing to sin.

Line 11

<b>The Chamber of the Hewn Stone:</b>: The Sanhedrin.


Line 12

<b>A generation that was in darkness</b> due to great pain. As there was no rainfall.


Line 13

<b>You saved through your prayer</b> from death. As you brought them plenty.


Line 14

<b>Of that righteous man</b> - Choni HaMe’aggel - he was distressed over this verse.
<b>A song of Ascents:</b> It is an expression of ascending. 
<b>We were like those who dream:</b> The Babylonian exile, which was seventy years, was like a dream.
<b>Seventy years in a dream:</b> By way of a question: Is there someone who sleeps seventy years in his dream; and is there any person who sleeps seventy years at one time?


Line 15

<b>Until seventy years [until] it produces fruit for the first time. </b>
<b>We teach [the following version]:</b> I found a world full of carob trees. Just as my ancestors planted for me, I too am planting for my descendants.

Line 16

<b>He sat</b> [meaning,] Choni HaMe'aggel, and he ate bread.
<b>A cliff formed around him:</b> A boulder arose around him.
<b>And he was concealed from sight:</b> So they did not find him there.
<b>Several herds:</b> The offspring of offspring. It was pregnant with a male, and during those years that he slept, it also mated with it and they were born.

Line 17

<b>He said to them:</b> He asked them, "Is the son of Choni HaMe’aggel alive?"
<b>These discussions are enlightening us:</b> This discussion is as illuminated as if he had learned it in the lifetime of Choni HaMe’aggel, who would break it apart for us and illuminate it very well for us.  
<b>Either friendship or death:</b> And we do not teach [the version], "like the friends of Iyov," here; but rather [only] in Bava Batra (16b), concerning the story of Iyov. If the friends of a person do not honor him as at first, it is better to him that he should die. "Alternatively, certain hooligans," is not written in our books (in Taanit 23b:7)&gt;

<b>Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa:</b> He was a Tanna (an early Talmudic teacher from the period before the Mishnah was composed).
<b>The entire world is suffering:</b> Since they are requesting water for their fields.
<b>Is comfortable:</b> Since I am sitting in my house and I do not need rain, as I do not have fields.

Line 12

<b>What effect does the prayer of the High Priest have</b> when the High Priest would recite the brief prayer on Yom Kippur - as he would say, "And let not the prayer of travelers enter Your presence." For Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa would negate the prayer of the High Priest. As the Holy One, blessed be He, would listen to [Rabbi Chanina's] prayer, in spite of it, and stop the rain.
<b><i>Shechunah</i>:</b> Hot; similarly, Yonatan ben Uziel translates (Isaiah 44:16), "I am warm, I can feel the fire," (in the Targum, as), <i>shachenit</i>. 


Line 13

<b>If it will be hot, may it be rainy:</b> If it is hot, the land requires much rain frequently. 


Line 14

<b>A Divine Voice emerges and says, "The entire world":</b> And we do not teach [the version, "emerges] from Mount Chorev."
<b>A kav of carobs, from Shabbat eve to Shabbat eve:</b> He would be sustained the whole week with that. He was lacking bread, so he would suffice with carobs.
<b><i>Aktarta</i>:</b> Something that brings up smoke like the smoke of a furnace.

Daf 25a



Line 1

<b>Due to embarrassment:</b> Since her neighbors were baking dough to honor the Shabbat, whereas she was not doing anything.


Line 2

<b><i>Agana</i>:</b> A kneading basin.
<b><i>Masa</i>:</b> A shovel with which we remove the bread. A <i>mardeh</i> is a <i>pele</i> in [Old French]; and a <i>mardeh</i> and a <i>masa</i> are one thing.
<b>It was taught, "She too had entered to bring a <i>mardeh</i>":</b> That is a <i>pele</i> in [Old French. It is called this,] since we <i>rodeh</i> (remove) the bread form the oven with it. As she did not borrow [but rather already had one], since she was accustomed to miracles.

Line 3

<b>She saw:</b> His wife [saw] in a dream.

Line 4

<b>It does not take [something back]</b> after it gives. 

Line 5

Any place, we teach, <b><i>bei shimshei</i> (twilight),</b> it is about Shabbat eve. I have not heard the reason.
<b>For a vessel of vinegar:</b> For a vessel that has the vinegar in it. So I placed the vinegar into the lamp and the lamp became extinguished.  
<b>Until they brought from it fire for havdalah:</b> He lit another light from it, from which to benefit, and extinguished the lamp of the miracle story - like Rav Yehudah did (Taanit 24b) with the sand that became fine flour. 

Line 6

<b>They are causing damage:</b> [Our] fields.
<b>Bears</b> and wolves in the fields.

Line 7

<b>But the ceiling did not reach:</b> The beams did not reach from one wall to [the other] wall.
<b>If so (<i>ikku</i>), may your beams reach:</b> May the beams stretch.


Line 8

<b>They were segments:</b> The beams were made of segments. Through the occurrence of the miracle, small pieces became attached along their length.

When the gates close -- The Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Berachot, in the chapter [beginning with] "the morning prayer", defines when the "closing" occurs. One opinion is that it refers to the gates of the temple, and one opinion is that it refers to the gates of heaven, which are closed close to evening at the completion of prayers.  And it was customary to add the Neilah prayer on all public fast days the same way we do on Yom Kippur.

Eating and drinking are forbidden- These aren't done for a mourner rather they are things that are forbidden [on Tisha B'Av] in addition to the things that a mourner doesn't do: washing, anointing, shoes, ect.
And it forbidden to read from the Torah ect.- As it's written regarding the Torah: "it makes the heart happy"

Line 11

In a place where he is unaccustomed to reading- Since he doesn't know it, [learning it] includes pain.

Line 12



Line 13

How long- is it fully considered meat? Since it is not "salted meat" as long as it is like a peace offering, it should not remain in salt for more than 2 days and 1 night which it the time period of eating the peace offering. And the reason it's based on the peace offering is because when [the Torah discusses the time for eating the peace offering] we find that it is called "meat" as it says: "And the leftover meat from the slaughtered peace offering ect."(Leviticus 7), [however] more [than that time] we don't find that it's called meat because the taste is removed after 2 or 3 days.

Line 14

Wine from its press- New and sweet and not good like old wine and slimy and harmful.
Fermenting- with heat
The laws of exposed liquids don't apply to it- as snake won't drink from it because it will flee from the heat

Line 15



Daf 30b



Line 1

Between the oven and stove- the least respectable place in the house.

Line 2



Line 3

He won't see a sign of blessing- from that work

Line 4

Anyone who eats meat or drinks wine of Tisha B'av, on him the verse is said: "And those sins are on their bones"- On Tisha B'Av: meaning the meal that separates it (the last meal before the fast).

Line 5

Pregnant and nursing women- that cannot sleep on the ground
One is able- That it's possible for them [to sleep on the ground].

Line 6

What's the practical difference?- Since [the Rabbis] admit in a cause where he is able and [Rebbi Yehuda] admits in a case where he isn't able.
Other beds- that are in the house that he doesn't sleep on. Rebbi Yehuda who in the Mishnah obligates overturning the bed also obligates one who is able to overturn the rest of the beds, and the Rabbis hold he must overturn his bed but not other beds. This is related to a Baraita regarding a mourner.

Line 8

That the last tablets were given on it- On the 17th of Tammuz Moshe descended from the mountain for the first time and broke the tablets. Then, on the 18th, he grounded up the Golden Calf, judged the sinners, and ascended back to the heavens. He stayed there for 80 days: 40 days he stood in prayer as it says: "and I prayed before Hashem 40 days and 40 nights" (Deuteronomy 9:9), and he stood another 40 days like the first time. A calculation from the 17th of Tammuz until Yom Kippur comes out to 80 days: 12 days left from Tammuz (as it's a short month), 30 days in Av, 29 days in Elul equals 71 days. Add 9 days of Tishrei which equals 80 days. Add on the night of Yom Kipper and remove the night of the 17th of Tammuz that shouldn't be calculated as we already calculate it as the time he went up. Now, the explanation is 80 full days and nights and morning of Yom Kippur which is the 10th of Tishrei he went down and established that day as Yom Kippur to inform then that [Hashem] had forgiven and had mercy on the bad thing that he said he would do to his nation; therefore Yom Kippur was established on the 10th of Tishrei. This is what I heard. 

Line 9

That the tribes were permitted to intermarry- As the Torah said, "and every daughter of Israel who inherits land ect." (Numbers 36:9) and it continues "And inheritance shall not pass over from one tribe to another, rather each Israelite shall cling to his land" [If woman with land intermarried then their land would pass over.] And they stood and allowed this thing on the 15th of Av.

Line 10

This is the thing that Hashem commanded to the daughters of Tzlaphchad etc.- The word "this (zeh)" is a limiting word the limitation being: This thing will only be observed in this generation of the daughters of Tzlaphchad.

Line 11

To come into the congregation- To marry women. For Israel had sworn not to intermarry with them as it is written in Judges 21.
From us- this word is a limitation as it is written: "No man from us shall give his daughter to Binyamin". They only swore for themselves (ממנו), but on their children they didn't swear.


Line 12

1 "[the day] on which the deaths ceased in the desert" - As it was taught in a braita, all 40 years that they were in the desert, every Erev Tisha B’av, the proclaimer would go out and say: let each individual go out and dig [his grave]. And every single person would go out and dig for themselves a grave, and sleep in it, in case they would die before they had dug. And the next day, the proclaimer would go out and proclaim: let the living separate themselves from the dead. And every one who had the soul of life would rise and go out [of his grave]. And every year they would do this. And in the 40th year, they did it, and the next morning everyone stood up alive. And when they saw this, they were astonished, and they said, ‘perhaps we made a mistake in calculating the month [and it is not yet Tisha B’Av].’ They returned and slept in their graves each night until the 15th, and since they saw that the moon was full on Tu [B’av] and no one had died among them, they knew that the calculation of the month was in line, and that the 40 years of the decree had been completed, they established that day as a Yom Tov.
