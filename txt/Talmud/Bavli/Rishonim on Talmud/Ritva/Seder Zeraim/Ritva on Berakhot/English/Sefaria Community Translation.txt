Daf 26b





The Patriarchs Established Them And the Sages Based Them On Sacrifices. This means that certainly the patriarchs established [prayer], but from this establishment alone we would not have been obligated to say [the prayers]. So the sages came and based them on sacrifices so that we would be obligated.

Daf 27a






And he did not interrupt the prayer of Rabbi Yirmiyah, as he did not step in front of him - And we learn from this that it is forbidden to pass in front of people praying, and specifically in front of their faces, but regarding their sides we aren't worried about just passing by.
