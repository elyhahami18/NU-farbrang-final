Tosafot on Avodah Zarah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

The Mishnah's placement of tractate Avodah Zarah follows logically from the preceding tractate, Sanhedrin. Sanhedrin deals with matters of idolatry, including the case of the "Ir haNidachas", and the worship of constellations. Therefore, it is fitting that Avodah Zarah, also concerning idolatry, follows directly within Nezikin, the "Order of Salvations". However, Makkot and Shevuot, dealing with corporal punishment and oaths respectively, are also relevant to the Sanhedrin's jurisdiction, explaining their position immediately afterwards. Following these, the Mishnah returns to its logical progression, presenting Avodah Zarah and then Horayot.
The Mishnah sometimes places the number at the end of its statement, as in this case, Kiddushin 2a (concerning the three ways to acquire a wife), and Bikkurim 2:6 (regarding the three ways an etrog is like a tree). Sometimes the number is at the beginning, as in Nazir 65b (the seven ways to examine a zav), Yoma 2a (seven days before Yom Kippur), and Gittin 9a (the three ways women's divorce documents are similar).
Rashi explains that this prohibition prevents idolaters from thanking their deities due to business conducted with Jews on festival days. This seems to include even ordinary commerce. This raises a difficulty, given the common practice of trading with them on their holidays. Even if most of their festivals are for saints, they still have a weekly holy day, which, according to Rabbi Yishmael (Avodah Zarah 6a), should prohibit business entirely. The argument that idolaters outside of Israel merely follow ancestral customs (Chullin 13b) is refuted by Shmuel (Avodah Zarah 7b), who states the prohibition applies on their festival day, even in exile. Perhaps it is permitted to avoid animosity, as in the case of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi accepting a gift (Avodah Zarah 6b). However, this isn't conclusive, as he may have been seeking advice to avoid conflict, not permission. Further, avoiding animosity explains lending, borrowing, and repaying debts upon demand, but not regular trade. A Jew could simply claim disinterest. How would the idolater know it was due to the festival? Perhaps the leniency stems from the understanding that local idolaters don't truly worship idols. This explains Rav Yehuda and Rava sending gifts (Avodah Zarah 65a), stating their certainty of this. Alternatively, the Yerushalmi on our Mishnah states the prohibition applies only to unfamiliar idolaters. Transactions with acquaintances are permitted as mere flattery, avoiding attribution to the festival. A baraita states that joining a city's celebrations is simply flattery. Rabeinu Tam explains that the prohibition applies only to items offered to idols, not ordinary purchases, which are permitted under both the "thanksgiving" and "Lifnei Iver" interpretations. It's forbidden to sell them sacrificial items. "To carry and give" means exchanging money for such items. He cites Avodah Zarah 6a, questioning whether the prohibition is due to profit, leading to thanksgiving, or "Lifnei Iver." The Gemara differentiates based on whether the idolater has another animal. If non-sacrificial items were forbidden, the Gemara would have used that example. In regular commerce, "thanksgiving" doesn't apply, as money is exchanged, and profit isn't assured. The Gemara asks: Is it forbidden because the idolater will have more animals to sacrifice, even if they already possess some? Or is it "Lifnei Iver," permitting it if they already have one? Rabeinu Tam suggests the common practice is understandable. Even if devout, they offer money, not sacrifices, negating the "increased wealth" issue. However, lending money for offerings is problematic. Rabeinu Elchanan disagrees, saying offering-money goes to priests for themselves, not idol worship.
Rabeinu Tam explains this refers only to interest-free loans. Lending with interest is permitted as it causes them hardship (Kiddushin 20a).
The Gemara (Avodah Zarah 6b) follows Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah: oral loans are collectible, as it saves money from idolaters. Perhaps even documented loans are collectible, as the Yerushalmi says even these can be lost. The Ri states that loans in our documents, or even those with guarantees, are collectible, even if the idolater will give thanks, as it's always considered saving it from them. Regarding Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah saying documented loans aren't collectible: this applies when we have power over them. Even then, oral loans are collectible to prevent future denial. The Yerushalmi says if there's collateral, the loan isn't considered lost. However, it's still considered saving money, as even with collateral, loans can be lost.

Line 4

<b>Why doesn't our Mishnah use the word "Eidihen" (their testimonies)?</b><br>Similar textual discrepancies exist elsewhere in the Talmud, such as in Beitza 35b ("Meishlin" vs. "Mashchilin") and Bava Kamma 116b ("Meitzikin" vs. "Masikin"), without the Gemara questioning why each version is preferred. Perhaps this is because those variations have similar meanings, unlike our case. However, this contrasts with Sukkah 50b ("Sho'eivah" vs. "Chashuvah") and Yevamos 17a ("Rishonah" vs. "Sheniyah"), where different meanings exist without the Gemara raising similar questions. Our Gemara likely focuses on this because it considers "testimony" more logical, as it signifies evidence against idolatry, thus questioning the alternative spelling. However, this raises another question: Why does the Gemara question the version with "aleihen" if the questioner already knows "eidus" (testimony) is preferred? It seems the Gemara asks why the version with "aleihen" isn't "eidihen," as the latter is explicitly in the verse, while "eidihen" with an "aleph" isn't; only "eidam" appears. The Gemara answers that a term implying "breaking" is preferred, then questions why the other version uses "eidihen" if "breaking" is preferable.

Daf 2b



Line 1



Line 2

Rome is called "Rome the liable" because the verse in Malachi 1:4 refers to it as "the boundary of wickedness," and "wickedness" translates as "liability." This is corroborated by the Maseh Merkavah, which recounts a great destruction decreed upon Rome in connection with the martyrdom of Rabbi Chanina ben Tradyon.

Line 3



Line 4

This means that God asked them what merits they had accumulated throughout their generations.

Line 5

God could have simply said they built marketplaces for trade, but He chose to highlight their baseness, implying they even facilitated prostitution.

Line 6



Line 7

<b>And the Bear is Liable</b> <br>One might consider Babylonia, symbolized by a lion, more important. However, a bear is considered more aggressive and cunning. This is illustrated in Berachos 13a, where a bear encounter overshadows a previous lion story. Alternatively, Rabbi Yitzchak explains that Babylonia's lion-like status was only during its global dominance. Now insignificant, Persia remains second to Rome and will maintain its standing until shortly before the Messianic age.

Line 8

<b>Many Bridges</b> <br>While Rome also constructed bridges (Shabbos 33b), Persia was far more renowned for its bridge-building prowess.

Line 9



Line 10

<b>And We Build</b> <br>When asked about their deeds, the Persians failed to mention their assistance in building the Temple. This is because that merit applied only to that generation, whereas God's question concerned the merits of all their generations.

Line 11

<b>What's the Difference?</b> <br>This question pertains specifically to Babylonia and Greece, the major powers that oppressed Israel, not the other nations.
<b>Draws</b> <br>Persia's eventual fall to Rome (Sanhedrin 98b) will occur shortly before the Messianic age, when Rome will briefly hold global dominion.

Line 12

<b>What?</b> <br>Paran is located in Ishmaelite territory (Genesis 21). Our Gemara connects it to Habakkuk 3:3 ("The Holy One from Mount Paran"). The Gemara doesn't say "Teiman" because it's in Seir (Obadiah 1:19). But why cite Habakkuk when "Paran" is also mentioned in "V'zos Habracha"? Perhaps because "V'zos Habracha" is interpreted as in Bava Kamma 38a, where Paran refers to Mount Sinai, one of its five names (Shabbos 89a). Rabbi Elazar argues that the reading "What did He want in Seir, what did He want in Teiman?" is perfectly acceptable. "Teiman" isn't a nation's name but rather means "south," like in Song of Songs. The Sifri on "V'zos Habracha" explains that God revealed Himself from all four directions ("God comes from Teiman"—Habakkuk 3:3). This necessitates the Gemara's citation of Habakkuk.

Daf 3a

Line 2

<b>Kohanim (Priests)</b> <br>The Gemara implies that non-Jews are also called "Adam" (human). This is puzzling, as Bava Metzia 114b states that non-Jewish graves don't convey ritual impurity through ohel (overlapping structure), since the verse specifies "Adam." The verse "You are My sheep...you are Adam" (Ezekiel 34:31) implies this applies only to Jews. Rabeinu Tam differentiates between "Adam" and "ha'Adam." The verse about Hiram (Ezekiel 28:2), "You are (ben) Adam, not God," doesn't contradict this, as "Adam" there is derogatory, not honorific. The verse "When Adam rises against us" refers to a person, not a king (Megillah 11a), or perhaps to Edom, not Adam. Similarly, "What will Adam do to me?" refers to a lowly person. Regarding Gittin 47a, which states non-Jews can acquire land in Israel ("The land was given to the sons of Adam"), Rabeinu Tam explains this means descendants of the first Adam (see Bava Kamma 38a).
<b>She'Afilu (Even)</b> <br>This refers only to their observance of the seven Noahide laws. Studying other commandments would violate the prohibition against teaching Torah to idolaters (Sanhedrin 59a).
<b>Harei (Behold)</b> <br>The comparison to a High Priest is because the verse calls Torah "more precious than pearls." Horayos 13a derives from this that Torah surpasses even a High Priest entering the Holy of Holies. While a Torah scholar surpasses a High Priest, a non-Jew studying Torah is merely comparable to one.

Line 3

<b>Gadol (Great)</b> <br>One commanded to perform a mitzvah is greater than one who does so voluntarily because they constantly struggle to overcome their inclinations and fulfil God's will.

Line 4



Line 5



Line 6

<b>Nogim (Touching)</b> <br>The continued existence of heaven and earth doesn't prove their Torah observance, as a father (God) wouldn't testify against his son (Israel). Alternatively, their existence may be due to Israel's acceptance of the Torah.
<b>Yom (Day)</b> <br>If the Torah was given on the seventh of Sivan, what is the significance of the sixth day? Perhaps God didn't address them on the first day due to travel fatigue. Alternatively, the giving was intended for the sixth but Moshe added a day.

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9

<b>They Did Not Bow to the Image</b> <br>Rabeinu Tam argues that Nebuchadnezzar's image wasn't an idol but a statue honouring the king. This explains the distinction between Abraham not worshipping idols and Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah not bowing to an "image." It also explains Ketubot 33b, which states they would have bowed under torture. Had it been true idolatry, they would have faced death like Rabbi Chanina ben Tradyon (Avodah Zarah 18a) and Rabbi Akiva (Berachos 61b). This also clarifies Pesachim 53b's question about their refusal to bow, as it wasn't true idolatry. Further support comes from Megilah 12a, which questions why Jews were punished for seemingly bowing; they only pretended, as true idolatry would have demanded martyrdom. The verse itself distinguishes: "To your God we will not bow, and to your image we will not prostrate ourselves."
<b>Bildad the Shuhite, Zofar the Naamathite, and Eliphaz the Teimanite will come</b><br>The Talmud often doesn't maintain strict order, as seen in Ketubot 11a regarding a convert, captive, or maidservant.

Line 10



Line 11

<b>Today to do them, not tomorrow to do them</b> <br>This doesn't justify the people of Jericho's rushed Shema recitation (Pesachim 57a), which seemingly implied "today on your heart," but not tomorrow. In that context, "today" and "tomorrow" are taken literally. However, in Deuteronomy 7:11, "today to do them" refers to reward, as the verse discusses God repaying His enemies. The righteous are rewarded in the World to Come, not literally "tomorrow."

Daf 3b

Line 2

<b>There is no laughter</b> <br>The statement in Bava Metzia 59b, "He smiled and said, 'You have defeated me, My child'," is merely a figure of speech.

Line 3



Line 4

<b>And They Place</b> <br>The Yerushalmi (Yerushalmi Avodah Zarah 2:1:3) connects "We will detach his straps" with tefillin and "…throw off his thick rope" with tzitzit.

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

<b>Second</b> <br>Some suggest the Musaf Kedusha prayer "From His place He will turn" reflects God shifting from judgment (performed during the second quarter of the day, when Musaf is typically recited) to mercy. However, this contradicts the conclusion that judgment occurs in the first quarter of the day. Therefore, the prayer's wording isn't connected to this, but is simply the standard liturgy.

Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

<b>If I Forget You</b> <br>The verse simply means: If I forget Jerusalem, meaning if we sing God's song in exile, let my hand forget the harp, my tongue cleave to my palate if I try to sing, unless I remember you.

Line 11



Line 12



Line 13



Line 14

<b>Those Who Gather</b> <br>This verse refers to the poor eating wild greens, echoing Kiddushin 66a ("Our fathers ate mallow, so shall we"). "Alei siach" means by the trees, not indoors.

Line 15



Line 16



Line 17

<b>Everything</b> <br>This means daily events beyond human control are divinely ordained, except for heat and cold. "Pachim" (fiery coals/hot stones) appears in Psalms 11:6 ("He will rain coals upon the wicked") and in Sanhedrin 18b ("He will blow with his mouth, and it will go out to greet him").
<b>One Who Guards</b> <br>Bava Metzia 107b states, "God will remove all sickness," referring to cold. This implies cold is divinely controlled. However, this means God provides clothing for protection. Vayikra Rabbah relates Antoninus asking Rebbi to pray for him. Rebbi prayed for protection from cold, which Antoninus dismissed. Rebbi then prayed for protection from heat, which Antoninus accepted, as that's truly providential. Rebbi prayed for clouds to provide shade, suggesting Antoninus couldn't control the heat. This is reconciled by noting that a traveller like Antoninus lacked shelter, while someone at home can build accordingly. The saying "Everything is in God's hands except for fear of God" (Berachos 33b) refers to predetermined traits like strength, wealth, and intelligence, not righteousness or wickedness, which are matters of choice.

<b>I have no anger, for I have already sworn</b> <br>The passage in Nedarim 32a, which suggests Moses eliminated God's anger, isn't a contradiction, as there are two kinds of divine anger.

Line 6

<b>And this is [the meaning of] Rabbi Alexandri</b> <br>Rashi links this to the earlier statement that God doesn't bring forth unreasonable complaints. However, the significant gap between the statements makes this questionable. Rabeinu Tam connects it to the distinction between God's anger toward Jews and non-Jews, consistent with Rabbi Alexandri's interpretation of "On that day I will seek" and Rava's assertion of a difference between Jews and non-Jews.
<b>Their actions</b> <br>This means "their deeds," as reflected in the Aramaic translation of Psalms 66:3, "How awesome are Your works."

Daf 4b



Line 1

<b>And he knew the mind of the Most High</b> <br>This implies Bilaam possessed direct knowledge of God's thoughts, not prophetic knowledge. This prompts the Gemara's question: How could he know this but be ignorant of his donkey's thoughts?

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4



Line 5



Line 6

<b>A moment is like a word</b> <br>What could Bilaam utter in such a brief moment? He may have intended to say "destroy them," which God changed to "king," as in Numbers 23:21. Rabbi Eliyahu suggests merely beginning the curse was sufficient. His desire for a lengthy curse is evident in Sanhedrin 105b.
<b>From where do we learn this?</b> <br>The alternate reading, "How do we know a moment suffices for speech?", is redundant, as this is already established.

Line 7

<b>In the first three hours</b> <br>This refers specifically to the third hour, when kings of the east and west put on their crowns (and worship the sun). It's customary for kings to rise at this time (Berachos 9b).

Line 8



Line 9

<b>Learn from this</b> <br>In versions reading "idolater," this makes sense, as idolaters aren't punished by being thrown into a pit (Avodah Zarah 26a). Bilaam intended harm, not death. Even with the reading "heretic," who are subject to such punishment, it's understandable, as Bilaam sought his death. Nevertheless, the Gemara concludes this isn't standard practice, as one shouldn't force God's hand, even against someone deserving death.

Line 10



Line 11

<b>Since there is a congregation praying, it is not pushed aside</b> <br>Rabeinu Tam clarifies: While prayer from a congregation elsewhere prevents a curse's dismissal, the prayer itself is effective only where the congregation prays (Berachos 6a).

Line 6

<b>If not for the fact that they sinned, we would not have come into the world</b> <br>While Eruvin 13b states it would have been better for man not to have been created, this applies at birth, before one's destiny is known. A righteous person brings blessing to themselves and their generation. Furthermore, our Gemara only means "as if" we hadn't come into the world.

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

<b>The son of David will not come until the souls in Guf are finished</b> <br>Couldn't these souls be depleted through non-Jewish births? Rabeinu Elazar argues that Jewish and non-Jewish souls are distinct. Regarding Shabbat 30b's statement about daily births in the Messianic era, perhaps those are new souls in new bodies.
<b>For a spirit from before Me will envelop</b> <br>The Messiah is called a "spirit" (Lamentations 4:20). This verse means the Messiah will tarry before God, similar to "The elder shall serve the younger" (Genesis 25:23), due to the souls I have made.

<b>But they lost their possessions</b> <br>They weren't blinded, as Numbers 16:14 mentions their eyes. They weren't lepers, as they dwelled within the camp. Healing at Sinai is irrelevant, as those healed relapsed after the Golden Calf incident. Childlessness wouldn't diminish their influence to slander Moses. Perhaps poverty diminished their power to cause harm, unlike the other afflictions. The plain meaning of the verse refers to Pharaoh's death, as indicated by the preceding phrase.

Line 19



Line 20



Line 21

<b>Ungrateful</b> <br>They are called ungrateful because they refused to say, "You give," not wanting to acknowledge God's benevolence.

Line 22



Daf 5b



Line 1



Line 2

<b>Ad (Until)</b> <br>Rashi suggests even Moses didn't recall God's statement. But why then was Moses angry with the Israelites? Perhaps because he, unlike them, didn't need that prayer and thus didn't focus on it until forty years later. The Israelites, needing the prayer, should have reflected upon it sooner, especially after their sins with the Golden Calf and the spies. The Ri offers a different perspective: Moses wasn't upset for forty years, believing they would eventually understand and ask God to provide. He didn't anticipate they would refrain out of ingratitude. After forty years, realising they should have known better, he understood their ingratitude and rebuked them.

Line 3

<b>Yitzram (Their inclination/impulse)</b> <br>This derives from the phrase "those who send out the feet," as the evil inclination is likened to a wayfarer ("a wayfarer came to the rich man's house").

Line 4



Line 5

<b>And do we require all this?</b> <br>Rashi asks: Does one typically become so engrossed in a festival's joy that business dealings are forbidden three days prior? The Mishnah mentions four specific times… The Gemara concludes: For festivals focused on food, one day's preparation suffices. But for sacrifices, requiring more extensive preparation, three days are necessary. Thus, business is forbidden during this period, as idol worship is foremost in their minds, leading to expressions of gratitude to their deities.

Line 6



Line 7

<b>The eve of the last day of the festival</b> <br>The Gemara doesn't mention the first day of Sukkot because people are occupied with the lulav and sukkah, leaving little time for elaborate meals. Alternatively, these four occasions have specific reasons for festive meals. The last day of Sukkot is unique, a distinct holiday, unlike the preceding Sukkot days or the seventh day of Passover. Additionally, the eighth day's sacrifices are specifically for Israel, while the other Sukkot sacrifices correspond to the nations. Passover eve marks redemption and freedom. Shavuot requires a celebratory element ("for yourselves"). Rosh Hashanah, as the new year, calls for festive meals and symbolic actions for good fortune (Horayot 12a, Keritut 5b).
<b>And according to Rabbi Yosi, also Yom Kippur eve in the Galilee</b> <br>Ketubot 5a questions why Yom Kippur falling on a Monday is postponed, lest one slaughter a bird on Shabbat. Why not focus on other major festivals? The question applies even to the Rabbis. The concern is specifically about birds. Slaughtering an animal requires more effort, making Shabbat violation more conscious. These festivals typically involve animal slaughter, while Yom Kippur often involves birds, fish, or simpler fare (Genesis Rabbah 11).

Line 8

<b>And we learned in the Mishnah: We inquire about the laws of Passover</b> <br>While we still discuss Passover laws thirty days prior, even without the sacrifice, the original decree focused on the sacrifice, as Pesachim 6b explains, citing the prophet's warning about Passover Sheni.

Line 9



Line 10

<b>From where [do we know] about one missing a limb…?</b> <br>This refers to sacrifices on personal altars. In the Temple, even a blemished animal is forbidden ("You shall not offer anything with a blemish"). The verse "From all living creatures" teaches Noah was warned against bringing blemished animals onto the ark, as they would be used for sacrifices. But the Gemara later states Noah was also warned against bringing old or castrated animals, which are permitted for sacrifice. Furthermore, the verse refers to unclean animals ("two of all flesh"), which are unfit for sacrifice (Zevachim 116a). Perhaps old or castrated animals were excluded for their inability to procreate, whereas blemished animals could still reproduce. The exclusion of unclean animals is irrelevant, as they're never fit for sacrifice.
<b>From where [do we know] that one missing a limb is forbidden to Noahides?</b> <br>The term "forbidden" indicates a strict prohibition for Noahides. Why isn't this among the seven Noahide laws? It can't be because the prohibition isn't explicit, as we derive prohibitions from positive statements (e.g., "You shall eat from every tree" implies not stealing). Perhaps it's a positive commandment, derived from "A man, a man," allowing Noahides to make offerings. If one pledges a blemished animal, they must bring an unblemished one. Positive commandments aren't among the seven Noahide laws. Kidushin 24b derives from "from the bird" that a blemished bird is unfit. Why is this derivation needed? Isn't it obvious that what's forbidden to Noahides is forbidden to Jews? Perhaps because other blemishes permitted in birds (e.g., unspecified gender) might have been thought to apply to missing limbs as well. Or perhaps without "from the bird" explicitly forbidding blemished birds for Jews, we might have assumed it permissible for Noahides, even though mentioned in their laws (Sanhedrin 59a).

Line 11



Daf 6a



Line 1

<b>But according to the one who says a treifah gives birth, what is there to say?</b> <br>This means, according to him, "from all living creatures" excludes a treifah. But how can a treifah be excluded if it can give birth and therefore live? Even those who say a treifah cannot give birth concede it can live. So how can "from all living creatures" exclude it? Perhaps the verse means entirely healthy and vigorous creatures, not sickly ones. A treifah, though living, is perpetually ill and deteriorating. Thus, it's excluded more readily than an animal missing a limb, which is otherwise healthy. Rashi offers a similar explanation later (51a).
<b>With you, those similar to you</b> <br>However, this doesn't exclude animals missing limbs or with blemishes, as only procreation is relevant. But how do we exclude a treifah if we accept they can reproduce? Perhaps "from all living creatures" is needed to exclude those missing a limb. "With you" alone might refer to those missing a limb, not a treifah, as the former is more repulsive. Many treifot are undetectable. The Gemara's earlier question (5b) about excluding treifot refers to "from all living," implying healthy, not treifah. An animal missing an ear is otherwise healthy.
<b>Perhaps Noah himself was a treifah</b> <br>Although Noah lived many years after, he might have been a treifah at the time, unknowingly bringing one aboard. This is unlikely, as the warning surely concerned only visible treifot. Perhaps the Gemara now follows the opinion that a treifah lives, consistent with the view that it can reproduce.
<b>Tamim (Unblemished) is written about it</b> <br>Why does Menachot 5b need "from the cattle" to exclude treifot? Why not derive it from "unblemished"? It's logical that "unblemished" excludes blemished animals, which are more offensive offerings than treifot. The verse about blemished offerings ("Offer it to your governor; will he be pleased with you?") highlights their unacceptability. Some treifot aren't readily apparent. Furthermore, the verse explicitly states a blemished animal isn't "unblemished": "It must be unblemished and without defect."

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4

<b>Now that we have derived from "with you"…</b> <br>If a treifah doesn't give birth and is excluded by "that its offspring may live," why do we need "with you"? We can't dismiss it as standard phrasing, since Sanhedrin 36b derives from it. Perhaps we derive from "with you" that they should be secondary to you, as in Bava Metzia 62a ("Your brother shall live with you" prioritizes your life) and Bereishit Rabbah ("It will be for you and for them" makes them secondary).

Line 10



Line 11

<b>And if you say that they and their festivals are ten days</b> <br>If the Mishnah's three days exclude the festival itself, its brevity is understandable, as festivals can last one, two, or eight days. However, if the three days include the festival, how can the next Mishnah list Kalanda, implying a three-day prohibition, when it's actually ten (eight for Kalenda, plus two)? There must be at least two days between Kalenda and Saturnalia. Since the Gemara suggests the Mishnah should state ten days, there must be two non-festival days before Kalenda. This is logical, as Kalenda's eight days correspond to Adam's eight festivals, likely not instituted immediately after the solstice.

Line 12



Line 13

<b>But learn from this that they [three days] are without their [festival] days—learn from this</b> <br>Why doesn't the Mishnah itself clarify this? "Three days before their festivals" implies exclusion. If inclusive, it should say "two days." A "one day" formulation would have been unambiguous.
<b>They [three days] are without their [festival] days—learn from this</b> <br>Why does Shmuel state the seemingly obvious point that, according to Rabbi Yishmael, it's always forbidden? Perhaps to emphasize the continued prohibition despite no leniency ever being applied. Or perhaps to clarify that Rabbi Yishmael, like the Rabbis, doesn't forbid the days after the festival. Or perhaps to emphasize that a single day, like Sunday, carries the same weight as other festivals.

Line 14

<b>Or perhaps because of, “Do not place a stumbling block before the blind”?</b> <br>Some question Rashi's interpretation of "giving and taking" as buying and selling. Selling is clearly a stumbling block; how is buying? Perhaps by providing funds for idol worship.

Line 15



Line 16



Daf 6b



Line 1

<b>From where do we know that one should not hand a cup of wine to a Nazir?</b> <br>It seems this principle applies to all prohibitions, but wine and a Nazir are mentioned because it's assumed the Nazir wants to drink it – everyone drinks wine, and he might have forgotten his Nazirite vow. However, if a Jew asked for neveilah (carrion), pork, or another clearly forbidden item, one wouldn't suspect he intends to eat it and therefore wouldn't hesitate to hand it over. But if it's known he does intend to consume it, handing it over is forbidden, even if it's his own property. This is implied by the question, "if you don't give it, he'll take it himself!" Therefore, it's also forbidden to give apostates something forbidden to them, even if it's theirs, because they'll certainly consume it, and they're still considered fully Jewish. This applies when the sinner is in a situation where they can only obtain the forbidden object if someone else hands it to them, as the Gemara concludes, like being on opposite banks of a river.

Line 5

<b>It is taught in a baraita according to Reish Lakish</b> <br>It appears to the Rabbeinu Yitzhak that the halakha follows Rabbi Yochanan, despite the baraita supporting Reish Lakish. He proves this from the passage in Yevamot 36a, which lists cases where the halakha follows Reish Lakish against Rabbi Yochanan, and this specific case isn't included. It's insufficient to argue that this case is omitted because the baraita is already in line with Reish Lakish, making further consideration unnecessary. Yevamot 36a does include the case of chalitzah (levirate shoe-removal) performed for a pregnant woman, even though a baraita there also supports Reish Lakish. Furthermore, later in Avodah Zarah 7b, the Gemara concludes that the point of contention between them is ordinary business dealings, clarifying that the Sages of our Mishnah forbid business dealings, aligning with Rabbi Yochanan. A Mishnah carries more weight than a baraita.
<b>They only forbade items that last</b> <br>This refers specifically to selling, as purchasing is surely forbidden even for items that don't last longer than those that do. Therefore, this baraita must only be discussing selling. However, the latter part of the Mishnah still refers to it as "business dealings," as Rabeinu Tam notes. According to the Rashi, this is difficult to reconcile.
<b>But we do not take from them</b> <br>According to Rabeinu Tam, who believes no buying is forbidden, "taking" here must mean accepting a gift. Similarly, for lasting items, one wouldn't accept a gift. One shouldn't infer that lasting items can be purchased; the Dinar Caesarina was a lasting item, yet acceptance was questioned.

<b>Abaye said a decree to repay them, because of lending to them</b> <br>It's puzzling why Abaye states a decree as the reason. Why not simply say it's because the idolater is happy, as the Mishnah indicates – even if presently inconvenienced, he'll be happy later? Perhaps the happiness derived from future repayment isn't sufficient grounds for a decree, as he isn't happy on his festival. However, without some element of happiness, a decree wouldn't be relevant. The decrees in all these cases are prompted by some form of celebration, as explained in the nearby passage clarifying their necessity. Now it's clear why all these cases are necessary for Abaye as well as Rava.

Line 10

<b>Rather, to borrow from them, he is reducing them</b> <br>This passage provides evidence for Rabeinu Tam's view that the prohibition applies to interest-free loans. Why would the Gemara say "he is making them lose money" if it refers to loans with interest, which are profitable for the lender?

<b>Rebbi Meir states, he gives him the value of his wool</b> <br>It's a puzzle, for Rebbi Meir appears inconsistent. Here, he says the worker pays for the wool, implying alteration constitutes acquisition. Yet in Bava Kama (95a), regarding theft, the Mishnah quotes Rebbi Meir stating: if one steals a pregnant cow that calves, or a sheep with fleece and shears it, he must compensate for the cow and calf, or sheep and fleece. This suggests alteration does not constitute acquisition! This can be resolved by noting that the Bava Kama case involves a penalty imposed by Rebbi Meir, as explained there, because of the transgression of theft. Similarly, in Gittin 53b, Rebbi Meir penalises one who unintentionally renders something ritually impure, mixes it with priestly offering, or libates wine to an idol, likening unintentional action to deliberate damage. However, here, a penalty is inappropriate as the worker acted for the owner’s benefit, believing he was instructed thus. Yet, Rebbi Yehudah also seems inconsistent. There, he says a stolen item must be returned intact, implying alteration does constitute acquisition. Here, the Mishnah states "his hand is underneath," implying alteration does not constitute acquisition. Rabeinu Tam suggests that in theft, the thief intends to acquire the item. Here, the worker unintentionally caused damage, with no such intention.

Line 3

<b>It is obvious that it is a dispute and subsequently a general [ruling]</b> <br>It is curious why we need to resolve this by appealing to a general ruling. Even without that, we determine in Eruvin 46b that in disagreements between Rebbi Meir and Rebbi Yehudah, the legal precedent follows Rebbi Yehudah. If the concern is that some Amoraim dispute this principle, there are also Amoraim who dispute the principle of following a general Mishnah! Indeed, even regarding a dispute followed by a general ruling, some disagree later (Avodah Zarah 21a) concerning renting houses to idolaters. Rebbi Meir and Rebbi Yosi disagree, yet Rav Yehudah rules in Shmuel’s name that the precedent follows Rebbi Yosi, despite the subsequent general ruling aligning with Rebbi Meir. Therefore, it seems the Gemara is not seeking to resolve this through the general ruling to establish legal precedent. Rather, the query is that this is a dispute followed by a general ruling, and even for those who reject the notion of legal precedent following the general ruling, it still holds weight as representing a majority view against a minority. It should therefore be assumed the rule is like the general Mishnah.

<b>One who asks a sage and is declared impure should not ask another sage to be declared pure</b> <br>But surely, one could consult all scholars and have them debate, perhaps leading to a change of mind? It is only forbidden for the one asking if they fail to mention to the second Rabbi that they already consulted a first who forbade it. If they disclose this prior consultation, it is permitted. However, the second Rabbi should certainly be cautious about reversing a previous strict ruling. As stated in Niddah 20b, a Rabbi who has forbidden something cannot be overruled by a colleague unless the first Rabbi clearly erred, whether in the text or in their logical reasoning. In such cases, Sanhedrin 6a states that past actions remain valid, but the Rabbi who made the erroneous ruling must compensate from their own funds if they enforced their ruling materially. Specifically, a Rabbi's prohibition cannot be overturned, but a colleague can impose a stricter ruling than a lenient one. However, the Yerushalmi in Shabbat 17:2 recounts that when Rabbi Simon ruled leniently and Rabbi Ami ruled stringently regarding circumcision, Rabbi Simon was upset. The Yerushalmi questions this, citing the baraita that if a Rabbi rules leniently, one should not seek another ruling lest it be stricter. This seems to imply a lenient ruling cannot be overturned! The Yerushalmi clarifies that Rabbi Simon's anger was precisely because there is no basis for such a baraita concerning lenient rulings. The Sages only forbade seeking a second opinion after a strict ruling. Rav Yudan clarifies the incident was the other way around: Rabbi Ami ruled stringently, then Rabbi Simon ruled leniently, and Rabbi Ami was upset, aligning with the baraita about not seeking a lenient ruling after a strict one. Regarding the Gemara in Chulin 49a, where Huna declared an animal treifah and Rav Ada declared it kosher, they were both present in the Beit Midrash when the question arose.

Line 10

<b>In matters of Torah law, follow the stricter opinion</b> <br>Rashi generally ruled that whenever "there are those who say" appears in the Gemara (presenting an alternate reading), if it concerns Torah law, one follows the stricter reading. If it’s a matter of Rabbinic law, one follows the later reading. Riva explained that these alternate readings are secondary to the primary text, and the halakha follows the first version. Rabeinu Tam argues that in Torah law, one rules stringently, whereas in Rabbinic law, leniently, as with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah here. Rabbeinu Shimshon explained that wherever the Talmud's preferred approach can be discerned, one follows that approach.

Line 11

<b>And all of them who reverted</b> <br>Rashi explains this refers to thieves and Amei ha'Aretz. But surely an Am ha'Aretz is capable of repentance? Also, "forever" implies prior acceptance. Furthermore, Bechorot 30b cites a baraita stating that an Am ha'Aretz accepting Chaver status, if suspected of impropriety in one area, is suspected in all. This implies that if not suspected, they are accepted! Therefore, it seems to refer to Amei ha'Aretz suspected of neglecting tithes and Shemitah, who previously accepted Chaver status but then relapsed. The debate is whether to re-accept them as Chaverim. The Tosefta in Demai 2:8 connects this with an Am ha'Aretz accepting Chaver status. The Tosefta means those who accepted Chaver status and relapsed are never re-accepted, according to Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: if they relapsed "b'Matmoniyot" (privately), meaning they relapsed secretly but maintained Chaver practices publicly, they are rejected as they deceive people. However, if they relapsed publicly, without deception, they are re-accepted, as their repentance is likely genuine. Some interpret "made their words like Matmoniyot" differently: if they acted as Chaverim even in private, they are re-accepted. Given their strong commitment to repentance, even privately, they should not be rejected after a relapse. However, if they only acted as Chaverim publicly, they are not re-accepted, as they may be sinning secretly and misleading others.

"Old" is also mentioned because an old horse might die in battle, endangering the rider. Each detail has its own specific reason. Rebbi Eliezer of Beiham explained "old" is inclusive, permitting sale even if it involves labour incurring a chatat, as later stated (16a) that old horses can grind millstones, yet sale remains permitted. "Male warhorse" is also inclusive, permitting sale despite potential prohibition due to weapon status and large animal status, and yet it is still permitted.

(Psalms 142:3). Which verse is the true source? Both are needed, as they illuminate one another. Without the Isaac verse, one might assume "talking in the field" was casual conversation, not prayer. "I will pour out my talking" clarifies "talking" means prayer. Without "I will pour out my talking," one might think "talking" signifies prayer but not necessarily a fixed prayer. The Isaac verse, mentioning "towards evening," implies a regular evening practice, namely Minchah prayer.

This is akin to what we say in Berachot 34a, that an individual should not make personal requests in the first or last three blessings of the Shemoneh Esrei (silent prayer). Yet, we see the custom of saying Krovetz (liturgical additions) within the first three blessings during public prayer. It must be, therefore, that public prayer is different.

One can answer that even though they generally ceased trying these cases, when they saw a pressing need, they would return to the Chamber and conduct judgment there. My teacher, Rabbeinu Menachem, told us in the name of Rabbi Yehonatan that "since the destruction of the Temple" refers to the statement "the law of four deaths continued." The meaning is this: even though the four forms of execution by the court completely stopped, their heavenly judgement did not cease. Certainly, in the forty years prior to the destruction, when they could technically have administered capital punishment, heavenly justice still operated.

Line 18

<b>This teaches that the place is a factor</b> <br>If you ask, "But Jerusalem is also termed 'the place' in relation to eating sacrifices and second tithe, as it is written, 'In the place that God will choose,'" one can respond that regarding capital cases, "the place" refers specifically to the Chamber of Hewn Stone, which was partially on holy ground and partially on secular ground. This is due to the requirement that the Sanhedrin be close to the Divine Presence. This is also why we say later (52a) that anyone who appoints an unfit judge is as if they plant an Asheirah tree next to the altar, as it is written, "Judges and officers," and adjacent to it, "You shall not plant for yourself an Asheirah tree beside the altar of God." Therefore, they went into exile and sat in the shop, because even though the shop itself was on the Temple Mount, it was still not as close to the Divine Presence as the Chamber of Hewn Stone. If you ask, "From where do we know this stringency of place applies to all capital cases, not just a rebellious elder, as the verse only explicitly mentions a rebellious elder," one can answer that we derive it thus: as long as the Great Sanhedrin is in its proper place, justly positioned by the altar, then "judges shall you appoint in all your gates" to judge capital cases. When they departed from that place, all capital jurisdiction ceased.

Line 2

<b>He who does not know in which year of the Sabbatical cycle he stands</b> <br>From Rashi’s commentary, it appears he intends to explain that the Second Temple was destroyed at the close of the Sabbatical year, specifically the second year of the Sabbatical cycle, meaning the year when the Sabbatical cycle begins anew. <br>The Temple was destroyed in the year 420 since its construction. As most of the year had already passed, the Tanna who is counting the years of the destruction does not include that year in the count, but rather starts from the subsequent year, which is the second year of the Sabbatical cycle. Thus, one should add one year to the count of years given by the Tanna. <br>Furthermore, Rashi explained that in Erchin 12b, a question is posed to Rabbi Yehudah: “How long did the Temple stand? Four hundred and twenty years. This leaves eight years out of four hundred for the Jubilee cycles, which if we divide by fifty, leaves eight. Together with the other twenty, this totals twenty-eight." This implies the Temple was destroyed in a Sabbatical year, not the year after! <br>The Gemara concludes that the six years until Ezra ascended and consecrated [the land], which did not count Sabbatical years, are not included in the calculation. Therefore, it emerges that the destruction occurred twenty-two years after the Jubilee, which is indeed the year after the Sabbatical year. <br>It seems, however, that due to the complexity of the matter, Rashi was not precise in his explanation that the Temple was destroyed in the four hundred and twentieth year. It was actually in the four hundred and twenty-first year, as evidenced explicitly by the Gemara in Erchin. <br>Another difficulty is Rashi’s explanation that in Erchin, the question is posed to Rabbi Yehudah. This is incorrect; the question is posed according to the Rabbis, and there is no difficulty according to Rabbi Yehudah. <br>The Gemara in Erchin states: “Is it possible that the year after the Sabbatical year is the second year [of the cycle]? Let us analyse this. How long did the Temple stand? Four hundred and twenty years. This means that apart from the year of destruction, there were four hundred years, comprising eight Jubilee cycles.” This aligns with the Rabbis’ view (who hold that the fiftieth year is a separate year, and the Sabbatical cycle restarts in the fifty-first year). “There were also twenty-two years. This implies it was destroyed in a Sabbatical year, meaning in the twenty-first year.” <br>Some texts read that the destruction occurred in the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle, referring to the four hundred and twentieth year discussed. The Gemara answers that this must be according to Rabbi Yehudah, who holds that the fiftieth year counts for both [Yovel and Shemitah]. <br>“This leaves eight [years] from the eight Jubilee cycles, and twenty years; that’s twenty-eight. In the four hundred and twenty-first year the Temple was destroyed, showing it was destroyed in the year after the Sabbatical year.” <br>Regarding the answer concerning Ezra – that the six years [before his consecration] are a different matter – Rav Ashi concludes with another resolution, even according to the Rabbis. The six years until Ezra ascended, which did not count Sabbatical years, are not included. If so, there were eight Jubilee cycles and fourteen additional years (twenty minus Ezra’s six). The four hundred and twenty-first year, following which the Temple was destroyed, indicates it was destroyed in the year after the Sabbatical year. This clearly demonstrates that the Temple was destroyed in the year 421. <br>Therefore, it appears Rashi retracted his initial explanation, aligning with the Erchin passage as I have described. <br>Rashbam also states that the Temple was undoubtedly destroyed in the year 421. When the Gemara says to add another year, it’s because the Tanna does not count the 21st year within the years of destruction but within the years the Temple stood. According to this, the Erchin passage aligns with this explanation. <br>However, it is difficult to reconcile counting 421 years for the Temple’s existence, as everywhere else, only 420 years are counted. <br>Indeed, it was stated earlier (9a) that Persia ruled for 34 years, Greece for 180, the Hasmoneans for 103, and Herod for 103, totalling 420 years. Year 421, however, seems to be the year of destruction. <br>Another difficulty arises: according to this calculation, the common saying that the year 4000 was completed 172 years after the destruction would be incorrect. It should be 171 years, according to the Tanna who counts 421 years for the Temple’s existence. <br>Furthermore, the entire preceding section of Gemara regarding adding 48 years is based on the premise that the initial count was 420 years. The same applies to the Gemara stating to add three years. If it was 421 years, only two years should be added. <br>Rabeinu Tam raises another difficulty, applicable to both Rashi’s and Rashbam’s explanations. How can we understand the Gemara's sign, “And your sign is ‘for these two years’,” which refers to subtracting two years from each hundred years, aligning with Rabbi Yehudah and not the Rabbis? This differs from other halakhic signs, which involve adding or subtracting. It would have been simpler to provide a sign to add one year, as the Gemara suggests one should do to determine the current year of the Sabbatical cycle, for example, by quoting the verse, “He will be free to his house for one year!” <br>Therefore, Rabeinu Tam favours the reading of Rabbeinu Chananel: “He who does not know in which year of the Sabbatical cycle he stands should subtract two years or add five years, and we should calculate generally by Jubilees and specifically by Sabbatical cycles. Your sign is ‘for these two years of famine in the midst of the land, and another five years in which there will not be plowing or harvesting’.” This does not refer to the years after the destruction at all, but rather to the count from the Greek kingdom, whose reign began in the 41st year of the Second Temple’s existence. <br>Persia reigned for 34 years during the Temple’s existence, and the Greeks ruled for six years before their kingdom expanded, which are not counted, making forty years. In the 41st year, they began counting from their kingdom. Thus, the third year of their kingdom is the 43rd year of the Temple’s existence. This year was the first year of the Sabbatical cycle according to Rabbi Yehudah, as Sabbatical cycles began to be counted at the Temple's construction. <br>This explains the Gemara’s statement that if one wishes to know the Sabbatical year, they should subtract two years from their count and begin counting Sabbatical cycles, or add five years to their count, and the result will be accurate. Now it is clear that the entire verse serves as a sign for both addition and subtraction. <br>Rabbeinu Baruch in Sefer Ha'Terumah (Book of the Offering) rules that the halakha follows Rabbi Yehudah, who states that the fiftieth year counts for both [Jubilee and the start of the next Sabbatical cycle]. <br>Despite Erchin 12a and Rosh Hashanah 9a stating that this is to exclude Rabbi Yehudah’s view, the halakha nevertheless follows Rabbi Yehudah. We find similar instances, such as in Ketuvot 10a, where the Gemara states that this excludes Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says the Ketuvah (marriage contract) is a Torah obligation, even though the halakha is indeed that the Ketuvah is a Torah obligation. I have elaborated on this at length in Ketuvot. <br>In Tosafot Rabbeinu Yehudah also, there is an implication that the halakha follows Rabbi Yehudah, as he calculates the current Sabbatical years based on forty-nine years per Jubilee. <br>This is how he explains Rashi in our passage, that in the 420th year [of the Temple], the Sabbatical cycle began anew, and 172 years after the destruction, the four thousand year mark was completed. If we add the 420th year itself, that makes 173 years before the destruction. If we add the entire fifth millennium and fifteen years of the sixth, that’s 1188 years. Subtracting 1150 years in Jubilees, and taking two years from each hundred, leaving 23 years of Jubilee excess to add to the 38 years remaining from the 1150, we get 61. Fifty-six of these are seven sevens, leaving five years. According to this calculation, year 11 of the sixth millennium is when the Sabbatical cycle begins anew. <br>According to Rashbam, who explained that the Temple was destroyed in the 421st year, and that this was the start of the Sabbatical year, the Sabbatical cycle would not restart until year 12 of the epoch. This is also true according to Rabeinu Tam. <br>Go forth and calculate: 380 years before the Temple, the Greek kingdom began, and 172 years after the destruction, the four thousand year mark was completed, totalling 552 years. Subtracting two years, as the Gemara says “minus two years,” leaves 550. Adding to this the entire fifth millennium and 15 years of the sixth, we get 1565 years. Fourteen hundred of these go in two hundred year cycles, leaving 165. One hundred forty of these go in twenty year cycles, leaving 25. These comprise four years after seven-year cycles. Thus, in year 12 of the sixth millennium, the Sabbatical cycle began.

<b>After four thousand and thirty-one [years].</b> <br>This relates to Sanhedrin 97b, where Eliyahu tells Rav Yehudah the world will last at least eighty-five Jubilee cycles, with the Messiah coming in the final one. Rav Yehudah asks if he'll come at the start or end of it, but Eliyahu doesn't know. Four thousand two hundred years is eighty-four cycles. Our Gemara implies he'll come after most of the last cycle (after 4231). [So, why hasn't he arrived?] Rav Ashi explains that until 4231, one shouldn't expect him, but afterwards, one should.

Line 1

<b>Precious scribe wrote it.</b> <br>This teaches us that a document is valid even if the scribe omitted the "from creation" part of the date, even if he skipped the thousands and hundreds, as long as he wrote the specific last digits. This is because they used to date documents according to the Seleucid era (Greek kings), and the scribe must have just left that bit out. If the document explicitly stated "according to the Seleucid era," the Gemara wouldn't have entertained the possibility that it might refer to the Exodus era or another reckoning. Even so, we don't assume it's a different dating system and thus invalid until that later date arrives. Since in exile they used the Seleucid era, if one omits the "from creation" now, it's fine since that's our standard reckoning. Even omitting the thousands is fine, as the Gemara later says, "Ignore the first thousand, take the last." Some versions read, "Ignore the general (thousands), take the specific (units and tens)." Rabeinu Tam actually wrote a document with just the last digits, omitting both the thousands and the "from creation."

<b>They Have Neither Script Nor Language</b> <br>Rashi explains this as meaning their language is a collection from other nations. But this is difficult, since the descendants of Ishmael, Keturah, Ammon, and Moab, who existed after the Tower of Babel incident, also must have got their languages from other nations! Therefore, the Ri explains that "writing and language" refers to a formal, prestigious language used by kings, like scholarly Greek. This aligns with Megillah 10b, which says, "I have cut off from Babylon name and remnant," where "name" refers to language. This is puzzling, as they spoke Aramaic and still do! Rather, it means they lack a royal, formal language. Alternatively, Bereishit Rabbah says that the flood during the Tower of Babel wiped out many families from the seventy nations, with the survivors descending from Ishmael and Keturah. Perhaps each nation inherited a language from one of the lost ones, while Rome learned a different language altogether.

<b>And It Was Taught, Coronation Day and Birthday</b> <br>The Gemara could have quoted the whole Baraita that appears later, but only quotes a part.

Perhaps the one offering the resolution didn't know the full Baraita, and only addressed the quoted part. Alternatively, it might be a different Baraita altogether. The Gemara couldn't have derived this question from our Mishnah, which implies two different people, using the lengthy phrase "coronation day of kings and birthday." The Baraita's phrasing, "coronation day and birthday," implies one person.

And it can also be said (answered) that he chose the heretics and the denouncers. For even though there are no [disqualifications on account of being from the] heretics among the [other] nations, concerning the acceptance of sacrifices from them; concerning lowering, there are - as it is challenged in the first chapter of Chullin (13b), "Now if one lowers a Jewish [heretic] into a pit, is it necessary [to say that one lowers a gentile one]?"

The Caesar sent and brought Rabbi and his mother before him. But his mother exchanged him with Antoninus and nursed him, until she brought him before Caesar. So he found him uncircumcised and dismissed them peacefully. Yet that leader said, 'I saw that they circumcised that one; but the Holy One, blessed be He, does miracles for them at every instant.' So they rescinded the decree." And we say similarly in the Yerushalmi that in the end, Antinonus studied Torah, converted and circumcised himself.

<b>All Her Princes, Not All Her Officers</b> <br>The text doesn't read "officers," but rather "princes," as the verse states "her kings and all her princes." Rabbeinu Yitzhak explains that "prince" (nasi) here refers to the elder discussed in Josephus. The Romans had vowed not to have a king because of a previous king who seized a woman. They appointed an elder with three hundred advisors instead. Later, someone forced his way into rulership. His mother died giving birth, her stomach was split open, and he was found alive inside. He was called Caesar, meaning "cut" in Hebrew, and this became the title for all subsequent Roman emperors.

Line 14

<b>Woe to the Generation That Departs Without a Bris</b> <br>But didn't the Gemara exclude Antoninus, saying he had a share in the World to Come even without circumcision? Perhaps he eventually did undergo circumcision. The Yerushalmi (Yerushalmi Megillah 1:11:4) relates that Antoninus asked Rebbi if he would feed him Leviathan in the World to Come. Rebbi said yes. Antoninus then pointed out that Rebbi wouldn't let him eat the Passover sacrifice, but would feed him Leviathan. Rebbi replied, "What can I do? The verse says the uncircumcised cannot eat it." Upon hearing this, Antoninus went and had himself circumcised. This is why it's said he converted.

<b>Radishes and Horseradish, Not in Summer, Not in Winter</b> <br>The Gemara in Eruvin 56a says seeing radishes is like seeing a life-saving remedy. But another Baraita calls them the "poison of death"! This is resolved by noting that in summer they're healthy, but in winter, harmful. [So why praise Rebbi and Antoninus for always having them?] Perhaps the Gemara refers to when they're beneficial. Some texts say the leaves are harmful but the roots always healthy, and our Gemara refers to the roots. [But Rebbi didn't benefit from this world!] True, but he had many guests at his table.
<b>Radishes Never Left Their Table</b> <br>This isn't remarkable in itself, but rather indicates lavish meals requiring much cutting and turning of food to make room in their stomachs.

Line 9

<b>If It's a Chukah, How Can We Burn?</b> <br>Why is this a question? Perhaps it is a Chukah (ritual), and since it's in the Torah, we're not bound by the prohibition against following their rituals. Sanhedrin 52b discusses execution. The Rabbis say to use a sword as the kings do. Rebbi Yehudah prefers an axe, citing the prohibition against following their rituals. The Rabbis counter that since "killing" is in the Torah, we're not emulating them. [If so, why question burning for kings?] Perhaps our Mishnah's Rabbis follow Rebbi Yehudah, who does consider it following their rituals. [But we conclude burning isn't a Chukah!] Rabbeinu Yitzhak explains there are two types: those for idolatry, and those out of silly custom. Our Gemara refers to idolatry. Rebbi Meir holds burning for kings isn't idolatrous, hence the question. If it were idolatrous, it'd be forbidden, even if mentioned in the Torah, like the matzeivah (stone altar), loved when the Patriarchs used it, but hated when the Amorites made it idolatrous. The Gemara concludes it's not idolatrous, just silly custom. Sanhedrin 52b understands "Chukah" as something important, based on this conclusion. Thus, even Rebbi Yehudah agrees it's permitted if in the Torah and not idolatrous. If not in the Torah, we wouldn't follow it, even if just silly. "Killing" doesn't specify "sword," so an axe is fine. Even for a condemned city, "by the sword" might include an axe. The Rabbis there prefer a sword to avoid a gruesome death.

<b>Severing for Kings</b> <br>Why doesn't the Gemara ask about causing pain to animals, as it does later regarding marketplaces of idolaters? There, it's not bal tashchit (wastefulness), as it's for the king's honour, like expensive shrouds. But animal suffering remains! Perhaps a king's honour is different, representing all of Israel, thus overriding animal suffering.

Line 14

<b>Severing That Causes Treifah</b> <br>Rashi explains it's forbidden to make an animal unfit for consumption by severing the sciatic nerve. [But are they sacred animals? And what about bal tashchit for non-kosher animals?] The Tosefta (Tosefta Shabbat 8:10) implies "forbidden/permitted" refers to eating. It states, "Severing the sciatic nerve for kings is permitted, and not like Amorite ways. Severing that causes treifah is forbidden for eating but permitted for benefit. Severing without treifah is permitted for eating." [Why state the obvious about treifah?] It clarifies that benefit is permitted, despite the king's honour. It also clarifies that eating is permitted in the other case, again despite the king's honour.

"We do not place an animal in gentile inns"
The Gemara teaches that one is also prohibited from handing over an animal to their gentile shepherd. The question arises: What is our basis for relying on allowing our animals to be left alone with them, as we often do? Additionally, we even entrust our animals to their shepherds.
It cannot be explained based on what Rav said earlier in the first chapter (Avodah Zarah 14b), "In a place where it is permitted to sell, it is permitted to leave the animal alone," because that explanation does not hold; even Rav ultimately retracted that position.
Rather, Rabbeinu Tam explains that we rely on Rabbi Pedat's answer in the Gemara (23a), which establishes that the Mishnah follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who is concerned about bestiality, whereas the baraita—which permits purchasing animals from them for sacrifices—follows the Sages, who are not concerned about this. Since we follow the Sages, this concern does not apply to us.
And although Ravina, who represented the later authorities, disagreed with Rabbi Pedat and offered a different explanation, Rabbi Pedat's reasoning appears more compelling for several reasons:
Rabbi Pedat's interpretation precedes Ravina's, as Rabbi Pedat lived many years before Ravina. Rabbi Pedat was the son of Rabbi Eliezer, as stated in the first chapter of Berakhot (11b), and he was also a colleague of Rabbi Zeira, as stated in the first chapter of Niddah (8a): Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Pedat, "See, from you and your father the world receives blessing." That Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Pedat's father, was a student of Rabbi Yochanan.
Furthermore, in matters of rabbinic decrees, we follow the more lenient opinion.
And although the anonymous Mishnah, "We do not place [an animal in gentile inns]," is established according to Rabbi Eliezer, nevertheless, the halacha does not follow him, because there is a dispute about this in Masechet Parah (Chapter 2, Mishnah 1), and in two tractates everyone agrees that there is no fixed order of precedence (ein seder).

Rashi's commentary: The rabbis decreed [that one must not eat "stewed" or cooked foodstuffs of a non-Jew] because of the concern lest they eat impure things. And more [than this concern] it seems that the reason [for this decree] is because of [the concern] of intermarriages [between Jews and non-Jews]. And thus [in] Chapter 5 of the Mishnah, the great Rabbi Abraham son of Rabbi David said certainly lashes [are given because] the sages forbade a non-Jew from cooking in his house [for a Jew], but if he [i.e. the non-Jew] cooks in the house of a Jew, there is no suspicion of either intermarriage or of eating impure things. But Rabbeinu Tam did not agree with him, that certainly when it comes to a non-Jew cooking, the sages did not divide the general principle [of forbidding food cooked by a non-Jew] between the domain of the Jew and the domain of the non-Jew, because there is always a suspicion lest one is not careful also in the home of the Jew in the same manner that one is careful in the home of the non-Jew

The Torah only prohibited the celestial servants in the upper realm" - Rabbi Yitzchak explained that all of these answers given by Abaye are indeed valid, for since he did not say in each case that he was retracting, but instead simply stated, 'Abaye said,' it implies that he was not changing his opinion. Rather, initially, he derived from the verse a prohibition concerning the servants of the lower realm, such as the Temple and its hall, and then subsequently prohibited the servants in the upper realm, such as the Seraphim, the Ophanim, and the lower heavens—namely, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, which are set in the second firmament.

Since Rabban Gamliel had others make it for him – Rabbi Elchanan posed a difficulty, as it appears that Rabban Gamliel instructed a non-Jew to make it, yet instructing a non-Jew (to perform work) is rabbinically prohibited (shvut), even for something unrelated to Shabbat, as we say in the chapter 'The Hired Workers' (Bava Metzia 90a) regarding 'Muzzle my ox and thresh with it.' One could answer that a mitzvah is different. Some want to be stringent and not have a non-Jew make an impression with a human image for a loan unless the non-Jew offers to do so on their own. Similarly, they should not wear belts that have a raised human image. However, there is a basis for leniency in the Hilchot Gedolot, which discusses the case of Rav Yehuda regarding a dragon image, where suspicion of idolatry applies more than with other images, as it states: 'One who finds utensils with a dragon image, etc., should take them to the Dead Sea.' And with an anderetai (a carved likeness), the concern for suspicion arose because it was a statue of a full human figure, with arms and legs.

Line 11

And behold, Rav Yehudah—others made (it) for him.  Explanation: and even so, Shmuel warned him not to keep it, unless he would blind its eye so that they would not suspect him of having made it and (thus) transgressed 'You shall not make (idols) and (the Gemara) answers: Rav Yehudah's case was different, because its seal was protruding and it was not due to suspicion of making (an idol), but rather due to suspicion of idol worship.
