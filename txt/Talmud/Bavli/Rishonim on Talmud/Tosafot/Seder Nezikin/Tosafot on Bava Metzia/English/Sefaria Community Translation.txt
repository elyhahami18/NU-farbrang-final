<b>Mishnah - <i>Elu Metziot Shelo</i>:</b> Bundles in a public area -  It is specifically with bundles that it distinguishes between a public area and a private area: <b>As according</b> to the one that holds (later, on Bava Metzia 22b) that an identifying mark that is prone to be trampled is [considered] an identifying mark, and that a place is an identifying mark - it is speaking here when there is no identifying mark; and the place is also not an identifying mark in a public area, because they roll around. But the place is an identifying mark in a private area - such that one would be obligated to announce [them when they are found there]. And that is speaking about when it is found in the manner of  being placed down (intentionally). But bread of a baker and round cakes of figs do not have an identifying mark, so they are [the finder's] even in a private area. And that is speaking about when he found it in the manner of [something] being dropped - hence the place is not an identifying mark. And if you will say, "Why does it mention bundles, in the manner of being placed down, more than the other [cases] - about which it is speaking in the manner of being dropped" - one can say that because the bundles are expensive, they would not have been dropped without his awareness (he would be more mindful about them). Rather, [the case would be] that when he stopped to rest, he placed them on the ground and forgot them there. However, the bread [from the kitchen] of a homeowner has an identifying mark, for homeowners are accustomed to make an identifying mark on their bread. Hence even [if they were found] in a public area, one is obligated to announce [them] - for an identifying mark that is prone to be trampled is [considered] an identifying mark. And [the reason] that the place is an identifying mark with piles of fruit or piles of money even in a public place - as it says later on - is because rolling around is not applicable to them. And if you will say, "How can [finders] take bundles in a public place when it is speaking about [them being found in] the manner of being placed down - behold, we say later that one may not take [an object when there is] a doubt that it was placed down, and all the more so [when it is] certain" - one can say that those words (that case) is when he finds [it] in a hidden and guarded place, such that he should not take it if there is no identifying mark; and if there is an identifying mark, he takes [it] and announces [it]. <b>And according</b> to the one that holds (later, on Bava Metzia 22b) that an identifying mark that is prone to be trampled is not [considered] an identifying mark, and that a place is also not an identifying mark - it is speaking about bundles that have an identifying mark. And hence one announces it [when it was found] in a private area. But the bread of the baker and the rest of [the cases in] our mishnah do not have an identifying mark. And hence they are his, even [if they were found] in a private area. However, he is obligated to announce the bread [from the kitchen] of a homeowner that has an identifying mark, even [when found] in a public place - as it is not something that is prone to be trampled, since we do not pass by food [without picking it up]. And our entire mishnah is speaking about whether [the object] was [found] in the manner of being dropped or whether it was in the manner of being placed down. And if you will say, "If the bundles were in the manner of being dropped, hence [the one who dropped them] does not know where they are; so why does he need to announce [them] - behold [the owner has abandoned them, since he believes that they fell in the public area" - one can say that even though he is not able to determine the place [where he dropped it], he knows whether it fell in a public area or a private area.

Line 11

And how much? Rabbi Yitzchak says, "One <i>kav</i> in four [by four] cubits" - and it must be said that Rabbi Yitzchak himself inquired, "And how much?" For if the gemara inquired, "And how much," let it establish [the case as being in] the manner of  being dropped, and even more [than a <i>kav</i>] - as the gemara challenges after this. Rather [the question] is from the words of Rabbi Yitzchak. And Rabbi Yitzchak may not establish [the case to be] in the manner of being dropped and even more, because he holds - like Abbaye - that abandonment without intention is not [considered] abandonment. Rather, he establishes it to be in the gathering [of grain] on the threshing floor, such that he left them there intentionally. And likewise in this way is it found in our chapter (Bava Metzia 30b) that when it inquires, "And forever? Rav Yehuda [answers], etc." - it must be said that Rav Yehudah said, "And forever?" And likewise in the chapter [entitled] <i>Lo Yachpor</i> (Bava Batra 22b, and Tosafot there, s.v. and how much) concerning distancing from windows, such that it says, "And how much? Rav Yeiva said, 'The full width of the window.'"

Line 14

A half-<i>kav</i> in an area of two cubits, what is [the law] - It is a wonder: Is a <i>kav</i> in four cubits not also a half-<i>kav</i> in two cubits (is the ratio not the same); so what is he inquiring? And one can say that since there is only a half-<i>kav</i>, he will take [them] since there is no exertion [beyond this] to finish. But [with] a <i>kav</i> in four cubits, since there is exertion to take all of it, he does not take [them] at all. Or also (another answer), a <i>kav</i> in four by four cubits is [the same as] half a <i>kav</i> in two cubits width by four cubits length, whereas here he is inquiring about two cubits by two cubits.

Come and hear, one who finds coins, etc. - It is a wonder: Since it already brought a difficulty from our mishnah about scattered coins, why does it also challenge from this baraita? And also why did Rabbi Yitzhak not say his piece about our mishnah? And it can be said that it was stronger for it to raise a difficulty on the baraita, since it implies that it is the [finder's] in all cases - even in the case where there is an identifying mark, since it establishes the reason to be because the multitudes are found there. And it is also implied [that this is the case] even though the owner of the lost object was still in the study hall when [the finder] picked it up, and he didn't know that it had fallen from him. 

Line 11

Line 13

And exempt from tithes - In Tractate Peah 4:1, it is shown that it is only when he renders it ownerless before the end of the work [on the produce] that it is exempt from tithes. But if he renders it ownerless after the end of the work, when he was already obligated in tithes, there is nothing in this. And here too is it is speaking about after the end of the work, such that they have not yet dried - as it is shown in Beitzah 34b, the chapter [entitled] Hamevie - that the end of the work of figs that are ready to be spread out in the field and to be made into dried figs, is not until they are dried. And even if the finder claimed them before they dried, they are [still] exempt from tithes, as we say in Bava Kamma 28a, "One who renders his vineyard ownerless and arose early in the morning and harvested it [...] is exempt from tithes." But it is not like this concerning consecrated property (<i>hekdesh</i>). As if he consecrated [it] before the end of the work and it was redeemed before the end of the work, it is [still] obligated in tithes, as it is somewhat shown in the chapter [entitled] HaOmer (Kiddushin 62b). 

Line 14

The fig tree, too, one knows that [the figs] fell - The explantion: Granted, [in the case of] the fig trees, [taking the figs is] permissible - since it is common that they fall, [the owner] abandons them from the beginning. For he thinks that the finder will take them, for [the latter] did not know that it fell from a tree, but rather thinks that it fell from passers-by. But with olives and carobs, it is forbidden, for they are not prone to falling. Even though if [the owner knew that it fell], he would abandon [it] - as passers-by would take [it], since they would assume that it fell from [other] passers-by. [But] now that they did not know, they would think [the olives or carobs] did not fall - [so] it would be forbidden, as it would be abandonment without awareness. But according to Rava, why would it be forbidden? And if you will say, "If it is the law to assume [the fruit came from] passers-by, and not from the tree adjacent to it, why is it forbidden with olives and carobs" - one can say that according to the law, we certainly do not assume [it was] from passers-by, but from the tree; however, the owners will abandon [the fruit nevertheless], as they think that passers-by who are not upstanding will decide upon a dispensation for the fruit that they find, and assume they were from passers-by. And if you will say, "If so, what is the challenge it presents to Rava; let us say that olives and carobs are forbidden because even after the owners know that they fell, they do not abandon [them], since they know that the finder will not take them; as he will assume that they fell from the tree, as is the truth, since one should not assume [they were] from passers-by - one can say, if they do not abandon [them in the case of] the fig tree, why would [the figs] be permitted? However there are books [of the Talmud] that have the variant, "an olive is different, since its olive tree (<i>zaito</i>) proves about it." For with this, that which we raised as a difficulty is answered. That is to say that since they are below the olive tree, the owners will think that the finder will not take them, to assume [them] from passers-by. But "a fig becomes disgusting with its fall" - the explanation is, it gets dirty and is disgusting to him, so he renders it ownerless. But in most books, we have the variant, "since its appearance (<i>chazuto</i>) proves about it; and even though the olives fall, [the finder] knows that the place of a person is that person's" - the explanation is, olives that fell are similar to olives [still] standing on the tree; and therefore even when the owners know they fell, they will not abandon [them], as they know that the ones that find them will not take them. But "a fig dissolves (<i>nimiset</i>) with its fall" - this is the variant in Arukh - <i>nimiset</i> without an aleph - so they are not similar to those on the tree. And also we can follow the variant [that has] <i>nimaeset</i> (becomes disgusting) - and because it becomes dirty, it is not similar to a fig on the tree.

And if not, his separation of terumah is not valid – And if you say, in the chapter (Ketubot 99b ) we say that the default for a homeowner is one-fiftieth, and if the agent reduced or increased by ten [parts], his separation of terumah is valid because the homeowner can say, ‘This is how I estimated you’. Here too, let us say the same. And it can be answered that there it is all within the range of the measure of terumah, as some separate this way and some separate that way, and therefore he can say, ‘Since you did not specify for me, this is how I estimated you.’ But regarding mif'ot [an extraordinary or unconventional action], it is not customary to separate terumah in that way, and therefore he should not have separated in any such manner without the owner’s permission.

"If there is no identifying mark, what does he announce?" – This means: why should the finder need to make an announcement if the lost item has no identifying mark that the owner could provide? The Gemara answers that the finder announces the location where the item was found. Similarly, later (Bava Metzia 28a), when it is stated that one must walk three days forward and three days back and announce for one day, it also refers to the finder making an announcement, and the owner providing an identifying detail. However, there is a difficulty from the passage in Pesachim (49b), where it says that one does not announce the lost items of an am ha'aretz (an unlearned person). How, then, would we know whether the item belongs to an am ha’aretz? One could say that this applies in a place where amei ha’aretz are commonly found. Rashi explains that the finder announces the location, saying, “I found an item in such-and-such a place,” and the owner would then respond with “I lost such-and-such an item” and reclaim it. However, this is difficult, since we learned in our chapter (28a) that if one merely states, “I lost an item,” without providing any identifying marks, it is considered meaningless. This implies that merely identifying the object is not sufficient as proof of ownership. It can be answered that in that case (on 28a), the reason it is not accepted is not that we suspect the claimant of lying about losing an item, but rather because the finder could argue: “Just as you lost such an item, someone else may have lost the same kind of item.” However, in this case, we assume that it is uncommon for two people to lose an identical item in the same location. According to Rashi’s explanation, the meaning of “announcing the location” here should be understood literally, just as the announcement of the quantity of money found (mentioned at the end of the first chapter, 20a).

Ein ma’avirin al ha’ochlin"—Meaning, one is not permitted to pass over food, as Rashi explained, but rather, one must lift it. However, it is incorrect to explain that "ein ma’avirin" means "one does not trample upon food," as stated in Eruvin 64b, where Rabban Gamliel told Rabbi Ilai, "Take the loaf," because of "ein ma’avirin." This implies that he needed to lift it. Furthermore, the passage there states: "But in later generations, since people are more involved in sorcery, they do pass over [the food]." If "ein ma’avirin" meant "do not trample," then the statement about later generations being involved in sorcery would imply that they do trample, whereas here it seems that in places where people are concerned about sorcery, they do not trample at all.
Therefore, it must be explained as I have stated—that "ein ma’avirin" means one must lift the food rather than pass over it

From the fact that weight is considered a distinguishing mark (siman), measure and number are also considered distinguishing marks—this implies that measure (i.e., size or dimensions) is preferable. And if you ask: But don’t we say (later, in Bava Metzia 28a) that a lost item should be returned to one who provides its weight rather than one who provides its length and width? This implies that weight is a superior distinguishing mark. The answer is that this applies specifically to a garment, where it is not the usual practice to weigh it. In that case, weight is indeed the better distinguishing mark.

For he (the lander) may take out the collateral... Rashi explains that will make him (the borrower)  disquilifed from testimony and from swearing, (if he is proven wrong after he swore).
 this is difficult to Rabanu Tam, for is this is the reason (that the borrower may be proven wrong) would only encourage the borrower to be more precise when he swears, so he should not be able to be proven wrong, and why would we establish a rule to help a lier (by placing the pledge on the lander, so the borrower does not get caught lying). and if your concern is that possibly the borrower will swear in truth (about the collaterals value) and the lander will take out a ruined collateral and that would make it seam like the borrower lied). if so (that we are concerned about the collateral being ruined and decreasing in value) why does the Gemera suggest later on that the borrower can try and find the thief, if that wont prove he is right. (for we are concerned that their is a decrease in value). so if are concern is that it may be valued more then the borrower swears, this will only lead for him to be careful with his pledge?
so it seems to Rabanu Tam like Rabanu Channel  for (if the lander takes out the collateral) it seems like the borrower swore for no reason. and its a disgrace to swear when its possible that we will find out the value when the lander takes it out, but if the lander will swear he will only do it once he is sure that the object wont be found.

The Gemara uses this particular language because of Bat Sheva was a doubtfully married woman. Rashi interpreted that it is because ever man who went to one of David’s wars signed a Gett, on the condition that if he dies, she will be expelled and she would not require יבום (divorce), and all of the days he is out at war she would be considered doubtfully married. And this is a difficulty for Rabeinu Tam that if this is so, it is not “all men”, it is only if they had brothers and did not have children. However, Rashi is not particular when he says “יבום”, rather she will not be tied down (become an Agunah).

<b>If one cut [an earthenware oven widthwise] into segments and placed sand between each and every segment:</b> If there was no sand between them, Rabbi Eliezer would have conceded that it is considered a vessel (and so susceptible to impurity), since the plaster around the oven connects the segments and structures them one next to the other. So it is because it was learned [in a mishnah, that] sand between them is to separate the segments from one another that Rabbi Eliezer renders it pure. And it is learned thus in Tractate Kelim (5:8), "If an oven was cut up by its width into segments that are each less than four handbreadths in height, it is ritually pure. If he plastered it over with clay, it becomes susceptible to ritual impurity when it is heated to a degree that suffices for the baking of spongy cakes. If he distanced the plastering and put sand or gravel in between, of such an oven it has been said, 'A menstruant as well as (a ritually impure woman and) a ritually pure woman may bake in it and it remains ritually pure.'" It taught [here that] sand is similar to gravel, as it is dry.

Daf 59b



Line 1

<b>And this is the oven of <i>akhnai</i>:</b> Some have the version, <i>chakhnai</i>, and so is it in the Yerushalmi. And this <i>chakhan</i> is a snake. But perhaps the name of the owner of the oven who made [it] is like this.

Line 5

<b>It is not in heaven:</b> And that which it said in the first chapter of Yevamot (Yevamot 14a; and see Tosafot on Yevamot 14a, s.v. Rabbi) that the law is like the House of Hillel because a Divine Voice emerged - it is different here; since it is coming to disagree with words of the Torah, as it is written (Exodus 23:2), "After a majority to incline." Whereas there it is just the opposite, the House of Hillel is the majority [such that the law would follow them even without the Divine Voice], if it were not that we were in doubt if we follow the majority, because the House of Shammai is very sharp. And also (another answer) is that here the Divine Voice only emerged on account of the honor of Rabbi Eliezer, who said, "Heaven will prove [it]." And that which it said over there that [disregarding the Divine Voice] is [always the position of] Rabbi Yehoshua, who said that we do not pay attention to a Divine Voice - yet we do not hear it from Rabbi Yehoshua except in this incident of Rabbi Eliezer from here - it is making an exact inference there: Since he says, "It is not in heaven, the Torah was already given from Sinai," it is implied that we do not pay attention [to it] in any place.
<b>He, smiled and said, "My children have triumphed over Me":</b> And that which it said at the beginning of Avodah Zarah (3b), "There is no more laughter in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, since the Temple was destroyed" - that is fixed [laughter], whereas here it is just [regarding] a joke that He said.

Line 6



Line 7

<b>He rent his garments and removed his shoes:</b> It cannot be proven from here [about] that which it asked in Moed Katan (Moed Katan 15b; and see Tosafot on Moed Katan, s.v. La), whether one excommunicated must rent his garments and remove his shoes. As perhaps here, he is only doing it from plain distress.

Line 11

<b>From the house of the father of my father:</b> [Rashi] explained, "From the House of David, the patriarch of the family. As she was the daughter of leaders (<i>nesiim</i>), and they are from the House of David."
<b>Except for the gates of mistreatment:</b> [Rashi continues to explain,] "Since [it refers to] the pain of the heart; and it is close to [causing] tears to come down." It is implied [that he explained it this way] because it is derived earlier (59a:5) from a verse in Tehillim (Psalms 39:13). But he forced this for no reason. As behold Rav Chisda expounded earlier (59a:7) explicitly from that which it is written (Amos 7:7), "behold, the Lord stood upon a wall built with a plumb line" (the term for mistreatment and the term for plumb line are spelled in a similar manner). But perhaps she received [the tradition] from the House of Rabban Gamliel [the Elder], as he was the patriarch of the family; and it was not said about David. It is as we find (Rosh HaShanah 25a) also, that Rabban Gamliel said, "I received it from the house of the father of my father, that sometimes [the new moon] comes by a long [path]."

Before in the case of the river overflowing, he didn’t differentiate between if it was likely to overflow or it was not likely to overflow, because, you would think that he would only have agricultural ditches if it was needed regularly, so it must be that the river overflowed regularly (Why can’t we just say that the ditch is just to make it easier for the workers, that they can just put the water from the river right into the ditch? We have to answer that ditches are only made for when the river overflows, and not just for workers). And he doesn’t differentiate between if they are from the city or not, because even if they are from that city, it would still be the Ba’al Habayis’es loss. Because, it is not their problem to know how his field works, if it has ditches or whatever. So, if the river overflows, only the ball habayis would that HIS field was watered. But if the river stops, the whole city would know.

If it was taken "in the way it was going" (בדרך הליכתה), he says to him, "Behold, yours is in front of you" (הרי שלך לפניך). The Commentary Explains: (This refers to a commentary, likely the Rashi commentary on the Talmud) If the donkey was being led along the road that the renter wanted to go, the owner says, "Behold, yours is in front of you." And the renter can hire another animal until he gets there. Question: Why should he hire another animal? Shouldn't the owner provide it? (This is a question being posed in the text, highlighting the dilemma.) Answer: If the renter doesn't need the donkey for the journey, only for the return, then it's a different matter (הוי א"ש). (This suggests that there's a distinction in the law depending on the renter's need for the donkey). Rejection: But if so, shouldn't we have distinguished between needing the donkey immediately and only needing it for the return? (This is a point of contention, suggesting that the text should have addressed this distinction). It seems according to R. Chananel's Commentary: (This refers to the commentary of Rabbi Chananel) He interprets "in the way it was going" (בדרך הליכתה) to mean that the king's servants aren't searching houses but are only taking animals that they encounter on the road. The Owner Says: "Yours is in front of you." He can say that the renter's bad luck (מזלך גרם) caused this, and if the animal had been in the house (שאילו היתה בבית), it wouldn't have been taken. Even if it isn't returned: This is unlike when the donkey died, because here, the renter's bad luck (מזלא דידיה גורם) is clearly the cause. If it was taken not "in the way it was going," (שלא בדרך הליכתה) meaning they were searching in houses: Then the owner must provide a replacement donkey immediately (לאלתר) for the renter to do his work, because this wasn't the result of bad luck (לא מזלו של שוכר גורם). Even if the king's servants return the donkey: The renter shouldn't have to delay his work (אין לו לשוכר להתעכב ממלאכתו), so the owner should provide a replacement until the original donkey is back. This is unlike when the donkey was injured (הבריקה) or went mad (נשתטתה). (These are specific situations that are not directly related to the owner's responsibility). 
By inference one can learn that according to the opinion of the first tanna there is no difference and Shmuel is refuted, as tanna kamma considered like a majority opinion versus the individual.

<b>If you return, etc.:</b> From this, Rabbenu Tam said that Reish Lakish knew much at first, except that he removed the yoke of Torah [from himself], became an ignoramus and occupied himself with brigandry. Since he said, "If you return" - it implies, being like [you were] at first, and not to remove the yoke of Torah from upon you. And also [since] he said, "What benefit did you provide me, there they called me, Master" - meaning at first they also called me, Master, except I forgot [my learning]. And that which [Rashi] explained - "Master," is the master of the brigands - does not appear [correct]. Even though [it is true] that we find in Tractate Avodah Zarah (17b), "What is the reason they call you, Master? I am the master of weavers." And this is [also the explanation of] that which we say in the chapter [entitled] Kol Kitvei (Shabbat 119b), "Said Reish Lakish to Rabbi Yehudah Nesiah, 'So have I received it from my fathers' - and some say, from your fathers - 'any city that does not have children in a rabbi's school, etc.'" This implies that before Rabbi Yochanan taught him, he studied from others.
<b>If you return:</b> Later it is shown that he married [her]; as it says, "His sister came and she cried in front of him." And [Reish Lakish] was not concerned about, perhaps they will say that this one returned (repented) because of this, in the way that it was a concern later (Bava Metzia 85b). 

Line 13

<b>The knife, the dagger [...], from when are they susceptible to impurity:</b> Rabbenu Tam found it difficult - for we learn in Tractate Kelim, Chapter 14 (14:5), "A sword and a knife, from when does it become susceptible to impurity? The sword, from when it has been polished; and the knife, from when it has been sharpened." And that is not like Rabbi Yoachanan and not like Reish Lakish! But it appears that that mishnah is about when they got rusty and one comes to fix them. As it is learned in the Tosefta, "A sword and a knife that became rusty are pure. [If] one polishes them or sharpens them (they are susceptible to impurity). But at the beginning, their completion [which makes them susceptible to impurity], is as it is explained in our discussion (here in the Gemara). And it appears that, "polishes" refers to the sword; and "sharpens" refers to the knife, even though it is taught in the plural (them). So then the Tosefta is like the Mishnah.

King Shapur -- The correct explanation appears to accord with Rashi (that King Shapur here refers to the actual King Shapur, not the sage Shemuel who is sometimes called King Shapur), for King Shapur was an expert in Jewish law, as it says at the end of Tractate Avodah Zarah (76b), that he stabbed the knife ten times into hard earth when he cut the citron with a knife for Rav Yehudah.
