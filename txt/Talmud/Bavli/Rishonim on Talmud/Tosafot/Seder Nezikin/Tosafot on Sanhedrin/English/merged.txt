<b>It is the Way of Boiling the Torah Forbade</b> And with fat it is not considered boiling, rather frying, like it says in Rashi. And that which we call pan roasted as boiling in the chapter of 'Kol Shaah' (Pesachim 41a) is different there, because there it says "and boiled" (Exodus 12:9) with anything (any form of liquid here, including fat, would be considered boiling). And there are those that say that the Torah prohibited boiling [in milk], because without boiling [in milk], [the food] would have been allowed; through boiling [in milk] it (the food) was prohibited - to exclude [the thought that we are referring to] forbidden fat, because [cooking in forbidden fat] is prohibited either way. This explanation is difficult because if you have forbidden fat and [meat from animal which] died, this is forbidden also with the prohibition of forbidden fat, as it says in the chapter of 'Kol Habasar' (Chulin 113b and 115a) according to one who says that multiple prohibitions can stack - and we say over there that forbidden fat and an animal which died doesn't need an extra verse to prohibit it.

"and they will cease on their own" -- the interpretation is that their prophecy will cease, because the Shechinah does not descend in the midst of sadness, but rather in the midst of joy.

and these are the ones ineligible -- there is a version of our mishna that adds the word "avadim." Whoever has this version, thinks that our mishna lists people who are disqualified on a rabbinical (d'rabanan) and torah (d'oreita) level. But this is not correct since our mishna deals only with people who are disqualified based on d'rabanan. For example, a thief (gazlan) is not listed since he is pasul d'oreita. (Even though it seems like the things listed are פסולי דאורייתא Tosfot will prove how they are not because the person did not have willful intent to violate the torah.) 
1) Dice players: Even according to those who consider it asmachta since there is no valid transaction so it is stealing and therefore an איסור דאורייתא, it is not פסול דאורייתא since he does not have the intent to violate a prohibition. And according to those who invalidate it because it is not "ישובו של עולם (contributing to society)", it is certainly only פסול דרבנן.
2) Those who lend on interest: This is speaking about interest that is not fixed and therefore only איסור דרבנן. And even if it was talking about ריבית שקצוצה, this is not איסור because the debtor gives the money of his own free will, in which case the creditor is only פסול מדרבנן.
3) Pigeon racers: These are also פסול מדרבנן since bird flying is racing and therefore gambling, so the same concept of asmachta applies here. And according to those who interpret "מפריחי יונים" as "ארא" (pigeons that are trained to bring back pigeon's from another), this is only forbidden by the rabbis to keep the peace.
4) People who deal with shmitah produce: this only speaks about sheviit nowadays, which is only איסור דרבנן since most people live outside of Israel. And even if the mishna is talking about sheviit d'oreita, it is not considered an איסור since they are helping the poor.

"In what did He immerse?" -- the heretic did not ask, "how was He allowed to become impure [by burying Moshe]?". This is because the Jews are called children of God [and kohanim are allowed to become impure for their deceased children].

s.v. "And behold, Fructification and Muliplication": It is astonishing -- why do you think it was not said to gentiles? And if it is because it was not counted in the Seven Noahide Laws -- behold v.s. [Sanhedrin 58b] "rise-and-do laws are not counted." And possibly this is also an abide-and-refrain, because He who commanded Fructification and Multiplication also commanded not to waste semen.

<b>To remove the tefillin:</b> [Rashi] explained, [those] of Rabbi Eliezer. Even though Rabbi Eliezer did not move from one place, it is called a rabbinic Shabbat prohibition. As anything with which the Sages prohibited one to go out to the public domain, it is [also] forbidden to go out with it to the courtyard. And the law is the same even if he sits in one place - it is forbidden. 
<b>How can they neglect a prohibition [punishable by] stoning:</b> It is implied that we first light, and then we remove [the tefillin]. But that is difficult - since in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Madlikin (Shabbat 35b ff.),  it implies the opposite. For we  learned (in a baraita), "The third [shofar blow] is to light the [Shabbat] light - [these are] the words of Rabbi Natan. Rabbi Yehudah says, 'The third is to remove tefillin.'" And [Rashi] explains there, "So he lights with the fourth one." And it cannot be said that he lights with the second one - as it says there, after this, "The second is to light. In accordance with whom? It is neither in accordance with Rabbi Natan nor in accordance with Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi!" Nor can it be said that he lights with the third, and this is what it is saying - the third is also to remove tefillin, but one must always first light. For it said over there, "the third is to light," and it establishes [that position] to be in accordance with Rabbi Natan, and not in accordance with Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi. And there is another difficulty - did Hyrcanus not know his [father's] custom? So it can be said (answered) that the tefillin is certainly first. However, at that time, they delayed lighting because they were preoccupied with his sickness. And that is why he rebuked him.

<b>And their purification is as they are:</b> [Rashi] explained that they argued concerning immersion when they tore - if what is inside it separates [the water and the object] or not. And we do not find this disagreement explicitly. Rather in Chapter 23 of Kelim, it is learned, "A ball, a shoe last, an amulet and tefillin which were torn [after becoming impure] - one who touches them is impure; but one who touches what is inside it is pure." Hence its inside is not considered a connection. But we learned in the Tosefta, "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, 'We can even immerse them as they are.'" Hence since it does not separate during immersion, we understand from this that it is a connection.

<b>He was striking his flesh:</b> And it is not [forbidden] on account of, "Gashes for the dead" (Leviticus 19:28). As he did it for [the sake of the honor of the] Torah - as he said, "I have many coins, but I do not have a money changer to sort them."
