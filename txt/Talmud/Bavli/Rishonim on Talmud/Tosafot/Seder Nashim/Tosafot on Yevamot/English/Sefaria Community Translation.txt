"And the sister of his wife" - there is not to ask that a nidah should be forbidden to the yabham even though she became pure after like the sister of his wife that she isn't done yibbum on even if his wife died after this because it is not similar to the sister of his wife and the rest of arayas of prohibition that stand on the yabham more than the rest of mankind but a niddah to the whole world is prohibited and even in her niddah state it hears from pesahim at the end of chapter "These Things" (pesachim page 72b) that yibbum is applicable to her because rabbi yohanan says that if his wife is a niddah if he venisupered he is liable if his yebhamah is a nidah if he venisupered is unliable and the gemarah asks on it what is the difference of his yebhamah because he is doing a commandment etc. it hears that he acquires her and it also appears to diffrentiate that a sister of a wife even though his wife died after this she is not furthermore attached to yibum since she was exempt one moment because it says "it's ways are ways of pleasantness" (parables 3:17) like it is said in "Some Are Exempt" (later yebhamoth page 87b) and even where she is not pushed from this family completely for example that there is other  she is forbidden to this one that his wife died like it is said in chapter "Four Brothers" (later yebhamoth page 27b) any yebhamah that i don't call in her at the time of falling "her yabham should venisuper her" (devarim 25:5) behold she is like a wife of brother that there is to her children and is forbidden because this isn't 'ways of pleasantness' if there is to here to be attached to this one that she was detached from him but a nidah is 'ways of pleasantness' because to her husband also she needs to wait until she purifies. and regarding a minor later on in chapter "School of Shammai" (yebhamoth page 111a) that rabbah says without this also you can't find to say is there anything that is now is forbidden to him and after this it is permitted to him but behold says rav etc. there also this is not ways of pleasantness if she must wait until he grows up but that which she waits because he is a minor and is not suitable for ventio it is ways of pleasantness because it is not due to prohibition and it is as if the yabham went overseas.
