"And the sister of his wife" - there is not to ask that a nidah should be forbidden to the yabham even though she became pure after like the sister of his wife that she isn't done yibbum on even if his wife died after this because it is not similar to the sister of his wife and the rest of arayas of prohibition that stand on the yabham more than the rest of mankind but a niddah to the whole world is prohibited and even in her niddah state it hears from pesahim at the end of chapter "These Things" (pesachim page 72b) that yibbum is applicable to her because rabbi yohanan says that if his wife is a niddah if he venisupered he is liable if his yebhamah is a nidah if he venisupered is unliable and the gemarah asks on it what is the difference of his yebhamah because he is doing a commandment etc. it hears that he acquires her and it also appears to diffrentiate that a sister of a wife even though his wife died after this she is not furthermore attached to yibum since she was exempt one moment because it says "it's ways are ways of pleasantness" (parables 3:17) like it is said in "Some Are Exempt" (later yebhamoth page 87b) and even where she is not pushed from this family completely for example that there is other  she is forbidden to this one that his wife died like it is said in chapter "Four Brothers" (later yebhamoth page 27b) any yebhamah that i don't call in her at the time of falling "her yabham should venisuper her" (devarim 25:5) behold she is like a wife of brother that there is to her children and is forbidden because this isn't 'ways of pleasantness' if there is to here to be attached to this one that she was detached from him but a nidah is 'ways of pleasantness' because to her husband also she needs to wait until she purifies. and regarding a minor later on in chapter "School of Shammai" (yebhamoth page 111a) that rabbah says without this also you can't find to say is there anything that is now is forbidden to him and after this it is permitted to him but behold says rav etc. there also this is not ways of pleasantness if she must wait until he grows up but that which she waits because he is a minor and is not suitable for ventio it is ways of pleasantness because it is not due to prohibition and it is as if the yabham went overseas.

Line 1

The graves of gentiles do not render items impure through a tent - This is astonishing! Why did R. Banna'ah mark [above] the cave the place of Abraham our father and Adam the first [man] (Bava Batra 58a), even though Adam and Abraham are called "man"? Even according to the Rabbis, who say that graves of gentiles render items impure through a tent [this is difficult]; Even graves of Israelites render items impure through a tent only for those who died after the passage "when a man dies (yamut) in a tent" (Numbers 19:14) was said, for "yamut" connotes those who will die! Also, in Nazir (54a) we needed a verse to include impurity imparted by touching for a grave [of one who died] before the giving of the Torah. This implies that it does not render items impure through a tent! (Tosafot on Bava Batra 58a answered that since Adam and Abraham are called "man", we do not exclude them from rendering items impure through a tent. Others say that before the giving of the Torah, all graves rendered items impure through a tent, or he marked them merely for honour (in Ramban ibid), or that Abraham had the law of an Israelite, for he observed the entire Torah, and also Adam was a prophet (Ritva ibid).
And the gentiles are not called "man" - This is astonishing, as in Avodah Zarah (3a) and Sanhedrin (59a), we expound that a gentile who engages in Torah is like a Kohen Gadol because the verse states: “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, which if a man do, and shall live by them” (Leviticus 18:5). It is not stated: Priests, Levites, and Israelites, but rather the general term "man". Rashi explains in Sanhedrin (ibid) that that drashah is unlike R. Shimon here. We can say so according to the texts there that say R. Yirmeyah. However, according to the texts that say R. Meir, this is difficult; We know that R. Meir holds (Keritsut 6b) that one who anoints a gentile with the official anointing oil [that has been consecrated] is exempt; It connotes that this is because it says "on flesh of man", and gentiles are not called man! We can say that R. Meir exempts because the people commanded not to anoint (i.e. Israelites), one may not anoint them. Those not commanded not to anoint, there is no prohibition to anoint them. Rabbeinu Tam explains that "man" and "the man" are different. Gentiles are included in "the man". But surely, it says "it does not say Priests, Levites and Israelites"! (If "man" excludes gentiles, it should have said "it does not say "man""!) This means that it does not say "man", which would connote Priests, Levites and Israelites, rather, "the man". [Support for this is that] in all the verses we ask from, it says "man". We do not ask from verses that say "the man". Rabbeinu Meshulam used to say: Only regarding punishments, we say "[only] you are called "man"." [G-d] did not want to explicitly write Israel regarding punishments; However, regarding "which if a man do, and shall live by them", [if this excluded gentiles], it should have written explicitly Priests, Levites and Israelites, like it normally writes everywhere. Why do we ask from these verses, even though also gentiles are called "man"? Even so, we ask. Since regarding punishments Israelites are called "man", when the verse discusses only gentiles, it should not have called them "man". But surely it says "when a man rose up against us" (Psalms 124:2)! This is because the verse mentions G-d's Name. The same applies to "yet you are a man, and not G-d" (Ezekiel 28:2) regarding Hiram. But surely it says "I will give men in exchange for you" (Isaiah 43:4)! We expound in Berachot (62b) "do not read this "Adam", [rather, Edom]." But surely it says "and He has given the earth to the children of men" (Psalms 115:16) and we expound from this (Gittin 47a) that gentiles can acquire [land in the land of Israell]! [The verse calls them] children of Adam the first [man].
