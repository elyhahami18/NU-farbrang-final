If he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two - Rashi explains: If he did not talk he says one blessing - for both that of the hand and that of the head. If he talked, he says two blessings - "To lay the Tefillin" for that of the hand, and "concerning the precept of Tefillin" for that of the head. But Rabbeinu Tam explained: If he did not talk, he says one blessing - On that of the head he says (only one blessing) for that of the head: "Concerning the precept of tefillin," because that is its blessing. If he spoke he says two blessings - for that of the head: "to lay" and "concerning the precept of." And it is also written like this in the Shimusha Rabba D'Tfillin. This is the teaching of my teacher and master.

Line 9

<b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say, "If one affixed [<i>tsitsit</i>] to a garment that already had them affixed, it is fit":</b> It is a wonder: How might you think that Rabbi Zeira does not hold of, "Prepare [it], and not from what has already been prepared." Behold, Rabbi Zeira himself holds from it above! And it can be said (the answer is) that you might have thought that since the beginning of its placement was for the sake of the commandment, "Prepare it, and not from what has already been prepared," does not apply. But above, when it was cut, the [status of the] placement was nullified.

Line 10

<b>It is involved with [violating] "do not add"; it is not considered an action:</b> As since he transgressed a prohibition, it is not considered an action; so [only] at the time of the cutting of the first [strings], is it the making [of the second strings]. So it is not similar to that [case] in the first chapter of Sukkah 11a, in which we do not say their cutting is their making. And this requires [further] investigation. 


Line 11



Line 12

<b>Sky-blue strings are not subject to diverse kinds, and even on a cloak that is exempt:</b> From its saying, "and even," and not saying, "even" – without "and" – it is implied that [also] when it is not [a case of] a cloak that is exempt was it necessary to inform us that there is no [prohibition] on account of diverse kinds. And in this manner did we make an inference in the Chapter [entitled] <i>Taraf Hakalpi</i> (Yoma 46a): Rabbi Meir would say, "[Regarding] limbs of a burnt-offering from a weekday that remained [on the altar and were not fully consumed], one should make an arrangement of wood for them and arrange them [upon it], and even on Shabbat." And the discussion from there shows that we are informed of two things [from Rabbi Meir's statement]. And Rabbenu Tam says that here too are we informed that even at night is there no [prohibition] on account of diverse kinds, even though it is not the time of [the obligation of] <i>tsitsit</i>. For the verse completely permitted diverse kinds within <i>tsitsit</i>. And that which we decreed earlier [regarding diverse kinds] on account of a cloak for the night, is only [regarding] a cloak that is designed specifically for the night. (And Rabbenu Tam contradicts [his] explanation above [in the second entry on this page 40b]:) As a cloak for the day is obligated [to have <i>tsitsit</i>] even at night; and so is it in the first chapter of Kiddushin 34a. And you should know that we say later (Menachot 44a), "[In the case of] a borrowed cloak, it is exempt from <i>tsitsit</i> for thirty days; from then on, it is obligated" – and even [if the <i>tsitsit</i> are] from diverse kinds, even though it is exempt from the Torah (i.e. the obligation is only rabbinic and therefore would not have been able to override a Torah-level prohibition if one existed here). For one can not differentiate, once there is no [prohibition of] diverse kinds for the man to whom it belongs. And so too for women [wearing diverse kinds would be permitted in a cloak (designed) for the day, even though they are exempt from <i>tsitsit</i>]. And that which we say (below, Menachot 43a) concerning the priests (kohanim), "True, [wearing priestly garments that contain diverse kinds] is permitted at the time of the [Temple] service; when not at the time of the service, it is not" - is not similar at all [to the case of <i>tsitsit</i>]. For it is written (Deuteronomy 22:11-12), "Do not wear <i>shatnez</i> (diverse kinds) [...]. Make tassels for yourself" – to say in the case of tassels (<i>tsitsit</i>), you may wear <i>shatnez</i>. [Hence] it is implied that the Torah permitted all [such] wearing. Moreover with a cloak made for his [own] benefit, the verse obligated diverse kinds, whereas [the priest] only [has an obligation to] wear priestly garments at the time of the service. But Rabbenu Tam also said that priestly garments are also permitted not during the time of the service; and this is what was said [in Menachot 43a]: "True, [wearing priestly garments] is permitted at the time of the service," meaning those designed for the service; "when not at the time of the service," meaning those not designed for the service, "it is not permitted." And so is it shown in the Tosefta in Kilaim (Tosefta Kilaim 5:14), as it is learned, "[Regarding] priestly garments and the garments of the high priest, there is no [prohibition] on account of diverse kinds. [In a case of] the garments of a high priest that went into the province [wearing his garments], he is liable; within the Temple, he is exempt - whether to serve or not to serve." And it requires [further] investigation whether night is similar to the province, which is liable. And it can be said that that he is liable [only] rabbinically. And [regarding] that story of Simon the Just in the Chapter [entitled] <i>Ba Lo</i> (Yoma 69a), of "a time to do for the Lord, rescind Your Torah" – rescinding is also applicable with rabbinic [laws]. Nevertheless, it is not implied that way. For it rather looks more likely that he is liable on the Torah level, and one should not compare places [at night] to the province - as there is no dispensation in the province. But you should know that it does not distinguish there between a time that is fitting to serve and a time that is not fitting to serve. And that which we say [in] the Chapter [entitled] <i>Ba Lo</i> (Yoma 69a) concerning [the teaching about] priestly garments that "they fold them and place them under their heads" is not actually under their heads, but rather next to their heads on account of diverse kinds - is about spreading out bedding, which is not similar to wearing which the Torah permits. But regarding <i>tsitsit</i>, there is no distinction between spreading bedding and wearing. And we learned in Sifrei, "A cloak designed [both] for day and for night is obligated in <i>tsitsit</i>. Rabbi Yehudah ben Bava says, 'The Sages specifically negated a woman's garment from [the obligation of] <i>tsitsit</i>, and they obligated her cloak, because her husband covers himself with it." Therefore, it appears that diverse kinds are permitted in <i>tsitsit</i>, whether during the day or during the night, or with a woman.

<b>Do you punish [even for a positive commandment:</b> of this type]. For a man is not obligated to purchase a cloak that requires [<i>tsitsit</i>], if [he] does not [have one]. But concerning a full positive commandment (in which the Torah obligates us to do something), even the earthly court may strike him until he dies.

The middle is preferable. And the explanation of the book [Rashi] is regarding that we read the Torah that we do not read any less than ten verses, and the middle reads four verses, being preferable. And regarding this he brings the baraita there, in the third chapter of Megilah (Megilah 21b) but it is difficult - because they bring also other baraitot, that affirm that the first and the last [alyiot] are preferable [as well]. Therefor it seems that here in our mishnah regarding the three that walk in the way, the bigger is on the middle, as it is said in the chapter "The appointed one said to them" (Yoma 37a) and in Masechet Megillah (Megillah 21b) it brings that since other things are preferable, it is preferable that he reads 4 verses.
