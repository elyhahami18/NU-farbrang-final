if you say that we are relying on the pasuk that says "when you go to sleep" than the verse is only particular about the reading of the shema, but if you that it is relying on the verse of concerning the creation of the world then it is particular about all things, if so the end of the mishna which says   
the seven blessings are corresponding to the phrase "seven times in the day I praised you", but it doesn't count the blessing of "our eyes shall see", because that blessing the rabbis made so that people should wait  for their friends (who were running late) in shul.but this is only true regarding their shuls because they were in the fields and were in danger due to the evil spirits, but in our shuls one must only wait at night,

and if youll say we already taught this once on the tractate of negaim,and it is also brought in the chapter of hearel "if the sun sets he may eat teruma?we can awnser that it is normal for mishnayos to tell us something we already know in short 

Line 14



Daf 2b



Line 1

rashi  explains until the light of the eighth day comes out, and what does it mean "cleansed",that the man cleans himself with the bringing of his sacirfices. and it shocking acc to his explanation the gemera should ask this on the Mishna in hearel, wich says "if the sun came down for him he can eat terumah", how do we know this refers to coming down of the sun? and further more, how can we say that this refers to the coming out of the sun?, for if it were referring to coming out it could have just written "anf the sun came out, why does it say "and the sun came out" like a different pasuk that says "from the coming out of the sun". or it could have said a language of going out like a different verse says "the sun came out on the earth", instead it chose a language of "coming" this makes it clear that were talking about the going  down of the sun. and further more the gemera asks this "coming of the sun" does it refer to the sun coming out and it resolves it from the braisa "the hint for the matter is" acc to rashi who says that the question is that it might be referring the coming out of the sun in the morning then we should resolve this from the Mishna in negaim that says clearly that when the sun comes down is the time when we read the shema? we could say that this is the explaniton, the gms question is, how do you know that this "sun coming" is referring to the sun coming down, witch would be referring to the stars coming out, maybe its referring to the beginning of the sun setting, and this is when  the sun begins to enter the sky, and there is still time to walk 5 mill until the stars come out, and what does it mean "and he was cleansed" that the man was cleansed? and by the saying this we no longer have any difficulty because we can say that the Mishna in hearel is referring to the coming of the sun and therefore we cant resolve from there that the "sun coming " is acttualy referring to the stars coming out. therefore we nedded to bring the braisa of tzeis hacochavim. 

Line 2

even thoguo in several places it says only "becomes clean"  as apposed to   "he cleansed himself", over there one would not would not make a mistake, but here where one could make a mistake it should have written  "and he cleanses himself"

Line 3



Line 4



Line 5

it is surprising if this is the case when the poor man himself eat? because since you said that the time for eating is the time for krias  shema, then as soon as its time to eat he isn't allowed to do so because it is forbidden for one to eat once it is time to recite the shema? as we teach later on: and he reads krias shema and he eats his bread and he blesses, and anyone who disobeys the word of the sages is obligated to be put to death.? and we could that the time for davening is a little bit before the time for eating, witch means that the phrase "from when the poor person comes in to eat" isn't particular with its language rather it means a little bit before that time,that while they are getting his meal ready for him he can daven and read krias shema

And if you'll ask, we know that Rabbi Eliezer holds that in order to read Krias Shema it must be light enough to recognize between blue and green? We can answer that since he knows when the rising of the sun is, by the time he gets up and gets ready it will be the right time.

That Sadducee who was in the neighborhood of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi etc. - it is not the way of the world. Even though the Sadducees etc. "we lower them down but do not raise them up." This refers to being done by a person, but by the hand of Heaven it is not the way of the world to punish them, trouble them, and kill them by the hand of Heaven in an unnatural way unlike how human beings act. And if we read here "idol worshipper" it makes sense, as it says there (in Avodah Zarah) regarding an idol worshipper and shepherds of small animals that we do not raise them up nor lower them down.

Daf 7b



Line 1

It did not state that a person called Him "Adon" - But if you would ask, it is written "Blessed be the L-rd, the G-d of Shem" (Bereishis 9:26)? It can be answered that there it is not spelled with an Alef and Daled, which is the language of "mastership". But if you would ask, why does it not bring the verse "My L-rd (Adonai with Alef-Daled), what will You give me?" (Bereishis 15:2) which is written earlier? It can be answered that the portions (of the Torah) were not stated in order, and there is no chronological order in the Torah, and this verse from the Covenant Between the Parts happened earlier. And so it must be, for Avraham was 70 years old at the Covenant Between the Parts. And "After these events" (Bereishis 15:1) was said after the war with the kings, as Rashi explains in his Torah commentary... And at the war with the kings he was 73 years old, for the entire duration of Sodom was 52 years, as we say in the first chapter of Shabbat (11a) - subtract 12 years that they served Kedorlaomer and 13 years of rebellion, leaving 26 years that it existed peacefully. And at its overturning, Avraham was 99 years old, for the overturning was one year before Yitzchak was born. Subtract those 26 years of tranquility, and it emerges that he was 73 years old at the war with the kings. If so, the portion of the Covenant Between the Parts was 3 years before the portion of "After these events," and that portion concludes "And He reckoned it to him as righteousness" - and therefore it brings that verse of "How shall I know?" because it came earlier. And with this, Rashbam reconciles that in one place it implies it was night, as it says "and count the stars" (15:5), and after that it says "and the sun was about to set" (15:12) implying it was day? Rather, it must be that these are two separate portions that were not said at one time, and "there is no chronological order in the Torah."

Rav Sheshet would turn his face away and study - But if you would ask, did we not say in Sotah (39b) - "What is meant by the verse 'And when it was opened, all the people stood' (Nehemiah 8:5)? Once the Torah scroll is opened, it is forbidden to speak even words of Torah." It can be said that there it is referring to speaking out loud, so as not to disturb the reading of the Torah, but here it is referring to learning quietly. And the fact that it states he "turned his face away" implies a chiddush (novelty) - even though he turned his face away, appearing like one who puts down the Torah scroll, it is still permitted. And the reason he turned his face away was in order to concentrate properly on his learning. And Rav Alfas (in the 4th chapter of Megillah) wrote that the BaHaG explained it is only when there are 10 others there that one is permitted to study. But if there are not 10 besides him, then no. And here it is discussing where there were 10 besides him. And further, Rav Alfas offered another answer - that Rav Sheshet was different since Torah study was his occupation. And we find this latter answer more satisfactory.

Line 30

Verses twice and translation (Targum, i.e. Aramaic translation) once - Some explain that the requirement [of reading a translation] applies to foreigners in their (native) language, as it is like (Aramaic) Targum that sometimes explains the verses. Because, just as the (Aramaic) Targum explains [the verses] to the Amei Ha'aretz (literally, "People of the Land"), so too, foreigners understand [the translation of the verses] through their native tongue. However, this does not appear [to be a correct], since the (Aramaic) Targum explains items that cannot be understood from the Hebrew, as can be found in many places. [For example], Rabbi Yosef said, (Megillah 3a) "If it were not for the (Aramaic) Targum of this verse, I would not know what it is speaking of." Therefore, one should not recite [the translation] in any language the third time (i.e. after the verses are read in Hebrew twice), except for the language of the (Aramaic) Targum.

Daf 8b



Line 1

And even regarding "Ataros v'Divon" etc. - Rashi explains that even regarding "Ataros v'Divon" which does not have a Targum (Aramaic translation), one also needs to read it three times in Hebrew. And this is difficult - why did it specify "Ataros v'Divon" which does have a Targum Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Targum)? It could have said "Reuven and Shimon" or another verse that has no Targum at all. It can be said that the reason it specified "Ataros v'Divon" is despite the fact that it does not have a well-known Targum except for the Targum Yerushalmi, and one needs to read it three times in Hebrew - nevertheless, it is better to read the third time in the Targum (Yerushalmi).

It was asked to Rabbi Yitzchak '[People]  like us, who do not learn right after the morning prayer and are busy, go without learning until midday or later. Why don't we say the Blessings for Torah Study a second time when we start to learn [In the afternoon.]?' <br>Rabbi Yitzchak replied: 'We don't accept what it says in Jerusalem Talmud. In our Talmud doesn't say that you have to learn immediately [without any interruption]. Furthermore even according to the Jerusalem Talmud, the blessing of  Ahavah Rabbah is not primarily a blessing for Torah Study - it was primarily instituted as a blessing for the Shema. Therefore it doesn't cover  blessing for Torah Study, unless one learns right away without any interruption. <br> However, the blessings Asher Bachar Banu Laasok BeDivrei Torah Which are mainly  Blessings for Torah Study covers his study for the entire day. <br>If you will ask why is this different to Sukkah that you have to make a blessing lay-shayv bah-soo-kah before every meal [and for Torah Study just in the morning]? <br>Answer: One can suggest that studying Torah is different because he doesn't forget about it. A person is constantly obligated to learn, like it says ”you shall meditate therein day and night”. It's similar to one who was sitting a whole day [And learning Torah] without interruption.  <br>However, eating in the sukkah has a set time <br>If you ask, why don't we make a blessing “to sleep in the sukkah”? <br>Answer: One can suggest, that the blessing we say for eating covers the sleeping in the sukka.  <br>Alternative answer: since he may not fall asleep and it becomes a blessing in vain. For a person is not able to fall asleep whenever he wants. Rabbeinu Tam used to say, that when a person gets up  in the night to study he doesn't need to say the Blessings for Torah because the blessings from yesterday morning cover until the next morning.  <br>But it doesn't seem right.

1 In The Holy Tongue It Is Said - Rashi explains in the second chapter of Tractate Megillah (Page 17 Side 2) [that the word "Vehayu" comes to teach us] to read in the Torah. And it's not clear because Ezra decreed the reading of the Torah, and since it was Ezra, why would I need the word "Vehayu?" And there is to say that since this is referencing the biblically ordained readings like Parshat Zachor. Alternatively, it could reference the biblical readings like on the first fruits, the tithe confession, and the spurning of the levirate marriage whose recitation is biblical. Even though it was said in every language at Sinai because every utterance from the Mouth of G-d would divide into seventy languages [those readings must be recited in the Holy Tongue].

One who does them not for their own sake, preferable for him had he not been created - What about what the statement of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav in the perek Makom Sh'Nahugu (Pesachim 50b) "A person should always do Torah and mitzvot even if he doesn't do them for their own sake, for thought doing them not for their own sake he will come to do them their own sake"? It is possible to say that over here we are dealing with someone learning only to vex his friends whereas over there it is someone who learns with the motivation that others should honor him.

In the Talmud Yerushalmi the reason is explained: Rabbi Boon said, it says "in order that you may remember [the day when you came out of the land of Egypt] all the days of your life"  - when you are engaged in life and not days when you are engaged with death. There is also a version which says 'exempt from reading the Shema and from prayer and from T'fillin."

According to Rashi, you do not need to bless. And understand from his explanation that if one wants to bless, it is permitted. However, in the Yerushalmi it says, if you want to be stringent, we don't let him. Therefore, it appears to say, one does not bless and one is not permitted to bless, and the Yerushalmi explains why, and says because of Kavod HaMeit (respect for the dead). Alternatively, because he doesn't have anyone who will carry his burden. We ask a question: but isn't it taught in a Braita: exempt from netilat lulav. And should you think we are dealing with Yom Tov, and there he is not too busy to carry the burden, and we teach that it is referring to Chol, meaning Chol HaMoed [because he could potentially bury on Chol]. But isn't it taught in a Braita: 'Exempt from the blowing of the shofar'. It should have said on a weekday and not on Yom Tov. And that's a question. And we answer: Rav Chanina said, since he needs to prepare the casket and the shrouds [which the dead wear], as it is taught in a Mishnah: "you may violate the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds" its as if he is carrying the burden. Consequently, the implication is that on shabbat and yom tov you are not permitted to make blessings and pray since you are busy violating the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds. But there is a question from the end where it says "on shabbat you make blessings and a mezuman.

<b>Thirteen schools.</b> There are those who explain that they maintained experts [in Okatzin] in thirteen yeshivot; “thirteen” is not to be taken literally, rather it is a common amplification throughout Talmud, e.g. “thirteen coins” (Chulin 44a). Rashi explains it in a different manner.

Line 1

If he erred and did not pray mincha on Friday etc.; He erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat he prays at arbit twice.  This is to say, on Saturday night, and he says havdalah in the first, etc.   Rabeinu Yehuda wrote that if he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh at mincha he should not pray an extra time in the evening, for what will this accomplish? He already prayed mincha, he just forgot to add [yaaleh ve'yavoh for] Rosh Chodesh. If so, he does not gain anything if he prays an extra time in the evening after Rosh Chodesh has ended, since he will not mention Rosh Chodesh [in the extra prayer], and he has already prayed Amida. And this is different than the case here, where one erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat [at all], where in the evening he prays an extra time using the Amida of a regular evening, since here he did not pray at all so at least he gains the extra amida when he prays after shabbat ends in the evening, even though he is not mentioning shabbat.  And if you will ask, isn't he praying more than required since on shabbat there were only seven blessings and he will pray 18? There is no reason to worry about this, since even on shabbat it would be appropriate to pray all 18, but this was not required because of the extra effort it would require. We find, then, that he gains the full extra prayer. But when he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh, he has already prayed, so praying an additional time on Saturday evening will yield nothing.  And similarly, if he prayed a regular weekday amida at mincha on shabbat, and did not mention shabbat, it would seem that he should not pray again Saturday evening since he already said the amida. However, Rav Alfas [the Rif] does not seem to maintain this position, and in this case even though he does not gain anything he requires an extra prayer. To quote him: "With regard to the statement 'make havdalah in the first one and not in the second one, and if you did not say havdalah in the first one but did say havdalah in the second one, the second counts but the first does not count', since he needed to say the second one first; since he did not say havdalah in the first one but said havdalah in the second one, he has shown his intention that the second one should be his normal prayer. Therefore, he must pray again another time for his make-up prayer so that the obligatory prayer precedes the make-up.  And if he said havdalah in both of them, even though he was not required to do so, he does not need to repeat. And if he did not say havdalah in either of them, we do not make him repeat, as we learn in a braita 'if on erred and did not say havdalah in He Who grants us wisdom, we do not make him repeat since he can say havdalah on the cup of wine'".  Therefore, we require him to pray again even though he will not gain anything additional the second time. This is what Rabbi Moshe Malavar concluded from the words of Rabbi Alfas.

Hence it is deduced that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of one engaged in prayer – whether in front of them, behind them or on the side of them.  The Teshuvat Geonim explain that that this is only if one is sitting idly, but if they are engaged in the recitation of Shema or something similar, even if they are sitting it is okay.

Line 1

If he says "Bring salt", he needs to repeat the blessing. - Because this is a distraction, and as we have learned, one who speaks between putting on the two tefillin needs to say another blessing (Menachot 36a). This is true too if one speaks between saying the blessing of Hamotzi and eating, or between kiddush and drinking, that one needs to repeat the blessing, unless it relates to something in the meal. The same too for ritual slaughter of animals, if one says after the blessing "are there any more animals to slaughter" or "hold this tight", the blessing does not need to be repeated. We do not have the practice to have salt on the table and no relish either, because our bread is refined, as we see in subsequent section of Talmud. Rabbi Menachem however was very scrupulous to have salt on the table. This relates to the following midrash: when Israel sit at the table and wait for each other to wash hands, Satan accuses them, but the covenant of salt (Leviticus 2:13) protects them.

Who hast sanctified us by His commandments, and hast commanded us to lay the Tefillin - since he starts by putting it on his arm, he should bless "to lay," but on that of the head he blesses "concerning the precept" and not "to lay," sind he already started and layed one of them. But in chapter Hakometz it says, "if he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two blessings." Rashi explained that it says so on both Tefillin, that he says one blessing on both of them if he did not talk in between them, but it is difficult to say that the two blessings of "to lay" and "concerning the precept" were only needed when he talked and did a transgression. Therefore Rabbeinu Tam explained that on that of the head, which is the finishing of the commandment and the main part, because it has four compartments and the letter Shin, he says on it (an additional blessing of) "on the precept," and this is (how it appears) in Shimusha Rabba, authored by the Ge'onim. And according to the explanation of Rabbeinu Tam regarding "if he talked he says two blessings," (it refers to) if he puts on that of the head alone, since they (the two Tefillin) do not hold back each other  (from letting the wearer fulfill a commandment from it), he says two blessings. And this that the Gemara doesn't mention that on that of the head he says two blessings, it is because it is not at all common to place one without placing the other, since Tefillin by one with an obligation is common. And Rabbeinu Tam explained like this in his Responsa, and Rabbeinu Elchanan, in his "Order of the enactment of prayer," wrote like this.
