Women are obligated in reading the Megilla. From it appears that women may fulfill the obligation on behalf of others, from the fact that it does not say "to hear the reading of Megilla." And this is also implicit in Arachin (2b), which states, "All are obligated in the reading of Megilla." And it concludes, "All are obligated, to include what?" And it answers, "To include women," implying that they may even exempt men. But it is difficult, because in the Tosefta it states explicitly that a tumtum cannot fulfill the obligation on behalf of his gender or another species, and an androgynos can fulfill the obligation for his gender and not for another gender. And it is obvious that a woman is no greater than an androgynos. And so ruled the author of Halakhot Gedolot, that a woman may fulfill the obligation for her gender but not for men. And one can respond that we would have thought that their reading is ineffective even to fulfill the obligation for women; it comes to teach that they are obligated - that all are obligated in listening, servants, women and children. 
<b>Since they were also part of the same miracle.</b> Rashbam explained, that the primary part of the miracle was done by them; Purim - by Esther, Chanukah - by Judith, Pesach - for they were saved in the merit of the righteous ones of that generation. And this [interpretation] is difficult, for the language "since they were also" implies that they were secondary, and according to his [Rashbam's] interpretation, it should have said "since they were". Therefore, it seems to me, that they were also potentially going to be wiped out and killed, and so too on Pesach, when they were enslaved to Pharaoh in Egypt, and in Chanukah, the decrees applied to them too. In the matter of Matzah, there is one who asks why do we need this comparison, that everyone who is included in the prohibition of eating leavened bread is included in the positive commandment of eating Matzah. [Why not] learn it from them having been part of the same miracle? And it should be said, that this reason [part of the same miracle] does not obligate one but Rabbinically, so we need the comparison. And our Rabbi Joseph, of Jerusalem, explained that you might exempt them from it, by means of a comparison, for [Pesach] is on the 15th, and so too Sukkot is on the 15th [and women are exempt from the Sukkah], as I have explained in the chapter of <i>Eilu Ovrin</i> (Tosafot on Pesachim 43b:1).

<b>And Rabbi Eliezer beRebbi Yose holds, even the reading of the scroll (at the outset on the first:</b> And it appears) that he made a precise inference from that which it taught an extra [teaching in the] mishnah: that all commandments that are practiced in the second are practiced in the first, (which implies) at the outset (<i>lekhatchila</i>). And there are some that are accustomed to making days of feasting and joy on the fourteenth and fifteenth of the first Adar (Adar Alef), and the quick [reading] of our mishnah also implies this, as it says [that there is no difference between the two months] except for the scroll and gifts to the poor. [From this] it is implied that concerning the matter of feasting and joy, this and that (both months) are the same. And [this] is not lucid; as behold, we say in the gemara, "Concerning the matter of eulogies and fasts, this and that (both months) are the same." [From this] it is implied that feasting and joy are not [treated the same in both months]. As per force, one is not dependent upon the other; as if one were dependent upon the other, let [the gemara] make us understand that feasting and joy are practiced on [the fourteenth and fifteenth of the first Adar], and automatically, it would be forbidden for eulogies. As behold, the days that are mentioned in Megillat Taanit that are forbidden for eulogies [also] do not have feasting and joy (so we see that feasting implies not having eulogies, even if having no eulogies does not imply feasting). And so is the law (halakha), that there is no need to be stringent to make feasting and joy in the first Adar.

Line 10

 We must say that it means that there is no Melachah forbidden on Shabbos that is not forbidden on Yom Tov, except for Ochel Nefesh.
However, there are other distinctions between them. This (Shabbos) has Misah (for one who does Melachah), and this (Yom Tov) is a Lav.

(SUMMARY: Tosfos discusses the inference that Ochel Nefesh is permitted even if it was possible before Yom Tov.)
משמע מדלא פליגי אלא במכשירין מכלל דגוף המאכל שרי לעשות ביום טוב אע"ג דאפשר לעשות מערב יו"ט
(a)
INFERENCE: Since they argue only about Machshirin, this implies that one may make the food itself on Yom Tov, even though it was possible from Erev Yom Tov.
ומדרבי יהודה נשמע לרבנן דהא לא פליגי עליה אלא במכשירין
1.
We learn from R. Yehudah to Rabanan. They argue with him only about Machshirin.
וא"כ קשיא דאמר בפרק המצניע (שבת דף צה. ושם) החולב והמגבן והמחבץ והרודה חלות דבש בשבת חייב חטאת הזיד ביו"ט לוקה את הארבעים
(b)
QUESTION - CITATION (SHABBOS 95A): If one milked, curdled milk or made cheese or removed cakes of honey from a hive, on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he is Chayav Chatas. If he did so on Yom Tov b'Mezid, he gets 40 lashes.
אע"ג דהוי אוכל נפש
1.
This is Ochel Nefesh! (The Torah permits it on Yom Tov.)
ואפי' לרבנן דאמרי התם אחד זה ואחד זה אין בו אלא משום שבות
2.
IMPLIED SUGGESTION: [Our Tana'im hold like] Rabanan, who say there that both of these (i.e. on Shabbos and Yom Tov) are forbidden only mid'Rabanan.
מ"מ מודו היכא דאיכא אב מלאכה דלוקה
3.
REJECTION: Chachamim agree that one is lashed for an Av Melachah!
ויש לומר דודאי אוכל נפש המתקלקל אם עושהו מאתמול מותר לעשות ביו"ט
(c)
ANSWER: Surely, Ochel Nefesh that would spoil if one did it yesterday (before Yom Tov) one may do it on Yom Tov;
אבל אוכל נפש דעדיף טפי כשהוא עשוי מאתמול כגון ההוא דהמצניע אסור לעשותו ביו"ט
1.
However, Ochel Nefesh that is better when it is done from yesterday, e.g. the case in Shabbos 95a, one may not do it on Yom Tov;
אבל מכשירין דלא מתקלקל כשנעשו מאתמול בהא ודאי יש לחלק [בין] היכא דאפשר ללא אפשר.
2.
However, Machshirin, which do not spoil when they are done from yesterday, surely we distinguish between when it was possible [before Yom Tov] and when it was not!

<b>She broke out in leprosy:</b> By <i>gezera shavah</i>, it is explained that we learn [about], "had been decreed (<i>nigzar</i>)," that is written about Vashti (Esther 2:1) - from, "he was cut off (<i>nigzar</i>)," that is written about Uzziah when he became a leper. As it is written about him (II Chronicles 26:21), "for he was cut off (<i>nigzar</i>) from the House of the Lord."

Line 6



Line 7

<b>Go to Ammon and Moav, who have remained settled in their places like wine:</b> But this is difficult: As behold, the chapter [entitled] Tefillat HaShachar (Berakhot 28a) challenged, "Does Ammon reside in their place? Did not Sancheriv come and scramble [it]." Hence Rabbenu Tam explained that we teach the version here [with] only Moav. For the verse also only mentioned Moav, as it is written (Jeremiah 48:11), "Moav has been at ease." And also in Berakhot, we teach the version [with] only Ammon. And from this reason, they permitted Yehudah the Ammonite convert to enter into the congregation (to convert to Judaism). But it is implied that they did not want to permit the other [forbidden nations as] converts, since Sancheriv did not scramble Egypt and he did not scramble Moav. However it is [still] difficult, since in Berakhot in that which I cited, it is implied that Sancheriv scrambled Ammon; whereas in Jeremiah, it counted them among those that Nebuchadnezzar exiled! But it can be said (answered) that since Sancheriv was the first to scramble, everything was called by his name; and it is about him that it is written (Isaiah 10:13), "I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures." But the main destruction was certainly through Nebuchadnezzar.

Daf 14b



Line 1

<b>He was rebelling against the kingship, and there was no need to judge him -</b> This is difficult: If so, how in tractate Sanhedrin (36a) it states that capital cases begin from the side, as it is written regarding Naval "And every man girded his sword, and David too girded his sword" (I Samuel 25:13). But he (Naval) was rebelling against the kingship, so he shouldn't have needed to be judged! And further, it is difficult - how could David sit in judgment, when we do not seat a king in the Sanhedrin, as we learned in Tractate Sanhedrin (18b)? And there is a further difficulty from the tractate Shabbat (56a) regarding Uriah, where it says David should have judged him in the Sanhedrin - but why, if he was rebelling against the kingship? The resolution can be said that here the meaning is: He was rebelling against the kingship and did not need to be judged like other capital cases, where we judge during the day to acquit and on the next day to convict. Rather, even on that same day we can render a final guilty verdict. And this is what Avigail said to him: "Do we judge capital cases at night? You should have waited until the next day to render the final verdict!"  And he (David) responded to her: "He was rebelling against the kingship, so there was no need to wait until the next day." But to judge him, certainly it was required. And it is also not difficult from the fact that David sat in judgment, for the reason we do not seat a king in the Sanhedrin is because it is not honorable for him to sit silently. But regarding one rebelling against the kingship, it is honorable for him to sit silently, since he is personally involved in the matter.
