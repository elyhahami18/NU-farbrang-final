Daf 2b



Line 1


It is a difficulty, because what is the strength of this anonymous Mishna over that anonymous Mishna? It can be answered that in Misseches Ediyos it doesn’t teach this among the leniencies of Beis Shammai and the stringencies of Beis Hillel.

[1] "We do not clap and we do not dance." Rashi explains that this is because one might come to repair a musical instrument. However, for us, it is permitted because specifically in their days, when they were skilled in making musical instruments, it was relevant to decree this prohibition. But for us, since we are not skilled in making musical instruments, the decree is not relevant.
