In the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon, we find that there are six cases where the halakhah follows the view of Beit Shammai. The first is the case of whether a sukkah must be large enough to accommodate one's head, most of one's body and one's table...

Line 2

Talmud - How much larger is [the area of] a square than a circle - one fourth
Tosafot - This cannot be proven from the fact that a square of 3x3 has a perimeter of 12 surrounding it, and a circle with a diameter of 3 has a circumference of (approximately) 9 surrounding it as [according to the Talmud's calculation] a circle with a circumference of 3 has a diameter of 1. (Our hypothesis is that any shape's area is equal to it's perimeter or circumference. If this is so, then the Talmud's conjecture is seemingly proved, as the square's perimeter is 1/4 larger than the circle's circumference and they have the same distance across (3).]
[Why is this not a proof -] As proof cannot be brought from the perimeter/circumference [of a shape] to its area. [For example, according to the hypothesis that the perimeter/circumference of a shape is equal to its area,] you would think that a circle with a diameter of 4 would have the area of only as much as a square of 3x3, since their perimeter/circumference is equal (the square is 3 per side, thus it's perimeter is 3x4=12, and the circle's circumference is 12 as we multiply its diameter, 4, by 3. However, [in truth,] when you divide a square of 3x3 into a grid of 3 strips horizontally and 3 strips vertically, you will only find 9 square cubits (see diagram). But a circle with a diameter of 4 must have 12 strips of one square cubit each. For a square of 4x4, when it is divided into 4 strips of a cubit's width along it's height, and also along it's width, will result in 16 strips of one square cubit. And if [as the Talmud conjectures] a square is only one fourth larger than a circle, it comes out that you are saying that a circle [with a corresponding diameter of 4] has an area of 12 square cubits. (Thus we find that a circle and square can have the same perimeter/circumference, 12, and still have different areas - the square has 9 but the circle has 12.) Rather, [we must say] that there is no proof from the circumference/perimeter [to the area] at all.

Line 4

Talmud - Each ama of the sides will result in one and two fifths amos of its diagonal.
Tosafot - This calculation is not precise, as there is an additional small amount (of diagonal). [To prove this point -]
If you draw a square of 10x10 and divide it into a grid, you will have four sub-squares of 5x5. If you then draw a line across the diagonal of each of these sub-squares, with the lines meeting in the middle of the sides of the large square (see diagram), you will then have an inner square of 50 amos inside the large 10x10 square. [We know that this inner square] is 50 amos in area since you divided each of the 5x5 squares in half along their diagonal.
[However,] if you use the [Talmud's] calculation of 1 2/5 amos [diagonal per ama of length], it will result in an inner square of 7x7 (as each sub-square is 5x5, it's diagonal will be 5x1.4=7). Therefore, the inner square would not have the area of half of the outer square, as a square of 7x7 only has an area of 49 square amos. [But as proved earlier,] the inner square actually has an area of 50, as it has half the area of the large square of 10x10, which has an area of 100.

The messengers of Mitzvah ... Those who travel to fulfill a Mitzvah, for example to learn Torah or to greet his Torah teacher and to redeem captives are exempt from Suka, and even at the time of their encampment (to rest). So is explained in the notes of Rash"i and so is implied by the Gemora because it says: "Those who travel to fulfill a Mitzvah are exempt from Suka, whether during the day or during the night". It implies (that they are exempt from Suka) even if they don't travel except during the day. Because, if (the Gemora was talking about the case where) they went on traveling during the day and during the night, even (if they would have gone) for a permitted non-Mitzvah activity, they would be also exempt (from Suka), as was thought in a Brisa. And also (another example of being exempt from Suka even when not directly involved in doing a Mitzva), a story with Rav Chizda and Raba bar bar Huna that were resting on the shore of Sura river (outside of Suka), (when they came to hear a Torah exposition and to visit the Leader of the Exile - Rash'i). Toisfos continue: and it is a wonder, if they are able to fulfill both (i.e. the Mitzvah that they are currently involved in, and the Mitzvah of Suka), why are they exempt (from Suka)? Just because a person has Tzitzis on his garment and Tfilin on his head, who would exempt him with this from the rest of the Mitzvahs? (obviously nobody).  Toisfos continue: and in the chapter "Ein Bein Hamoder" [Nidorim chapter 4, page 33b], in regard to the one who swore against getting benefit (from the owner of the lost object), that he (the finder, nevertheless,) returns to him (to the owner of the lost object) his lost object, even though he (the finder) benefits a Pruta (a small amount of money, according to the opinion) of Rav Yosef. (Rav Yosef holds in Meseches Bava Kama, bottom of the page 56b that a finder of a lost objects benefits from the lost object by being exempt from giving a piece of bread to a poor man who knacks on his door while the finder is involved in the Mitzvah of lost object, thus, saving to the finder the value of that piece of bread).  (The finder, despite of getting the benefit, should return the object) because it is not a  frequent event (that a poor man would knock on the door while the finder  is involved in the Mitzvah of lost object). (However) if all the time that the lost object is in his (finder's) house, he (the finder) is exempt from giving bread to a poor man, if it is so, it is a frequent event (saving the value of a piece of bread, because poor people knocking on the door, while the object is in his house, are frequent). Rather, for sure, his is not exempt (from giving bread) except at the time that he is involved with it (with the lost object). For example, lost Talis and he (the finder) spreads it for its needs (to air it out), or an animal when he gives to it food. It is not frequent that at that moment would come a poor man to ask from him (bread). The Toisfos conclude: It is needed to be said that here to (in the case of travelers to do Mitzvah and in the case of Rav Chizda and Raba bar bar Huna traveling to visit the Leader of Exile)  they are talking about a case like this one (i.e. these two cases of travelers are similar to the case of a lost object at the moment of taking care of it, in a way) that if they (the travelers) would bother themselves to fulfill the Mitzvah of Suka, they would be detracted from (their original) Mitzvahs. (i.e. if they look for a Sukah it, for example, may take longer for them to arrive to their destinations to fulfill the original Mitzvah. To summarize, it seems from this Toisfos that the principle Osek Be Mitzvah Potur min Ha Mitzvah, the one who is involved in one Mitzvah is exempt from another Mitzvah, applies only when the involvement with the second Mitzvah is detrimental in some way to the original Mitzvah).

It seems from here that women are exempt from reciting Hallel on Sukkos and Shavuos because it is a time-bound positive mitzvah. Although the Gemara implies that women are obligated in the four cups of wine on the first nights of Pesach, and the rabbis ostensibly only instituted the four cups to enhance the recitation of Hallel and Maggid, Hallel of Pesach is different because it commemorates the miracle and [women] also were part of the miracle.

Line 9

"Truly, they said 'A son can bless for his father.'" This here in the Gemara does not continue the topic the Mishna was discussing, but connects to the Mishna's issue of one who is cursed.     In Berakhot 20b, there they wanted to prove from this Mishna here in Sukkah that women have an obligation for Birkat haMazon on a Torah law (de-Oraita) level, but that proof was rejected with the question, do minors also have an obligation on a de-Oraita level? So it was suggested there in Berakhot this case here in Sukkah could where one only ate a shiur (amount) that obligates on a Rabbinic level, and so in that case a woman could bless and a man's obligation could be fulfilled.       However, in the Tosefta it says that a woman and minor do not fulfill the obligation of Birkat haMazon of the general public. This could be limited to the case where the other person eats an amount that generates a Torah law obligation.      Therefore, it cannot be proved from here that women are obligated in Birkat haMazon on a Torah level, perhaps it is not Torah level because women do not combine to a Zimun, as it says in Berakhot 45a, that men can bless for them, but they cannot bless for men, so a man can include women in his Zimun, but a woman cannot include a man in a men's Zimun.           Or perhaps it would be improper, similar to Megilah, where women are certainly included in the obligation, yet women cannot read the Megilah for men according to the understanding of the Baal Halakhot Gedolot.

In Rava's town (lit. "place") they were all experts in Hallel, and they would all recite Hallel along with the <i>shaliach tzibbur</i>, just as we recite it nowadays. And they did not rely on him (i.e. his recital) at all, as Rashi explains. (WILL FINISH LATER)

Daf 50b

Line 2

[1] And the Rabbis hold that the primary singing is vocal. It is puzzling, because in the chapter "One Who Finds Tefillin" (Eruvin 102b), it is taught that we tie a string in the Temple but not in the rest of the country. And there is a Tanna in the Gemara who says, "I did not tie it, I wrapped it." They only disagree about repairing an instrument, whether it overrides Shabbat due to the preparation of the sacrifice, but everyone agrees that the song itself overrides. And it is also taught in the second chapter of Arakhin (10a): "On twelve days a year, the flute is played before the altar: at the slaughter of the first Passover offering, at the second Passover offering, on the first day of Passover, on the festival of Shavuot, and on the eight days of Sukkot," which implies that it overrides Shabbat and Yom Tov, as it is impossible for the eight days of Sukkot to pass without a Shabbat. [Secondly,] And according to Rabbi Yirmiyah bar Abba, who concluded in our discussion that they disagreed about the song of the water-drawing celebration, but the song of the sacrifice is agreed by all to override, it is understandable. [Thirdly,] And Rabbi Yosef here was refuted by a Baraita. Therefore, it must be said that the Mishnah in Arakhin and Eruvin was established by Rabbi Yosef according to Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda [and so he overrules the majority.] However, it is still difficult because at the end of "The Tamid was Slaughtered" (Pesachim 65a), it is implied that it is obvious there is no rabbinic prohibition in the Temple. Even Rabbi Natan, who is stringent there, agrees that necessary rabbinic prohibitions were permitted.  [] And it is also taught in our chapter (53b) regarding the trumpet blasts of the Temple that every day there were twenty-one blasts, even on Shabbat, as derived in the Gemara from the phrase "every day." No Tanna is mentioned to disagree, and it cannot be said that those blasts are of biblical origin, because the three blasts for the opening of the gates and three to stop the people from work override Yom Tov that falls on the eve of Shabbat, as taught in the first chapter of Chullin (26a): "Yom Tov that falls on the eve of Shabbat, they blow but do not separate," as they would change somewhat as explained there in the Gemara. All of those there are rabbinic, and they did not decree in the Temple, but for the drawing of water, as it is written, "And you shall draw water with joy" (Isaiah 12:3), they decreed. And it can be said that since there were many musical instruments, flutes, lyres, cymbals, and harps that needed constant repair, they decreed more than those satisfied with a shofar that does not need repair. And since they decreed on them, they also decreed not to blow for the water drawing on Yom Tov, as it is proven in our chapter (54b) that asks, "If so, even the eve of Shabbat during the festival should not be counted," meaning the blasts are less because they do not blow for the water drawing. And this is the reason, as explained, because they were accustomed to increase other musical instruments without number, as taught in our chapter (51b), they decreed not to blow at all.
