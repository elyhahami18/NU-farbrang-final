The Tosafot's Question:
"But now, wouldn't the 'form of a doorway' not benefit him?" - If having a specific type of opening is enough to make the Eruv valid (as implied by the Gemara), then why wouldn't simply shaping the opening like a doorway always work?
The Tosafot's Answer:
"But he doesn't ask, 'Wouldn't doors benefit him?'" - The Gemara doesn't even bother asking the more obvious question: Why aren't doors enough to create a valid Eruv?
"Because it's obvious, since it has doors and they are locked, it's like an upper partition." - Having doors that can be locked is clearly sufficient, as it functions as a wall and effectively encloses the space.
"It's also not relevant to ask, 'Doesn't it require the form of a doorway?'" - There's no need to even bring up the question of whether a doorway shape is necessary.
"Because the form of a doorway is only for aesthetic purposes." - The shape of a doorway is merely decorative; it has no inherent halachic (Jewish legal) significance in creating an enclosed space.
"But this question is well-placed, 'Wouldn't the form of a doorway benefit him?'" - The Tosafot clarifies that the original question about the doorway shape is valid in this specific case.
"Because if it was considered a doorway even when very large, by means of the form of a doorway, he could make it equal to a hall." - Here's the crux of the issue: If any large opening could be considered a valid "doorway" just by shaping it like one, people could make huge openings and still claim it's a valid Eruv, which is not allowed. The Eruv rules have size limits for openings.

If it were to collapse, it would have more sunlight than shade. Rabbi Yitzchak explains that [the concern of] "more sunlight than shade" is by means of the wind coming and dispersing [the covering] until it has more sunlight than shade. For if it only had more sunlight due to collapsing, how would we permit it according to the later statement [in the Gemara]? Indeed, invalid covering does not combine with valid covering, as it says in Sukkah (4:9) regarding one who makes his Sukkah under a tree.
And it is difficult [to understand] because it says in the first chapter of Sukkah (4:4) [that] if it was higher than 20 cubits and the materials are falling within 20 [cubits], if its shade is more than its sunlight, it is valid, if not, it is invalid. And why is it valid? Is it not so that if it were to collapse, the materials will fall below? And according to the later statement here, it fits well.
And for Rava, who explains it because it is a Sukkah of an individual [and therefore lenient], it also fits well, for regarding [the case of] the materials, we can say that many are falling below, so there is nothing to derive [from that case]. But for Ravina it is difficult, for it seems that because it is a Sukkah [whose laws are] from the Torah, it is invalid because if it collapses, etc. And we can say that there it is dealing with a case where there are many materials that can easily remain in place by leaning on each other.
And furthermore, we can say here that if it collapses, it has more sunlight only through the collapsing itself, and it combines with the covering that is above 20 [cubits], and according to the later statement, which does not consider invalid covering so much since it would be valid covering if it were below 20 [cubits]. But it is difficult, for regarding the materials, it says "if not, it is invalid." And according to the later statement here, we permit it even if it has more sunlight than shade. However, according to the first statement, it is good. Alternatively, regarding the materials, there is more reason to invalidate it, since the upper bundles and the lower ones are [intertwined] with each other, so that if it collapses, everything will fall.

It is permitted to use [the space] under the beam. The "kontres" explains that this is because [we say] "the outer edge descends and seals."  Someone who forbids [using the space] holds that "the inner edge descends and seals."  He didn't want to explain that one opinion holds the "lechi" belongs to the people of the public domain and one opinion holds it belongs to the people of the alleyway, because the Gemara later says "and if you want, say that everyone agrees the beam [works] because of the 'lechi'," which implies that until now, it wasn't [considered] a "lechi" according to everyone. There is no difficulty with his explanation [regarding the fact that] since they hold the beam [works] because of [the principle of] a partition, then what is the reason of the one who says one handbreadth [is sufficient], and behold, it is not a partition [if it's] less than four [handbreadths]? [The answer is that] there is no need to be concerned since it is a wall, but he [the "kontres"] just came to lessen [the required size], as explained in the "kontres" regarding this matter nearby.

Line 1

Or perhaps it is a case where there are enough [people] (this Tosafos is following a version of the text where the 2 alternative questions were said in the opposite order) -- since even if the Halakha is not like Rabbi Eliezer, [perhaps there is a permissible way that] he can go [back] in [when there are enough people to make a wall all the way back inside the Shabbos boundary -- thereby not requiring that the Halakha be like Rabbi Eliezer].   ...
And if you will say that the Rabbanim, [arguing on Rabbi Eliezer] who say that he cannot go back in, even if he is only 1 handbreadth outside the Shabbos boundary, [and] even though the 4 handbreadths of his personal boundary overlap inside his original Shabbos boundary, [that they would say] here too: even if a wall of people could extend [from where Rav Nechemiah is standing] to inside the boundary, he cannot return -- [we can resolve that difficulty] by saying that it is not similar [to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbanim], because here, when the wall of people disperses, and he has already gone out of the 4 handbreadths the sages gave him [when he went outside the original Shabbos boundary] -- now it would be necessary to give him another 4 handbreadths boundary.  But since he is now back in his original Shabbos boundary, he is not given another 4 handbreadths, rather he returns to his original Shabbos boundary [of 2,000 handbreadths].  But in case where he does not lose his [new boundary of] 4 handbreadths by walking back in [to the original Shabbos boundary] -- he cannot return [to the original boundary].


Line 2

Because if he [Rav Nachman] was speaking of a case where there were not enough people, what question could you have? --  And even though Rabbi Meir invalidates an animal for [use] as a wall for the Sukkah [as the Gemara brings in the] upcoming [section], it was obvious to Rava that the Halakha follows Rabbi Yehuda's opinion [who permits using an animal] (and, a fortiori, Rabbi Yehuda permits using people as well).  
(Therefore Rava does not consider the possibility that Rav Chisda was asking about the Halakhic validity of using people to create an enclosure).  
But we cannot explain [the basis Rava's rationale] that, regarding [using] people [for a wall], even Rabbi Meir agrees that [the basis for prohibiting an animal is due to] its propensity to run away does not apply to people [when used as a wall].  Because [in the final analysis] this [reason of propensity to run away], was not Rabbi Meir's reason [for prohibiting an animal], as the Gemara concludes in the chapter "The One Who Sleeps" (Sukkah 23a).  
And [although] the Gemara investigates in the upcoming section by questioning whether we learned that Rabbi Meir explicitly prohibits using people and implements [to create a valid Sukkah wall], this [question is posed from the point of view] of the one [Amora] who explains in the Gemara Sukkah, that the reason for Rabbi Meir's prohibition is [solely due to the fact that] we are concerned that perhaps the animal will run away.
