We learn (Yuma 81b) from verses that one must make a Tosefes (addition) to Shabbos, both when it enters and leaves, to add from Chol to Kodesh! Answer: That small amount is not important, since it is Kalshehu (any amount suffices); R. Gamliel would agree that one must add that Shi'ur [to Shevi'is, when it enters and leaves].
