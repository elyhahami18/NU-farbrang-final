Explanation: Surely, mid'Oraisa it is Batel, but not like we said above; Rather, he (R. Gamliel) holds like R. Yishmael. R. Gamliel was meticulous about why the traditions about Tosefes Shevi'is and Nisuch ha'Mayim were taught together; Everywhere, these three Halachos (including also Aravah) are taught together. They were given [to Moshe] this way. Surely, Hash-m did so to teach [that all of them apply only when the Mikdash stands].
