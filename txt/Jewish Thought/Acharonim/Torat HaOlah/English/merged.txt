Torat HaOlah

Author's Introduction

Menachot 110a: “A Song of Ascents, Behold, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the House of the Lord at night” (Psalms 134:1). What is “at night”? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah study at night. The verse ascribes them credit as though they engage in the Temple service... Reish Lakish said: What is that which is written: “This is the law [torah] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering...” (Leviticus 7:37)? [This teaches that] anyone who engages in Torah is as though he sacrificed a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering... "...And in every place offerings are presented to My name, and a pure meal offering..." (Malachi 1:11) Do they really present offerings in every place? [Rather] these are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah in every place. [God says:] I ascribe them credit as though they burn and present offerings to My name.
And we say there that Torah scholars who engage in Torah are as if the Holy Temple is being built in their days.
In Midrash Rabbati Tzav (Pesikta Rabbati 16:1), Rav [Huna] said two things: 1) The exiles will only be gathered in through the merit of Mishna. Why? "And while they are courting among the nations, I will gather them" (Hosea 8:10). Rav Huna said, "Or from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honored among the nations, and everywhere incense and pure oblation are offered to My name..." (Malachi 1:11). Is it really so that a pure oblation is offered in Babylonia? Rather, this [Babylonia] refers to the Mishna. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, "Since you engage in the Mishna, it is as if you offered a sacrifice. Shmuel said, "When they are ashamed of all they have done [make known to them the layout of the Temple]..." (Ezekiel 43:11). Is there a layout of the Temple to this day? Rather, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, "Since you engage in its study, it is as if you built it."
And so one finds in Midrash Tanhuma, and Midrash HaNe'elam, Parashat Vayera: "Rav Keruspedai said, Whoever mentions out loud, in synagogues and study halls, the matter of sacrifices and offering, and means it -- there's a covenant cut that the angels who prosecute the misdeeds of humans, to cause them ill, are unable to do to him any bad thing, but only good."
And we say in Midrash Tanhuma, Parashat Tsav: "The Torah is greater than all the sacrifices, as it is said, 'This is the teaching [torah] of the olah, the minhah, and the hatat, etc' -- all who engage in Torah are as though they have sacrificed an olah, as though they have sacrificed a minhah, as if they have sacrificed a hatat and an asham and miluim and zevah hashlamim."
And from now on, since the Bet HaMiqdash was destroyed for our misdeeds and those of our ancestors, and we no longer have a temple, or a priest who can offer sacrifice to atone for us, we have nothing left for our own atonement except this Torah. And we say in the final chapter of Taanit that Avraham said to the Holy Blessed One during the Pact between the Pieces, "When the Temple no longer exists, what will become of them [the Jewish people]?" God said to him, "I have already prepared for them the process of the sacrifices; all the time that they are preoccupied with that, I count it for them as though they had sacrificed before Me."
Therefore, Haza"l instituted that we read every day the verses of the Tamid offering, and to repeat the mishnah Eizeh Meqoman, in order to establish this utterance in the place of bringing sacrifice, it being well-known that humans do not subsist on such things alone, but by all that God decrees. This is the way Rabenu Bahiya put it at the end of [his commentary on parashat] Vayakhel: "Know that the story of the Tabernacle and its vessels, and investigation into them, their usage and shapes and handling, even though the Temple is no longer standing, is a great mitsvah... so how much more so if we merit to really grasp the issue and to be enlightened as to one of its hidden aspects, as King David z"l said on the subject of the hidden and revealed: "Walk around Zion, circle it, count its towers, note well its rampart, enter its citadels, that you may tell it to a future generation" (Tehillim 48:13-14).

Chapter 1

Part One
is called
"Mountain"
One who climbs the mountain / is singled out as holy,
And this mountain has 25 chapters / its steps reaching the heavens.
"Lift your heads, O gates, and let be lifted
The openings of the world, that the glorious King may enter."
It is taught in Masekhet Midot: "The Temple Mount was 500 cubits by 500 cubits, most of it on the south side, secondarily on the eastern side, thirdly on the western side, and a small part on the western side."
The sages have already said about this verse, "The Temple, Lord, which your hands established" (Shemot 15:17), that it teaches that the Temple on earth corresponds with a supernal Temple. We say in the first chapter of Ta'anit (5a): "Is there such a thing as a supernal Jerusalem? Yes, as it is written (Tehilim 122:2-3), 'Jerusalem built up, like a city joined together'." And we say too in Masekhet Hagiga (12b), "As Micha'el is the High Priest above, standing and sacrificing the souls of the righteous on a supernal altar." And so we say in the midrash, in Vayiqra Rabah, responding to the verse "And on the day that the Sanctuary was established" (Numbers 9:15): "R. Siman said, This teaches that another Sanctuary was established together with it."
The only possible conclusion is that those [sacrificial] elements below constitute a pattern aligned with counterparts above, as said David a"h, "All this that the LORD made me understand by His hand on me, I give you in writing—the plan of all the works" (1 Chronicles 28:19). And it is written about the construction of the Temple, "The patterns which are being shown to you on the mountain" (Shemot 25:40). This teaches that things are aligned above and below. And to that, I say that the sum total of the world is called a supernal Temple, in that it is the activity of God, may God be blessed. And indeed the total world is called a "house of God," according to the explanation of Maimonides (Part 1, chapter 54), in his Guide for the Perplexed. About this is said, "At Bet El [lit. 'House of God'] he would meet Him, and there speak with Him" (Hoshea 12:5). For it is through God's activities, when they are revealed, that we encounter God. That's what it means by "He would meet Him there." 




For this [reason], they said that the temple mount was 500 by 500 [ells], corresponding to the world in general, which is a 500-year walk in its breadth and in its length, meaning 500 by 500. And it is well-known that the whole world is not standing on any support. Rather, it is suspended by the word of God, may He be blessed. And it is as it is stated, <i>Who suspended earth over emptiness</i> (Job 26:7). And likewise did they say that underneath the Temple mount, there are arches above hollow arches beneath it, similar to the world that is standing upon emptiness.

There were 11 kaftorim [on the menorah of the Mishkan], parallel to the Torah’s 11 essentials and roots, as [Rabbi Yosef Albo] the author of the Ikkarim wrote (1:15), “Using this method, we find that the essentials and roots are eleven”... And although HaRav Abarbanel, in his book Rosh Emunah, argued against  those who identify roots and essentials for Torah since we must believe in the entire Torah, his words have neither root nor essential in this. We have seen the Sages say (Makkot 23b-24a), “David came and established the Torah on ten principles, Isaiah came and established it on six, etc.”<br> And the flowers [on the menorah of the Mishkan]  were nine, parallel to nine true beliefs which every person of Torah should believe, such that one who denies any of them is called a “heretic”...

 To return to our subject, to explain the two flowers on the right and left branches: The flower on the right branch is parallel to belief in Prayer, that one should pray to G-d and not employ any intermediary. This belief is clarified in the book of Bereishit [which is the right branch, as the first chumash]. We find that the patriarchs all prayed to G-d without any intermediary at all. The Sages already said (Berachot 26b), “The prayers were established by the patriarchs”, and we have found that Avraham prayed in the event with Sodom, and Yitzchak prayed for his wife Rivkah, and Yaakov prayed as they taught regarding Bereishit 28:11, “And he was pogeia in the place.” Note: According to the Talmud, Yitzchak’s prayer took place in the field before Rivkah arrived, in Bereishit 24:63. Rabbi Isserles seems to refer to Bereishit 25:21.]<br> This what Yaakov actually meant when he  said (Bereishit 30:1-2), “Am I in the place of G-d, who has withheld, etc.” He meant that one should not place any intermediary between himself and G-d.<br> Therefore Yaakov was angry at Rachel, for she wished to place him between her and G-d, when she said, “Grant me children.” He knew that Rachel was not irrational, thinking that Yaakov could grant children; rather, she meant that he should be an intermediary, and this was what enraged him. All of this is clear.

The Toledot Yitzchak wrote further a seventh reason: That anyone who sins does so from the spirit of impurity with which he is clothed. And when it appears to him that he will atone, it is necessary that that spirit of impurity be destroyed and flee from him. And with that, he will be pure and atoned from his iniquity, with the offering of each one of the sacrifices - and especially a she-goat or a he-goat, which are a part of the spirit of impurity. And the fire of the altar burns and destroys everything together, to hint to the sinner burning himself with the fire of the evil impulse. Then the fire of the altar will come and destroy it completely.

And the Rabbi of the Guide wrote in Part 3, Chapter 46 (Guide for the Perplexed 3:46): As most could not afford to offer a beast, the [Torah] commanded that birds also should be sacrificed. [...] Those who are too poor to offer a bird, may bring bread of any of the kinds then in use: baked in the oven, baked in a pan, or in a frying-pan. If the baking of the bread is too much trouble for a person, he may bring flour. [...] The idolaters did not offer any other bread but leavened, and chose sweet things for their sacrifices, which they seasoned with honey, as is fully described in their books: but salt was not brought in any of their sacrifices. God, may He be elevated, therefore forbade us to offer leaven or honey, and commanded us to have salt in every sacrifice - "with all your offerings shall you then offer salt" (Leviticus 2:13). And he wrote further: When the sacrifice is of flour, it is soaked in oil; for that is what is best and pleasant. And the frankincense was chosen because of the goodness of the smell of its smoke in its place, in which the meat is burnt. To here are his [words].
And in the Book of the Zohar, brought down by the author of the Recanati (Parshat Vayikra 130a): Rabbi Eliezer said, "That which is not from an animal to arouse through a sacrifice like other sacrifices; that is fine flour and matzah in order to arouse joy to those holy chariots. That pure thought is called fine flour and is called matzah - why is it called mitzvah, with a <i>vav</i>; but when it is being nourished by the holy chariots, it is called matzah, without a <i>vav</i>? Because of that, all those sacrifices come from the side of flour and bread alone. And because of that, they bring fine flour with the secret of Israel, the Priests and the Levites, as you see." To here are his [words]. And the Recanati wrote further [there]: And the matter of the giving of oil and its secret, you can understand from the verse, "Oil and incense gladden the heart" (Proverbs 27:9), and you know the understanding of, "heart." And behold it is to find a place for the supernal fire to rest there. Also the frankincense, [you can understand] from the verse, "in clouds of myrrh and frankincense" (Song of Songs 3:6). To here are his [words].

The belt they would wear corresponds to the theft that the men of the generation of the flood would do, as it is stated, <i>for the earth is filled with violent crime</i> (Genesis 6:13). And it has already been explained above (Chapter 43), regarding the high priest, that these three garments would atone for these three sins. The hats they would wear corresponded to the idolatry that they were worshipping, as it is stated, <i>then they called out profanely in the name of the Lord</i> (Genesis 4:26). And you should know that even though I wrote about the high priest (Chapter 43), that the matter of the turban with the high priest was to teach about the prohibition of eating meat, and the apron was for idolatry, the ideas of the clothes of the regular priests came for another matter. And that is why the name is differentiated, since this one is called turban [<i>mitznefet</i>], and that one is called hats [<i>migbaaot</i>]. And likewise, the making of the hats was different than the production of the turban, as the Tosafot wrote in the first chapter of Sukkah (Sukkah 5a, s.v. VeAl), in Yoma (Yoma 25a, s.v. Notel), and in the first chapter of Gittin (Gittin 7a, s.v. BeZman). And so too did Ramban write in his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 28:31). Likewise, Ibn Ezra wrote on Parasht Tetzaveh (on Exodus 28:36) that the <i>migbaaot</i> were a type of hat, whereas the <i>mitznefet</i> was something long that he would wrap around his head, see there in his commentary. And it shows pride, since it is a fine ornament on the head, such that he can be proud and beautify himself with it, which was not the case with the regular priest, since he only had a small hat on his head to cover it, to say that the divine presence is over his head above. And that is why they were forbidden to go around with a bare head. So, through this, they were teaching the prohibition of idolatry. And the content of the <i>migbaaot</i> would [also] teach about the matter of idolatry from the angle of the shared word, <i>migbaot</i>. For the way of the idolators was to set up idols upon the hills and mountains [<i>givaaot</i>], as it is stated, <i>They sacrifice on the mountaintops and offer on the hills</i> (Hosea 4:13); and it is stated, <i>And upon all the high hills, and upon all the lofty mountains</i> (Isaiah 2:14). And there are many [examples] like this in Scripture. And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, already said (Avodah Zarah 45b), "You do not have any mountain in the land of Israel upon which they did not set up an idol."
.


Behold I saw fit to expand a bit in this way in order to resolve the question that Ramban, may his memory be blessed, raised in Parashat Toledot about their midrashic statements (Bereishit Rabbah 95:2) that the forefathers kept all of the Torah. It is, as they, may their memory be blessed, expounded on [the verse]: <i>Inasmuch as Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, etc.</i> (Genesis 26:5). And there Ramban wrote, "And one can ask, 'If so, how did Jacob set up a pillar (Genesis 28:18), and marry  sisters; and Amram marry his aunt (Exodus 6:20); and Moses set up twelve pillars (Exodus 24:4)? And how is it possible that they should act [as if what is forbidden] in the Torah is permissible, which Abraham, our father, forbade upon himself; and that God, may He be exalted, [gave] him reward upon the matter — and that is <i>that he commanded his children and his household after him to walk in His ways</i>? And with Jacob, they expounded (Bereshit Rabbah 79:6) that he kept the Shabbat and established boundaries (within which he would be allowed to walk on Shabbat).'" And Ramban answered that "Abraham only kept the Torah in the land [of Israel], and Jacob [accordingly only] married sisters outside the land, and likewise Amram, etc." — as he wrote at length there. But I wonder about this since we do not find that Jacob divorced his wives upon coming to the land. And after Rachel died, he remained with Bilhah and Zilpah, who were also sisters according to the opinion of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed (Bereishit Rabbah 74:13:14).
However according to what we have indeed written about the matter of change in the commandments, everything is resolved. As it is possible that the prohibition of two sisters was not yet a sin at all during the time of the patriarchs, but was rather innovated afterward when the divine wisdom saw that a great catastrophe can come from this, given the jealousy of the children of Leah towards Joseph, the son of Rachel, the sister of their mother. Also [due to] the jealousy Leah and Rachel towards each other. As given that Leah and Rachel were Jacob's main wives, [their children] were jealous towards each other, which was not the case with the children of the maidservants. And that is why it is stated about Joseph: <i>and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and the sons of Zilpah</i> (Genesis 37:2). Behold it was from the angle of Leah and Rachel being sisters, and the jealousy of their children towards each other, that our ancestors went down to Egypt. And that is why [marrying] two sisters was subsequently forbidden. That is the reason for the need for the content of these stories: To make us aware of the reason for one of the commandments. And the Guide [for the Perplexed], Part III, Section 50 wrote something similar to this about the story of <i>These are the kings, etc.</i>. And it is possible that just like the law of sisters was changed, so too was marrying an aunt changed. And that is why Amram was permitted to marry his aunt. And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded similarly to this concerning the prohibition of a sister, as it is stated about it:<i>it is kindness</i> (Leviticus 20:17). And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yerushalmi, Sanhedrin 9:1), "What I permitted to Cain and Abel, etc." And that is why these sexual prohibitions were not yet forbidden during the time of the patriarchs until the time of the giving of the Torah when this law was innovated. And Ramban himself, may his memory be blessed, wrote like this concerning pillars, and these are his [words]: And the [prohibition of setting up a] pillar is a commandment that was innovated at a certain time, as they expounded (Sifrei, Deuteronomy 146) about that which is stated: <i>in that the Lord, your God, hated it</i> (Deuteronomy 16:22) — "He hated it, after it was beloved in the time of the forefathers." To here are his [words]. And since it is [the case] here, it is also [the case] there. For one should learn from what is revealed about what is hidden.
