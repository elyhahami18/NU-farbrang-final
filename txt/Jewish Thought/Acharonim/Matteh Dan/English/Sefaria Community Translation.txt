Matteh Dan

Title Page

the second kuzari
the great wise rabbi, educated in philosophy and in the seven wisdoms, rabbi dovid nito zt"l, the head of the bes din, argues and instructs through intelligent claims and strong proofs and with great wonders to prove the truth of the oral Torah that was received from our rabbis z"l, the sages of the mishna and shas ע"ר the first kuzari, because the whole point of rabbi yehuda halevi zt"l in his book the kuzari was specifically to prove the truth of the written torah, and he only spoke about the oral torah in general terms. and therefore through him and through me both the turths will become clear, and the opposing arguments will be stopped, and so it stands against the heretics like a valiant warrior going out to battle.

<b>The eighth principle:</b> Anything that was included in a category, but was singled out to teach — it was not singled out to teach about itself, but was rather singled out to teach about the entire category. For example: <i>Anyone among the Israelites, or among the strangers residing in Israel, who gives of his offspring to Molekh, shall be put to death; the people of the land shall pelt him with stones</i> (Leviticus 20:3). Molekh was part of the category of idolatry. So why was it singled out? To compare to it and say [that] just like [the punishment for worshipping] Molekh is with stoning, so too is all idolatry with stoning.

Chapter 28

The sage said: The lunar month, from one beginning to the next beginning, is 19 days, 12 hours, and 793/1080 parts of an hour. However, since we did not find in the Torah that part of a day is holy and part of a day mundane, but rather that all of our holidays, our [new] moons, and our Shabbats are from one evening to the next evening, we must make one month lacking with 29 days, and one month full with 30. Let's assume that Adar is the lacking one and we have set Rosh Chodesh [the first day of the month of] Nissan on the thirtieth day of it. If so, the first half of the thirtieth day is Adar, and the latter half is Nissan. So Rosh Chodesh Nissan does not really start until this latter half. Yet we are compelled to sanctify the whole day for the reason that we mentioned. And that is [the meaning of] that which the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Chapter 1 in Megillah 5a), "You count days for months, and you do not count hours."


Chapter 29

The Khazar [king] said: Why are MarChesvan and Kislev sometimes both full; or both lacking; or Cheshvan lacking and Kislev full, according with their order?

Chapter 30

The sage said: It is [because of] the 793 parts, which are three-quarters of an hour — and that is how I will refer to them in the future. The extra three-quarters of an hour each month add up to close to nine hours by the end of the year. And when these hours over two or three years are joined together, we add them to the month of Cheshvan. And this is also done to fix the year of the coming year so that Rosh Hashanah does not fall out on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday and Pesach on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, etc.
