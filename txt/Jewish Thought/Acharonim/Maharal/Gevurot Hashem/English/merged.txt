Second Introduction to Gevurot Hashem



Third Introduction to Gevurot Hashem







Chapter 1

<b>Who can speak of the mighty acts of <i>Adonai</i>; Proclaim all God's praise? Ps. 106:2 </b><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">From the <i>Shabbat </i>liturgy: “If our mouths were as full of song as the sea, and our tongue as full of jubilation as its myriad waves, if our lips were full of praise like the spacious heavens, and our eyes shone like the sun and moon, and our hands as outstretched as eagles of the sky, and our feet as swift as hinds – we still could not sufficiently thank You.</i> This verse teaches us that to praise the Holy One is impossible from two perspectives. First, one cannot fully express the greatness of God’s acts. Second, since God's acts are without end, it is impossible to praise all of them. Therefore both qualitatively and quantitatively one cannot fully praise God. Qualitatively, words cannot fully capture the greatness of God's might and quantitatively, one cannot mention all of God's acts that deserve praise. This is the meaning of the verse from Psalms. Regarding the qualitative nature of God’s acts, Scripture states, "Who can speak of (<i>milel</i>) the mighty acts of God." The word <i>milel, </i>tell, implies saying something new as in the verse, "Who would have said (<i>milel</i>) that Abraham that Sarah would suckle children?" (Gen. 21:7) The second half of the verse expresses the great number of God's acts, "Who can proclaim all God's praise?" The expression, "all God's praise," implies the great number of acts God has performed.
The <i>Talmud </i>relates: "A certain reader went down<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">In this story, the person who was leading the congregation in prayer added a list of adjectives in praise of God. In the rabbinic world, there was not yet a set liturgy yet so the prayer leader would improvise in phrasing the prayers. Rabbi Hanina chides the prayer leader for adding too many adjectives in praise of God and not using the three terms of praise which Moses stated and the Great Assembly canonized. The Men of the Great Assembly created the first order of prayers at the beginning of the second Temple period.</i> (to lead prayers) in the presence of Rabbi Hanina and said, 'O God, great, mighty, terrible, majestic, powerful, awful, strong, fearless, sure and honored.' Rabbi Hanina waited till he had finished, and then said to him, 'Have you concluded all the praise of God? Why do we say all this? Even with the three terms that we do say (<i>haGadol haGibor, v’haNorah</i>, from Deut. 10:17) , had not Moses mentioned them in the Torah and the Men of the Great Synagogue not inserted them in the Amida, we should not have been able to mention them, and you say all these and still go on! It is as if an earthly king had a million denarii of gold and someone praised him as possessing silver ones.'" (B. Berachot 33b)
Maimonides explains this to mean that one should not try to praise the extent of God's greatness nor mention all of God's mighty acts since they are without number. This is the meaning of the parable: switching gold with silver demeans the quality of the praise just as praising the king for having thousands of denarii when he actually has thousands upon thousands diminishes the king and would be an insult to him.
Therefore, one must ask, how can we be commanded to praise God's mighty acts that took place during the Exodus? Why not say, "Who can tell the mighty acts of <i>Adonai</i>, proclaim all God's praise,” and refrain from praising God.<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Since we cannot possibly mention all the miraculous acts that God performed during the Exodus or the greatness of each individual act why are we commanded to mention all of God's mighty acts and praise God for having redeemed us? God's greatness is beyond human comprehension and expression.</i>
It is true that we are incapable of "telling the mighty acts of God and proclaiming all God's praise." The reason we speak of God's mighty acts on Passover eve is not for God's sake but for our own sake. We recite these praises so that we don’t become ungrateful for the miracles and wonders that God has performed for us. If we give thanks for even a small portion of that which God has done for us then we are less likely to become ungrateful.
This suggests that if it was not our intention to praise God, then it is not forbidden to speak of God's attributes, as Rabbi Hanina said, "Had Moses our Master not mentioned these three words…we should not have been able to mention them."<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">If it is one's intention to praise God then one might sound like a servile person who flatters others. Praise serves a higher purpose of developing a sense of reverence in the presence of God. God does not need our praise, in other words; we need these words of praise to develop the proper attitudes in ourselves. We do not call God Ha-el <i>hagadol hagibor v'hanora</i> – the great mighty and awesome God - as a means of praising God but simply because this was the formula used by Moses. It serves as a means of developing reverence rather than serving as a means of praising God.</i> Since praise of God is unseemly, why did Moses offer these words of praise, 'great, mighty, and awesome?' It was not Moses intention to speak words of praise God but rather to teach the people of Israel to become more God fearing. By contemplating these three terms (God is great, mighty, and awesome) the people could develop fear of God. That is why it was permissible for Moses to recite these words and for the Men of the Great Assembly to insert them into the Amida. Even though they were included in the Amidah, they were not offered as words of praise. They were simply words that were taken from Scripture.
The fact that the Men of the Great Assembly decreed that they should be included in the Amida proves that we do not say them to include words of praise but rather to create a set text for the Amida based on the language of Moses.

Chapter 2

<b>Why Do We Recall the Exodus on Passover Eve: Critiquing Maimonides </b>It is a positive commandment to tell the story of the Exodus on the first night of Passover. This commandment is discussed by Maimonides in the <i>Mishnah </i>Torah: It is a positive commandment of the Torah … as stated: "Remember this day, on which you left Egypt," (Ex. 13:3) just as it is stated: "Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it." (Ex. 20:8) From where (do we learn that it is a commandment to tell the story of the Exodus) on the night of the fifteenth? The Torah states: "And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: 'It is because of this...'"(Ex. 13:8) implying that the <i>mitzvah </i>is to be fulfilled when <i>matzah </i>and <i>maror </i>are placed before you. This <i>mitzvah </i>applies even if one does not have a son. Even sages are obligated to speak about the Exodus. Whoever elaborates on the events which took place during the Exodus is worthy of praise. (<i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, 7:1) Maimonides implies that one must recall the Exodus on the fifteenth of Nisan ("Remember this day on which you left Egypt") in the same manner that one is sanctifies the Sabbath on the Sabbath eve. Thus, Maimonides states that telling the story of the Exodus must begin in the evening just as the Sabbath is sanctified at nightfall. (The Maharal suggests that Maimonides' explanation is problematic.) The Sabbath is different from Passover since regarding the Sabbath, the Torah states that one must "sanctify it." Regarding Passover the Torah states "Remember this day" but it does not state to "sanctify this day," as it does for the Sabbath. "Remember this day on which you left Egypt" applies every day and not only on festivals. Also, regarding the Sabbath, the Torah states to observe (<i>shamor</i>) and to remember (<i>zachor</i>) the Sabbath Day. The <i>Talmud </i>states "One who is commanded to observe the Sabbath must also "remember" the Sabbath."<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The commandment regarding the Sabbath is written differently in the two versions of the Ten Commandments. In Exodus 20 the Torah says to remember the Sabbath; in Deuteronomy 5 the Torah states observe the Sabbath. The two terms refer to the different aspects of the Sabbath: Remember is the prescriptive aspect of Shabbat (Reciting the <i>Kiddush</i>, lighting candles, preparing special meals) while observe refers to the proscriptive aspect of the Sabbath (not lighting a fire, refraining from work, etc).</i> (B. Shavuot 20b) Regarding Passover in Exodus 13:3, the Torah says nothing about 'observing' the day so one cannot assume that this verse applies to the fifteenth of Nisan. The other verse which Maimonides mentions is also problematic in proving that one must tell the story of the Exodus on the fifteenth of Nisan. The verse, "And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: 'It is because of this...'" applies to teaching the Exodus to one's children; it is not a general obligation for everyone to remember the Exodus. Also, it brings us back to the original question. How does one know that this verse applies to the fifteenth of Nisan? It might apply to speaking of the Exodus every day. <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Both verses that Maimonides uses as proof texts speak about remembering the Exodus but do not specify what day the Exodus should be remembered on. Maharal suggests that both verses might be a general commandment to remember the Exodus daily and not necessarily on the anniversary of the event.</i> The <i>Mekhilta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mekhilta </i>is an early <i>Midrash</i>.</i> also understands Exodus 13:3 as applying not to Passover eve but to the general obligation of remembering the Exodus: "And Moses said to the people: Remember this day when you went out of Egypt, etc." I know only that the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned in the daytime. Whence do I derive the same for the evenings? From, "… so that you remember the day of your going out of Egypt all the days of your life:" (Deut 16:3) "the days of your life" — the days; "all the days of your life," includes the nights, as per Ben Zoma. (<i>Midrash Mekhilta Parshat Bo</i>, 13:3) This would seem to contradict the opinion of Maimonides' interpretation of Exodus 13:3. There is no hint in this verse that one must mention the Exodus on Passover eve, the fifteenth of Nisan. The verse suggests that one only needs to mention the Exodus. It would be enough to recite the <i>Kiddush </i>(which contains a mention of the Exodus). Rather, the verse from which one learns that we are obligated to tell the story of the Exodus on the eve of Passover is, "When, in time to come, your child asks, 'What means the testimonies, statutes, and rules that the Lord your God has enjoined upon you,' You shall say to your children, "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt'…" (Deut. 6:20)<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Haggadah </i>begins its telling with Deuteronomy 6:20 - "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt…" This is the answer given in the Torah to the question attributed to the wise child. For the Maharal, this would appear to be the key passage in the Torah since it contains both the most complex question as well as the most general answer to the question of why we remember the Exodus as well as who must remember the Exodus. Deut. 6, then, is considered to be the model for the <i>Haggadah</i>, even though Exodus 13: 3 and 14 are the basis for telling the story on the eve of the fifteenth of Nisan.</i> Commenting on this verse, the <i>Midrash </i>states, "Rabbi Eliezer asked: From where does one learn that if a group of scholars or students are together on Passover eve, that they must study the laws of Passover....because it is stated, 'What mean the testimonies…'" (<i>Mekhilta Bo </i>13:14)
Since this verse states: "What mean the testimonies, statutes and rules," it must be speaking about a person who is knowledgeable. (This verse implies that the child who asks the question has the ability to differentiate between three types of commandments.) The word testimony (<i>edut</i>) refers to commandments that testify to the events in Israel's history, such as, the Passover offering is testimony that God 'passed over' the houses of the Israelites; <i>matzah </i>is testimony that the Israelites left Egypt before the dough had time to rise; and <i>maror </i>testifies to the bitterness of slavery and hard labor. Other commandments are statutes (<i>hukkim</i>), such as the commandment to offer a lamb and not a cow, and that it must be one year old and not two year old. These laws are called statutes (<i>hukkim</i>) because there is no explanation for the law and they must be obeyed on faith alone. There are also rules (<i>mishpatim</i>) in the Torah such as the rule that an uncircumcised person cannot eat the Passover offering and that only an Israelite can consume the Passover offering. These rules make clear that the offering only applies to those who were redeemed from Egypt and to no one else. Even though the verse states 'child' ("When your child asks"), the verse refers to sages in general, since the point of the verse is that the questioner is discerning in his questions. He knows enough to know how to differentiate between the different types of commandments: testimonies, statutes, and rules. The verse in Deuteronomy states that one still has to teach all matters relating to the Exodus even though it is obvious that these matters are known to him already. The fact that the child asks a question does not imply that he doesn’t know the answer. This is implied in the teaching: "If his son is wise, then let him ask. If the son is not wise enough, let his wife ask him; if she is unable to do so, let him ask himself questions. Even two sages who are together should ask one another, "How different is this night!" (<i>Pesachim </i>116a) The reason that it is better for a child to ask questions is because the purpose of the telling is to publicize the wonders and miracles which the Holy One performed at the time of the Exodus. It is better for the child to ask since this will allow for an even greater spreading of the Exodus story. One should relate all matters regarding the Exodus to him. Telling the story to a good student who already knows about the Exodus is not as effective as such a student already knows about it. Still, a <i>mitzvah </i>is still a <i>mitzvah</i>! One is obligated to study about the story of the Exodus since even though one already knows the story, by telling the story orally, one publicizes the Exodus more.
We see from Deuteronomy 6:20 that even two scholars or a someone celebrating Passover alone is obligated to relate the story of the Exodus. This verse is not a proof text for the commandment but an example to remind us that it applies not only to one's child but to all Jews. Like Exodus 13:8, it applies to the eve of Passover. At this time one is obligated to tell the story of the Exodus to his child and even to himself, even if he is a scholar. Even though the Mekhilta speaks of studying the laws of Passover, discussing the laws of Passover is one way of teaching the story of the Exodus, since when we explain the different Passover foods we tell the story of the Exodus…


Chapter 3

<b>The Exodus as Foundation of Torah Faith </b>God chose to make His deeds known to all humanity on the eve of Passover. The Exodus is the foundational story in the Torah and the root of all belief. Many <i>mitzvot </i>were decreed in order to keep the Exodus before us as the basis of belief and so it would never be forgotten, such as: dwelling in the Sukkah, "in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt," (Lev. 23:43) and Sabbath, "Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt." (Deut. 5:15) Certainly Passover and the festival of Unleavened Bread served as a reminder of the Exodus. On each festival we sanctify the day by saying, "A reminder of the Exodus from Egypt."<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">We often associate <i>Kiddush </i>with wine. Actually, it refers to the blessing after the wine in which we declare the "sanctity" of the day: "Blessed are You, Our God, Ruler of the world, You have chosen us from all peoples, exalting us and sanctifying us with <i>mitzvot</i>. In Your love, Our God, You have given us feasts of gladness and seasons of joy; this festival of matzot, season of our freedom, in love, a holy commemoration, a reminder of the Exodus from Egypt. God, You have chosen us from all peoples, consecrating us to your service, giving us the Festivals, a time of gladness and joy.</i> In addition to all these occasions, we are obligated to remember the Exodus every day, and according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, both day and night. The Exodus and not the miracles associated with it are the foundation of faith. Even though the Holy One performed countless miracles and wonders, the Torah did not command us to remember them. While someone of limited intellect who makes his judgments based on what he sees, the miracles and wonders might seem greater than the Exodus, this is not the case from the Torah's perspective. The Torah made the Exodus the principle and the basis of faith, as we see from the examples listed above and which we learn from many other statements in the Torah. Commenting on the verse, "Jethro rejoiced<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">According to another <i>Midrash</i>, Jethro didn’t just "rejoice" (<i>vayichad</i>) but he affirmed his faith and adopted the religion of Israel. The word <i>vayichad is </i>said to be related to the word <i>yichud</i>, affirming God's oneness.</i> over all the kindness that the Lord had shown Israel when He delivered them out of Egypt" (Ex. 18:9) the <i>Mekhilta </i>states, "The Exodus is equal to all the miracles and mighty acts that the Holy One performed for Israel.: (<i>Yitro </i>Ch. 1)
<i>Midrash Shocher Tov </i>states:<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shochar Tov </i>is a <i>Midrash </i>on the book of Psalms. It is a homoletical work known since the 11th century. It was called also Shocher Tov because it begins with the verse in Prov. 11:27.</i> “the Lord has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt…” (Deut. 4:20) “Just as the gold smith stretches forth his hand and takes the gold from the fiery furnace, so the Holy One took Israel out of Egypt. Just like a fetus in its animal's womb so the shepherd places his hands and takes out the new born animal, as it is stated: 'Has any God ventured to go and take one nation from the midst of another nation?'" (Deut. 4:34) 
This <i>Midrash </i>explains two important things about the nature of the Exodus from Egypt (with these two metaphors). First, that Egypt was so powerful and invincible, so that the people of Israel could not free themselves from their control. And second, we learn that the Israelites were so dependent on the Egyptians that they did not have any independence or self-will. Thus, Israel was compared to gold in fiery furnace in which the fire serves as a separation between the gold and the one who wishes to take it out of the furnace. When Israel was in Egypt, the Egyptians subjugated them and ruled over them so severely that there was no way for them to escape. Regarding the metaphor of the fetus, Israel was attached to Egypt in the way that a fetus is attached to its mother so that it has no vitality or independence of its own. This is what the Torah implies when it states that the Lord freed Israel from Egypt "with a mighty hand." (Deut. 6:21) and a "outstretched arm." (Deut. 5:15) <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Midrash </i>uses two metaphors to describe the nature of Israel's Exodus: the fiery furnace and the womb. The Maharal sees in these two metaphors two aspects of slavery and liberation. The first metaphor suggests the nature of Egypt's tyranny. The second metaphor, the womb, suggests that Israel could not become a full nation until it was fully developed into a nation that could be redeemed. Both the furnace and the womb were a deterrent to Israel's Exodus: Oppression by Egypt and immaturity on the part of Israel. He now explores these metaphors. Metaphors are both helpful for understanding an idea but also have limitations. One cannot understand them too literally.</i> ...
"With a mighty hand:" When the <i>Midrash </i>compares the Exodus to taking gold out of a furnace, it is suggesting that God took Israel out of Egypt much in the way a goldsmith might take gold from the furnace barehanded. Doing so with tongs would not have been so miraculous. Since the gold is in a furnace, the fire not only refines the gold but serves as a partition, preventing the goldsmith from removing it from the furnace. The fire and furnace serve as a partition between him and the gold. So, too, when Israel was subjugated to Egypt, there could be no connection between the Holy One and Israel. In order to take the Israelites out of Egypt, the Holy One had to connect with the Israelites which was as difficult as a goldsmith reaching into the furnace with his bare hands. This is the meaning of the verse, "The Lord… brought them out of Egypt, that fiery furnace, to be His very own inheritance." (Deut. 4:20) The difficulty was from the perspective of Egypt which prevented Israel from connecting with God. ...
The second metaphor describes the problem of leaving Egypt from the perspective of Israel. The Torah states, "'Has any God ventured to go and take one nation from the midst (<i>mi-kerev</i>) of another nation?"<sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">The Maharal's understanding of Israel as a fetus has surprising implications for how we understand abortion and what defines viable life. Israel, the fetus, is not a full nation, as long as it is in the womb of Israel. It is still <i>yerekh emo</i>, still part of its mother. It is merely part of the 'entrails" and not a full person yet. This fits with the notion of the life of fetus which Jewish law views as potential life and part of the mother rather than a separate being.</i> The word <i>kerev </i>is similar to the language of scripture, "Moses washed the entrails (<i>ha-kerev</i>)…" (Lev. 9:14) In other words, while they were in Egypt, the Israel became so absorbed into Egypt that Israel was like the fetus is part of the mother's entrails. Only when it is completely developed did it emerge from the womb as its own person. While they were in Egypt, the people of Israel continued to develop into a complete nation, and would only reach this stage when they numbered 600,000.
This number represents Israel's wholeness. After Israel was punished following the golden calf the Israelites still numbered 600,000, and later, in the book of Numbers, they are still numbered as 600,000. The completeness of Israel is represented the number 600,000. When their number increased later one, it was because they were blessed with increase fertility.
The number six represents wholeness… only that which has three dimensions is complete… since a cube contains four directions and above and below, it represents a whole structure. <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">One doesn’t usually finding geometry in rabbinic commentaries. I have chosen to summarize this section. The Maharal looks at the numbers as each representing a point in space: one a single dimension, two points a line, four a plane and six a three dimensional cube - a shape that he considers "whole." Similarly six, hundred, and thousand represent complete numbers since they do not change when counting. The numbers, then, represent, wholeness and completion.</i> Because Israel numbered 600,000 it now represented a nation that had reached a state of wholeness. The number 600,000 is considered complete because there are three levels to the number: 'six,' 'hundred,' and 'thousand.' 

These numbers are all considered to be whole numbers… all numbers are counted with hundreds and thousands (and not tens of thousands). Tens is not included as a complete number because we don’t count in tens. We don’t say six-tens but we say six-hundreds or six-thousands. These numbers are considered complete since they can be combined with the number six without changing the six. When Israel reached the number of six - hundred - thousand, they were they considered complete and prepared to go forth from Egypt like the fetus who reaches its maturation and can come forth from its mother's womb…
One can further understand that the Egyptians overpowered Israel both in term of Israel's form (<i>tzurah</i>) and their substance (<i>chomri</i>). <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">This is a central idea to which the Maharal returns repeatedly in his commentary: Tzurah and chomer, or form and substance. Chomer is the material make up of an object or a person, while tzurah is the idealized form of the thing or person. Everything and everyone is defined by form and substance.</i> There are two aspects to every people or nation. They are made up of substance which makes them a people and they are also defined by their form which gives the nation its uniqueness. The two verses quoted above refer to the two aspects of the people of Israel (the fiery furnace and the womb). The subjugation of Israel had to do with its substance and with its uniqueness. Israel's substance was controlled by subjugation, and its form was controlled by jealousy, opposition and oppression. Slavery affected their substance while oppression affected their form… <sup class="footnote-marker">*</sup><i class="footnote">Egypt set out to destroy Israel's substance (their physical makeup as a nation), as well as their spirit (their essence as a people). The two verses with which we began this section regarding the fiery furnace and the delivery of Israel from the womb each refers to a different aspect of Israel as a physical and as a spiritual people.</i> Thus, regarding the Covenant of the Pieces (Gen. 16) it is stated, "Know that your offspring shall be strangers…and they shall be enslaved and afflicted. The two aspects of Israel's experience in Egypt - physical enslavement and spiritual affliction refer to these two aspects of Israel's identity, substance and form. Israel was subjugated both in terms of its physical substance as a people, and its spiritual form as a nation. Physically, Israel was like a fetus that was attached to its mother. God took them out in the way that a shepherd delivers the baby from its mother. Just as the beast is <i>chomeri, </i>physical substance, so Egypt is substance and Israel was delivered as a physical people from Egypt's womb. Spiritually, God took the people Israel out as a nation by removing them from the fiery furnace of Egypt. Gold is another term for Israel which was refined and purified in the furnace of Egypt. The verse, "The Lord… brought them out of Egypt, that fiery furnace, to be His very own inheritance" refers to the people's spiritual form which was redeemed from Egypt.
Scripture states, "When Israel went forth from Egypt; the House of Jacob from a foreign people." (Ps. Ch. 116) Scripture mentions both names because God redeemed both aspects of Israel: its physical substance and its spiritual essence or form. The two names of the Jewish people refer to the form and substance of Israel as a nation. Jacob, which is a humble and lowly name, is connected to the material substance that makes up the nation. This name comes from the word <i>ekev</i>, a heel and to supplant. The name Israel refers to the spiritual form of the nation. This name is connected to the more important aspect of Israel - it is connected to the essence of Israel, <i>ki sarita</i>, "who wrestled with God."

Also there (Bereishit Rabbah 44:21): He showed [Abraham] the splitting of the Red Sea as well, as it is written: <i>that passed between those pieces [gezarim]</i> (Genesis 15:17); and it says: <i>Who split the Red Sea into sections [gezarim]</i> (Psalms 136:13). With this, they explained something very amazing, that He showed him that great stature which the Jewish people has, such that they control the natural world, so that nature [may be] suspended for their sake. And this [occurred] at the Red Sea, when nature was suspended for their sake. And He showed this to Abraham by way of his passing through the pieces [of animals]. As those pieces indicate physicality, since all animals are physical. So when he passed through the pieces, it indicated that Abraham's covenant with the Holy One, blessed be He, was above nature; and that the supervision that He extended over Abraham was through the negation of nature. That is why he passed through the pieces, to say that Abraham's supervision by the Holy One, blessed be He, was with the negation of nature and its suspension. And that is why He showed him the splitting of the Red Sea. So contemplate these things, one by one, and you will find very, very amazing things. 

Chapter 9





































And we have already said above that [the number] three has a beginning, an end, and a middle. And Abraham, who is first, corresponds to the head. Hence Abraham merited to become the head, the leader, and the father of the multitude. And each one of the patriarchs merited something unique, a unique virtue. As the head has its own virtue, the second has its own virtue, and the third has its own virtue. But since the second is different from the first, it is facing the end, given that the end is [also] different from the first – as the one is the beginning and the other is the end. But the third is not in opposition; just the opposite, it unifies everything. Hence the third faces the middle since the middle unifies the two ends.
And because of that, the trait of Abraham is kindness and the trait of Isaac is justice. One is the opposite of the other. As justice has to dig deep to full justice. But kindness is called kindness when it does not dig deep into the depths of a matter. And Jacob corresponds to the middle, as we said above. That is why the trait of Jacob is truth, since truth does not incline to the right or to the left. That is why Jacob corresponds to the middle, which has neither right nor left. So all of Jacob’s offspring were true offspring, such that there was no residue in his offspring. Whereas there was residue in the offspring of Abraham and Isaac.

Chapter 11




And it was specifically Joseph from all of the other brothers, since it was fitting that Joseph would be the king ruling over Egypt. For Egypt is called a donkey [<i>chamor</i>, which is similar to the word, <i>chomer</i>, physical matter], as it is written: <i>whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys</i> (Ezekiel 23:20); and they were flooded in licentiousness, as it is written in the section about sexual immorality, <i>What is done in the land of Egypt, wherein you were settled, you are not to do</i> (Leviticus 18:3). And there was no place in the world that was so flooded in licentiousness like the land of Egypt. But Joseph was sanctified and separated from sexual immorality, as you can see from the story about the wife of Potiphar. And because of that, Joseph was only made the king through the story of the wife of Potiphar; so does it appear. And it is well known that the breaching of sexual immorality is from physical action, as will be explained. So one who is separated and sanctified from licentiousness is sanctified from the lowliness of this disgraceful physical matter. And it is certainly similar to form, which has no type of matter in it, and this matter has already been explained above at length. And it is already well known that the form is what acts and reigns, whereas the matter is subordinate to the form. That is why Joseph ruled over Egypt, since he was the one sanctified and separated from matter.

And in Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer (Chapter 48:17), he gave a different reason for the word[s], I have surely visited [<i>pakod pakadati</i>], with which they were redeemed. It said, and this is its language there: Rabbi Eliezer said, "The five letters of the Torah that are of double [shape] are all expressions of redemption. <i>Kaf, kaf</i>, with which our father Abraham was redeemed from Ur of the Chaldees, as it is stated: <i>Go out [lekh lekhah] of your land</i> (Gen. 12:1). <i>Mem, mem</i>, with which our father Isaac was redeemed from the Philistines, as it is stated: <i>Go from us, for you are much mightier than us [mimenu meod]</i> (Genesis 22:16). <i>Nun, nun</i>, with which our father Jacob was redeemed from the hand of Esau, as it is stated, <i>Deliver me, I pray, [hatzileini na]</i> (Genesis 32:11). <i>Peh, peh</i>, with which the Jewish people was redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: <i>I have surely visited you, [pakod pakadti]</i> (Exodus 3:16, 17). <i>Tzadi, tzadi</i>, with which the Holy One, blessed be He, in the future will redeem the Jewish people at the end of the fourth empire, as it is stated: <i>Tzemach is his name; and he shall grow up [yitzmach] out of his place</i> (Zechariah 6:12). All of them were told to Abraham, and Abraham passed them down to Isaac, and Isaac passed them down to Jacob, and Jacob passed them down to Joseph and his brothers, as it is stated: <i>He will surely visit [pakod yifkod] you</i> (Genesis 50:24). Asher, the son of Jacob, passed down the mystery of the redemption to Serah his daughter. When Moses and Aaron came to the elders of Israel and performed the signs in their sight, the elders of Israel went to Serah, the daughter of Asher, and they said to her, 'A certain man has come, and he has performed such and such signs before us.' She said to them, 'There is no substance to these signs.' They said to her, 'But did he not say, "<i>Pakod yifkod</i>?"' She said to them, 'He is the man who will redeem the Jewish people in the future from Egypt, for so did I hear from father.' As it is stated: <i>And the people were convinced when [...] the Lord had visited [<i>pakad</i>] His people</i> (Exodus 4:31)." To here [is the midrash].

<b>And the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, explained</b> in Shemot Rabbah (9:9) on this section: Why was the Nile afflicted? It is because the Egyptians worshipped the Nile. This is why He afflicted their gods first: Since when the Holy One, blessed be He, punishes the nations, he punishes their gods first, since the idolatry is the cause of the sin of the nations of the world, for their force is what entices them to sin. And the Nile was a great force for Egypt, about which [Pharaoh] boasted and said, <i>My Nile is my own; I made it for myself</i> (Ezekiel 29:3). And it is fit for the cause to be afflicted first, since every progenitor is first. 

Chapter 33


<b>The explanation</b> of this is that it was difficult to them that the singular form, "and the frog rose," was written with the frogs. But why, "and there was a louse"  (Exodus 8:13), was written with the lice was not difficult to them. As it is the way of lice to gather together; but the way of frogs is not like that. Hence Rabbi Akiva reasoned that they were referred to in the singular because of [their] power to engender frogs and have them swarm. It is about this power that it states, "and the frog rose." But Rabbi Eliezer reasons that it is the power that gathers them together that is called, frog, in the singular. And according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, that which is stated (Exodus 7:28), "And the River swarmed frogs" - which implies that the River had the frogs swarm (and not their own power to do so) - that is to say that the River also had them swarm. For if there was no River, this power [intrinsic to the frogs] would not act. And the river is to the frogs like what the ground is to seeds put out by fruit. For if the ground did not give its bounty, the seed could not grow. Here too, the River swarms frogs; nevertheless this thing is through an intermediary power. And it is about [that power intrinsic to the frogs] that it states, "and the frog rose." But according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, "and the frog rose," is said about the power that connects and gathers them together to rise onto the land. 
<b>Plead with the Lord (Exodus 8:4):</b> Even though each plague had a measure of seven days — since they expounded so (Shemot Rabbah 9:12) from the verse <i>And seven days were completed, after the Lord had smitten the Nile</i> — it was so that it not continue and increase. For about the Nile that became blood, there is no doubt that the Nile does not stand still, and new water constantly comes [through it]. But all the water that came [through it] became blood until [the end of] seven days. And after seven days, it was not like this. And likewise the frogs, the Nile continued to swarm with more frogs for seven days and no more. However, had it not been for Moses' prayer, the ones that had come to Egypt would not have left, but would have rather stayed even after the seven days. And likewise, the locusts that were there (Exodus 10:14) would have remained even after the seven days. Hence the prayer removed them (Exodus 10:18). And so too, the mixture of wild animals that were there (Exodus 8:20) would have remained, but were removed by the prayer (Exodus 8:26). And the hail as well. The hail that was already in the air and in the clouds would not have been interrupted had it not been for Moses' prayer (Exodus 9:33). But Moses' prayer caused it, that even the hail that was in the air was removed, as it is stated: <i>no [rain] came pouring down upon the earth</i>. So does it seem.
 




And that which he said to him: <i>Now send word, give refuge to your livestock, etc.</i> (Exodus 9:19) — why did He warn him? As behold, He came to attack him! The reason is that He only wanted to bring the hail upon the trees of the field, to be struck down by the hail. Hence He warned him that he should bring in that which was not the Omnipresent's will [to strike down], so that the plague not be counterproductive. As it was not the will of the Omnipresent about it, that the livestock be struck now. So He showed him that He wanted what was good for him, that which He did not want to strike the livestock now. Hence concerning this plague, Pharaoh said, "<i>The Lord is in the right [tzaddik]</i> (Exodus 9:27), for behold, I saw that He acted charitably [<i>assah tzedekah</i>] with me, however I did not recognize it." But with the plague of pestilence, which was also with the livestock in the field (Exodus 9:3), He did not warn them to bring them into the house. As there, the plague was against the livestock, so He did not want to warn them. So it was specifically about the hail that He warned them, since the strike was only [meant to be] against the trees of the field. So He warned him to bring anything that the plague was not aimed at into the house.

<b>And in the Midrash Rabbah</b> on this section (Shemot Rabbah 15:12): <i>And they shall take each person a lamb</i> (Exodus 12:3), corresponding to <i>God will see to the lamb for Him</i> (Genesis 22:8). <i>Unblemished [tamim]</i> (Exodus 12:5), corresponding to <i>The Rock, His actions are perfect [tamim]</i> (Deuteronomy 32:4); <i>a male</i>, as He kills all the firstborn of Egypt and spares the firstborn of Israel; <i>from the sheep or from the goats you shall take it</i> – just as I kill man and animal, the captive and the maidservant, so do you have license to take [it] from any place that you wish, and should guard it [the lamb], and it shall be for you a great festivity, as it is stated: <i>You shall hold it in safekeeping</i> (Exodus 12:6). <i>And you shall slaughter it</i> – you slaughter the paschal offering, and I slaughter the firstborn. <i>They shall take of the blood and place it on the two doorposts</i> (Exodus 12:7) – as I will pass over you and protect you. You shall be careful with it, as it is eaten [only] at night, as it is stated: <i>They shall eat the meat on that night, roasted with fire</i> (Exodus 12:8). <i>Roasted with fire</i>, corresponding to Abraham, whom He rescued from the fiery furnace; <i>and unleavened bread</i>, corresponding to Sarah, who prepared loaves for the angels; <i>and bitter herbs</i>, corresponding to Jacob – just as his descendants were pursued in Egypt, so did Esau pursue him. <i>You shall not leave any of it until morning</i> (Exodus 12:10) – just as I will not leave any soul [of the Egyptian firstborn] until morning. It is analogous to a king who told his sons, "Know that I judge capital cases. Offer a gift to me, so that when I go up to the tribunal, I will transfer [<i>aavor</i>] your verdict to others." So too did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, "I am dealing in capital cases, and I hereby inform you that I can spare you with mercy, with the blood of the paschal offering and the blood of circumcision; and I will grant atonement to your souls, as the passage [<i>haavara</i>] that I will make is severe," as it is stated: <i>I will pass in the land of Egypt [on that night]</i> (Exodus 12:12). Likewise, Israel says: <i>The Lord also will be a haven for the oppressed, a haven for times of trouble</i> (Psalms 9:10). To here [is the midrash].

And the Shabbat before Passover is called Shabbat haGadol, and many words have come about this, but none explain it except that we read as a haftara that day "And they will be pleasing to haShem" (Malachi 3:4-24) and there it says (Malachi 3:23) "before the coming of the great [haGadol] and the awesome day of haShem:" For this reason it is called Shabbat haGadol. And the explanation that the Exodus from Egypt was called great on account of the greatness of God's awesome acts that God did and acted when they left Egypt, and in the future, in the world to come, Israel will aquire even higher levels, and the Holy Blessed One will do even greater deeds than all the great deeds, and even more awesome than all the awesome deeds. And as Israel merited the level of the Exodus from Egypt when great deeds were done with them, they will merit an even higher level and and deeds will be done in the n world to come. And thus the Shabbat before Passover is called Shabbat haGadol, for every Shabbat is a source and remembrance of the world to come which is called Shabbat as well, and thus the Shabbat preceding Pesach is a remembrance of the great Shabbat that will be the "great and the awesome day of haShem."
And thus the Shabbat before the Day of Atonement is called Shabbat Tshuvah [repentance/returning], and this is because the Day of Atonement is a day of repentance/returning, for all return to their original inheritance by the forgiveness of the Holy Blessed One who forvices them, and they return to haShem and this is known, and thus the Torah determined the jubilee on the Day of Atonement for all return to their original inheritance, and the day of Atonement is similar to this, for they repent/return from the iniquities that were upon them and return to haShem, and in the future when every day will be Shabbat all return to haShem at the diminishing of thus world, and this will be by the merit of the Day of Atonement that they now return to haShem, thus they will merit to repent/return on that Shabbat to haShem. And since every Shabbat is a source of the world to come and a remembrance of it, thus the Shabbat preceding the Day of Atonement is a source for the Shabbat on which all will return to haShem, and obviously it's the Shabbat before and not the Shabbat after, for that Shabbat is first and higher. And since the Shabbat of the future of the world to come belongs to the Day of Atonement as we said, our Shabbat is an allegory for it belonging solely to the Shabbat before it, and not the Shabbat after the Day of Atonement for the Day of Atonement has already passed and this is clear. And thus for the matter of Shabbat haGadol.
And look, it is made clear that the Shabbat before Passover we can call it Shabbat haGadol for Passover is great, as above, and the Shabbat relying on it is the Shabbat even more magnified and blessed, for it is all the more the great and awesome day, and understand well that this is correct and there is no doubt for understanding it.

<b>Another reason</b> for the redemption of Israel, they said in Shir Hashirim Rabbah (4:12) about the verse <i>a locked garden</i> (Song of Songs 4:12): “Rabbi Huna said in the name of bar Kappara: By virtue of four matters, Israel was redeemed from Egypt: That they did not change their name, they did not change their language, they did not speak slander, and not one of them was steeped in licentiousness. They did not change their name: Reuben and Simeon descended [to Egypt]*; Reuben and Simeon ascended*. They did not call Reuben Rufus, they did not call Simeon Luleyani, [...] They did not change their language. There, it is written: <i>The survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew</i> (Genesis 14:13), and here it is written: <i>The God of the Hebrews [has called upon us]</i> (Exodus 5:3), and it is written: <i>That it is my mouth speaking to you</i> (Genesis 45:12), in the sacred tongue.* They did not speak slander, as it is stated: <i>Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask each man from his neighbor</i> (Exodus 11:2). You find that this matter had been entrusted to them for twelve months, and not one of them was found to have informed on his counterpart. Not one of them was steeped in licentiousness, as it is stated: <i>The son of an Israelite woman went out, and he is [the son of] an Egyptian man</i> (Leviticus 24:10–11), to apprise in praise of Israel that not one of them was found except for this one.”(Shir HaShirim Rabbah 4:12:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Translation of the midrash adapted from <i>The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022</i></i>.
<b>To explain this statement,</b> the redemption* of Egypt was because they had not been uniting with Egypt. For if they had been uniting with Egypt, and if Israel had an attachment with Egypt, they would not have left them*, because they would have had an attachment with Egypt, and how* could they extricate themselves? Accordingly, had they changed their names to Egyptian names*, or had they spoken the Egyptian language, they would have had a connection with them, and they would not have left. Likewise their not speaking slander, and their not being steeped in licentiousness, because if, God forbid, they had revealed their secret to the Egyptians, that would be intimacy with Egypt in revealing their secrets and their innermost to Egypt, and that is uniting with them, and they would not have left Egypt, because they would have had unity and connection with them. And all the more so if they had been steeped in licentiousness, mixing with Egypt*, which is more intimacy and more unity with them—coupling with them.

<b>Also there (Sota 30b):</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: At the time that [the Jewish people] ascended from the sea they resolved to sing a song. [And how did they recite this song?] If a baby was lying on his mother’s lap or an infant was nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Divine Presence, the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth, and they recited, “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). As it is stated (Psalms 8:3): “Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings You have founded strength (<i>oz</i>, which is spelled the same as the first word in the song).” Rabbi Meir would say: Even fetuses in their mother’s womb recited the song at the sea, as it is stated (Psalms 68:27), “In full assemblies, bless God, the Lord, you that are from the source of Israel.” To here [is the Gemara.]
They wanted to say with this as we said above. For the Song is from the angle of that which is caused desiring to cling to its Cause from which it comes. For every caused thing desires its cause. And hence Rabbi Yosei HaGelili reasoned that the baby who is caused by the mother and clings to his mother, or an infant who turned to the thing that is the source of existence for him, which is nursing – so he was nursing from his mother’s breasts – when he saw the Divine Presence, which is his true cause, he left the physical source and cause and turned to his Cause, which is actually his Cause. For all things turn to their cause. The general principle of the thing that they wanted to say with this is that their level was so great, to the point that they all turned to the Cause and were clinging to it. And this is the matter of Song. For you do not need to say that this Song of the infant was oral and with speech, as people think. Rather, since the level of the Jewish people was so great, to the point that they were all clinging to the First Cause, they were separated from the physical.

<b>And concerning the drinking of wine</b> on the eve of Passover, the Gemara (Pesachim 107b) says, "Rava drank wine all day on the eve of Passover in order to stimulate his heart [i.e., whet his appetite], so that he might eat more matzah." But in the chapter [entitled] Keitzad Mevarchin (Berakhot 35b:18), it asks, "But does wine satiate? Wouldn’t Rava drink wine all day on the eve of Passover?" And it answers, "A lot of wine stimulates, a little satiates." And in Tosafot (on Berakhot there), [they wrote]: From here, it is implied that it is forbidden to drink wine on the eve of Passover from the time of the afternoon prayers and onward. But if he wants to drink, he should drink a lot of wine, as it stimulates [the appetite]. To here [are their words]. But the opinion of the author of Tur is not like that, as he decided (in Orach Chaim), Paragraph 471 (Line 1), that one may drink, whether a lot or a little. And our teacher, the rabbi, Rabbi Yosef Karo, may his memory be blessed, (in Beit Yosef, there) was from those who wondered about [this decision] in Tur, for Tosafot showed from the Gemara that it is forbidden to drink a little wine!

<b>However, the explanation</b> of the thing is that is because matzah is called the bread of poverty [<i>lechem oni</i>], the opposite of enriched [<i>ashirah</i>] matzah. As when it has oil or honey in it, it is called enriched, since that thing enriches the bread. And that is because a poor person has nothing besides himself; he does not have money, but only himself and his body. So, too, with matzah, when it only has the essential dough — as the essence of dough is water and flour, and that is the essential dough — in this way, it is the bread of poverty. But if there is leaven or leavened matter in it, the taste of the leaven or leavened matter adds to the essence of the dough. And that is more enriched than enriched matzah. For the enrichment of enriched matzah is because there is liquid in it; however, dough that has leaven or leavened matter has extended further out from poverty, since there is leavened matter in the body of the dough. And that is why matzah is the bread of poverty.

And we pour a second cup and one begins, Mah Nishtanah (How is [tonight] different), and recounts all of the differences that we are doing on this night (Pesachim 116a). And some ask - behold, we have not found an answer to the [question], "How is it different?" And because of that, they explained things that are distant from the truth. But all of this is not difficult - as the answer is certainly at the end of the  [section], when he answers, "Pesach, Matzah and Maror," when he gets there.  However, "We were slaves," is the beginning of the story. And likewise, about our reclining, he answers, "In each and every generation, one is obligated to see himself as if he left Egypt, etc." And since he sees himself as if he left Egypt, reclining should be done. For it is [then] apparent that he is free. And he answers everything as is appropriate.

Indeed, there is something else wondrous and deep in this: You should know that this angel was M[i]chael, the numerical equivalent of angel [<i>malakh</i>]; and this seraph was Gabriel. And [regarding] these two angels, Michael is of water, and Gabriel is of fire, and that is why he is called a seraph [the meaning of which is burnt]. And about them, it is stated, <i>He makes peace in His heights</i> (Job 25:2). As He established Michael with water and Gabriel with fire, yet one does not injure the other. And behold, water and fire are two opposites in their actions. There are some actions in the world that follow from the trait of water, and there are some from the trait of fire. But you will not find a force that includes everything besides God, may He be blessed. For [regarding] all the angels, this one is appointed over this, and that one is appointed over that. However, God, may He be blessed, includes everything. And that is why it said that this extraction was not from the angel appointed over the water, and the actions would have come from him, according to that which is appropriate to come from him. And there are actions that are the opposite, such that they come from the trait of fire. But the extraction was also not through that power either.
 <b>And not through</b> a messenger: For the actions which are in the world that come from the higher beings are divided into these three parts. And that is because He, the First Cause, may His name and His mention be forever blessed, includes everything, hence His actions are not just partial but rather with everything. Whereas angels are appointed over partial things, as we said above. Hence Michael is water, Gabriel is fire, and none include everything. Rather, each one has one specific part. However there is one angel who does not act with the specific, so he includes more than the other angels. However there is a difference between this angel and the First Cause, since his comprehensiveness is with a smaller power. It comes out that an angel and a seraph are completely differentiated from the First Cause, since each one does something specific, whereas He, may He be blessed, includes everything. And the third [category] is that there is an angel that is not specific, however, his power to act is smaller. And these three things include all of the parts. Hence he is called a messenger, since the messenger is like him regarding comprehensiveness. But because he is His messenger, he is smaller in his level. As the greater sends the smaller. Hence he has a smaller power, but he is not specific. Among the sages, it is known that the name of this messenger is Metatron, which is the numerical equivalent of the Omnipotent [<i>Shaddai</i>]. And Scripture states about him, <i>Behold, I will send an angel before you, etc. as My name is in him</i> (Exodus 23:20-21); and the sages called him the Small Omnipotent. And it is stated about him, <i>I have been young and I have also grown old</i> (Psalms 37:25). And all of these are found in comprehensiveness, but with [less] power.

Chapter 57






So behold, the first three plagues, blood, frogs, and lice, are in the lower realms. As this is [the case] when the Nile turns into blood (Exodus 7:20); when the Nile swarms with frogs (Exodus 7:28), and the land with lice (Exodus 8:3). Whereas the plague of the mix of animals, the pestilence, and the boils were not at all in the lower realms, but rather with those that dwell on the earth’s surface. For example, the mix of animals dwells on the earth’s surface, as opposed to the frogs and lice which are in the water and the ground. But the mix of animals, which are dangerous wild animals, and the pestilence upon the domesticated animals (Exodus 9:3), and the boils upon man and domesticated animals (Exodus 9:9-10), were all upon animals which are on the earth’s surface. But this is not the case with the first ones, their habitat is not on the [its] surface. As the frogs only live in the water, and the lice only live in the ground, and not on the world’s surface. For swarming creatures that swarm upon the earth (alluding to Genesis 7:21) are not considered living on the earth’s surface; only animals and man, which are not from those which swarm on the earth. But even if the lice were considered as if they were on the Earth’s surface – which is not at all the case – it is inappropriate to call the plague of lice something on the earth’s surface. For behold, the plague was upon the ground, as it is written: <i>Hold out your rod and strike the dust of the earth, etc.</i> (Exodus 8:12)! And the next three are in the sky. For the hail is in the sky, as it is written in the verse (Exodus 9:23); the locusts are from those that surely fly (alluding to Genesis 1:20) in the firmament of the sky; and the darkness was so that the Egyptians could not use the luminaries of the sky. So you see that the next three plagues were in the sky. And afterwards was the plague of the firstborn, which was above everything. For behold, it was upon man’s supernal soul, and the soul has a greater value than the sky. Hence there is an order unique to the plagues of blood, frogs, and lices; an order unique to the plagues of the mix of animals, pestilence, and boils; and an order unique to the plagues of hail, locusts, darkness, and the firstborn. 







5 And furthermore you should know, that when the Holy One brought the plagues upon Egypt, he struck them in all divisions of the world, for just as we have said that the plagues came upon them from below, above, and in the hollow (on the surface) of the world, so too they came upon them in all the divisions of the world. There are ten divisions to the world and they are the ten divisions that the Holy One created in the six days of creation. Each division had its own statement and these are the ten statements with which the world was created, for "Bereishit" was also a statement as is stated in Masechet Rosh Hashana (32a). Even though the plagues did not come upon them in the order fo the statement with which the Holy One created the world for each one has its own order, that is because with regards to the plagues, each plague was always more severe than the previous on for you wouldn't make one severe plague followed by one that is not as severe. Therefore they went from least to most (severe) and this is what causes the change in the order of the statements.
Still, you will find clearly that all of these plagues corresponded to the ten statements. Because of this you will find in the final statement (Bereishit 1:29) "And G-d said, Behold I have given you all seed bearing herbs... to eat." This is the tenth statement that G-d gave living beings their sustenance and food since food upon consumption becomes blood, and when they become blood, the animal is sustained. G-d altered this statement by making the river blood for just as this statement would have been nullified if the creation of blood, their sustenance, had been removed, so too it is considered lost and destroyed when there is an increase in blood for all addition and all subtraction are equal.
The second plague, Frogs, corresponds to the statement "Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures." This nullified the statement "swarming of living creatures" for there was addition here and addition and subtraction are equal for it is called striking it when there is a departure from the order (created by) of the statement and here was a change from the natural order.
The third plague, Lice, that the dirt became lice struck at the statement ""Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear," and now the dry land was struck that the dirt of the land turned to lice. "Afar" (dirt) (of the land) refers to an area fit for habitation. The rest of the land is called "Eretz", but "Afar" refers to inhabited land is clear in Perek Kisuy Hadam (Chullin 88b).
Wild Animals corresponds to "Let the earth bring forth living creatures," that G-d altered this statement to the point that they became completely destructive.
Pestilence corresponds to "Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens." It is agreed upon by researchers that renewed pestilence comes from sparks from the stars that become renewed in their visibility. From them come changes in the air and thickness from star sparks - so say the researchers. Therefore, the pestilence that came upon strikes at the statement "Let there be luminaries."
Boils was a plague against "Let us make man in our image," for we have already explained earlier that boils was a plague that attached itself to man and we don't fine any that attached themselves to man except this one. And since it is written, "Let us make man in our image - in the image of G-d He created man," and with the plague of boils their form and mold was changed, that they no longer had their shape and visage because of the boils attached to them, for the boils destroyed the image of the person that they no longer had a shape and form. For this reason, the sorcerers were embarrassed to stand before Moshe and Aharon when the boils came upon them.
Hail corresponded to "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water." With this statement, an additional action occurred in the sky and hail came from it in an unnatural way. This was a change in the statement "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water," for from the skies came hail.
Locusts corresponded to "Let the earth sprout... fruit trees producing fruit," for the locusts were a destruction of this statement specifically, for locusts are more capable than any other insect in destroying fruit as is written (Devarim 28:38), "The field will produce much seed, but you will gather little for the locusts will consume it," and it also says, "All your trees and fruit of your land will be inherited by locusts." From here you see that Locust are specific in their ability to destroy tree and fruit. Even though the hail also struck the trees of the field, it wasn't specific to the trees of the field for it also struck animals and people. But the locusts were specific to the trees and fruit.
Darkness struck at the statement, "Let there be light."
The Plague of the Firstborns corresponds to the statement of "Bereishit," for a firstborn is the first of those that come after it and it corresponds to the statement of Bereishis which was the beginning of creation as well. They are both beginnings. Just as the plague of the firstborns was equal to all the other plagues, so too, the statement of "Bereishis," was equal to all the other statement - so we find in the Midrash.

And because God, may He be blessed, took and chose the Jewish people in particular from all of the nations to be His; He showed through this that He is unique. For since He is unique, He chose a unique nation, and not the nations as a whole. For this fosters the idea of oneness, that He should have a specific nation. For were there no unity here, He would not have chosen a unique nation. However since He is unique, He chose the unique. And this service is the service of a unique people to the One who is one. 
And that is the essence of this sacrifice, and that is why all of this service related to oneness. For the commandment of this sacrifice is to eat it, "with its legs and its inner organs" (Exodus 12:9), since it is not fitting for this sacrifice to be divided up, but rather, "its head with its legs and its inner organs." For something divided up is not one; as behold, it has portions. But something that is whole has oneness, since all of the content of this sacrifice is to show oneness. And likewise, "It shall be eaten in one house" (Exodus 12:46): This whole idea is that it is forbidden to divide a sacrifice between two group or that it is forbidden to eat it in two places - as it is a disagreement among Tannaim in Tractate Pesachim (86a). This whole thing is so that the process of the sacrifice be in a manner of oneness, and not in a manner of division.

And similarly, "Do not eat it raw, nor cooked, but rather roasted" (Exodus 12:9). This is all the same idea, that cooking in water or in other liquids causes the parts to detach through the cooking process, and disconnect. But with roasting, because of the fire's power, it is the opposite. The piece of meat becomes unified, because the fire expels the juices, and the meat becomes hard and one unit, which is not so when it is cooked in water, where it falls apart. So too it is forbidden because of this reason to eat it raw, but rather roasted, and then the meat hardens because of the fire. All of this teaches the idea of unity, that the sacrifice is one toward Hashem Yitbarach who is one. Furthermore, we have mentioned many times how water is always in the plural throughout Scripture, and we have explained the reason (in chapter 18 above) on the verse of "For from the water was he drawn out" (Exodus 2:10), that it is because water is substance (chomer), and unity can only occur in form (tzurah). Thus, this sacrifice, which teaches about unity, cannot be cooked in water, or any liquid which is like water. This idea is great and understandable.
And similarly, "You shall not break any of its bones" (Exodus 12:46). This is the same thing, that if a bone of the Pesach is broken, this represents separation and disunity regarding something that is inedible. Because even though he eats the meat of the edible parts, that is not considered separation and disunity, because it is meant to be eaten. But breaking the bones, which is not for eating, that is called a break and a disconnection, which is not possible for the Pesach. Furthermore the breaking of bones, which is called an "etzem" (essence of a thing), that breaking is especially called separation and disunity.
The principle of the thing is, that the Pesach should be a unified sacrifice, because it represents Hashem Yitbarach who is one, for the Israelite worship is from the aspect of unity that He is one, and therefore He chose a singular nation as well, since He Himself is singular. Furthermore, this sacrifice, which is the primary worship representing that He is the God of Israel, and that He is singular in His divinity, thus the sacrifice must be one. This is not so for other sacrifices, the service thereof is not about Him being their God - only with this sacrifice does it state, You shall serve with the worship..." (Exodus 13:5), where this sacrifice is just called "worship" (avoda). Therefore this sacrifice is regarding His divinity, and that He is singular in His divinity.

Chapter 61


<b>There are those who ask</b>, what good has the leaving done us? We are enslaved among the other kingdoms. What difference is there really between the kingdom of Egypt and the other kingdoms? —And these words are nonsense, for when Israel went out from Egypt, they received the essential good, such that they were capable themselves of being free, by dint of their elevation, and that elevation is essential to Israel, that they are capable of being free by dint of their own essential elevation. And a happenstance cannot nullify an essential thing at all, because Israel still has that elevation; they are essentially free, even though they happen to be enslaved. Because since the Holy Blessed One brought Israel out of Egypt, and made them free, and not only that, but even kings, as it says “And you shall be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6)—that name applies to Israel’s essence, and the elevation and the importance in it is not nullified in their exile, which is only by happenstance. Accordingly, the sages of Israel say (Shabbat 67a) “All of Israel are princes” even in their exile, and that is by way of their elevation and the importance that Israel in its essence received, which is not nullified by a happenstance at all. And there is no doubt that there are things that are drawn to Israel as a result of their elevation and importance, because they are essentially free, and their strength will not diminish because they happen to be slaves. And this is a simple matter, and there is no need to speak at length about it, as it is clear to those who understood it.
<b>Therefore we are obligated, etc.:</b> This is the version I have found in all of the Ashkenazi orders [of prayer], and it seems very correct to me: Therefore we are obligated to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, lavish, bless, raise high and acclaim He who made miracles, etc. And these are nine praises; and the tenth praise is, "And let us say before Him, <i>Halleluyah</i>!" And it appears that there are ten praises, corresponding to the ten praises with which the book of Psalms were said. And in the chapter [entitled] Arvei Pesachim (Pesachim 117a): This book is said by means of ten types of hymns - by <i>nitzuaḥ, niggun, maskil, mizmor, shir, ashrei, tehillah, tefillah, hodaah<i> and <i>halleluyah</i>. The greatest of them all is halleluyah, as it includes God’s name and praise in one word. To here [is the Gemara]. Hence here it said nine types of praises, and "let us say before Him, <i>Halleluyah</i>," is the tenth, since it is the greatest of the ten praises.</i></i>
