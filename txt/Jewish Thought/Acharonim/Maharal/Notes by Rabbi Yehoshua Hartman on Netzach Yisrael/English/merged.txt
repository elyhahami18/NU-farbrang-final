Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman on Netzach Yisrael

Introduction







Chapter 1


































































...[66] The explanation: Since Rachel is called <i>akeret habayit</i>, the meaning of which is the mainstay of the home <i>ikar habayit</i>, it follows that the word home refers to Rachel more than it does to Leah. And so the characteristics of a home [which are the powers of unity] are primarily with Rachel. And these are [Maharal's] words in Gur Aryeh on Genesis 48, note 12: “And this midrash has more of a secret, since the Congregation of Israel [<i>Knesset Yisrael</i>] is called Rachel. For Rachel is Jacob’s mainstay of the home, and everything [else] is auxiliary to her. And that is why she is like the house of Jacob. So the Congregation of Israel – which is the house of Jacob – is called by her name. And in Rachel’s merit, they will return to their borders, to connect with the Holy One, blessed be He. As [in] this dispersion that the Jewish people are separated from the Holy One, blessed be He, [and] dispersed in all the lands, they have a force that connects and gathers them. As behold, Rachel is the house of Israel that gathers them. So in her merit, they will have a complete gathering, to return to their borders.” And in another place in Gur Aryeh, he explains that the description, “Congregation of Israel,” is “the general force in the Jewish people, which is called the Congregation of Israel, which is an expression of gathering” (Gur Aryeh on Leviticus 20, note 6). And there, he continues to explain that the name, Congregation of Israel, relates to the mother more than to the father. And therefore, it is clear that Congregation of Israel refers to Rachel.
