Introduction







Chapter 1

When a good thing is known from its opposite, that is true knowledge.  The knowledge of all things is acquired from their opposite.  It is from the appearance of black that one can gain knowledge of the appearance of white.  And smilarly with all opposites.  From one is acquired the knowledge of its opposite.  It is widely accepted that "the knowledge of opposites is all one thing".  Because of this, the [Sages] say in Arvei Pesachim (The final chapter of Babylonian Talmud Tractate Pesachim 116a) that in the Haggadah "one begins with disgrace and concludes with praise".  Why do they begin with disgrace?  Only because true praise can only be recognised from its opposite.  Therefore, we cannot explain the the concept of the final redemption [geulah], without explaining the concept of exile [galut] and churban [destruction of the temple in Jerusalem].  It is by this means that we can come to know the goodness and salvation which we hope for.  When we come to explain the concept of exile with true knowledge, we will need to start with the cause of the exile, and matters connected to the exile.
There is another reason to explain the concept of exile first.  The exile itself is proof and clear imperative for redemption.  This is because there is no doubt that exile is an alteration and departure from the normal order.  The Blessed Holy One arranged each nation in the place which is appropriate for it, so he arranged the People of Israel into the place which is appropriate for it, namely the Land of Israel.  Exile from their place is a complete alteration and departure [from that order].  Anything which departs from its natural place, which is outside its place, is unable to stay in the place which is not natural for it.  Rather they need to return to their natural place.  Because if they remain in a place which is unnatural for them, then the unnatural would become natural.  And it is impossible for the unnatural to become natural.  A metaphor: it is like trying to force fire to stay down, when it's natural state is to rise - or like trying to hold up solid matter, when its natural state is to fall to the earth.  If you could achieve that, then you would be making the unnatural natural.
Similarly with the People of Israel themselves.  If they were to stay in exile for ever, which is not the right place for them to be (since the right place for them, according to the order of existence, is the Land of Israel under their own sovereignty and not under the sovereignty of any other).  Just like everything in natural existence, each one has its own place as our sages decreed (Pirkei Avot 4:3) "There is nothing which does not have its place".  Each thing under its own sovereignty.  If they would remain in exile forever, then this thing (unnaturally standing outside their place) would become natural.  Only natural things can stand permanently, because the nature which the Blessed Holy One gave to each thing is what sustains it such that it is established to stand forever.  If an unnatural state of affairs were to exist forever, even though it was not according to the order and nature of existence, then the nature of that thing would be loosened and nullified completely for no purpose, and such a thing could not happen.
Similarly, dispersal is not a natural state of affairs.  Just as each thing returns to its place, so dispersed and separated parts have to return to [become] one entity.  This is clear to anyone of intelligence, that all parts have one essence to them.  If so, why would there be a division between them, and not unity, since they are one thing?  Therefore all dispersal stands only to be coalesced together.  Therefore the dispersal of the People of Israel among the nations is a thing which exists outside of nature, since (the People of Israel) is one nation, suitable to be standing together as one, as is found in the case of all natural things which are not divided into two.  Rather that they should be joined together.  Similarly "All the rivers flow into the sea" (Kohelet 1:7) to be gathered together.  One thing is not divided.  So since the Jewish nation is a nation united more than any other nation, not divided or separated , it is appropriate that they should be gathered together.  From this we can see that dispersal is particularly unnatural for them.  It is impossible to say that this state of affairs is only because of sin and iniquity, after all the dispersal of the People of Israel is so unnatural, because if this were to become permanent, then the unnatural would have to become natural.
Furthermore, according to the order of existence, it is not appropriate for a nation to be subjugated by another under the weight of a yoke upon it.  Because the Blessed Holy One created each nation with its own purpose.  The idea that the People of Israel should be "higher than all the other nations of the earth" (Deut 28:1) when they do the will of the Almighty is a separate concept, because it is the order of existence that [in those conditions] they should be on a higher level.    But in the case of the rest of the nations, according to the order of existence, it is appropriate that each one of them from the point of view of being created for its own purpose, should not be under the authority of others.  And if such a state of affairs were to exist permanently, namely the exile and the hand of other nations ruling over the People of Israel, then such a state of affairs contrary to the order of existence, an alteration in the order of the world, would be impossible. Therefore we can only understand redemption from exile.
The Sages hinted towards this idea, in their wisdom, in Midrash Bereishit Rabbah (44:18) [on the double language in the verse] "G-d said to Avram you shall surely know [lit: it is known, you will know]" (Gen 15:13)" [The Midrash says:] "(1) It is known that I will disperse them, you will know that I will gather them in.  (2) It is known that I will pawn them, you will know that I will reclaim them.  (3) It is known that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them." This Midrash did not need to express all three of these ideas, because they are all one concept.  It would have been enough for them to express [only the third one] "It is known that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them"  Because this is the essence which records that, in any case, that He will redeem Am Yisrael.  So why did they need to mention also the idea of (1) gathering in and (2) reclaiming?    The [Sages] wanted to express that by this double expression  the exile and redemption are hinted at.  The exile is referred to by the expression "it is known" and the redemption by the expression "you will know" in the future tense. They explain [that G-d is saying] "it is known that I disperse them, you will know that I will gather them in".  Because dispersal is not according to the order of existence - that a single entity, like the People of Israel which is one people, should be dispersed, as has been explained already, that things which are one are together also.  And [the Sages say] "it is known that I will pawn them" meaning that I will put them under the authority of others, and it is not appropriate according to the order of existence that the People of Israel should stand under any other sovereignty.  Because when the People of Israel are in another land, they leave behind their own sovereignty and stand under the authority of another.  Like a pawned object which is situated in the domain of someone other than its owner.  So with the People of Israel, who should not, according to the order of existence, be under the government of others, and that others should be subjugating them, because it was not for this that they were created.  Therefore, "by it being known  that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them" - take them out of the subjugation.  Because He is the One who ordered existence, it is impossible that something which comes from Him should depart from that order.  Rather something temporary arising out of the happening of a sin, because something which is a temporary punishment because of sin is not called a departure from the order of existence.  But for such a state of affairs to continue forever cannot be, because you will not find anything which departs from the natural order which sustains.  Similarly when [the Sages] said "it is known that I will subjugate them, you will know that I will redeem them", it is because the subjugation of one nation by another is not in accordance with the order of existence as it should be, because it should be that every nation is free.  This we have discussed at length in my book "Gevurot Hashem" (Chap 35) on the verse "This month shall be for you the first of months" (Ex 12:2)  q.v. Thus has been explained by these three ideas [being out of place, dispersal, and subjugation] that one can come to an understanding of redemption from [understanding] exile.
And you will understand all this, since the letters of the expressions, exiled [<i>galah</i>] and redeemed [<i>gaal</i>], are the same [even though only the first has a <i>hey</i> and only the second has an <i>alef</i>]. It is just that the expression, redeemed, hints within it that He, may He be blessed, redeemed them from all four directions of the world and united their dispersion. For all unity in the world is in the center, since the edges are divided but the center is one. And that is why the <i>alef</i>, which is unity and the unification of the dispersion, is in the middle [of the word]. However, exiled is with a <i>hey</i>, which is dispersion. And dispersion is in the four directions, in all of the edges, and also in the center. For something that is dispersed is dispersed in all of the space, which includes the four directions and also the center. And even though the middle is not dispersion — this thing that they have a middle comes to teach that a power of unity and assembly remains among the Jewish people, as will be explained. It also tells you that the exile itself is a cause for the redemption, to assemble the dispersion, and for the Jewish people to be one. Hence the letters of exiled are the letters of redeemed, except that the dispersion becomes a unification, which is hinted to in the <i>alef</i> of <i>gaal</i>; and with that which there is a <i>hey</i> in the word, <i>galah</i>, since the <i>hey</i> teaches that the Jewish people is dispersed in all of the corners and in the center. And because of this, unity remains among them, even in their exile. As, behold, the one that is in the center, in the middle of the four [directions], unites and binds the dispersion of the four to itself. For the middle always unites and binds everything. And this thing indicates that the Jewish people still have the power of unity in their exile, and that they have not been completely separated. And because of this power of unity that remains in them, they will again unite. For if, God forbid, there were no power of unity remaining in them, they would have already separated and they would not have the power to become reunited. However now they will unite from the power of unity that remains among the Jewish people.

And it said that each one was destroyed because of a matter fitting for it. As Jerusalem was destroyed because of baseless hatred, and this was explained in the previous chapter (Chapter 4) at length. For the entire Jewish people are made to be like one person on account of the temple and Jerusalem. This is because they [only] had one altar and were not permitted to have each person build his own altar (Megillah 10a). So the Jewish people were one on account of the temple. But when there was division among them, that place, which was made for the unity of the Jewish people, was destroyed. And that is why the city and the temple were destroyed because of the baseless hatred of Kamtza.

Chapter 9






And in the Midrash (Eikhah Rabbah 1:1): They asked Ben Azai, saying to him, "Our teacher, expound for us one matter from the scroll of Lamentations." He said to them, "Israel was exiled only after they denied the Unique One of the world, circumcision that was given after twenty generations, the Ten Commandments, and the five books of the Torah. From where [do we know this]?  '<i>Eikhah</i> (the numerical value of which is 36, the sum of these things) does it sit desolate.'" To here [is the Midrash]. The author of this Midrash further clarified the matter. And that is because Israel had a covenant with God, may He be blessed. And when they had the covenant with God, may He be blessed - and that is the link and the connection - they were not exiled. For they had a connection and link with God, may He be blessed. But [they were exiled] when they negated the covenant, by way of denying the One with whom they had a covenant; and that was the Unique One of the world. And they also denied that there was a receiver of the covenant, since circumcision indicates that the Jews accepted the covenant from God, may He be blessed. For circumcision is a covenant that clings to the body of a person, and it is the connection. And that is why the covenant is in their flesh: To say that the Jews accept the covenant from God, may He be blessed. And the Torah and the Ten Commandments are a covenant and a connection when the Jews are following the Torah and the Ten Commandments. For they rest in the "Ark of the Covenant" (Joshua 3:6). As the Torah and the commandments that God, may He be blessed, gave to Israel - that is the covenant itself and the connection, when the Jews are doing His commandments. For any covenant and link is on account of three [entities]. The first [here] is God, may He be blessed, who sealed a covenant with them. [The second] is the recipient of the covenant, which is man. And the thing that is the covenant is the third. 

Chapter 10



Chapter 11


















It has become clear to you that that which God, may He be blessed, took the Jewish people for Himself is not because of the righteousness of the Jewish people or their deeds. Rather it was a more encompassing choice. And this thing is explained in several places, and the faithful sages [also] came [to discuss] it in several places. Hence it is not fit to say that with the removal of the cause – which is the righteousness of the Jewish people – the result would also be removed, meaning His taking them as a people for Himself. And even though their deeds, good or bad, caused there to be more or less attachment [to God], as this is certainly according to the majority of [their] deeds, such that there would be more or less [of it] – nevertheless, [God's] actual choice was not because of any deed at all.

In the [Babylonian] Talmud in chapter Chelek (Sanhedrin 94a) he said: "To where were [the ten tribes] exiled? Mar Zutra says:  to Afrikei, and Rabbi Ḥanina says: To the Selug Mountains".  Now, according to the one who said "Afrikei", there are no known Israelites in Africa.  And one can't say that they were mixed with the gentiles and that the dispute [of Rabbi Akiva  and Rabbi Elazar] is whether those mixed among the gentiles will return in the future, for in the first chapter of Tractate Yevamoth (17a) it is [clear] that we are not concerned for this [possibility], for it says there: a [presumed] gentile who [attempts to] perform Kiddushin [which is only effectable by an Israelite or proselyte] nowadays, we are not concerned that the "Kiddushin" may be valid, [since] perhaps he is from the ten tribes, as "it is learned as a tradition that the girls from the ten tribes of that generation [became barren]", and there was no further concern that there were [descendants] of the ten tribes [mixed among the gentiles].  Therefore, one must say that that which Rabbi Elazar said that the ten tribes are destined to return, the meaning is that they will return in the future along with the rest of the exiles [of the kingdom of Judah].  For even now also they are [mixed] in the midst of the rest of the exiles [of the kingdom of Judah], for originally He exiled them such that ultimately they would be able to return with the rest of the exiles, for He exiled them originally to Afrikei or to the Selug Mountains, and afterward they were uprooted from their place [there] to be amongst the rest of the exiles [of Judah].  For often a person uproots himself from his place and goes to another place.  And according to [Rabbi Akiva] who said that [the ten tribes] never return, those 10 tribes went off and were lost from the land. This is what is meant "They are not destined to return", i.e. from the onset He didn't exile them that they would then return [again] in the future; rather they would be lost from Israel. Nonetheless, it is unsayable that [G-d forbid] an [entire] tribe would be gone from Israel.  Rather, as we said, [the 10 tribes] returned [to Israel] in the days of Jeremiah and [Josiah ruled] over them (Megillah 14b).  [Rabbi Akiva] is only speaking regarding those [of the 10 tribes] who did not return in the days of Jeremiah, whether they are destined to return. Regarding them [alone] he said "and he cast them to another land as this day" [means] that they will never return.

Chapter 35



Chapter 36

It was explained above that when there is a loss in the world of something that previously come into existence, it causes changes in several things. And just like the loss of something that previously came into existence will be with changes, so too is there a change in the world from the angle of a new existence that comes into the world. Since just like loss is a change, so to is a new existence a change in the world; and that is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. And it is called pangs, since it is like pangs coming to a woman because of the change [deriving] from the existence of the infant that comes to the world. Since every new existence is a change, such that the change is from the angle of the new existence. Likewise when a new matter materializes, meaning the world of the Messiah, it is a new existence that will materialize, such that this is certainly a change. And this is why there will be birth pangs of the Messiah. For it is just like that there are pangs to a woman when an infant comes out to the world from the angle of the existence and creation that comes into the world.

And the rabbis said, "[The Messiah's] name is the white one (on account of having <i>tzaraat</i>) of the House of Rabbi (Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi)": The Messiah also includes the virtue of intellect. Hence the rabbis, who were men of intellect, called him the white one of the House of Rabbi. And this thing is a deep matter. For <i>tzaraat</i> is something that is separated from this world. And that is indicated since the one with <i>tzaraat</i> is evicted from the encampment of Israel, and does not have a relationship to the world. And that is why it is written (Leviticus 13:46), "he shall dwell alone." And because the Messiah is also completely separated from this world, hence before the Messiah comes he is similar to one with <i>tzaraat</i>. As he has no commonality or connection with the world. Rather he is separated from it. And since that which the Messiah is separated is because he is completely of the intellect whereas this world is material, that is why he has the categorization of one with <i>tzaraat</i>. And that is why his name is called the white one of the House of Rabbi. For there were people with <i>tzaraat</i> in the House of Rabbi; because they were separated from this world in the House of Rabbi and they were drawn to the intellect, which is separated from this world. That is why <i>tzaraat</i> came to them, since it is also separated from the creatures. And that is why it said that the Messiah, who is completely of the intellect, is completely separated from this world. And that is why his name is the white one of the House of Rabbi. And this is itself what they said (Sanhedrin 98a) that he sits among the poor who suffer from illnesses. And understand this well!

According to the opinion that holds that after 4,291 years, the world will end, since he holds that we require at least 86 jubilees for the arrival of the Messiah and there is a need for another forty years until the king Messiah fully blossoms -- as it was at first when they went out of Egypt, that they overpowered their enemies after forty years (Numbers 14:33) to finish them off. And so after 4,291 years, the world will end. For 85 Jubilees are 4250 years, plus forty years for the blossoming of the Messiah, and then the world will end in the 41st year.

Chapter 46






And similarly, they said in Chapter 2 of Yevamot (24b:8): The sages taught, "Converts are not accepted in the days of the Messiah. Similarly, they did not accept converts in the days of King David or in the days of King Solomon." Rabbi Eliezer said, "What is the verse [it is based upon]? <i>Behold, they may gather together [gor yagur], but without Me; whosoever shall gather together [gar] with you shall fall on yours</i> (Isaiah 54:15). He who dwells [<i>gar</i>] with you in your poverty, he is the one who shall fall on yours. But not another." Behold, you see that we do not accept converts when times are good [for the Jews]. For a beginning should not be made from good days. Since a person will certainly serve God, may He be blessed, because of this, when he sees good. Hence, it is necessary for him to have his start before [the good times]. Then he will [merit it to] acquire the world to come even during the good days.

In the first chapter of Taanit (9a): Rabbi Yose, son of Rabbi Yehudah, says, “Three good sustainers rose up for the Jewish people, and they are: Moses, Aaron and Miriam. And three good gifts were given through their agency, and these are they: The well, the [pillar of] cloud, and the manna. The well in the merit of Miriam; the pillar of cloud in the merit of Aaron; the manna in the merit of Moses. When Miriam died, the well disappeared, as it is stated (Numbers 20:1), ‘And Miriam died there’; and it says thereafter (Numbers 20:2), ‘And there was no water for the congregation.’ But it returned in the merit of [Moses and Aaron]. When Aaron died the clouds of glory disappeared, as it is stated (Numbers 33:40), ‘And the Canaanite, the king of Arad heard.’ What report did he hear? He heard that Aaron had died and the clouds of glory had disappeared, and he thought he had been given permission to go to war against the Jewish people. And this is [the meaning of] that which is written (Numbers 20:29), ‘And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead.’ Do not read [the verse as], ‘And they saw (<i>vayiru</i>)’; but rather [as], ‘And they were seen (<i>vayerau</i>)' [since the clouds which had concealed the Jewish people were temporarily removed]. Both returned in the merit of Moses. As it is stated (Zechariah 11:8), ‘And I cut off the three shepherds in one month.’ But did they die in one month? Didn’t Miriam die in Nisan, and Aaron in Av and Moses in Adar? Rather, it is that three good gifts that were given through their agency were annulled, and all disappeared in one month.” To here [is the Gemara].
And it can be asked why were the clouds of glory  by the agency of Aaron, and the manna by the agency of Moses and the well by the agency of Miriam. But once you understand the things that were explained to you above, you will understand these things. We have already explained that Moses was fitting that the manna should be through his agency. For it was the sustenance of Israel and he was the sustainer of the generation and the leader of the generation. As the leader and the king in particular is called the sustainer, since he fills the lackings of the generation, just as sustenance fills man's lackings. And that is why Moses - who was the sustainer and king of Israel in particular, as explained above - was fitting to sustain and feed Israel to the point that the sustenance of Israel should be by his agency. Hence the manna, which is the sustenance of Israel, was by the agency of Moses.
And the clouds of glory were by that agency of Aaron: We have already told you that the connection of the Holy One, blessed be He, with Israel was through Aaron. It is in the same way that you find in every place that the Divine Presence was revealed among the lower beings, it was with the clouds of glory - "And the Lord appeared [...] in the pillar of cloud" (Deuteronomy 31:15), and such was always [the case]; "It was on the third day, in the morning, that there was thunder and lightning; a heavy cloud" (Exodus 19:17). And likewise, in every place where there was the revelation of His Divine Presence to the lower creatures, it was with the pillar of cloud. And that is why it was fitting that it be by the agency of Aaron, for the connection between God, may He be blessed, and Israel was through Aaron, as was explained.

And also in the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 105b) — Rabbi Elazar said: From the blessing of that wicked person [Balaam], you know what was in his heart. He sought to say that they should not have synagogues and study halls. [Instead,] he said, <i>How goodly are your tents, Jacob</i> (Numbers 24:5). He sought to say that the divine presence should not rest upon them. [Instead,] he said, <i>and your dwellings [mishkenot] Israel</i>. The kingdom of Israel would not continue; [he said,] <i>Like the winding brooks</i> (Numbers 24:6). They would have no olive trees and vineyards; [he said], <i>like gardens by the river’s side</i>. Their fragrance would not diffuse; [he said,] <i>like aloes that the Lord has planted</i>. They would not have kings of stature; [he said,] <i>like cedar trees beside the waters</i>. They will not have a king the son of a king; [he said], <i>Water shall flow from his branches</i> (Numbers 24:7). Their kingdom would not rule over the nations; [he said,] <i> and his seed shall be in many waters</i>. Their kingdom would not be fierce; [he said,] <i>and his king shall be higher than Agag</i>. There will be no fear of [their] kingdom; [he said,] <i>and his kingdom shall be exalted</i>. Rabbi Abba said: All of [the blessings] reverted to be a curse [such as he originally intended, except for the synagogues and study halls, as it is stated: <i>And the Lord your God transformed the curse into a blessing for you</i> (Deuteronomy 23:6) — "curse" [in the singular], not curses [in the plural]. To here [is the Talmud].
