<b>In the first chapter of Makkot (7a),</b> we learn [in the Mishnah]: A High Court [Sanhedrin] that executes [someone] once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says, "Once in seventy years." Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say, "If we had been in the court, no person would have ever been executed." And this is as we said — that since it issues the death penalty once in seven years, something that happens once in seven years, which is a continuous cycle, is not called uncommon. Rather, it is called common and is not an incidental thing. And that is why it is called destructive. Whereas Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says, "Once in seventy years." And in the Gemara (7a), it is asked whether the meaning is that [if it is] once in seventy years, it is called destructive. For anything that happens once in a person's life, which is seventy years, such that they would execute [someone] in each generation, is called common, such that they are destructive. Or is it that it is appropriate to execute [someone] once in seventy years. Otherwise, it will not be said that they are a court at all, since they clearly do not issue the death penalty. And the Gemara leaves this unresolved. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say, "If we had been in the court, no person would have ever been executed," as they would have argued the defense to so great an extent, as it is explained there. But about this, they answered them, "You would increase the number of murderers," when they would see that everyone was judged as innocent, such that they would not have any fear of the court at all when there would not be a single conviction. And it is worthwhile to bring all these things near to oneself with both hands; they are words of truth and righteousness.

<b>In the chapter [entitled] Arba Mitot</b> (Sanhedrin 64), they said regarding the passing of offspring to Molekh, "One who passed all his offspring through fire to the priests of Molekh is exempt, as it is stated, <i>of his offspring</i> (Leviticus 20:3), and not all his offspring." And they say, how is it possible that one who passes some of his offspring be more severe than all of his children! But it is not that it is more stringent, it is only that they said one who passes all of his offspring is exempt. However [the questioners] do not accept this thing. Yet this thing is [actually] not a wonder, especially since Scripture shows this. As it wrote, <i>since he gave of his offspring to Molekh</i>, and it did not write, "since he gave his offspring to Molekh." So behold, it implies some of his offspring! And this thing is also something clear. For the thing that is given to divinity is part of a thing, and this thing can be seen from several commandments — the priestly tithe, the tithe, the challah-tithe, which are given to God, may He be blessed. For if he gave all, it is not priestly tithe or tithe or challah-tithe. And the reason is because he is obligated to separate [a portion] out from that which God, may He be blessed, has given to him. And that is what causes the obligation — that he should give to God, may He be blessed, just like God, may He be blessed, gave to him. But if he gives Him everything and does not leave anything over, it would then not be fitting to give. For from what would he give if he doesn't have anything? That is why those who worshipped Molekh would give from their offspring, from that which it gave to them, according to their error, since they would believe the idolatry. So they would give a little to the idolatry. But if one gives everything, one is exempt. As that is not considered giving from his offspring, since nothing would remain for him. And the honor of a divinity is that one gives a little of what [the divinity] gives to him. As he shows that [it] gave it to him, since some of it remains for him. But if nothing remains for him, it is as if it did not give him anything, so it is not called giving at all. And because of this, one who makes all of his threshing floor priestly tithe or all of his dough, challah-tithe — it is neither challah-tithe nor priestly tithe. But that which a person gives to God, may He be blessed, is from that which He gave to him.

In Chapter [Four], "Ha-Zahav", (Bava Metzia 59b), in the dispute of Rabbi Eliezer and the sages, Rabbi Eliezer said to them: If the law is like me, [then] from the heavens it shall be proved. A heavenly voice went out and said to them: What [do you all have to argue] with Rabbi Eliezer, for the law is like him in every place. Rabbi Yehoshua stood up on his feet and said, (Deuteronomy 30:12) It is not in the heavens. Rabbi Yirmiyah said, We do not regard a heavenly voice, for it has already been written in the Torah (Exodus 23:2): After the majority, [you shall] incline. Rabbi Natan found Elijah [the prophet] and said to him: What was the Holy One, blessed be He, doing at that time? He said to him: He was laughing and saying: My children have defeated Me, My children have defeated Me. And behold, they are amazed [by this matter] in two ways: First, that it is said: We do not regard a heavenly voice. Second, that it is said: My children have defeated Me, for this thing [seems impossible, because] it is not possible for a lesser one to defeat his master in a matter of law.
