And behold that which the rabbi wrote, that the commandment of Pharaoh was to kill them before they went out to the atmosphere [were born], are words that behoove him. However the reason for the matter appears to me [as follows]: It is since a Jew is not forbidden about [the killing of] fetuses and is only liable from when it comes out to the atmosphere, and we know that it has finished its months [of normal gestation]. So behold, Pharaoh was afraid [that] they maybe would not listen to him about murder. Hence he gave them the counsel to kill them before they go out into the atmosphere, so that it not be considered murder. Through this, [he thought] they would listen to him, and he gave them an indication about this. And [this was the case] even though Noachides are forbidden regarding [the killing of] fetuses, as we say in the chapter [entitled] Arba Mitot (Sanhedrin 57b): They said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, “[Noachides] are forbidden even regarding fetuses. […] As it is written: <i>One who sheds the blood of a person, by a person [baadam, literally in a person], etc.</i> (Genesis 9:6). What is a person that is in a person? You must say this is a fetus that is in its mother’s womb.” And likewise did Rambam decide (MT, Laws of Kings 9:4). Nevertheless, it is well-known that the elders of the world disagreed if the Jewish people, before the giving of the Torah, had completely left the category of Noachides. As Ramban holds that they left the category of Noachides from the days of Abraham, and as they said in the Gemara (Kiddushin 18a) concerning Esau, “Maybe it is different with an apostate Jew?” And that is also the opinion of Rash Yaffe. However the rabbis of France and Reem held that they did not leave the category of Noachides until the giving of the Torah. And that which they kept all of the Torah was only [when it was] to be stringent and not to be lenient [as it would be in this case], as all of this has been explained at length earlier in Derekh HaAtarim (Sermon 1), see there. So behold, Pharaoh held that they left the category of Noachides before the giving of the Torah, and they had the legal status of an actual Jew, even to be lenient. And it is because of this that he commanded to kill the children before they go out into the atmosphere. For the midwives would not be forbidden [by the Torah] about this.
