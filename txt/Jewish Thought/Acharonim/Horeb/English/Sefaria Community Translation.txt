In everything, God always requires you, as a Jewish father, to instill in your children whom God has graced you with, while they are still with their father, that which God asks from you and your offspring. While they are still young, bring them close to God and encourage the desire in their hearts to be connected, embraced, and clinging to the Jewish people's life and fate. But on the evening of that day when you, yourself, celebrate the birthday of the Jewish people, God's creation of this amazing nation amid mankind, the beginning of your mission as a Jew — God dedicated this evening to sanctifying your offspring, to bringing your children into the covenant with you, your young children upon whose closeness to God or, God forbid, their profaning His name, the eternity of the Jewish people and the future of our nation depend upon. Through these children, you may nurture the planting of renown (alluding to Ezekiel 34:29), which God planted for eternity through the exodus from Egypt. So that they may grow and become worthy of being the fruit of holiness for jubilation — when you pass around the pieces of the bread of affliction [the matzah] to yourself and to them, while you are connecting to the mission of your people and the dedication of the Jewish people to the God of their fathers and His Torah — do not minimize the words that come out of the purity of your heart. Speak to them, to your children, and let them hear about the supernal nature of this sublime mission, to be a father to Jewish children and to be children of the living God. Teach them the concept of the bread of affliction; acquaint them with the spirit of the Passover holiday, which ascends upon high. Make them understand the supernal nature of God's deeds and wonders in Egypt and of the name of Israel, which He bequeathed to His people when He took them out from darkness to light and from slavery to freedom.

Circumcision (Milah)
When Avraham was 99 years old, Hashem appeared to him and said: "I am the Almighty God; walk before Me and be complete! I establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly." Then Avraham fell on his face, and God spoke to him, saying: "Behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall become the father of a multitude of nations. No longer shall your name be called Avram; rather, your name shall be Avraham, for I have made you the father of many nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will establish you as nations, and kings will descend from you. I will uphold My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. I give to you and your descendants after you the land of your sojournings, the entire land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God." God then said to Avraham: "But you must also observe My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. This is My covenant, which you shall observe between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and this shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you. At eight days old, every male among you shall be circumcised throughout your generations, whether born in your house or purchased with silver from a foreigner who is not of your descendants. Those born in your household and those bought with your silver must be circumcised, so that My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant. Any uncircumcised male who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant." (Genesis 17:1-14)
Hashem also commanded Mosheh: "Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a woman gives birth to a male child, on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised." (Leviticus 12:2-3)
"Walk before Me and be complete!"
Let your entire life be lived before My all-encompassing presence. In every moment of your existence, direct your gaze toward Me and dedicate every part of your life to My service! And thus, be whole! Do not divide your being—thinking that your spirit belongs to Heaven while your body belongs to the earth, that you serve God with your soul while indulging the desires of the flesh. Be whole! See even your body as an instrument of divine service, and recognize that every power, even those of the body, has been entrusted to you for a sacred purpose. Dedicate your body to Me just as you dedicate your soul, and thus be whole and unified—your entire being moved by a single thought, consecrated to the One and Only God. Thus, God spoke to Avraham when He commanded him to place His seal on the most physical part of his body, thereby sanctifying and consecrating the body for divine purpose.

Chapter 263

You must keep the forces of your body sacred. Do not squander them in base sensual indulgence. Do not use them against the will of your God, but rather for the purpose for which He has given them to you. Be a complete human, a complete servant of God! Even in the most physical of acts, see only a sacred duty meant for the holy purpose of building the world. Keep your physical strength sacred for this divine purpose and restrain the demands of the flesh within these sacred bounds. Know that God will hold you accountable for every ounce of energy you waste outside His service or use against His will.
Let the seal of Avraham remind you of this! Let it restrain your actions when desire tempts you to stray.

Chapter 264

Be wise and understand! Do not deceive yourself by thinking: "There is nothing in the world as much under my control as my own body. Whom would I harm if I use my body according to my desires?" But know that in doing so, you sin against God, your Creator, who owns both you and your body, with all its desires and inclinations. He is your Father, the One who placed upon your flesh the holy covenantal seal. This is a sign that you must rule over your body and its desires, sanctifying them for God's purpose.

Chapter 265

The eternal survival of your people is also founded upon the preservation of the holiness and purity of the covenantal seal. It was designed in such a way that, among Israel, base physical desire cannot dominate entirely, leading to the corruption of the entire generation and its annihilation from among the nations—as happened to other peoples, whose indulgence in bodily lusts weakened them and drained the strength of their vitality, causing their destruction. But in Israel, even among sinful ancestors, pure children are born, ready to grow like strong seedlings. This ensures that from generation to generation, the Garden of God will flourish anew, and the spirit and glory of God will walk among it. When the spirit of a past generation has fallen due to its corruption, a new generation will arise in Israel, untouched by its predecessor’s impurity.
But the desecration of the covenantal seal leads to human degradation, reducing one to the level of an animal, causing moral corruption, and bringing impurity into future generations. It defiles the dignity of family life, bringing upon them terrible and lasting afflictions that become an inheritance of disease from weakened ancestors to their descendants. Only a body that is strong and steadfast in holiness and purity can house a strong and sacred spirit.

Chapter 266

Thus says the Lord:
"I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you, for their generations, as an everlasting covenant—to be God to you and your descendants after you… And you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you, for their generations. This is My covenant that you shall keep between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised… And an uncircumcised male who does not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”
One who rejects this covenant severs his connection to God and uproots the very foundations of his existence.

Chapter 267

Thus, God spoke to Avraham, and thus He speaks to every descendant of Avraham. And you, young men reading these words, do not carry the seal of Avraham in vain! Do not let yourselves be swept away by the degeneracy of the times! If you are truly the children of Avraham, you must uphold a high standard.
Let this seal protect you from moral corruption! Let it strengthen you in times of struggle—it will surely help you achieve victory.
When youth everywhere withers like a decayed flower, when society rushes toward spiritual decline, let your pride be in remaining strong, in standing firm in the holy calling that you bear as a son of Israel.
"Walk before Me always and be pure, unblemished, and whole!"
This is what God calls upon you to do through the seal of the covenant at every moment when temptation arises. Will you mock this call? Will you throw away the honor of Israel for the sake of fleeting animal pleasure?

Chapter 268

It is the duty of the father not only to physically nurture his child but also to raise him in mind and heart as a true human being and a Jew. Therefore, the father bears the responsibility to bring his son into the covenant of Avraham on the eighth day. If he neglects this duty, the communal authorities must ensure it is carried out. If they too fail, then every male descendant of Avraham, upon reaching religious maturity, is obligated to undergo circumcision himself. If he refuses, the Torah states: "That person shall be cut off from his people."
Since circumcision is not merely a physical alteration but a spiritual elevation—raising the human being from animalistic indulgence to moral responsibility—it must be performed in the daytime, the time of action and purpose.
A healthy child must be circumcised on the eighth day. If the child is sick or physically weak, circumcision is postponed until full recovery. If the illness affected the entire body, the procedure must be delayed for seven full days after recovery. If the condition affected only one limb, it is performed as soon as the child has regained strength. Since circumcision is an irreversible act, it is delayed in cases of doubt to protect the child's life.
If two previous brothers died due to circumcision, a third son is circumcised only after he has grown stronger.
If there is uncertainty about the exact birth time—whether it occurred before or after nightfall—the eighth day is counted from the following day. If the eighth day falls on Shabbat or a festival, circumcision is postponed to the ninth day unless it is known with certainty that the child was born during the day.
All additional laws regarding circumcision can be found in sections 260-266.

Behold, if you have given your word and promise to give over ownership and money has been given in accordance with the decree, however, the sale has not been finalized by one of the methods of acquisition — we may not say that the matter was completed and they are allowed to go back on it. Nevertheless, if either the buyer or the seller goes back on it after money was received or after the buyer placed a sign on the merchandise, the curse of, "He who exacted payment," is given to him in court. That is, "He Who exacted payment from the people of the generation of the flood, and from the people of the generation of the dispersion, and from the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, and from the Egyptians at the Sea, He will exact payment from whoever does not stand by his word" (Bava Metzia 48a). And even one who only does business orally is obligated by his word, even though he has not performed an action. Yet even though a buyer or seller who only goes back on his word does not receive the curse of "He who exacted payment," he is called one lacking in faith. Anyone who promises something to his fellow in a way that his fellow should be able to rely upon it and goes back on it is considered someone lacking in faith (Choshen Mishpat 204).

Indeed it is so — do not destroy [<i>bal taschit</i>]! That is God's first great general call to you, man. That is when you see yourself as the ruler and governor over the face of His earth.  Behold, you see dirt, plants, and animals around you; and they already carry the seal of your human projects, to study and appraise them, through human effort and ingenuity, to serve your human purposes, to have them become your shelter, clothing, sustenance, and tools. So you have acquired them, that they should be in your possession, such that you stand amid your rulership over the face of the earth and all that exists are your servants to do your will and bidding. Yet you suddenly raise your hand to amuse yourself or to pour out your anger and swallow up and destroy something that can [otherwise] be used for your purposes. But you want to pound and break and obliterate that thing that you can make helpful and use properly. You surely desire this since, when you see creations below your level as things disconnected from justice and righteousness, you do not fear the Lord. Yet He is indeed their Shield and Protector, taking up their case with justice. So instead of thinking about them as means for the thoughtful acts of man, you see them haughtily, to have your power and the might of your will rule over them and to pour out your furious rage over them. Then the voice of God's great call thunders over you, "Do not destroy! Get away from it; act like a human being!" For it is truly only by using that which exists around you for the thoughtful and reasonable use of man as My Torah guides and designates that you are a man. Then you have power and possession over them. For I have given you, man,  power and possession over them by way of a divine mandate. However, if you destroy, if you ruin, if you obliterate, you are no longer man, but rather a wild animal or a predatory beast, so that you no longer have possession over what exists around you. For I have lent them to you only for wise human use. So don't ever forget that I am the One who lent them to you! However, if you act perversely, if you act without intelligence and good sense towards anything, small or big, behold you are acting wickedly, rebelling and stealing from God's earth! Behold, you then turn into a murderer and robber of God's possessions. You are a sinner, and you have violated the holiness of the possession. Then God will make this call to you and protect everything, small or big, with this call. With the utterance of this word, He will grant righteous justice to the small or big against the plots of your heart and the violence of your hand!

It is not for the sake of the prevention of bodily sickness that God arranged these laws about your food. Rather the Torah itself explains their reason: Just like the Temple of God, which symbolizes the ideal of the holy and sanctifies you for His sake, becomes defiled by impurity - that is, anything that is foreign to, or below the human realm (see the section on Service, Chapter 21) - so too are the forbidden foods "impure" for the holy sanctuary that you yourself constitute. Your body, your soul and your spirit form the essential playing field of your existence, which is designated for holiness. If you eat these foods, your body may well be nourished and become fatter. However, your animal impulse will be greatly aroused; or your body will only become a tool for your spirit. Instead of your soul becoming sanctified - meaning raising itself above any trace of animalism - it will descend to this low level, or become apathetic and lethargic. And your spirit can expect to encounter a greater struggle for which it is less equipped. It calls out to you again and again: It is impure to you! Do not defile yourselves with them! You will become impure from them! The meaning of becoming impure is to compromise preparedness for the designation of holiness. And behold you have been designated to be holy people, the children of a great holy congregation; and you have been chosen to attach yourselves to God and to walk in His ways. God said to you to be holy, "since I, your God, am holy." So then, you must guard your bodies like the holy sanctuary for your divine souls. As behold, the body is also for God. And that which is generally referred to as impure (<i>tumah</i>) is also referred to as something repulsive (<i>sheketz</i>), a disgusting thing. Something repulsive and disgusting is something that you reject on your own as a foreign body that is unfit for your constitution. And so just like your body naturally rejects anything that the sense of taste finds to be a foreign substance or unfit; so too must you reject these foods because they are repulsive, foreign and unfit for your spiritual constitution. Lest your spiritual constitution itself become repulsive, and you become distanced and turn away from your holy designation which you are meant to carry as a Jew. Likewise, abomination (<i>toevah</i>) - your spiritual constitution should abominate these foods, since they are antithetical to your spiritual designation and only nourish your animal impulse. These are the words of God's Torah.

The main things about a mikveh (ritual bath) are: That the water should not be gathered by a person's possession, meaning a vessel; and also not arrive through any object that is susceptible to becoming impure. And [the water] must be gathered in one place. It can be flowing water or rain water that has not flown through or over anything that is susceptible to becoming impure. When rain water, it must be standing and not running. And the mikveh needs to have the necessary amount of water, and the like. Regarding the immersion, there may not be anything that separates between the thing that is being immersed and the water; and it must be completely placed within the water of the mikveh and fully immersed. (See Yoreh Deah 120, 201, 202.)

Be fruitful and multiply! From now on, plant the planting of your species in the world. From now on, grow the thread of life at every instance and every time. Raise your offspring for all time so that they will continue to build and establish what you have left still unfinished and not yet sturdy. Plant your vine in the garden of the Lord, your species on the earth, so that it will grow to be a faithful planting in the vineyard of the House of Israel. And do everything in your power for your offspring, to raise them and educate them for God. And all the good things that you have acquired, fear of God, love of God, trust in God, living with faith in God — bequeath all these things to the next generation. With such an inheritance, you will continue through your offspring and their actions; and you, too, will live on and be remembered eternally.

Let your house not be closed and sealed only for yourself and your household, to be a place of rest and peace only for yourselves. Rather let it be open for the benefit of the desolate poor people, for the hungry, the thirsty and for all who seek shelter and refuge for themselves. You should happily and lovingly bring in any guest who has no other letter of introduction that would recommend him except for that which comes from his being a creation of the Omnipotent, a son of our Father in Heaven. Hence receive him joyfully, bring him into your house, supply his needs and even accompany him [when he leaves] so that he will be secure on his journey.

On these days that are memorial days of joy, they should not say such things that mention something sad relating to the fleetingness of life or sad thoughts about distressing matters - like <i>veHu rachum</i> (and He is merciful), <i>rachum vechanun</i> (merciful and compassionate), <i>El erekh apayim</i> (God full of patience) and <i>yaankha</i> (He should answer you). Likewise [is this the case] on other days primarily marked by joy besides Channukah and Purim: The fifteenth of Av; the fifteenth of Shevat; Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month); Purim Katan; the thirty-third day of the omer; the eves of Yom Kippur and Rosh HaShanah; all of the month of Nissan; the days between Yom Kippur and Sukkot; from Rosh Chodesh Sivan until the day after Shavuot. Also [is this true] on private days of joy that have a national character, like a house of nuptials and a <i>milah</i> (circumcision). (They say <i>yaankha</i> at a <i>milah</i> with regard to the child for his healing.) Also [do we omit these] at the house of a mourner and on Tisha B'Av, for other reasons.

2) Festivals
First we acknowledge that the creation of both the body and the spirit of the Jewish people was from God ("You have chosen us... And you have brought us close"); and that the maintenance of the body and the spirit of the nation is also an act of God ("and Your great name"). We then make note of the special import of this holiday ("and gave"). Then we speak about the special character of the day - whether it is about the creation of the Jewish people or its maintenance, the request from God concerning the creation or maintenance of the Jewish people is in, "May it come and may  it ascend," and in, "And raise up for us." This is like, "God and God of our Forefathers, accept," on Shabbat. This is to bring down the blessing of the holiday: Life, peace and joy - may they come to fruition in our lives. And after the standing prayer (<i>amidah</i>), we recite the Hallel. On the first days of Pesach and on all the days of Sukkot, it is 'full Hallel,' like Chanukkah. But on the later days of Pesach, it is like Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month): We skip [some sections] and recite 'half Hallel.' (The reason is explained nicely: It is because the latter days of Pesach do not only remind us of the salvation of the Jewish people, but rather also of the downfall of the Egyptians and their drowning in the sea. So it is like the Sages, may their memory be blessed, say [Yalkut Shimoni on Nakh 1085], that it is not good to say and prolong verse and praise about the destruction of the creations of God. That is why Hallel is not full [on those days].

Tisha B'Av at night: The scroll of Lamentations. It is the emotions of the prophet Jeremiah's soul and his dirge that he took up about the destruction of the holy city of Jerusalem and the Temple. And it is especially about the sin that Jerusalem and his people sinned, which is what caused that awful destruction to happen. And while glancing with eyes full of tears, he instructs and shows the path that leads to repentance and towards the revival of Israel, to renew our days as of old (alluding to Lamentations 5:21).


Sukkot: They recite Ecclesiastes in the morning service of Shabbat of the intermediate days of the festival (Chol HaMoed) of Sukkot. As it shows that the maintenance of the body and the spirit of the nation is through God. This is in order to know that, without God, all human competition, all human actions and calculations, as well as the results of the toil of his efforts and his mighty hand - they are altogether empty.
