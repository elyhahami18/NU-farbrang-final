Chapter 1













<b>B) The Sabbatical Year of the Statutes: Compassion and Solidarity</b>
What is the nature of the commandment of the sabbatical year? One should note that this is not a simple commandment at all. It is a commandment that confounds the whole way of life and brings into question man’s ability to sustain himself. It is a commandment that throughout history, from all that is apparent, was not carefully observed. In the Bible, we hear that the exile at the time of the First Temple was a punishment for not observing the sabbatical year. <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See II Chronicles 36:20-21; Jeremiah 17:4.</i> And in the Midrash of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, its great difficulty is emphasized.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See for example, Vayikra Rabbah 1:1: “Mighty in strength, who perform His bidding” (Psalms 103:20) – regarding whom is the verse speaking? Rabbi Yitzchak said, “The verse is speaking of those who observe the Sabbatical Year. The way of the world is that a person performs a commandment for one day, for one week, for one month. But does one do so for the rest of the days of the year? Yet this one sees his field fallow, his vineyard fallow, pays his land tax and remains silent. Is there anyone mightier than that?”</i> The Midrash in Eikhah Rabbah also shows how strange this idea was in the eyes of the [other] nations, who would mock it in theatrical parodies.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Abbahu began: “Those who sit at the gate talk about me” (Psalms 69:13) – these are the nations of the world, who sit in theaters and circuses. “I am the subject of songs by ale drinkers” (Psalms 69:13) – after they sit, eat, drink, and become intoxicated, they sit, speak about me, mock me… They would bring the camel into their theaters with its garments on it. They would say to each other, “Why is this one mourning?” They would say, “These Jews observe the sabbatical Year, and they do not have any vegetation, and they eat its thorns; and it is mourning over them.” (Eikhah Rabbah, Petichta 17) It is possible that the dig in the appearance of the camel is that part of the point of the sabbatical year is equality with animals. See also Y. Heinemann, “Judaism in the Eyes of the Anceint World,” <i>Jews and Judaism in the Eyes of the Hellenistic World </i> (Jerusalem, 1974), p. 18.</i> If so, why does the Torah nevertheless command the sabbatical year? It appears that the different sections [of the Torah discussing] the sabbatical year present different answers to this question.
You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the spirit of the stranger, having yourselves been strangers in the land of Egypt. Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its yield; but in the seventh you shall let it rest and lie fallow. Let the needy among your people eat of it, and what they leave let the wild beasts eat. You shall do the same with your vineyards and your olive groves. Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor, in order that your ox and your donkey may rest, and that your home-born slave and the stranger may be refreshed. (Exodus 23:9-12)
In the section about the statutes (<i>mishpatim</i>), the laws of the sabbatical year appear alongside laws that deal with social justice. The rationale that ties together the first verse cited here dealing with the concern for the stranger, the verses of the sabbatical year and the commandment of Shabbat coming after them, is a societal one, [meaning] sensitivity and concern for the weak. A person commanded to know the spirit of the stranger is also called to render his produce ownerless for the poor and the animals of the field. Accordingly, the rest of Shabbat is explained here by the right of slaves and animals to have a day of rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">1r</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned, the liberation of slaves on the seventh year also expresses a similar approach.</i>
In the background of this description stands the exodus from Egypt: That is the shared experience of suffering that stands as the basis for the socialization of the people and the experience that established a true basis for knowledge about the ‘soul of the stranger’ and the feeling of brotherhood with those who are suffering. As a basis for the laws mentioned here, there is a feeling of empathy that emerges from awareness of the other, a feeling that has the possibility of overcoming class differences that separate people. When we see the juxtaposition of <i>the soul of the stranger</i> and <i>that your home-born slave and the stranger may be refreshed</i>, it is impossible not to be reminded of the verse, <i>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and was refreshed</i> (Exodus 31:17). There, the rest of man on Shabbat is a reflection of the Godly rest at the end of creation. Here, this conception is transformed into a historical outlook that emphasizes the common suffering of the past. The rationale, whether for the Shabbat or for the sabbatical year, is not a return to the act of creation, but rather empathy for the indigent and even for animals of the field. 




































"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, ad to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so." (Genesis 1:28-30)
