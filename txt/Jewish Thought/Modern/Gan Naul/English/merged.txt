The commandment of telling over the exodus from Egypt every year on Passover night: It said (Exodus 13:8), "And you are to tell your child on that day." And the intent is not only to inform our children who did not know and did not hear of this great act of the Lord. Rather even the sages, the discerning ones and those who know the whole entire Torah must tell over the exodus from Egypt on that night. It is like our ancestors, may their memory be blessed, said,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"> Passover Haggadah</i> "And even if we were all sages, all discerning, all knowledgeable about the Torah, it would [still] be a commandment upon us to tell the story of the exodus from Egypt. And anyone who adds [and spends extra time] in telling the story of the exodus from Egypt, behold he is praiseworthy." And it brings a proof, the story of five great sages, Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Akiva and their colleagues, who were telling the story of the exodus from Egypt that whole night. And don't say that they were telling it to the students who did not know, but they<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These sages</i> rather sat by themselves. For when the dawn arose, the students came to them to inform them that the time of [reciting] the morning Shema had arrived. And it is like they said, "until their students came, etc." That is because this story is not the same for every person. Rather each one should recount the greatness of God and the ways of His wisdom that were revealed through the wonders that He did in Egypt, according to the power of his mind and his understanding; and according to the extent of his understanding and his knowledge of the ways of God, the images written in the Torah about the stories of the exodus from Egypt, the tradition of the fathers about these matters and the hidden wonders about them. And from this, you can understand the difference in the performance of this commandment between different people. And these differences branch out from the differences that we explained in (Chapter) 8 about the first commandments.

"to avert the evil of Haman the Agagite and his thought against the Jews" (Esther 8:3): You should know that Haman concluded to destroy the descendants of the Jews. And he acted on his conclusions, since he wrote books to all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to destroy the Jews. And were it not that God was with us, to repeal his counsel, he would have done according to his desire, God forbid. And nevertheless, his plan is never described with the expression, counsel (<i>etzah</i>), and you will not find it in the Scroll of Esther or in another source with the description, counsel. And the reason is clear from our words, since he did not conclude it from the intellect, and he did not evaluate it in his heart, among various contrasting thoughts which grow out of opposed models. For this evildoer sought to destroy a great nation without any blame, but just from his evil thought. For all 'the impulse of his thought is only evil'<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion based on Genesis 6:5.</i> ; the thought designed by his pride, as written explicitly in the words of Esther (Esther 8:5), "let dispatches be written countermanding the dispatches of the <b>thought</b> of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who wrote to destroy the Jews throughout the king’s provinces": The thought of his impulse to harsh anger; the thought of his impulse to great hatred towards the people of God, since he was an Aggagite enemy of the Jews; the thought of his impulse to evil; and so forth many times over. And the thoughts of these designs came to one conclusion towards evil. And Scripture testifies to this when saying (Esther 3:5), "and Esther was full of anger." That is to say that Haman's spirit was full of violence and anger, nothing could pass in front of him. A thought of the model of fear of God and His trepidation did not raise itself in his heart; a thought of the model of mercy did not raise itself; and likewise from the good models - since he was totally wicked. It is as is it stated (Esther 3:6), "and Haman sought to destroy all the Jews." That is to say his spirit desired to do evil, not from intellect and not from knowledge.
