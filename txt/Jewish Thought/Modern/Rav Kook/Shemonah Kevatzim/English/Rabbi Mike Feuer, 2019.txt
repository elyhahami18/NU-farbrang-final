Paragraph 416

Miracles clarify Divine faith, which is above all boundaries, and through this holy faithfulness Divine wholeness is fixed in the soul (nefesh). When emunah entirely completes its task, bringing the soul (neshama) to light, then faith in miracles and the remembrance of them will no longer be necessary to selfhood. But the wholeness of emunah, in its lofty holiness, only comes through establishing an active, faithful, connection to miracles. The Exodus from Egypt, and the miracles bound up with it, is their foundation which will continue to last until the days of the messiah. Then the Exodus will no longer be the essential foundation, but rather a secondary element or even something which has already served its whole purpose. “…They shall no longer say, "As the Lord lives, Who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt," But, "As the Lord lives, Who brought up and Who brought the seed of the house of Israel from the northland and from all the lands where I have driven them, and they shall dwell on their land." (Jeremiah 23:7-8) The messianic light will restore the supernal brilliance of humanity to its might, and it will be higher than any Divine revelation which has been until now, and even the Torah of this world will be as insubstantial vapor in comparison to the Torah of messiah. The supernal brilliance of primordial man draws the dew of its sacred and joyous life from the present, it does not require the past. It draws from the depths of consciousness and life, not from memory.

The more one gazes upon their spiritual stature, so they will find that there is no cause for limiting their conceptions. On the contrary, let one’s power of conception conceive all that is within its ability, and even if it occasionally conceives of something great and mighty, it still will not have achieved more than a drop of the lofty greatness of which it is capable. How great the joy which comes from such a free gaze, when it is accompanied by the play of positive imagination. It has not yet achieved one portion in the limitless tens of thousands of the true Eden that dwells within all existence, all of which is a revelation of the transcendent playfulness, and Eden is the rock of all the ages to come

Every time the heart beats with a true spiritual pulse, every time a new, noble idea is born, we are listening. It is like the voice of the angel of G–d knocking, tapping at the dors of our soul, asking us to open up in order that it can appear to us in the fullness of its glory. And the more free our spirit and pure our soul when we meet it, with emotion admirable and mighty, with the most serious and deep desire for the highest, most elevated and honorable love, so multitudes of noble souls manifest, illuminating our darkness with their glow. Our give and take with the objective, spiritual world is progressively sanctified, and our connections to it strengthened. Habit works upon us, settling our minds through calm and clarity of consciousness, and the capacity for manifestation, that fragment from the majestic grandeur of prophecy, begins to move us – bringing us healing upon its wings. We will be secure from all delusion, from any evil or lie with which the imagination could insult us, if we hold fast to the tree of life of the Torah of our fathers, to its pleasant guidance, to its order and commands over all the paths of life, in our relationship to humanity, to family and nation, to life and all its matters. And with this we have no need at all to be bound by communal ties which choke the transcendent free spirit; they desecrate the holy, that which comes from the highest world, from the world of freedom where free rein is given to thought, absolute liberty to aspiration complete freedom to the inclinations of the will, to creation. And as freedom expands, holiness increases and life becomes more elevated. “And will I rejoice in the LORD, exult in the God who delivers me.” (Habakuk 3:18) Let everyone bring into being that which their soul shows them, in truth and simplicity, bringing to fruition their spiritual potential without deception. And from sparks such as these great torches of light will be formed, lighting up the whole world with their glory. It from pieces of inner truth such as these, that the great truth will appear.

Paragraph 233

Man’s will is bound up with the Divine Will, and flows from the radiance of its light. Only so long as one does not reveal this connection in himself, the Divine treasure within his will is not revealed. But in so far as man sets his heart to know that we have no will other than a revelation from the light of the Divine will - according to the extent this is revealed, the precious ability of his will to affect, bring to be, innovate and decree is revealed. And according to that measure comes prayer and shows its wonders, and even common expression comes and works wonders as well, sometimes without intention like the blessings and curses of a Sage which are given on condition, even though the condition is not fulfilled, or the unintentional act of a leader, for better or worse; and even in the revelation of some simple motion like the slipping off of one shoe causing rain to come. (Berachot 20a) “Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.” (Isaiah 65:24) 
We must explain the foundation of prayer. The prayer in its standard form, request, is a technical ideal, in the highest sacred sense. The individual will is not an isolated thing, it is an offshoot of the all-encompassing will, of the outpouring of will which rises above at the head of all. It pours out from the will of the One who generates all things, the Creator of all the worlds, the One who renews creation each day, always. The branched off will is weak, its ability is naught, because in its self-conception it is separate from the all-encompassing desire; to the extent the individual will cleaves strongly to the sacred all-encompassing will, it rises up and its ability intensifies. In the moment of prayer, when one turns to G–d from the depths of their will, the essential power of their particular will rises. And according to the measure of this qualitative cleaving, this individual will, freed from its particularity, goes running in leaps and bounds, flying and overflowing in its return to the foundation of its life, to the source from which its existence was carved, to the depths of G–d’s will, the Master of all, and does His work, according to its (His?) will and conception.
