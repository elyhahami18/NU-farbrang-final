My heart is in the east,
and I in the uttermost west--
How shall I render my vows
and my bonds, while yet
Zion lieth beneath the fetter of Edom
and I in Arab chains?...
A light thing would it seem to me to leave
all the good things of Spain --
Seeing how precious in mine eyes to behold the dust of the desolate sanctuary
