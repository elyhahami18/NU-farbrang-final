"Abraham returned to his servants, they arose, and walked together to Be'er Sheva..." (Gen. 22:19)  Where did Isaac go? He went to Be'er Lachai Ro'i, as it says "Isaac had just come back from the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi, for he was settled in the region of the Negeb." (Gen.24:62)  Isaac went and fled fraught about his father, his mother, and his God.  How did it happen that he was bound, that they saw fit to do it, and why do it to him.  He went to the wilderness, to a place where no man passed or dwelled.  They said, "no man," but a woman did pass there, and it was Hagar - Be'er Lachai Ro'i (the well of life's shepherd) is Hagar's well.  Isaac stood at the well until he remembered Ishmael who had played with him when he was a baby.  He remembered Hagar who had walked away with a jug of water on her shoulder.  Isaac sat there with Hagar and Ishmael, cried with and shared anger with them for many days.  One day, he stood at the well opening and behold, the living God saw him, the living God heard his voice in the moment, and Isaac was comforted.  He arose, took Hagar, and brought her back to his father, as it says, "Abraham too another wife, and her name was Keturah." (Genesis 25:1) Keturah is Hagar whose cries rose like the smoke (ketoret) on the altar. He also arose and took Ishmael and returned him to his father, as it says, "His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him" (Gen. 25:9) "He shall reconcile parents with children and children with their parents" (Malachi 3:24). Afterwards, Isaac returned to that welland settled there, as it says "After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi."(Genesis 25:11)  This is why it is said about him that he re-dug old wells and brought out of them living water.

A man and his household, his partner, and his children, went down to Egypt. And only Dinah was isolated, without a husband and without children. And her brothers could not speak to her in peace [alluding to Genesis 37:4]. They did not speak with her in her youth. Hence, <i>And Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land</i> (Genesis 34:1). 
They did not speak with her after Shekhem took her and abused her. And they did not even ask what she wanted, as it is stated, <i>And Chamor and Shekhem his son they killed by the sword, then they took Dinah from Shekhem’s house and went off</i> (Genesis 34:26). And they did not speak to her after she conceived, as is it stated, <i>But they said, "Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot</i>" (Genesis 34:31); will they say in the whole land that there is a wanton woman in the tents of Jacob?!"

Exodus

<b>Wise-hearted Women</b><br> Ayalah Ronen Samuels
And the Lord took us out from Egypt by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm and awesome power, and by signs and portents. (Deuteronomy 26:8)
The Holy One, blessed be He, only took us out from Egypt in the merit of the wise-hearted women:<br>"By a mighty hand" - that is the daughter of Levi, who strengthened her hand to send her son into the water, as it is stated (Exodus 2:3), "so she got a wicker basket for him and caulked it with bitumen and pitch, and she put the child into it and placed it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile."<br>"By an outstretched arm" - as it is stated (Exodus 2:5), " She spied the basket among the reeds and sent out her arm to fetch it."<br>"And fearful power" - that is Shifrah and Puah, as it is stated (Exodus 1:17), "The midwives, fearing God, did not do as the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live."<br>"And by signs and portents" - that is Miriam, since all of the years that the Israelites wandered in the desert, a wonderous well that was given to them on her account rolled together with them until the day that she died and the well went away, as it is stated (Numbers 20:1-2), "and the people stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there. And the community was without water."
Hence it is stated (Exodus 35:26), "And all the women whose hearts inspired them with wisdom" - about those women whose hearts inspired them with wisdom and overcame the failing of strength and wherewithal, the fear of the monarchy and the limitations of man. And about such as these, it is stated (Song of Songs 3:5), "that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till it please." For with these actions, they stirred and awakened the lower ones and Supernal ones for redemption.
<small><b>Wise-hearted Women:</b> "And every wise-hearted woman with her hands" (Exodus 35:25). <b>And sent out her arm to fetch it:</b> According to one of the opinions, "her <i>amah</i>," is the daughter of Pharaoh's arm. See BT, Sotah 12b. <b>"And by signs and portents" - that is Miriam:</b> See Bamidbar Rabbah 1:2: What was written? "Miriam died there and was buried there." And what is written afterwards? "And the community was without water." And how was the well made? It was a boulder like a type of hive, and it would roll and go with them on the journeys. <b>That she died and the well went away:</b> Tosefta Sotah 11:1: The whole time that Miriam was alive, the well would suffice for the Israelites. From when she died, what does it say? "Miriam died there and was buried there. And the community was without water." For the well went away.  </small>

For whose benefit?
This is the matter that the Lord commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying: "They shall be wives to whomever they think best, according to their own preferences." (Numbers 36:6)
It is not stated as "in their eyes" but rather "in their own eyes," and why is that? Because the hands of the men established and wrote according to the perspective of the men. And despite all their wisdom and greatness, the matter was not of interest to them personally. However, the daughters of Zelophehad sought goodness, desired goodness, and did goodness as the Lord commanded. Therefore, it is fulfilled and written: "They shall be wives to whomever they think best" - "in their own eyes" specifically, because these women shall be considered good in the eyes of the people for generations.

Ruth Explained (Yael Unterman)
She left from the place that was there, and there were two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on their way to return to the land of Yehudah (Ruth 1:7). They lifted up their voices, and they cried, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, and Ruth clung to her (Ruth 1:14).  
They trod three milin (unit of measurement) until they reached the border of Moav. Naomi said: Go, return to the house of your mother (Ruth 1:8).
Orpah said: Mother-in-law, does not the Torah say, "Therefore a woman leaves her father and her mother and clings to her husband, and they become one flesh"? I don't have a husband, and I am thoroughly abandoned — how can I return? 
Naomi said: My daughter, I did not teach you thus, but rather it is written, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24) and the choice is in your hands.
Orpah kissed her mother-in-law (Ruth 1:14). She said, "It is the law, and I accept it." She returned to her mother's house. 
Ruth interpreted these things: "Ish" (the word for "man") includes "ishah" (the word for "woman"). Just as a man leaves his family and clings to his woman, so too does a woman leave her family and cling to her man. When "b'ishto" (to his woman) is said — it includes his father-in-law and his mother-in-law and the descendants of his family. Immediately (i.e. as soon as Ruth made this point, the narrator said) — "davkah bah" (she clung to her). 
Orpah, who did not know how to interpret [it], did not merit [Ruth's decision].
And Ruth, because she interpreted [correctly], she merited the crown of Torah and the covenant of the forefathers, and she became the mother of royalty.
Another interpretation: Ruth said to Naomi, "I don't have a father or a mother or a husband, except for you alone. And from now on, I am like a newborn baby." "Davkah bah" (she clung to her). The sages determined the halakhah (law) like this, that behold, a convert who converts is like a child who is just born, and every last body part that they had when they were an idolator, they don't have anymore.

Book of Esther

I


<i>The couriers went out posthaste on the royal mission, and the decree was proclaimed in the fortress of Shushan; the king and Haman sat down to feast, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</i> (Esther 3:15)
And who knew the secret of that confusion? That was Mordekhai, as it is stated (Esther 4:1), "And Mordekhai knew all that had been done, etc." And what is this word, "all," here? It teaches that it was not only the outer layer that Mordekhai knew, that which is revealed and known to the eyes of all who see, but also what was inside. For there is one who gets excited and comes to the world dressed in only one cloak; such that it is only the one who enters his rooms who can see the tunic below it.
And why was it specifically Mordekhai who knew? Because it is said about him (Esther 2:5-6), "There was a Judean man in the fortress of Shushan, whose name was Mordekhai, son of Yair, son of Shimii, son of Kish, a Binyaminite man. Who was exiled from Jerusalem with the captives exiled with Yechaniah, king of Judah, driven into exile by Nevukhadnezzar, king of Babylon." Do not read it as, "Nevukhadnezzar," but rather as, "<i>nevukhah denetzar</i> (the perplexity in store)." And some said, "The confusion (<i>mevukhah</i>) in store." Come and see that from that which Mordekhai was exiled by Nevukhadnezzar, he understood that confusion of the fortress of Shushan - that Nevukhadnezzar stored away the confusion that he earmarked for the Jewish people and guarded it until it would be fully ripe. Until the day would come when it would bring gladness, as old wine gladdens the heart of man. Since the more it ages, the better it becomes, such that the expert will wait.

And then there is a thanksgiving that brings the knowledge into someone's heart that the good is true, possible, and exists and that evil is unable to completely eliminate it. And when a difficult time comes to him, he stops and wonders how evil can dwell alongside the good in the world of the Holy One, blessed be He. So he wonders and wonders and does not bless the Holy One, blessed be He, nor His world, with his mouth. But even if he blesses the Holy One, blessed be He, and His world, he still wonders, and he stands up and does not say that the good is false. So good and evil, truth and falsehood, remain in that person's world until he accepts upon himself that, even if it would have been better for him not to be created than to be created, he will add to his life and examine his deeds. And perhaps one day he will know.

<b>One who did not find a woman</b> - Yael Unterman
An occurrence: one who reached his time and didn't find a wife. And that man was righteous and of good heart, honoured his father and mother, arose early and gave charity and confessed and did repentence, since he said "perhaps I sinned in my heart and cursed God in my heart, heaven forfend". And this he did every day.
He found a help who didn't match him, and one who matched him who was not a help to him, but a good match he didn't find for himself. And his face fell exceedingly. And it came to pass that he still had not found, and his life was ending. And he made two Shabbatot alone and did not taste a thing, until Eliyahu (his memory for the good) was revealed to him.
He said to him: my son, why do you weep? He said to him: since I'm considered as dead, as it says "The one who dwells without a wife dwells without life". He said to him: If you desire to marry, "go forth from your land and from your birthplace and the house of your father" (Bereishit 12:1) and go up to Jerusalem.
He went up, and it availed him nothing. He prayed for forty days and forty nights, and it availed him nothing. He examined his deeds and it availed him nothing. His spirits fell.
He went to inquire of God (cf Bereishit 25:22). He shouted a great and bitter shout (Esther 4:1) and said: Master of the Universe, it is written "Thus a man should leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife and they should be one flesh" (Bereishit 2:24). I have fulfilled the first part - what of the second part?! The Holy Blessed One answered: "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up thy loins like a man..." (Iyov 38:2-3).
He screamed and said before him: Master of the Universe, you commanded me with the commandments to be fruitful and multiply, and circumcision, and the education of children, and the sexual entitlement of a wife, and how can I fulfil all of these without a wife? The Holy Blessed One answered: Will you make void My judgment? Will you condemn Me so that you can be justified? (Iyov 40:8)
He fell on his face and said: My King and my God, not this! I am your slave, the son of your slavegirl (Tehillim 116:16) - please, open my fetters! The Holy Blessed One said: It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has taken it upon him. (Eicha 3:27-28).
The man said: "I will not die, but I will live, and tell the deeds of God; God has surely punished me, and not given me over to death" (Tehillim 118:17-18)." And he accepted the judgment on himself. He was silent, and said nothing more for good or ill.
Eliyahu, may he be remembered for good, came and said: Master of the Universe, the whole world is married, from the chopper of wood to the king in the palace, and you have a man like this and withhold from him a woman and offspring? Is there no Judge and no Justice?! He said to him: Silence, for thus it arose in thought before Me. Eliyahu was silent. The Holy Blessed One was silent. The Shechina walked and wept: "'My son, my son' - would  that I could suffer in your place, my son".
<b>And blessed God in my heart</b> A euphemism to say "And blasphemed in my heart", see Iyov 1:5 "and perhaps my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts". <b>Two Shabbatot</b> see Shabbat 118b "Rabbi Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, if only Yisrael would keep two Shabbatot according to their halacha -- immediately they would be redeemed.". <b>The one who dwells without a wife, dwells without life</b> - Kohelet Rabbah 9:9. <b>Is there no Justice and no Judge?!</b> - Vayikra Rabbah 28. <b>Silence, for thus it arose in thought before Me</b> - Menachot 29b. <b>My son, my son</b> II Samuel 19:1 - "My son Avshalom, my son my son Avshalom, would that I could die in your place, Avshalom my son my son".

Fertility and Parenthood

<b>And the spirit of the woman is not filled: And this is the secret of, "And when the daughter of a priest will be for a foreign man" (Leviticus 22:12). That is the holy soul, the daughter of the priest, who falls in the portion of a foreign man, this world. And sometimes even when it is connected to the body, the body remains a foreign man for it. And it is like that empty one that goes around and yells for her lost object, goes wandering over the earth, but she does not find rest for the sole of her foot, as it is stated (Genesis 8:9), "The dove found no place to rest its foot, so it returned to him into the ark, for the water was upon the surface of the whole earth." And the dove (<i>yonah</i>) is the spirit, it is the holy soul. It is Yonah the prophet who went down, fell and wandered to the lowest depths, as it is stated (Jonah 1:3), "He went down to Yaffo and found a ship [...] and went aboard to sail with the others to Tarshish, away from being before the Lord." And it is stated (Jonah 1:5), "and Jonah had gone down into the hold of the vessel where he lay down and fell asleep." And the soul falls asleep before the Lord, for there and only there can it find itself rest.</b>

<b>Midrashei mamzeirut</b> - Rivka Leibovitz
"A mamzer shall not come into the community of God. Even to the tenth generation, he shall not come into the community  of God." Devarim 23:3
<b>Mamzer and those who weep with him</b>. Five flow with tears about the mamzer, and their tears reach the Throne of Glory. And these are they: A mamzer who everyone knows is a mamzer; a mamzer who only he knows that he is a mamzer; a mother who knows that her child is a mamzer; a father who knows that his child is a mamzer, and cannot tell him because the child does not know that he himself is a mamzer; and a woman who aborted her foetus because of its mamzership. And some say: also the embryo which was in the future to be born and its mother aborted it, cries every day and says: Mother, mother -- why did you not birth me?! Tanot asked: what does the Holy Blessed One do at the hour a mamzer comes to the world, and at the hour that the community of God publicises that mamzer? And she responded: At that time, the Holy Blessed One weeps greatly and says: 'I never intended this, I never intended this'.
<i>Midrashim of mamzeirut</i> appeared in the catalogue accompanying the exhibition <b>Mamzeirim</b> (Jerusalem, Sukkot 5778). See Nurit Jakobs Yinon and Emily D. Bielsky (editors) <b>Mamzeirim: Signifying and Erasing</b>, Jerusalem 2017.
<b>Tanot - see Rivka Lubitz, "Midrashei Bat Yiftach", in Nechama Weingarten-Mintz and Tamar Biala (editors) <b>Dirshuni: Midrashei Nashim I</b> , Tel Aviv 2009, p100. Tanot is a fictional image, the soul of Yiftach's daughter, who is exponded from the verse "the daughters of Israel went every year to lament ["letanot", to Tanot] the daughter of Yiftach the Gileadite" (Shoftim 11:40). Her character serves as an intermediary between Jewish women and the Shechina: 'And what does she do? She sits in the heights, and hears the stories of Jewish women in the land, and after this she sits with the Shechina and tells ("metanah") in Her ears their troubles, and prays for them and learns merit about them'. "I never intended this" - see Taanit 4a, "Which I did not command and I did not say and I did not intend" (Yirmiyahu 19:5) - "Which I did not intend - this is Yitzchak son of Avraham".</b>
<b>The community of God<b> ...</b></b>
In the beit midrash of Bruriah, they stuck a sword and said: Halacha - a mamzer may enter the community. And what of that which is written: A mamzer may not enter the community of God" (Devarim 23:3)? They were specific and learned: in a place where there is a community of God - a mamzer may not come. In a place where there is no community of God - a mamzer may come.
It was asked of them: And where is the community of God? And they did not answer, until one of the students of the sages stood up in the beit midrash and said, I have received a tradition from the house of my mother that the community of God are separate, are pious, are learned, are performers of good deeds. And they live on the far bank of the Sambatyon. My aged grandmother walked from sea to sea and circled every direction under the heavens and did not find the community of God. 
They voted and decided in the beit midrash: the community of God never was and was not created, and is but a parable. And why was it written? To expound and receive reward.
<b>Stuck a sword</b> - see Yevamot 77a. <b>Never was and was not created... expound and receive reward.</b> - see Sanhedrim 71a.
<b>The atonement of a mamzer.</b>
A mamzeret came before the Holy Blessed One. She fell on her face and said: Master of the Universe, many tears I have cried every day for me and my offspring, and I have no comforter. And did I not learn that the gates of tears are not sealed?
The Holy Blessed One signed and said: I hear your words.
That mamzeret posed a difficulty to the Holy Blessed One: the fathers of mamzerim sinned, and their children what did they do?! Is it not already said "Their fathers ate sour grapes, and the teeth of the children shall be blunted?!" (Yirmiyahu 31:28). Are you not a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in kindness and truth? Is this called kindness? Is this called truth? Master of the Universe, there is no sin which does not have atonement before You. If I had sinned - I would bring a sacrifice. If I had erred - I would repent. And what shall I do now, that I have not sinned and I have not erred and I am unable to atone for something I have not done?!
The Holy Blessed One said: regarding you it is said "She is more righteous than me" (Bereishit 38:26).
That is what is said: "Truth from the earth will sprout, justice from the heavens will look" (Psalms 85:12).
<b>And for my offspring</b>: see Sanhedrin 4:5 - 'capital cases, his [the defendant's] blood and the blood of his offspring depend on him until the end of the world, as we find with Kayin who killed his brother, as it says: "Your brother's bloods are calling" (Bereishit 4:10); it doesn't say your brother's blood but your brother's bloods - his blood and the blood of his descendants.' <b>And I have no comforter</b> - Vayikra Rabbah 32:8. <b>The gate of tears is never locked</b> - Bava Metzia 59a.
<b>Rachel -- mother of mamzeirim</b>
At that moment, Rachel jumped up before the Holy Blessed One and said, before You wrote in Your Torah "Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, as her rival, and uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time." (Vayikra 18:18), I was married to Ya'akov and made a rival to my sister. Before You wrote in Your Torah, "a mamzer shall not come until the community of God", I bore to Ya'akov two children, Yosef and Binyamin.
Rachel was the mother of mamzeirim. And this is as it is said, "Rachel weeps over her children and will not be comforted about her children, for they are not" (Yirmiyahu 31:14). "Her children... her children". Initially it was said "her children" - these are the children of Israel who went into exile; and afterwards it was said "her children" - these are her own children, since they were mamzerim. "She will not be comforted" - these are mamzeirim, since about them it is said "And they have no comforter" (Kohelet 4:1). "For they are not" - Rachel saw that the mamzeirim were in the future to be forbidden to enter the community, and as if they were not.
The Holy Blessed One said to her: "Hold back your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears" (Yirmiyahu 31:15). "Your voice from weeping" about the children in exile, "and your eyes from tears" about the mamzeirim, for about their tears it is said "And behold the tear of the oppressed" (Kohelet 4:1). "For there is reward for your action, says God, and they will return from the land of the enemy" (Yirmiyahu 31:15) - these are the children who return from exile. "And there is hope for your end, says God, and children will return to their borders" (Yirmiyahu 31:16) -- these are the mamzeirim, who will in the future return to enter the community of God.
The mind of Yirmiyahu was set at rest, for he was concerned about the mamzeirut of his son, Ben Sira, who was born of his daughter when she was impregnated from his semen in a bathtub, and he prophesied: "In those days, they will no longer say 'fathers ate sour grapes and the teeth of their sons are set on edge', for every man will die for his own iniquity, and the one who eats sour grapes, his teeth will be blunted" (Yirmiyahu 31:28-29).
And this is the secret of the matter between Yaakov and Rachel. That Rachel said to him: "Give me sons, or else I am dead" (Bereishit 30:1). You think that if you come to me, your punishment will be kareit and your children will be mamzeirim, and if I think that if you do not come to me and I have no children - this will be my death.
<b>At that moment, Rachel jumped up</b> -- See Eicha Rabbati, Petichta 24. <b>Rachel was the mother of mamzeirim</b> -- See Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Issurei Biah 15:1. <b>These are mamzeirim, since about them it is said "And they have no comforter"... for about their tears it is said "And behold the tear of the oppressed"</b> -- see Vayikra Rabbah 32:8. <b>Was impregnated in a bathtub</b> - see Midrash the Alphabet of Ben Sira, Yehuda David Einshtein, Otzar HaMidrashim 1928 p43.
<b>Moshe reveals his mamzeirut</b>
When Moshe ascended on high, he was sitting and writing the Torah from the mouth of the Might. He reached the verse "The nakedness of your father's sister you shall not uncover, she is your father's flesh" (Vayikra 18:12). He said: And was my mother not the aunt of my father? Was Amram not my father, and he is the son of Kehat the grandson of Levi, as it is said "And these are the records of Levi, to their families... to Kehat the Kehati family... and Kehat fathered Amram" (Bamidbar 26:57-58). And Yocheved, my mother, she was the daughter of Levi, as it is said "And the name of the wife of Amram was Yocheved daughter of Levi, that Levi had fathered her in Egypt, and Aharon and Moshe and Miriam their sister were born to Amram" (Bamidbar 26:59). So it turns out that Yocheved and Kehat were siblings, and Yocheved was forbidden to the children of Kehat. Moshe's spirits fell.
He reached the verse "A mamzer shall not come into the community of God, even to the tenth generation he shall not come into the community of God" (Devarim 23:3). He said: The Holy Blessed One has not explained what a mamzer is. He heard them saying that that a mamzer is one who comes from any form of incest (lit "nakedness", ervah) excepting niddah. He said: and are my siblings and I mamzeirim? Moshe's strength weakened. For thirty-nine days he walked and wept, until it seemed to him that he heard a voice saying "Silence, for thus has arisen in thought before Me". He sought to die.
He returned backwards and sat in the beit midrash of Bruriah. He heard one asking: why isn't the ruling of mamzeirut practiced today? And they responded to her: since we do not accept testimony regarding mamzeirim, since it has already been codified that the entire community is under the presumption of mamzeirut, and are permitted one to the other. Moshe's spirits were soothed.
<b>Moshe ascended on High, "Silence, for thus has arisen in thought before Me"</b> - See Menachot 29b. <b>Yocheved was forbidden to the children of Kehat</b> -- See Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Relations 2:5: "A mother's sister, regardless whether a maternal or paternal half-sister, whether born from a married or an unmarried relationship, behold she is forbidden to him (lit. "ervah upon him") as a mother's sister. And so a father's sister, regardless whether a maternal or paternal half-sister, whether born from a married or an unmarried relationship, behold she is forbidden to him (lit. "ervah upon him") as a father's sister." <b>He heard them saying that a mamzer is one who comes from any incestuous relationship excepting the niddah</b> -- See Rambam, Laws of Forbidden Relations 15:1: "Who is the 'mamzer' (Devarim 23:3) mentioned in the Torah? One who comes from any erva of the arayot except the niddah, since a child from her is blemished but not a mamzer; but the one who has sex with any other erva, nonconsensually or consensually, deliberately or accidentally -- the child is a mamzer. Both sons and daughters are forbidden forever, as it says "Even to the tenth generation" (Devarim 23:3), meaning, "forever".

<b>The judgment of yibbum and chalitzah</b> -- Rivka Lubitz
When two brothers live together, and one of them dies without a child, the wife of the dead one shall not wed outside to a strange man. Her brother-in-law shall come unto her and take her to wife and make her his levirate wife. And the firstborn that she shall bear will uphold the name of the dead brother, and his name will not be erased from Israel. (Devarim 25:5-6)
The wise sages were precise in the beit midrash and learnt: "when brothers live together" - in the case that two brothers live together the judgment of yibbum shall be valid, and in the case when two brothers do not live together, the judgment of yibbum shall not be valid. The men asked them, do you seek to nullify the name of the dead from the world?! One of them [the sages] answered and said: one who has made themself a name, male or female, has a name; one who has not made themself a name - in any case is destroyed from the world without a name. The hands of the men were weakened. Another answered and said: the women of today are important (see Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 472:4) and make a name for their husbands in other ways, without being penetrated to one who is not acceptable to them. And the mind of the men was not put at rest until one woman whispered: the dead -- they will eventually be forgotten from the world, even if they are male.

Afterword









In Chapter 16, the prophet Ezekiel seeks to illustrate the Jewish people's harsh offense towards the God of Israel, to them. As they have abandoned Him for other gods — an offense that justifies the afflictions that are coming to them and that will come to them in the near future. At the end of this furious prophecy, Ezekiel adds words of comfort for the days that will come at the end of this difficult time period. These beloved words are mentioned during the high holidays in the <i>zikhronot</i> prayer: <i>But I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish it with you as an everlasting covenant</i> (Ezekiel 16:60).
The parable the prophet uses throughout the whole chapter until the end to elucidate the dynamic between the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Jewish people, is a very problematic one: (Like other prophets,) Ezekiel compares the Holy One, blessed be He to a spouse, the man; and the Jewish people to [the other] spouse, the woman. However, this time, the descriptions of the complicated relations between the spouses are so explicit, so cruel, so twisted and violent, that — at least for me — it gets to the point that the parable overpowers the message. I could not come to terms with the dynamics of power between a man and his wife, between men and women, sketched out [here].
The chapter opens with a touching description of divine kindness: The Jewish people has been abandoned; it has been sent away like a disregarded infant girl in the field. She is [then] gathered with great kindness by the Holy One, blessed be He, who takes care of her physically and spiritually. He raises her and nurtures her until she matures. Then, when she reaches 'the time of her loving' (alluding to Ezekiel 16:8), the Holy One, blessed be He, takes her covenantally for Himself as a wife. However, instead of gratitude and expressing loyalty to her benefactor, His wife begins to betray Him. Her licentious misdeeds are described over dozens of verses in a detailed and pornographic fashion; likewise, the harsh punishments that will come to her because of her actions. The history of the Jewish people, from the moment of its birth until the circumstances that it found itself in at the time of this prophecy, is explained through the stormy and violent rhythm of the narrative of this long and detailed parable.
