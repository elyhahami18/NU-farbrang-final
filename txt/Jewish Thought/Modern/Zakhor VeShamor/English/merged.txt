<b>D. Practical Applications of the Disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel</b> In the language of the Mishnah, “The New Year for Trees,” of course, means the New Year for the Fruit of the Trees. That is to say, the legal borderline according to which the classification of the fruits of the trees are determined for the various years of tithes or for the holiness of its fourth year (what is called <i>neta revai</i>): A fruit that emerged before the New Year for Trees is classified as being from the previous year, whereas a fruit that emerged after that date is classified as being from the next year. However, the fruits that are native and common to the land of Israel – like the seven species, almonds and apples – do not emerge at all in the Shevat season, nor even several months before it, but rather only at least a month after it. After further investigation, and it makes sense that, the New Year for Trees come out in a season in which there are no fruits; and only much later does the sap rise in the trees,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Rosh Hashanah 14a, s.v. hoyil veyatzu.</i> the blossoming begin and the flowering and growth of the fruits arrive. The height of the season of the fruits of the trees is the grape harvest which falls on the 15th of Av, half a year after Tu BiShevat. Indeed, with the vast majority of fruits, the question of to which year it belongs does not come up, since there is a clear distinction in nature between the fruits of one year and that of another.
Indeed, about which fruits did Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel actually disagree? Which fruits are likely to come out in the first two weeks of the month of Shevat?
In the Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 14b-15b), there is a long discussion about the legal questions that emerge from determining the 15th of Shevat to be the New Year for Trees. In that discussion, in other Taanaitic sources and in the Yerushalmi, they deal with a small number of unusual fruits – the etrog (citron), the carob and the white fig. We will discuss these unusual fruits below.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The entire issue is discussed at length by Prof. Yehudah Felix, may his memory be blessed, in his essay, “The 15th of Shevat, in Law and in Practice,” Tarbiz 46, pp. 181-210. (Republished in Talmud Yerushalmi, Tractate Sheviit 2, Y. Felix Edition, 1987, pp. 354-384.) Part of the details below are based on his writings.</i>

...This is the prophet Zachariah's answer to the question, "Shall I cry in the fifth month?" The prophet explained that we are not fasting because of the destruction [of the Temple], but rather because of <b>the reasons that caused it</b>. It follows that so long as the reasons that caused the destruction are in full force and stride, the fast is necessary and should not be abolished. The fast is <b> a call for repentance and rectification</b>. So even if the Temple were to be standing in its place, we should continue to fast in order <b>to prevent [its] destruction</b>. It is even possible to say this in stronger terms: <b>The reasons for the destruction are the destruction!</b><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In the same way that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, spoke about a heavenly voice that emerged and said (Sanhedrin 96b), "You burned down a burnt sanctuary; You grinded ground flour." For the iniquities had already destroyed Jerusalem and removed the Divine Presence from it before its physical destruction.</i> 
The prophet Zechariah thereby established an ethical significance to the fasts in place of a historical one: If the fasts were established in memory of the destruction, such a delineation would require that they be abolished with the building of the new Temple, and perhaps even in the middle of its building. However if the role of the fasts is to deal with the reasons for the destruction, it is very likely that there would be a need to fast and to lament even after the building of the Temple, so that it not be destroyed again. When there is hatred of fellow Jews, deep division in the people and in society, a culture of deceit, evil and corruption, the fasts need to be observed even if the Temple is rebuilt. 

Chapter XVI





















 The expression, "Mordekhai the Jew," precisely reveals the situation of the Jews in exile during that generation. The Jews began to take on foreign names, and even some, the source of which was idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Marduk and Ishtar were the name of the central gods in Mesopotamia (like Baal and Asherah in Canaan; and and just like particularly Christian names were adopted by the Jews in Europe). After the fact, these names were transformed to accepted Jewish names as a result of the Megillah and its sanctification [from its inclusion] in the Bible (along the lines 0f, "Ammon and Moav were purified by Sichon - Gittin 38a), obviously without any of its original idolatrous meaning. However the big question is, how could the Jews of Shushan get to the adoption of  names that were actually idols for their children and leaders. Moreover we should ask whether there is a connection between these names and sitting in the gate of the king and the heavy involvement in Persian politics; and whether this did not create an expectation in Shushan that Jews that  adopted these names would also give up their Judaism and bow to Haman.</i> And they had political connections with the leaders, based on loyalty (like the story of Bigtan and Teresh), but they nevertheless kept their distinctiveness, "but Mordecai would not kneel or bow low" (Esther 3:1); and the letter correspondence among themselves, "Mordecai recorded these events. And he sent dispatches to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, near and far" (Esther 9:20).
