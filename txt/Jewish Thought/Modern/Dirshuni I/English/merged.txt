Preface



Creation of the World

I


"That she should be a fit friend for him and a partner for all that he needs. And for this reason, I will make a helpmate that is proper and fit for him." (Rabbi Yitzchak Arama, Akeidat Yitzchak, Chapter 8.)
<i>It is not good for man to be alone; I will make him a helpmate corresponding to him</i> (Genesis 2:18). 
What is a helpmate (<i>ezer</i>)?<br>Rescue, as it is stated: <i>The God of my father was my help, and He rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh</i> (Exodus 18:4).<br>Protection, as it is stated: <i>He is our help and our shield</i> (Psalms 33:20).<br>Salvation, as it is stated: a people saved by the Lord, your helping shield (Deuteronomy 33:29).<br>Redemption, as it is stated:<i> I will help you, declares the Lord, I your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</i><br>So how does a woman help a man?<br>She rescues him, protects him, saves him, and redeems him from being alone.
And what is corresponding (<i>keneged</i>) to him?<br> There is a corresponding that means across from, and there is a corresponding that means equal to, as it is stated:<i> and I will go across from you</i> (Genesis 33:12). But our teacher, Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (Rashi), explained it right there: "This is [the meaning of] 'across from you' — equal to you." As behold Jacob and Esau walked together, since they had made peace before they walked. And now they walked equally, one alongside the other.
And how does the woman correspond to the man?<br>Behold the Torah said as follows: And the man gave names to all the beasts and to the birds of the sky and all the wild animals of the field; but no helpmate corresponding to him was found for the man (Genesis 2:20).<br>This teaches that no helpmate corresponding to him was found among the animals and the birds. For they are not like him.<b>That is why the woman was necessary, for only she is equal to him.</b>
And this is what they said, "Scripture never departs from its plain sense."

<i>Yet your urge shall be for your husband, but he shall rule  over you</i> (Genesis 3:16).
What is [the meaning of] <i>he shall rule [yimshol]  over you</i><br>Eve was only cursed by the comparisons [<i>mashalim</i>] people would compare [<i>yamshilu</i>] her with. Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, compared women to everything in the world:<br>If they wanted to compare them to a cup, they compared them.<br>If they desired to equate them with meat, they equated them.<br>If they sought to correlate them with bread, they correlated [them].<br>If they wished to describe them like ground, they described them. <br>In their eyes, they were like a cooked food, like sheep, like geese, like the human body; and even like a pouch full of this or another thing, and like nakedness.<br> In the future to come, it shall be fulfilled: <i>I will put an end to this comparison; it shall not be used in Israel any more</i> (Ezekiel 12:23).

<b>The Tests of Sarah</b> Naamah Adler
With ten tests Abraham, our father, was tested - and he withstood them all; in order to show how great was the love of Abraham, our father. (Avot 5:3)
With ten tests, Sarah, our mother, was tested - and she withstood them all; in order to show the extent of her strength, and how great was her hope.
As she was barren and did not have offspring; and she was taken from the place of her birth and the house of her father to an unknown land; as she was requested to lie for the sake of Avram when she came to Egypt, and she was taken to the house of Pharoah, and whatever happened to her happened; as her Egyptian maidservant became pregnant for Avram, her husband; and her maidservant made light of her; and her husband told her, "do to her what is right in your eyes" (Genesis 16:6); as she heard the announcement about the birth of Yitzchak from the opening of the tent; as she waited many years for her husband, Avram, to return from his journeys and his wars; as she was requested to lie for the sake of Avraham when she came to Gerar, and she was taken to the house of Avimelekh, and whatever happened to her there happened; as her son was taken from her for the binding (his sacrifice).

"These things (or words)" - these are the word that were [spoken] with Sarah: And God tested Sarah. And the angel said to her, "Take your son, your only one, that you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and bring him up there as a sacrifice." And Sarah said, "No, for a mother shall not slaughter her son." And in the morning she rose early. Sarah was shaken because the lad was not there, nor was his father, Abraham. She raised her hands to God in the Heavens and said, "Master of the universe, I know that the end of one who slaughters his son in the name of God is that he has neither a son nor God. Please forgive Avraham, who erred in this thing. Please remember that it did not cross the mind of the mother to sacrifice her son, and save the lad from his hand!" At that time, Abraham moved his hand towards the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the Lord called to Abraham and said, "'Do not move your hand towards the lad, since I now know that you fear God' (Genesis 22:12), even though you did not hold back your son." And that is why it is stated, "Everything that Sarah tells you, listen to her voice" (Genesis 21:12). Hence, "your offspring will be known through Isaac."

"So early next morning, Abraham saddled his ass and took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and he set out for the place of which God had told him." (Genesis 22:3)
"Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, 'Father!' And he answered, 'Yes, my son.' And he said, 'Here are the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?'" (Genesis 22:7) 
"An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush. He gazed, and there was a bush burning in fire, yet the bush was not consumed." (Exodus 3:2)
We have learned: The burning fire of the bush is the fire that Abraham brought with him to the binding of Isaac, as it is stated, "Here are the fire and the wood"; and it is stated, "a bush burning in fire." What fire? This is the fire of Abraham.<br>And what is the fire of Abraham? This is the fire of attachment that lifted him to sacrifice his son, as it is stated, "the fire and the wood." The wood, as it is stated, "He split the wood for the burnt offering." But the fire, we have not heard [of it]. Rather they said like this: "This was the fire of those who attach themselves to God, through the power of which he went to slaughter his son."<br>And some say, "From where [do we know] that it was the same fire that burned inside Abraham and at the bush? As it is stated (Genesis 22:1), 'and God tested Abraham; and it is stated (Exodus 3:4), 'and God called to him from within the bush.'<br>What is, 'from within the bush (<i>sneh</i>)?' From within that test (<i>nesayon</i>)." 
And how did the fire go up from Mount Moriah to Mount Chorev? They said, "The angel of the Lord who called to Abraham at Mount Moriah did not move from that altar of the binding, until Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. When they went down, it went and stood on Mount Chorev in the bush, it and the fire of Abraham which it guarded with it." But behold, one angel cannot do two missions! One angel cannot do two missions, but it can do one mission. So what was that mission? To protect the descendants of Abraham our father, and to fulfill, "for your offspring will be called through Isaac" (Genesis 21:12). This is what is stated, "it was not consumed." The knife did not descend into the bush - that is Israel! "But the more they were oppressed, the more they increased and spread out" (Exodus 1:12).

Jacob went out twice: Once from his mother's womb, as it is stated: <i>Then his brother came out, holding on to the heel of Esau</i> (Genesis 25:26). And once from the womb of his city, as it is stated: <i>And Jacob went out from Beersheba</i> (Genesis 28:10).<br>When he came out of his mother's womb, he came back and entered her tents, as it is stated: <i>and Jacob was a plain man, staying among the tents.</i> (Genesis 25:27).<br> Plain as a baby, folded up like a ledger.<br>Until she grabbed him firmly by the hairs and shook him: <i>get up and flee</i> (Genesis 27:43)!<br>He heard the echo of a voice saying, "Flee, my beloved. and you shall be like a gazelle" (alluding to Song of Songs 8:14). And across from it an echo of a voice answers, "Come, my beloved, let us go out to the field, let us lodge in the villages... let us see if the vine has blossomed, if the tender grapes have appeared, if the pomegranates are in bloom; there I will give my love to you" (alluding to Song of Songs 7:12-13).<br>He understood in his bone and his flesh that the time had come for him to go out into the world: <i>And Jacob went out.. and he went to Charan... and he lodged there...</i>

<i>And it was when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob came forward and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother</i> (Genesis 29:10). 
<i>And rolled [vayagel] the stone</i> — and what is <i>vayagel</i>?<br> That Rachel was revealed [<i>nigletah</i>] before him; and her face was like the face of his mother, Rebecca, who lit the candle in the tent of Sarah and brought back the [protective] cloud and the blessing in the dough. So the stone of the cry of Esau was rolled off of his heart, and he understood.<br><i>And watered [vayashk] the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother.</i> And afterward, it is stated: <i>Then Jacob kissed [vayishak] Rachel, and he raised his voice and cried</i> (Genesis 29:11).
<b>who lit the candle... blessing in the dough</b> — based on Bereshit Rabbah 60:16. <b>the cry of Esau</b> — based on Genesis 27:34.

...It was in the Beit Midrash of Bruria that they added: Relationships among women add to their strengths and diminish their sorrows.  ‘To her as a maidservant’ – Zilpah was given to Leah and Bilhah to Rachel….Why did Lavan give Zilpah to his daughter Leah?  Because ‘the eyes of Leah were soft / weak’ (Br 29:17), and tears would flow (zolfot).  Therefore he gave Zilpah [same root] to her, who knew how to contain her tears, and together they could draw the tears to a close.

<b>Midrashei Dinah</b> &lt;p&gt;Rivkah Lubitz&lt;/p&gt;
"And Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a boy... and became pregnant again and gave birth ... and became pregnant again and gave birth to a boy ... and became pregnant... and gave birth to a boy to Ya'akov ... and became pregnant again and gave birth to a boy ... and afterwards she birthed a girl" (Bereishit 29:32-30:21).
What is "And afterwards" (Bereishit 30:21)? -- After all the sons, a daughter. There are those who explain "after" is the language of distress, and those who explain it is the language of joy. The language of distress, since Ya'akov did not make a feast for the birth of Dinah, and he did not come when her mother named her, rather the proclamation went out and said "A daughter has been born to Ya'akov" and the world continued in its way. The language of joy, that Leah had been craving a daughter. Before this she had tried to please her husband Ya'akov with male children, and to outdo her sister with male children. After this, when Leah birthed these males, she only wanted a daughter for herself.
"And Dinah, the daughter of Leah, who bore her to Ya'akov, went out..." (Bereishit 34:1)
Why did the Torah cause us to learn here that Dinah was the daughter of Ya'akov, and not say this earlier? Dinah would sit by Leah all her days until she grew up. When she reached puberty, she left the tent to see the daughters of the land. Ya'akov said to Leah, 'my grandmother Sarah and my mother Rivka sat in the tent always, and a light burnt in it and cloud was tied above it. This one is curious, she goes and sees the daughters of the land, and is not mine.' Therefore the Torah says, and Dinah daughter of Leah who bore her to Ya'akov'.
"And Dinah went out..." (ibid.)
There are those who explain this verse 'like mother like daughter', and those who explain 'like father like daughter'. Like mother, as it says "And Leah went out to greet him" (Bereishit 30:16). Just as this one went to greet her husband regarding a mitzvah matter, this one went out to shidduchim [matches]. Like father, as it says "And Ya'akov went out" (Bereishit 28:10). Just as this one went out into what belonged to his brother Eisav, so too this one went out into what belonged to her brothers, to find herself a place.
"And Dinah went out... to see the daughters of the land"
Dinah was the tail to her brothers. When she grew up, she saw that her place was not with them, and went to see the daughters of the land. That is as it is said, "Companionship or death" (Ta'anit 23a).
"And Dinah went out... to see the daughters of the land" 
Dinah was a quiet person, and had no voice. All of this, why? Since her family didn't listen to her or speak much with her, like our sages said: 'Do not speak much with a woman' (Pirkei Avot 1:5). Therefore, she went out to see the daughters of the land.
Dinah was like someone mute, as it says "Dinah went out... to see" and not to hear. And further: "And he slept with her, and violated her" (Bereishit 34:2) and it doesn't write "And Dinah cried out". And would you have thought for a moment that Dinah did not cry out? She was like someone mute, that from the pain and from the shame she was quieted and struck dumb.
"And he slept with her and violated her"
In the beit midrash of Bruriah they were divided on whether this was consensual. There are those who said it was nonconsensual, since the verse says "And he took her" (ibid.) - it teaches that Shchem abducted her. And it further says "And he bedded her" - "her", and not "with her" [lit. "and lay to her", not "lay with her"], to teach that he forced himself on her. And it further says, "And he afflicted her" - literally. And there are those who say it was consensual, as it says "And he took her" - taking is the language of marriage, like it is said "When a man takes a woman" (Devarim 24:1). And it further says "And he bedded her" - literally. And it further says "And he afflicted her" [וַיִּעַנֶּהָ] - to teach that he came to her at her time. If so, that he answered [שענה] her - that she would ask and ask her brothers and they would push her and mock her, until Shchem came and answered her.
The silence of Dinah stretches to the ends of the earth. And this is a cry that is in the heart. Two women were forced and their silence stretches to the ends of the earth: Dinah, and Tamar the sister of Amnon. By Tamar the verse says: "And she went her way crying, and Avshalom her brother said to her... my sister, be quiet, he is your brother - pay this thing no mind. And Tamar sat and was desolate." (II Samuel 13:19-20)
These midrashim were first published in Rivkah Lubitz, "Feminist Midrashim", Nachum Ilan (pub.) <b>A good eye: Dialogue and Polemic in Israeli Culture, the Jubilee Book for Tovah Ilan</b>  [?], Bnei Brak 5759, and in 'And she went to examine - midrash of women of creativity', Tovah Cohen (pub.), <b>The Woman in Judaism: Arranger of Judgments</b> 11(5,763), pp20-22. 
<b>My grandmother Sarah and my mother Rivka</b> - Bereishit Rabbah 60:16. <b>Like mother, like daughter</b> - Yerushalmi Sanhedrim 2:6. <b>Companionship or death</b> - Bavli Ta'anit 23a. <b>Don't speak much</b> - Avot 1:5. 
<i>And Dinah went out</i>
There are those who expounded from this verse, "like mother, like daughter"; and there are those who expounded from this verse, "like father, like daughter."<br>Like mother, as it is stated: <i>and Leah went out to greet him</i> (Genesis 30:16). Just like this one went out to greet her husband for the matter of a commandment, so too did that one go out for matchmaking.<br>Like father, as it is stated:<i>And Jacob went out</i> (Genesis 28:10). Just like this went out on account of his brother, Esau, so too did that one go out on account of her brothers, to find herself a place.

Go and learn what the daughter of Paraoh sought to teach the Children of Israel at the time that she had compassion upon one of the children of the Hebrews and raised him like her own son: 'That one who raises an orphan boy or an orphan girl in his house is considered by Scripture as if he gave birth to them.' Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Bityah (a name that means the daughter of the Lord), the daughter of Pharaoh, "Moshe was not your son, nor are you My daughter; but I will call you My daughter (<i>biti</i>)." From here [we learn] that, 'There are righteous ones among the nations of the world that have a share in the world to come.'
As in each and every generation, Divinity spreads its wings over us and raises up for us women and men from the Jewish people and from the nations of the world, the courageous hearts and resilience of which, save us from arbitrariness, from enmity and from apathy that come against us to finish us off.

<b>Sing to the Lord</b><br>Tamar Duvdevani
Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord They said, "I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously." (Exodus 15:1)
Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her in dance with timbrels. And Miriam chanted for them, "Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; Horse and driver He has hurled into the sea." (Exodus 15:20-21)
For the sake of what was it stated, "And Miriam chanted for them?" As the song had already broken out from the mouth of Moses. For it is stated, "I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously." Rather it is that Miriam knew a song that Moses did not know.<br>What was the song of Moses? Moses called, "I will sing to the Lord," which is the song of the isolated individual, which does not combine itself to the aggregate of choruses, voices and melodies. Moses sought to extract the voice from everyone and redeem their song.<br>But the song of redemption was still incomplete.<br>And what was the song of Miriam? "Sing to the Lord," an expression of the plural.<br>Miriam had learned, "These words the Lord spoke to your entire assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the fog, with a great voice, and did not add to them" (Deuteronomy 5:18). "A great voice" - for the sake of what? Because it includes within it a great multiplicity of voices, accents, languages and tones. For the voice is the voice of God and the image is the image of God - constructed from all of humanity, from all of their different faces and opinions. Hence she called, "Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously," which combines all of the voices completely and connects the personal, I will sing," to the communal and multifaceted song.<br>Miriam said to them, "Sing to the Lord," and remind yourselves of the image of God within you, constructed of seventy faces, seventy languages and seventy melodies. "Sing to the Lord, bless His name" (Psalms 96b) - when you sing to him, you are blessing His name.
<b>All of their different faces and opinions</b> - based on Berakhot 58a.

Midrashim [on the] daughters of Zelophehad - Rivkah Lubitz
The daughters of Zelophehad... came closer. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Why were they called "daughters of Zelophehad" in the beginning and only afterwards by their names? Because of the shadow and fear that was with them in the beginning. In the beginning, they sat in the shadow of their father, and they feared raising their heads. After the sisters became closer to each other, they were strengthened and known by their names, as it is said, "The daughters of Zelophehad came closer... and these are the names of his daughters."

A mother and a woman peered through the window, but a harlot tied a length [of crimson cord from it]. The mother of Sisera peered, as it is stated, <i>Through the window peered Sisera’s mother and wailed</i> (Judges 5:28).<br>Michal, daughter of Saul, peered, as it is stated, <i>and Michal, daughter of Saul, peered through the window. etc. and she despised him in her heart</i> (II Samuel 6:16). Rahab the harlot did not peer, as it is stated, <i>She let them down by a rope through the window</i> (Joshua 2:15); and it is also stated, <i>and tie this length of crimson cord to the window</i> (Joshua 2:18).
Another explanation:<br> Why is it written <i>nishkefah</i> [which can mean, was seen], and not <i>heshkifah</i> [saw]? For behold, even one who sits in the corner of her house and peers through the window, her prayers reach the heavens.<br> And [Yiftach's daughter] who sits at the gate of the heavens hears the stories of all the women of all the generations and ties them all into a string of <i>tikvah</i> [the word for cord above in Joshua 2:18 is used here in the sense of hope] to her window, so that perhaps the day will come for her to come down with the rope through the window.

Who were these companions? They were merely two, and these were they: Rachel, who taught her to cry; and Miriam who taught her timbral and dances. "Rachel taught her to cry" as it is written "Rachel is weeping for her children...for they are gone." (Jeremiah 31:15) and about Bat Yiftach it is said "And weep for my virginity." "Miriam taught her timbral and dances" as it is written "and all the women went out after her in dance with hand-drums" (Exodus 15:20). "All the women" including those who were not in the same generation. And about Bat Yiftach it is said "there was his daughter coming out to meet him, with timbrel and dance!" (Judges 11:34)

There was a woman in Israel, and her name was Tanya. She was a righteous and proper woman. She was always kind and charitable to the poor, had a pleasing disposition towards everyone, and opened up her heart to hear the problems of others. But she did not have any fruit of the womb. Tanya would cry to herself when she lay down and when she got up. 
One year, when the Day of Judgement arrived, her pain became so great that she requested to die.<br>Akatriel Yah, the Lord of Hosts, appeared to her on account of her tears.<br>He said to her, "Tanya, My daughter, bless Me."<br>She said to Him, "May it be Your will that Your mercy overcome Your anger, and may Your mercy prevail over Your [other] attributes, and may You act toward Your daughters with the attribute of mercy."<br>He said to her, "What is with you, My Daughter?"<br>She said to Him, "Since Rabbi Zeira established that the daughters of Israel had taken on a stringency upon themselves and [wait] seven clean days after they have the way of women, I have been prevented from having fruit of the womb. And did You not bless us in the Torah of Your Mouth, <i>Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth</i> (Genesis 1:28)? Yet in the creation that You created, You have only established one time in every month when the fruit of the womb can be formed. And given that I have the way of women for nine days, and my husband is only permitted to me once seven more days have passed, it is specifically at that time that my husband is forbidden to me.<br>So His mercy prevailed over His [other] attributes, and He said to her, "<i>When a woman... she shall remain in her menstrual separation seven days</i>. So your husband is permitted to you after the way of women." <br>And the knot in her womb was untied, and her husband came to her, and she conceived.<br>And the Holy One, Blessed be He, nodded His head...
The midrash relates to the problem of "halakhic infertility." Scripture distinguishes between two different possible types of impurity from a woman's body requiring immersion in living waters before the consummation of marital relations: Menstrual (<i>Niddah</i>) impurity that concludes at the end of her monthly period, <i>When a woman has a discharge, her discharge being blood from her body, she shall remain in her impurity seven days</i> (Leviticus 15:19); and discharge (<i>zavah</i> impurity, when she bleeds not during the time of her period or for more than the seven monthly days of her period. The discharge impurity concludes after seven additional clean days, which are counted after the blood has stopped: <i>When a woman has had a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstruation... as though at the time of her menstruation, she shall be impure... When she becomes clean of her discharge, she shall count off seven days, and after that, she shall be pure</i> (Leviticus 15:25-28). These days are called, "the seven clean days."<br> The Talmud mentions Rabbi Zera's testimony, according to which the daughters of Israel were stringent upon themselves to sit out "the seven clean days" for any menstrual blood that they experienced (BT, Niddah 66a). The Talmud presents a disagreement concerning the status of this stringency, whether it is a custom or a law. In practice, this stringency was accepted as law, and what that means is that women are forbidden to have sexual relations for 12-14 days a month — the 5-7 days of the monthly period and "the seven clean days." Women who ovulate during one of "the seven clean days" are unable to become pregnant, and that is why their infertility is called "halakhic infertility." Throughout the generations and into our days, various decisors have sought to permit such women to immerse even before "the seven clean days" are finished. In our days, there are some who recommend a medical solution to this problem by using hormones that delay the time of ovulation in such a way that it does not occur during "the seven clean days."

What is the pain that has no limit? That is the pain of one who has a stillbirth. For the pain of pregnancy, the pain of birth and the pain of [work on] the land have a beginning and an end. But after them, their is great joy.<br>But the pain of a woman for her infant who was bent over and hidden but never saw light has no time, no end and no cure. And our Rabbis said about the death of a stillborn, a father's heart does not ache, he does not tear, we do not mourn for him and we do not cry. And not only that, but the infant appears to them like a fish, a creeping animal, a locust, a bug and even a sandal.<br>"From here, say, 'At the sound of their downfall the earth shall shake; the sound of screaming shall be heard at the Red Sea'" (Jeremiah 49:21). The ground needs to shudder for each and every stillborn infant that returns to it, and their voice needs to be heard from one sea to the other.<br>And from where can relief for the grieving soul be found? We can do nothing but aim our eyes towards our Father in Heaven. For He is the 'Supporter of the falling and the Healer of the sick,' as it is stated (Psalms 147:3), "He heals the broken-hearted and binds their wounds." And know that, "For His anger endures but a moment; in His favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning" (Psalms 30:6).

On that day, one of those refused a <i>get</i> [bill of divorce] answered them with all of the answers in the world, but they would not accept them from her.<br>She said to the sages, "Give me my <i>get</i>, and I will leave."<br>They said to her, "The man affects the divorce, and a man must affect the divorce willingly."<br>She said to them, "Force him [to give the] <i>get</i>. As behold, "We strike him until he says, 'I agree.'"<br>They said to her, "We are unable to force him, lest it be a <i>get</i> under coercion, and you would come out to be a married woman becoming available, the children of whom are <i>mamzerim</i> [illegitimate]."<br>At that time, the carob tree was uprooted a hundred ells from its place.

She said to them, "If so, behold that I am a living widow."<br>They said to her, "It has already been said, 'It is better to sit as two than to sit as a widow.'"<br>She said to them, "But my husband did this and that to me, and I find him disgusting. I am not like a captive, to have intercourse with someone I hate."<br>They said to her, "Who are we to place our heads between great mountains [to take sides in a debate between much greater scholars], so we must pay attention to [the position of] Rosh."<br>At that time, the aqueduct of water turned backward, but they did not pay attention to the thing.
She said to them, "Undo my matrimony, as he did something incorrect towards me."<br>They said to her, "We do not have the authority."<br>She said to them, "Negate my matrimony, with the argument that it was 'a mistaken transaction,' as I didn't know that he would do this and that to me. Had I known, I would not have wanted to get married to him."<br>They said to her, "We are not able."<br>At that time, the walls of the study hall leaned to fall in, and they continue leaning in.
She said to them, "The court is the father of orphans, and am I not orphaned and forlorn?"<br>They said to her, "That is not a claim, and we don't understand your claims at all. Perhaps he asked you for something and you didn't give it to him?"<br>She said to them, "True, he put many conditions upon me for the <i>get</i>, and I am unable to abide by them."<br>A heavenly voice emerged and said, "What do you want from this woman whose husband is disgusting to her? She does not need to give him anything in order to receive her <i>get</i>."<br>The sages said, "It is not in heaven, and we do not pay attention to a heavenly voice."
At that time, the Holy One, blessed be He, was crying and said, "My children have defeated me, My children have defeated me."
