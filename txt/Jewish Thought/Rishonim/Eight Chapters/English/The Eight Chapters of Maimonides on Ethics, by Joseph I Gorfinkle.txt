Eight Chapters

Introduction

<b>Foreword</b> <br>The author, Rabbi Moses (may God preserve him!) said:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Hebrew text p. 5, n. 2. The introductory words are by ibn Tibbon.</i> We have already explained in the introduction to this work (i. e. the <i>Commentary on the Mishnah</i>) the reason the author of the <i>Mishnah</i> had for putting this treatise (<i>Abot</i>) in this Order (<i>Neziḳin</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Goldschmidt, <i>Der Babylonische Talmud</i>, I, Berlin, 1897, <i>Einleitung in die Mišnah von Moses Maimonides</i>, p. XXX; and <i>Hebrew Review</i>, vol. I, p. 191.</i>. We have also mentioned the great benefit that is to be derived from this treatise, and have promised many times in preceding passages to discuss certain important points at some length in commenting upon it. For, although the contents of the treatise seem clear and easy to understand, yet to carry out all that it contains is not a simple matter for everybody. Moreover, not all of its contents is intelligible without ample comment, withal that it leads to great perfection and true happiness. For these reasons, I have deemed it advisable here to go into a more lengthy discussion. Besides, our Rabbis of blessed memory have said, “He who wishes to be saintly, let him practise the teachings of <i>Abot</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Baba Ḳamma</i>, 30a: אמר רבי יהודה האי מאן דבעי למהוי חסידא לקיים מילי דנזיקין רבא אמר מילי דאבות ואמרי לה מילי דברכות.</i>. Now, there is nothing that ranks so high with us as saintliness, unless it be prophecy, and it is saintliness that paves the way to prophecy; as our Rabbis of blessed memory said, “Saintliness leads to holy inspiration.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abodah Zarah</i>, 20b: חסידות מביאה לידי ענוה ענוה מביאה לידי יראת חטא יראת חטא מביאה לידי קדושה.</i> Thus, their words make it clear that the putting into practice of the teachings of this tractate leads one to prophecy. I shall later expound the truth of this assertion, because upon it depends a number of ethical principles. <br>Further, I deem it fit to preface the commentary on the respective <i>Halakot</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I. e., the verses of <i>Abot</i>.</i> proper by some useful chapters, from which the reader may learn certain basic principles which may later serve as a key to what I am going to say in the commentary. Know, however, that the ideas presented in these chapters and in the following commentary are not of my own invention; neither did I think out the explanations contained therein,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See H. Malter, <i>Shem Tob Joseph Palquera</i>, in <I>JQR</I> (new series), vol. I, p. 163, n. 21.</i> but I have gleaned them from the words of the wise occurring in the <i>Midrashim</i>, in the <i>Talmud</i>, and in other of their works, as well as from the words of the philosophers, ancient and recent, and also from the works of various authors,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The “ancient” philosophers upon whom M. drew, although not always from the sources (see Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 345, n. 4; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 5, n. 4), are Socrates, Plato, the Stoics, especially Aristotle (see <i>Introduction</i>, p. 5, n. 2), Alexander of Aphrodisias (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 31; II, 3), and Themistius (<i>Ibid.</i>, I, 71). By the “recent” philosophers M. means Abu Nasr al-Farabi (<i>Ibid.</i>, I, 73, 74; II, 15, 18, 19; III, 18), Ibn Sina, al-Gazzali, Abu Bekr Ibn al-Zaig (<i>Ibid.</i>, I, 74; II, 24 twice; III, 29), but hardly Ibn Roshd (Averröes). The “works of various authors” refers to the ethical writings of M.’s Jewish predecessors, among whom were Saadia, Ibn Gabirol, Baḥya, Bar Ḥiya, Ibn Zaddik, Yehudah ha-Levi, Abraham Ibn Ezra, and Ibn Daud. See M.’s <i>Letter to Ibn Tibbon</i>, in <i>Ḳobeẓ Teshubot ha-Rambam</i>, II, 28b; Munk, <i>Ibid</i>., I, p. 107, n. 1; p. 345, n. 4; p. 433, n. 2; 434, n. 4; III, p. 417, n. 2, and p. 438, n. 4; Beer, <i>Rabbi Moses ben Maimon</i> pp. 47-50; Geiger, <i>Nachgelassene Schriften</i>, III, <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, p. 41; Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, p. 324, n. 186; Rosin, <i>Ibid</i>., pp. 5-25, 96, n. 3; Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, <i>Introduction</i>, XII-XIII; Cohen, <i>Charakteristik</i>, in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I p. 79; in <I>JE</I>, articles on the Greek, Arabic, and Jewish philosophers mentioned in this note, and article by I. Broydé, <i>Arabic Philosophy—Its Influence on Judaism</i>, II, p. 58. On M.’s relation to Ibn Roshd, see Munk, <i>Notice sur Joseph ben-Jehouda</i>, p. 31, and n. 1; Steinschneider, <i>Catal. Bodl.</i>, <i>Moses Maimonides</i>.</i> as one should accept the truth from whatever source it proceeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Jaraczewski, <i>Die Ethik des Maimonides</i>, etc., in <i>ZPhKr.</i>, XLVI, p. 9; and H. Malter, <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 169, n. 31.</i> Sometimes, I may give a statement in full, word for word in the author's own language, but there is no harm in this, and it is not done with the intention of glorifying myself by presenting as my own something that was said by others before me, since I have just confessed (my indebtedness to others), even though I do not say "so and so said", which would necessitate useless prolixity. Sometimes, too, the mentioning of the name of the authority drawn upon might lead one who lacks insight to believe that the statement quoted is faulty, and wrong in itself, because he does not understand it. Therefore, I prefer not to mention the authority, for my intention is only to be of service to the reader, and to elucidate for him the thoughts hidden in this tractate. I shall now begin the chapters, which, in accordance with my intention, are to serve here as an introduction, which is to consist of eight chapters.





Chapter 1

<b>CHAPTER I</b> <br><b>CONCERNING THE HUMAN SOUL AND ITS FACULTIES</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of the contents of this chapter, see Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, c. I; Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr.</i>, XLVI, pp. 9—10; and Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 45 ff. A summary of the <i>Peraḳim</i> is found in Speier, <i>The Threefold Cord</i> (London, 1891), Appendix.</i> <br>Know that the human soul is one,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Moreh</i>, I, 41, M. explains the term soul (נפש) as being "the vitality which is common to all sentient beings." Cf. Aristotle, <i>De Anima</i>, c. 1 (ed. Hicks, pp. 50 and 51), "Hence soul is the first actuality of a natural body having in it the capacity of life." On the homonymous use of the word נפש, see <i>Moreh</i>, loc. cit.</i> but that it has many diversified activities. Some of these activities have, indeed, been called souls, which has given rise to the opinion that man has many souls, as was the belief of the physicians, with the result that the most distinguished of them<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Hippocrates, the creator of medical science. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 45; Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, p. 1, n. 2; M. Schloessinger, in <I>JE.</I>, VI, p. 403.</i> states in the introduction of his book that there are three souls, the physical, the vital, and the psychical.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">M. opposes the belief in the existence of three souls, but uses this classification to designate a threefold division of the soul's faculties, although, later in this chapter (see <i>infra</i>, pp. 38—39), he divides the faculties into five classes. In <i>Moreh</i>, III, 12, he points to the threefold division of the faculties, where he says, "all physical, psychical, and vital forces and organs that are possessed by one individual are found also in the other individuals." See, also, <i>ibid.</i>, III, 46 (end), where the appetitive (התאוה), the vital (החיונית), and the psychic (הנפשײת) faculties are enumerated. Baḥya, Ibn Gabirol, and Ibn Zaddik seem to have believed in the existence of three souls in man. See I. Broydé in <I>JE.</I>, vol. xi, art. <i>Soul.</i> Abraham ibn Daud, in <i>Emunah Ramah</i>, I, 6 (ed. Weil, 1842), also, opposed the belief of the physicians, supporting the Aristotelian view of the unity of the soul, as did M. Consult Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, p. 11, n. 3; Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 355, n. 1; idem, <i>Mélanges</i>, p. 38, n. 1; p. 40, n. 3; p. 54, n. 2; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 45, n. 1; Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, p. 398, n. 60.</i> These activities are called <i>faculties</i> and <i>parts</i>, so that the phrase "parts of the soul," frequently employed by philosophers, is commonly used. By the word "parts", however, they do not intend to imply that the soul is divided into parts as are bodies, but they merely enumerate the different activities of the soul as being parts of a whole, the union of which makes up the soul.
Thou knowest that the improvement of the moral qualities is brought about by the healing of the soul and its activities.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase, <i>the improvement of the moral qualities</i> (תקון המדות, Ar. אצלאח אלאכלאק), is one which M. probably borrowed from Ibn Gabirol, author of <i>Tiḳḳun Middot ha-Nefesh</i> (<i>The Improvement of the Moral Qualities</i>) to designate the practical task of ethics. Cf. Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, pp. 12, 37, n. 5. M. is not concerned with a theoretical discussion of ethics, but with the problem as to how one's moral qualities are to be improved, which is a practical question. Therefore, the science of curing the soul is to him as practical as is that of healing the body. What Aristotle says in <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 2 may well apply here. "Since, then, the object of the present treatise is not mere speculation, as it is of some others (for we are inquiring not merely that we may know what virtue is, but that we may become virtuous, else it would be useless), we must consider as to the particular actions how we are to do them, because, as we have just said, the character of the habits that shall be formed depends on these."</i> Therefore, just as the physician, who endeavors to cure the human body, must have a perfect knowledge of it in its entirety and its individual parts, just as he must know what causes sickness that it may be avoided, and must also be acquainted with the means by which a patient may be cured, so, likewise, he who tries to cure the soul, wishing to improve the moral qualities, must have a knowledge of the soul in its totality and its parts, must know how to prevent it from becoming diseased, and how to maintain its health.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Philo, too, speaks of a physician of the soul (<i>Quod Omnis Probus Liber</i>, I, 2). Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, I, 12, where Aristotle states that it is necessary for the <i>Politician</i> (moralist) to have a certain knowledge of the nature of the soul, just as it is for the oculist to have a knowledge of the whole body, and in fact more so, as <i>Politics</i> (ethics) is more important than the healing art.</i>
So, I say that the soul has five faculties; the nutritive [also known as the "growing" faculty], the sensitive, the imaginative, the appetitive, and the rational.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">M. agrees with Aristotle as to the number of the divisions of the faculties of the soul, but instead of the latter’s faculty of <i>motion</i>, has that of <i>imagination</i>. δυνάμεις δ' εἰπομεν ϑρεπτικὸν (הזן), ὀρεκτικόν (המתעורר), αἰσϑητικόν (המרגיש), κινητικὸν κατὰ τόπον, διανοητικόν (השכלי). <i>De Anima</i>, II, 3, ed. Hicks, pp. 58 and 59. M.’s division is preferable to that of Aristotle, <i>motion</i> being subservient to the <i>appetitive</i> and the <i>rational</i> faculties, as Aristotle himself states (<i>De Motu Animalium</i>, chaps. 6 and 8). M. considers <i>motion</i>, especially that of the limbs of the body, to be dependent upon the <i>appetitive</i> faculty (see <i>infra</i>, p. 43), and to be “an accident pertaining to living things” (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 26). Cf., also, <i>ibid.</i> I, 46 (שהתנוע אינה מעצם החי אבל מקרה דבק בו); and Aristotle, <i>Physics</i>, V, 2. See Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, p. 11, n. 3; p. 14, n. 4. Al-Farabi (התחלות הנמצאות, in ספר האסיף, Leipzig, 1849, p. 2) divides the faculties as follows: הכח המדברת (השכלי of M.) והכח המתעורר והכח המדמה והכח המרגיש. In making his division, M. seems to have had in mind the divisions of Aristotle and al-Farabi. By adding the <i>nutritive</i> faculty (הזן), which Aristotle includes in his list, to the list of al-Farabi we have M.’s list. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 47, n. 4.</i> We have already stated in this chapter that our words concern themselves only with the human soul; for the nutritive faculty by which man is nourished is not the same, for instance, as that of the ass or the horse. Man is sustained by the nutritive faculty of the human soul, the ass thrives by means of the nutritive faculty of its soul, and the palm-tree<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Hebrew text, c. I, p. 9, n. 9.</i> flourishes by the nutritive faculty peculiar to its soul. Although we apply the same term <i>nutrition</i> to all of them indiscriminately, nevertheless, its signification is by no means the same. In the same way, the term <i>sensation</i> is used homonymously<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">בשתוף השם; Ar. באשתראך אלאסם, <i>homonymously</i>, i. e. the participation of two things in the same name. In <i>Millot ha-Higgayon</i>, c. XII, M. defines this term as follows. “If a noun has a number of significations it is a homonym ....... The word עין, which is used to designate <i>the eye which sees</i>, and a <i>fountain</i>, is a homonym. The common or appelative noun (see Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, Introd., p. 6, n. 2) designates something common to two or more things, and by such a word we recognize, as regards each of these things, the class to which it belongs on account of the conception of the thing which each shares in common, as, for instance, the word <i>living</i> (חי) which is applied to a man, a horse, a scorpion, and a fish; for life, which consists of nutrition and sensation, is a common possession of each one of these species.” In this sense, the words <i>nutrition</i> (נזון) and <i>sensation</i> (מרגיש) are homonyms. See Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, <i>Introd.</i>, p. 6, notes 2 and 3; and Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, pp. 420, n. 91, 460, n. 148, 461, n. 149.</i> for man and beast; not with the idea, however, that the sensation of one species is the same as that of another, for each species has its own characteristic soul distinct from every other, with the result that there necessarily arises from each soul activities peculiar to itself. It is possible, however, that an activity of one soul may seem to be similar to that of another, in consequence of which one might think that both belong to the same class, and thus consider them to be alike; but such is not the case. By way of elucidation, let us imagine that three dark places are illumined, one lit up by the sun shining upon it, the second by the moon, and the third by a flame. Now, in each of these places there is light, but the efficient cause in the one case is the sun, in the other the moon, and in the third the fire. So it is with sensation and its causes. In man it is the human soul, in the ass it is the soul of the ass, and in the eagle, the soul of the eagle. These sensations have, moreover, nothing in common, except the homonymous term which is applied to them. Mark well this point, for it is very important, as many so-called philosophers have fallen into error regarding it, in consequence of which they have been driven to absurdities and fallacies.
Returning to our subject of the faculties of the soul, let me say that the nutritive faculty consists of (1) the power of attracting nourishment to the body, (2) the retention of the same, (3) its digestion (assimilation), (4) the repulsion of superfluities, (5) growth, (6) procreation, and (7) the differentiation of the nutritive juices that are necessary for sustenance from those which are to be expelled.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The first four of these powers are discussed with more detail in <i>Moreh</i>, I, 72. See Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 367, n. 5.</i> The detailed discussion of these seven faculties—the means by which and how they perform their functions, in which members of the body their operations are most visible and perceptible, which of them are always present, and which disappear within a given time—belongs to the science of medicine, and need not be taken up here.
The faculty of sensation consists of the five well-known senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and feeling, the last of which is found over the whole surface of the body, not being confined to any special member, as are the other four faculties.
The <i>imagination</i> is that faculty which retains impressions of things perceptible to the mind, after they have ceased to affect directly the senses which conceived them. This faculty, combining some of these impressions and separating others from one another, thus constructs out of originally perceived ideas some of which it has never received any impression, and which it could not possibly have perceived. For instance, one may imagine an iron ship floating in the air, or a man whose head reaches the heaven and whose feet rest on the earth, or an animal with a thousand eyes, and many other similar impossibilities which the imagination may construct and endow with an existence that is fanciful.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">M. defines <i>imagination</i> in <i>Moreh</i>, I, 73, <i>Tenth Proposition, Note</i>. It is the opposite of the intellect which "analyzes and divides the component parts of things, it forms abstract ideas of them, represents them in their true form as well as in their causal relations, derives from one object a great many facts, which—for the intellect—totally differ from each other, just as two human individuals appear different to the imagination; it distinguishes that which is the property of the genus from that which is peculiar to the individual,—and no proof is correct unless founded on the former; the intellect further determines whether certain qualities of a thing are essential or non-essential. <i>Imagination</i> has none of these functions. It only perceives the individual, the compound in that aggregate condition in which it presents itself to the senses; or it combines things which exist separately, joins some of them together, and represents them all as one body or as a force of the body. Hence it is that some imagine a man with a horse's head, or with wings, etc. This is called a fiction, a phantasm; it is a thing to which nothing in the actual world corresponds. Nor can <i>imagination</i> in any way obtain a purely immaterial image of an object, however abstract the form of the image may be. <i>Imagination</i> yields, therefore, no test for the reality of a thing." Further (<i>ibid.</i> II, 36) it is stated that part of the functions of the <i>imagination</i> is to retain impressions by the senses, to combine them, and chiefly to form images. The most perfect developement of the imaginative faculty results in prophecy. See <i>infra</i>, p. 47, and n. 3.</i> 
In this regard, the <i>Mutakallimun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Mutakallimun</i> were a sect of dogmatic or religious philosophers who tried to harmonize Mohammedan theology with Aristotelian philosophy. Starting with the "word of God" (<i>kalām</i>, Λόγος), as contained in the Koran, they endeavored to reconcile revelation with philosophy. I. T., in his <i>Glossary of Strange Words</i>, harshly criticizes them as "a sect of pseudoscientists without wisdom." T. J. De Boer says of their system of philosophy, "An assertion, expressed in logical or dialectic fashion, whether verbal or written, was called by the Arabs,—generally, but more particularly in religious teaching—<i>Kalam</i> (Λόγος), and those who advanced such assertions were called <i>Mutakallimun</i>. The name was transferred from the individual assertion to the entire system, and it covered also the introductory, elementary observations on Method,—and so on. Our best designation for the science of the <i>Kalam</i> is 'Theological Dialectics' or simply 'Dialectics', and in what follows we may translate <i>Mutakallimun</i> by 'Dialecticians'," <i>Geschichte der Philosophie im Islam</i>, Stuttgart, 1901, p. 43 ff.; Eng. ed., London, 1903, pp. 42-43. To M. we are indebted for a knowledge of the details of the system of the <i>Mutakallimun</i>, which he describes in a masterly way in his famous attack on the <i>Kalam</i> (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 71—76). He is vehemently opposed to them, not because of the views they held in regard to the universe and God, many of which coincided with his own, but on account of the method they pursued in arriving at their conclusions. On the <i>Mutakallimun</i>, and the Kalam, see Yehudah ha-Levi, <i>Cuzari</i>, c. V; Munk, <i>Mélanges</i>, pp. 311-312, 318 ff.; idem, article <i>Arabes</i>, in <i>Dictionnaire des Sciences philosophiques</i>; idem, <i>Notice sur R. Saadia Gaôn</i>, p. 156 ff.; idem, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 335, n. 2; Steinschneider, <i>Heb. Lit.</i>, p. 117; idem, <i>HUb.</i>, p. 415; Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, see index; M. Gutmann, <i>Das Religionsphil. Syst. d. Mutakallimun nach der Berichte des Maimun</i>, Leipzig, 1885; Ludwig Stein, in <i>AGPh.</i>, vol. XI, pp. 330-334; Schreiner, <i>Der Kalâm in der jüdischen Literatur</i>, Berlin, 1895; S. Horovitz, in <I>ZDMG</I>, 57, p. 177 ff.; I. Goldziher, <i>Vorlesungen über den Islam</i>, (Heidelberg, 1910), p. 100 f.; 127 f.; 129; 172 f.; 177 f.; etc.</i> have fallen into grievous and pernicious error, as a result of which their false theories form the corner-stone of a sophistical system which divides things into the <i>necessary</i>, the <i>possible</i>, and the <i>impossible</i>; so that they believe, and have led others to believe, that all creations of the imagination are possible, not having in mind, as we have stated, that this faculty may attribute existence to that which cannot possibly exist.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 73, <i>Tenth Proposition</i>, in which M. describes the theory of <i>admissibility</i> of the <i>Mutakallimun</i>, which forms the principal support of their doctrine (ההקדמה העשירית היא זאת ההעברה אשר יזכרהו וזהו עמור חכמת המדברים). Everything conceived by the imagination, they maintain, is admitted as <i>possible</i>. Cf., also, <i>ibid.</i>, I, 49; III, 15. See Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, pp. 12-13; Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 400, n. 2.</i>
The <i>appetitive</i> is that faculty by which a man desires, or loathes a thing, and from which there arise the following activities: the pursuit of an object or flight from it, inclination and avoidance, anger and affection, fear and courage, cruelty and compassion, love and hate, and many other similar psychic qualities.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">המקרים הנפשיים, <i>psychic accidents</i>. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 51. "It is a self evident fact that the attribute is not inherent in the object to which it is ascribed, but it is superadded to its essence, and is consequently an accident." See, also, <i>ibid.</i>, I, 73. <i>Fourth Proposition</i>. With M.'s description of the appetitive faculty compare that of al-Farabi, in התחלות הנמצאות, p. 2:והמעוררת היא אשר בה יהיה ההתעוררת האנושית כשיבקש הדבר או שיברח ממנו, או שיתעבהו או שימאסהו, או שירחיקהו, ובו יהיה השנאה והאהבה, והריעות והאיבה, והיראה והבטחון, והכעס והרצון, והאכזריות והרחמנות ושאר מקרי הנפש.</i> All parts of the body are subservient to these activities, as the ability of the hand to grasp, that of the foot to walk, that of the eye to see, and that of the heart to make one bold or timid. Similarily, the other members of the body, whether external or internal, are instruments of the appetitive faculty.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 46.: הכלים כולם באמת אחד הנראה מהם והפנימי כולם כלים לפעולת הנפש המתחלפות וכ׳. All the organs of the body are employed in the various actions of the soul. Cf. Aristotle, <i>De Anima</i>, III, 10, ed. Hicks, pp. 152 and 153.</i>
<i>Reason</i>, that faculty peculiar to man, enables him to understand, reflect, acquire knowledge of the sciences, and to discriminate between proper and improper actions.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Millot ha-Higgayon</i>, c. XIV (beg.): "The word <i>dibbur</i> as used by former philosophers of cultured nations, is a homonym having three significations. In the first place, it is used to designate that power peculiar to man by which he forms conceptions, acquires a knowledge of the sciences, and differentiates between the proper and the improper. This is called the reasoning faculty or soul." Cf. Ibn Daud, <i>Emunah Ramah</i>, I, 6.</i> Its functions are partly practical and partly <i>speculative</i> (theoretical), the <i>practical</i> being, in turn, either <i>mechanical</i> or <i>intellectual</i>. By means of the <i>speculative</i> power, man knows things as they really are, and which, by their nature, are not subject to change. These are called the sciences<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, VI, 3: "What science is is plain from the following considerations, if one is to speak accurately, instead of being led away by resemblances. For we all conceive that what we scientifically know cannot be otherwise than it is … So, then, whatever comes within the the range of science <i>is</i> by necessity, and therefore eternal—because all things are so which exist necessarily—and all eternal things are without beginning, and indestructible.”</i> in general. The mechanical power is that by which the arts, such as architecture, agriculture, medicine, and navigation are acquired.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Millot ha-Higgayon</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>: והשם מלאכה אצל הקדומים שם משתף יפילו על כל חכמה עיונית ויפילוהו גם כן על כל המעשים המלאכתים, ויקראו כל חכמה מחכמת הפילוסופיא מלאכה עיונית, ויקראו כל אחת מהנגרות והחצבות ומה שדומה להן מלאכה מעשית. Cf., also, <i>Eth. Nic.</i> VI, 4, on “Art.”</i> The intellectual power is that by which one, when he intends to do an act, reflects upon what he has premeditated, considers the possibility of performing it, and, if he thinks it possible, decides how it should be done.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">With M.’s definition of the <i>rational faculty</i> compare that of al-Farabi (התחלות הגמצאות, p. 2): והכח המדבר הוא אשר בו יאחוז האדם החכמות והמלאכות. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 47, n. 4; Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, p. 398, and note 60. On this faculty and its functions, see Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, pp. 14-29; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, pp. 49-51, and Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, p. 7, n. 1. The following scheme will elucidate the divisions of the functions of the <i>rational faculty</i>, according to M.  <i>Reason</i> (הנפש המדברת, הכח הדבור, הכח השכלי; Ar. אלנאטק) <i>Practical</i> (מעשי; Ar. עמלי)<i>Theoretical</i> (מלאכה עיונית, עיוני; Ar. נטרי) <i>Mechanical</i> (מלאכת מחשבות מלאכת מעשית,; Ar. מהני)<i>Intellectual</i> (מחשבי; Ar. פכרי)<i>Sciences</i> (חכמות; Ar. עלום) <i>Architecture</i>, etc.</i> This is all we have deemed it necessary to say in this regard concerning the soul. 
Know, however, that the soul, whose faculties and parts we have described above, and which is a unit, may be compared to matter in that it likewise has a <i>form</i>, which is <i>reason</i>. If the form (reason) does not communicate its impression to the soul, then the disposition existing in the soul to receive that form is of no avail, and exists to no purpose, as Solomon says, “Also in the want of knowledge in the soul there is nothing good”.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. XIX, 2.</i> This means that if a soul has not attained a form but remains without intelligence, its existence is not a good one.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">M. considers <i>matter</i> and <i>form</i> in the Aristotelian sense. The <i>principia</i> of all existing, transient things are <i>matter, form</i>, and the <i>absence of a particular form</i> (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 17). <i>Matter</i> (מאדה̈, חומר, ἡ ὔλη) consists of the underlying, basic substance of a thing, which has a potential but not a real existence, its true nature consisting in the property of never being without a disposition to receive a <i>form</i> (<i>ibid</i>., III, 8). Every substance is endowed with a <i>form</i> (צורה̈, צורה, το εἴδος), or incoporeal being (<i>ibid.</i>, II, 12), by means of which that substance is what it is. That is, through <i>form</i> that which is potentially in existence comes into real existence (Aristotle, <i>Physics</i>, II, 3; <i>Metaphysics</i>, I, 3), and upon it the reality and essence of a thing depend. When the <i>form</i> is destroyed, the thing’s existence is terminated (<i>Moreh</i>, III, 69). As soon as a substance has received a certain <i>form</i>, the <i>absence</i> or <i>privation</i> (אלעדם, ההעדר) of that <i>form</i> which it has just received has ceased, and it is replaced by the <i>privation</i> of another <i>form</i>, and so on with all possible <i>forms</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, I, 17). Cf. Aristotle, <i>Physics</i>, I, 5-7; also רוח חן, c. IX. <i>Matter</i> is constantly seeking to cast off the <i>form</i> it has in order to receive another, and so <i>form</i> does not remain permanently in a substance. M. aptly compares <i>matter</i> to a faithless wife, who, although not being without a husband, continually seeks another man in his place (<i>Moreh</i>, III, 8). The soul, according to Aristotle, is the <i>form</i> of the body which, as <i>matter</i>, has merely a potentiality for existence. See <i>supra</i>, p. 37, n. 2. He says, “It must follow, then, that soul is substance in the sense that it is the <i>form</i> of a natural body having in it the capacity of life.” (<i>De Anima</i>, II, 1, ed. Hicks, pp. 48 and 49). M. agrees with this, and says in <i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, IV, 8. “The soul of all flesh is its <i>form</i> which God has given it.” The human soul, however, needs in turn a <i>form</i> in order that it may become a reality. The soul’s <i>form</i> is, as M. states here, <i>reason</i> (עקל, שכל, νους), or more definitely the <i>acquired reason</i> (שכל הנקנה; see Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, c. III; also p. 59, note E; p. 65 ff., especially p. 66), and it this that makes man what he is. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 7. “It is acknowledged that a man who does not possess this <i>form</i>, ....... is no man.”</i> However, this is not the place for us to discuss such problems as that of <i>form</i>, <i>matter</i>, and the number of different kinds of <i>intelligence</i>, and their means of acquisition;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Moreh</i>, I, 68; Scheyer, <i>ibid.</i>, c. II, c. III, and especially Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, pp. 304-308, note.</i> nor is it necessary for what we have to say concerning the subject of ethics, but is more appropriately to be discussed in the <i>Book on Prophecy</i>, which we mention (elsewhere).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Perek Helek</i>, <i>Seventh Article of Faith</i> (Holzer, <i>Dogmenlehre</i>, p. 24; I. Friedlaender, <i>Arabic Writings of M.</i>, p. 32), M. mentions his intention of writing a <i>Book on Prophecy</i> and a <i>Book of Harmony</i> (ולפיכך אניח אותו למקומו אם בפירוש הדרשות אשר יעדתי או בספר הנבואה שאני מתעסק בו וכ׳), for the purpose of elucidating the exoteric lessons of the prophets and of the <i>Midrashim</i>. After having started, however, he abandoned this intention, and later incorporated the material for the <i>Book on Prophecy</i> in the <i>Moreh</i>, Part II, in chapters 32 to 48, and that of the <i>Book of Harmony</i> (ספר ההשואה) he scattered throughout the <i>Moreh</i>. See <i>Moreh</i>, I, <i>Introd.</i>; Bloch, <i>Charakteristik und Inhaltsangabe des Moreh Nebuchim</i>, in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I, pp. 7, 8 and 15.</i> Now I conclude this chapter, and begin the next.

Chapter 2

<b>Chapter II</b> <br><b>Concerning the transgressions of the faculties of the soul and the designation of those faculties which are the seat of the virtues and the vices</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of the contents of this chapter, see Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, p. 102 ff.; Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr.</i>, XLVI p. 10; and Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 54 ff. On the title, see Hebrew text, c. II, p. 14, n. 1 and 2.</i> <br>Know that transgressions and observances of the Law have their origin only in two of the faculties of the soul, namely, the <i>sensitive</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In ascribing transgressions and observances to the faculty of <i>sensation</i>, M. differs from Aristotle who asserts that <i>sense</i> is the originating cause of no moral action, since brutes, too, are possessed of <i>sense</i>, but are in no ways partakers of moral actions (<i>Eth. Nic.</i>, VI, 2). M., however, draws a distinction between the sensitive faculty of man and that of animals. <i>Sensation</i> as applied to man and beast is a homonymous term, the sensitive faculty of man being different from that of all other animate beings. See <i>supra</i>, c. I, pp. 39—40.</i> and the <i>appetitive</i>, and that to these two faculties alone are to be ascribed all transgressions and observances. The faculties of <i>nutrition</i> and <i>imagination</i> do not give rise to observance or transgression, for in connection with neither is there any conscious or voluntary act. That is, man cannot consciously suspend their functions, nor can he curtail any one of their activities. The proof of this is that the functions of both these faculties, the nutritive and the imaginative, continue to be operative when one is asleep, which is not true of any other of the soul’s faculties.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">M. differs from al-Farabi who ascribes participation in moral and immoral acts to all the faculties of the soul (התחלות הגמצאת, p. 35 ff.). The latter, however, does not consider <i>nutrition</i> to be one of the faculties. Abraham ibn Daud, including <i>nutrition</i> among the soul’s faculties, allots to each a cardinal virtue (<i>Emunah Ramah</i>, III, p. 110). Aristotle excludes the <i>imagination</i> as one of the faculties directly affecting the performance of virtues, but considers it as producing movement through the agency of <i>appetency</i> (<i>De Anima</i>, III, 10). M., later, departs somewhat from the view he holds in the <i>Peraḳim</i> regarding the <i>imagination</i>, and, in agreement with Aristotle, considers it to be bound up indirectly, through the <i>appetitive</i> faculty, with conscious activity (see Scheyer, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 98, and 105). This is the sense of the passage in <i>Moreh</i>, II, 4, where he states that animate beings move either by <i>instinct</i> (טבע considered equivalent to כח המתעורר), or by <i>reason</i>. <i>Instinct</i> he defines as the intention of an animate being to approach something agreeable, or to shun something disagreeable, as, for instance, to approach water on account of thirst, or to avoid the sun on account of its heat. He, then, goes on to say that it makes no difference whether the thing really exists or is imaginary, since the <i>imagination</i> of something agreeable or of something disagreeable likewise causes the animate being to move (כי בדמיון מה שהוא כנגד ומה שיאות יתנועע ג״כ החי). Furthermore, in <i>Moreh</i>, II, 12, he declares that all defects in speech or character are either the direct or indirect work of the <i>imagination</i> (כי כל חסרון בדבר או במדות הוא פעל הדמיון או נמשך אחר פעלו). In regard to prophecy, M. lays great stress upon the <i>imagination</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, II, 35), considering prophecy to be the most perfect development of the imaginative faculty. During sleep this faculty is the same as when it receives prophecy, except that when asleep the <i>imagination</i> is not fully developed, and has not reached its highest perfection. See <i>supra</i>, c. I, p. 41, n. 1.</i>  As regards the <i>rational</i> faculty, uncertainty prevails (among philosophers)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 55, n. 1.</i>, but I maintain that observance and transgression may also originate in this faculty, in so far as one believes a true or a false doctrine, though no action which may be designated as an observance or a transgression results therefrom.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, II, 4, “But even a being that is endowed with the faculty of forming an idea, and possesses a soul with the faculty of moving, does not change its place on each occasion that it forms an idea; <i>for an idea alone does not produce motion</i>, as has been explained in (Aristotle’s) <i>Metaphysics</i>. We can easily understand this, when we consider how often we form ideas of certain things, yet do not move towards them, though we are able to do so; it is only when the desire arises for the thing imagined that we move in order to obtain it.” Cf. <i>De Anima</i> III, 10. The same thought is expressed in <i>Eth. Nic.</i> VI, 2, “And so since moral virtue is a disposition exercising choice, and choice is will consequent on deliberation, the reason must be true and the will right to constitute good choice, and what the reason affirms the will must pursue… <i>But operation of the intellect by itself moves nothing</i>, only when directed to a certain result—i.e. exercised in moral action...” See Scheyer, <i>ibid</i>., p. 103—104; and Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 56, n. 2.</i> Consequently, as I said above, these two faculties (the sensitive and the appetitive) alone really produce transgressions and observances.
Now, as for the virtues, they are of two kinds, <i>moral</i> and <i>intellectual</i>, with the corresponding two classes of vices.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, (ἀρται ἠϑικα and διανοιτιτικαί) I, 11 (end); II, 1; VI, 2; <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, II, 1; <i>Millot ha-Higgayon</i>, c. XIV (מעלות המדות מעלות דבוריות).</i> The intellectual virtues belong to the rational faculty. They are (1) <i>wisdom</i>, which is the knowledge of the direct and indirect causes of things based on a previous realization of the existence of those things, the causes of which have been investigated;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Wisdom (חכמה), according to M., is used of four different things (<i>Moreh</i>, III, 54). It denotes (1) the knowledge of those truths which lead to the knowledge of God, (2) the knowledge of any workmanship, (3) the acquisition of moral principles, and (4) cunning and subtlety. In <i>Moreh</i>, I, 69, where M. demonstrates that God is the <i>Primal Cause</i>, in agreement with Aristotle (<i>Physics</i>, II, 7), he asserts that everything owes its origin to four causes, the substance, the form, the <i>agens</i> (פועל), and the final cause (תכלית). These are sometimes direct (קרובים), and sometimes indirect (רחוקים), though each in itself is a <i>cause</i> (עלה or סבה, corresponding to Ar. علة‎ and سبب‎; αἰτία, αἴτιον. Cf. Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 313, n. 1.)</i> (2) <i>reason</i>, consisting of (a) <i>inborn, theoretical reason</i>, that is, axioms,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>first impressions</i> (המושכלות הראשונות; Ar. מעקולאת אלאול; ἀρχαι τῶν αποδεικτῶν αξιώματα, <i>intelligibilia prima</i>), which are fundamental principles or axioms that would need no proof even though man were left in his primitive state (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 51), and which are explained by common sense. There are four kinds of knowledge which need no demonstration, one of them being the knowledge of axioms, as, for instance, that the whole is greater than a part, that two is an even number, that two things equal to the same thing are equal to each other (<i>Millot ha-Higgayon</i>, c. XIV), and that one cannot both affirm and deny a thing. See Scheyer, note to <i>Moreh</i>, I, 51. Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, VI, 6 on <i>Intuitive Apprehension</i>; Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, p. 16—17; and Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 128, n. 3.</i> (b) <i>the acquired intellect</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For the definition and description of the <i>acquired intellect</i> (שכל הנקנה or שכל הנקנה הנאצל; Ar. אלעקל אלמסתפאר, νοῦς ἐπικτητος), see <i>Moreh</i>, I, 72; I. T. <i>Glossary of Strange Words</i>, <i>sub voce</i> (under ס); Scheyer, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 17—19, 39—93; Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, pp. 307—308, note; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 57, n. 1; Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, p. 11, n. 1; and idem, <i>Mûsa b. Maimûns eschatologische Gedanken</i>, p. 13, etc.</i> which we need not discuss here, and (c) <i>sagacity</i> and <i>intellectual cleverness</i>, which is the ability to perceive quickly, and to grasp an idea without delay, or in a very short time. The vices of this faculty are the antitheses or the opposites of these virtues. <br>Moral virtues belong only to the appetitive faculty to which that of sensation in this connection is merely subservient.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Scheyer, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 104—105, and Rosin, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 57, n. 4.</i> The virtues of this faculty are very numerous, being moderation, [i.e. fear of sin], liberality, honesty, meekness, humility, contentedness, [which the Rabbis call “wealth”, when they say, “Who is truly wealthy? He who is contented with his lot”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, IV, 1.</i>], courage, [faith-fulness], and other virtues akin to these. The vices of this faculty consist of a deficiency or of an exaggeration of these qualities. <br>As regards the faculties of nutrition and imagination, it cannot be said that they have vices or virtues, but that the nutritive functions work properly or improperly; as, for instance, when one says that a man's digestion is good or bad, or that one's imagination is confused or clear. This does not mean, however, that they have virtues or vices. So much we wished to discuss in this chapter.

<b>Chapter III</b> <br><b>Concerning the Diseases of the Soul</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of the contents of this chapter, see Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr.</i>, XLVI pp. 10—11; and Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 77 ff. A short summary is contained in <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 1.</i> <br>The ancients<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Foreword</i>, p. 35 n. 3.</i> maintained that the soul, like the body, is subject to good health and illness. The soul’s healthful state is due to its condition, and that of its faculties, by which it constantly does what is right, and performs what is proper, while the illness of the soul is occasioned by its condition, and that of its faculties, which results in its constantly doing wrong, and performing actions that are improper.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Pirḳe Mosheh</i>, in <i>Ḳobeẓ</i>, II, 20b, אמר משה מן הידוע מאמר הפילוסופים שיש לנפש בריאות וחולי וכ׳.</i> The science of medicine investigates the health of the body. Now, just as those, who are physically ill, imagine that, on account of their vitiated tastes, the sweet is bitter and the bitter is sweet—and likewise fancy the wholesome to be unwholesome—and just as their desire grows stronger, and their enjoyment increases for such things as dust, coal, very acidic and sour foods, and the like—which the healthy loathe and refuse, as they are not only not beneficial even to the healthy, but possibly harmful—so those whose souls are ill, that is the wicked and the morally perverted, imagine that the bad is good, and that the good is bad. The wicked man, moreover, continually longs for excesses which are really pernicious, but which, on account of the illness of his soul, he considers to be good.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Aristotle, in discussing <i>Pleasures</i> (<i>Eth. Nic.</i>, X, 5), says, “Yet in the case of human creatures they (pleasures) differ not a little; for the very same things please some and pain others; and what are painful and hateful to some are pleasant to and liked by others. The same is the case with sweet things; the same will not seem so to the man in a fever as to him who is in health; nor will the invalid and the person in robust health have the same notion of warmth. The same is the case with other things also.” Cf., also, <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 1, “To those who are diseased the bitter tastes sweet and the sweet bitter. Some sick people, moreover, crave and long for food that is unfit to eat, such as dust and charcoal, spurning food that is beneficial, such as bread and meat, according to the intensity of their illness. Likewise, people whose souls are diseased desire and love evil characteristics, and hate the moral path, being loathe to pursue it, since, on account of their illness, it is very difficult for them to do so. Thus, Isaiah says of such people, ‘Wo unto those that say of the evil it is good, and of the good it is evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter’ (V, 20). Concerning them it is also said that ‘(they are those) who leave the path of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness’ (Prov. II, 13).”</i> 
Likewise, just as when people, unacquainted with the science of medicine, realize that they are sick, and consult a physician, who tells them what they must do, forbidding them to partake of that which they imagine beneficial, and prescribing for them things which are unpleasant and bitter, in order that their bodies may become healthy, and that they may again choose the good and spurn the bad, so those whose souls become ill should consult the sages, the moral physicians, who will advise them against indulging in those evils which they (the morally ill) think are good, so that they may be healed by that art of which I shall speak in the next chapter, and through which the moral qualities are restored to their normal condition. 
But, if he who is morally sick be not aware of his illness, imagining that he is well, or, being aware of it, does not seek a remedy, his end will be similar to that of one, who, suffering from bodily ailment, yet continuing to indulge himself, neglects to be cured, and who in consequence surely meets an untimely death. Those who know that they are in a diseased state, but nevertheless yield to their inordinate passions, are described in the truthful Law which quotes their own words, “Though I walk in the stubborness of my heart, in order that the indulgence of the passions may appease the thirst for them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Dt. XXIX, 18.</i> This means that, intending to quench the thirst, it is, on the contrary, intensifed. He who is ignorant of his illness is spoken of in many places by Solomon, who says, “The way of the fool is straight in his own eyes, but he who hearkeneth unto counsel is wise”.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. XII, 15.</i> This means that he who listens to the counsel of the sage is wise, for the sage teaches him the way that is actually right, and not the one that he (the morally ill) erroneously considers to be such. Solomon also says, “There is many a way which seemeth even before a man; but its ends are ways unto death”.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, XIV, 12.</i> Again, in regard to these who are morally ill, in that they do not know what is injurious from that which is beneficial, he says, “The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know against what they stumble.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, IV, 19. Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 1, “What is the remedy for those whose souls are diseased? Let them consult the sages who are the physicians of the soul, who will cure their disease by teaching them those characteristics by which they may return to the moral path, and recognize their evil traits. Concerning those who do not seek the sages in order to be cured, Solomon says, ‘wisdom and instruction fools despise’ (Prov. I, 7)”. The conception of a spiritual healing originated neither with Aristotle nor with M. There are many biblical passages based on such a comparison with the healing art, as Jer. III, 22: ארפה משובותיכם; Hos. XIV, 5: ארפא משובתם Ps. XLI, 5: ארפאה נפשי כי חטאתי לך, etc. Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 78, n. 4, refers to similar passages in Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic literature.</i> The art of healing the diseases of the soul will, however, form the subject-matter of the fourth chapter.

Chapter 4

<b>Chapter IV</b> <br><b>Concerning the Cure of the Diseases of the Soul</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To this chapter, in which the Aristotelian doctrine of the <i>Mean</i> (Μεσότες, balance) is applied to Jewish ethics, M. later supplemented <i>H. Deot</i>, I, 1—7; II, 2, 3, 7; and III, 1. Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i> II, 5—9; III, 8—14; IV. Although M. follows Aristotle in defining virtue as a state intermediate between two extremes, the <i>too little</i> and the <i>too much</i>, he still remains on Jewish ground, as there are biblical and Talmudical passages expressing such a thought. Such passages are Prov. IV, 26, "Balance well the track of thy foot, and let all thy ways be firmly right"; ibid., XXX, 8, "Neither poverty nor riches give thou unto me"; Eccles. VII, 16, "Be not righteous overmuch; neither show thyself overwise" (quoted in <i>H. Deot</i>, III, 1); etc. In <i>Moreh</i>, I, 32, M. interprets "neither show thyself overwise" and "To eat too much honey is not good" (Prov. XXV, 27) as a warning against attempting to exceed the limits of one's intellectual powers, and as an admonition to keep knowledge within bounds. In the Palestinian Talmud (<i>Ḥagigah</i>, II, 77 a <i>bot.</i>), there is found an interesting passage which sums up well the thought of this chapter, and it is curious that M. did not refer to it. It reads, "The ways of the Torah may be likened to two roads, on one of which fire and on the other snow is encountered. If one go along one path, he will be burned to death, and if he proceed along the other, he will perish in the snow. What, then, should one do? He must go between the extremes." A similar passage is found in <i>Tosefta Ḥagigah</i> 2 (cf. <i>Yer. Ḥagigah</i>, p. 20), "They make it incumbent upon man to go between the extremes, and not to incline to this side or to that." See, also, <i>Soṭah</i>, 5a, "he (the scholar) in whom there is pride deserves excommunication, and also he in whom there is no pride at all." For a discussion of Aristotle's doctrine of the Μεσότες, see Grant, <i>The Ethics of Aristotle</i>, vol. I, pp. 251—262. For that of M., see Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr</i>, XLVI, pp. 11—12; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 26, n. 1; p. 79 ff.; Lazarus, Ethik, vol. I, <i>Abhang</i> XIV (Eng. ed. vol. I, p. 273 f.); Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, Introd., pp. XIII—XIV; Yellin and Abrahams, <i>Maimonides</i>, pp. 78—83; Cohen, <i>Charakteristik</i>, etc., in Moses ben Maimon, I, p. III ff.; A. Löwenthal in <i>JE</i>., II, p. 101; Lewis, in <i>Aspects of the Hebrew Genius</i>, (London, 1910) pp. 82—83. On the mean in Jewish religious philosophy, see Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, pp. 10, 12, 14, 19, 24; H. Malter, <i>JQR</i> (new series) vol. I, p. 160, n. 15.</i> <br>Good deeds are such as are equibalanced,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">השױם, <i>the equidistant</i> (equivalent to the Aristotelian ίσον, <i>the exactly</i> <i>equal, the normal,</i> or <i>equibalanced</i>); cf. <i>Moreh</i>, II, 39, “It is clear, then, that the Law is normal (משוױה) in this sense; for it contains the words, ‘Just statutes and judgments’ (Deut. IV, 8); but ‘just’ is here identical with ‘equibalanced’ (שוױם).”</i> maintaining the mean between two equally bad extremes, the <i>too much</i> and the <i>too little</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">הממוצעים, <i>the mean</i> (Aristotelian μέσον). <i>Nic. Eth.</i>, II, 6, “By an objective mean, I understand that which is equidistant from the two given extremes, and which is one and the same to all, and by a mean relatively to the person, I understand that which is neither too much nor too little.”</i> Virtues are psychic conditions and dispositions which are mid-way between two reprehensible extremes, one of which is characterized by an exaggeration, the other by a deficiency.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i>, “Virtue, then, is a disposition of the moral purpose in relative balance, which is determined by a standard, according as the thoughtful man would determine. It is a middle state between two faulty ones, in the way of excess on one side, and defect on the other; and it is so, moreover, because the faulty states on one side fall short of, and those on the other side exceed, what is right, both in the case of the emotions and the actions; but virtue finds, and, when found, adopts the mean.” Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, I, 4, and II, 2.</i> Good deeds are the product of these dispositions. To illustrate, abstemiousness is a disposition which adopts a mid-course between inordinate passion and total insensibility to pleasure. Abstemiousness, then, is a proper rule of conduct, and the psychic disposition which gives rise to it is an ethical quality; but inordinate passion, the extreme of excess, and total insensibility to enjoyment, the extreme of deficiency<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">הקצה הראשון, is <i>the extreme of excess</i> (Aristotle's ὐπερβολή), and הקצה האחרון <i>the extreme of deficiency</i> (ἔλλειψις). Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, I, 5; III, 1; ואתרחק לצד האחרון עד שלא יאכל בשר ולא ישתה יין וכ׳, where צד האחרון clearly means the extreme of the <i>too little</i>.</i>, are both absolutely pernicious. The psychic dispositions, from which these two extremes, inordinate passion and insensibility, result—the one being an exaggeration, the other a deficiency—are alike classed among moral imperfections.
Likewise, liberality is the mean between sordidness and extravagence; courage, between recklessness and cowardice; dignity, between haughtiness and loutishness<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Hebrew text, c. IV, pp. 19—20, n. 17. On the gloss והגחת ממוצעת וכ׳, introduced here in some Mss. and edd., see Hebrew text, c. IV, p. 20, note. This gloss seems to go back to <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 7, “He that is as he should be may be called friendly, and his mean state friendliness; he that exceeds, if it be without any interested motive, somewhat too complaisant, if with such motive, a flatterer; he that is deficient and in all instances unpleasant, quarrelsome and cross."</i>; humility, between arrogance and self-abasement; contentedness, between avarice and slothful indifference; and magnificence, between meanness and profusion. [Since definite terms do not exist in our language with which to express these latter qualities, it is necessary to explain their content, and tell what the philosophers meant by them. A man is called magnificent whose whole intention is to do good to others by personal service, by money, or advice, and with all his power, but without meanwhile bringing suffering or disgrace upon himself. That is the medium line of conduct. The mean man is one who does not want others to succeed in anything, even though he himself may not thereby suffer any loss, hardship, or injury. That is the one extreme. The profuse man, on the contrary, is one who willingly performs the above-mentioned deeds, in spite of the fact that thereby he brings upon himself great injury, or disgrace, terrible hardship, or considerable loss. That is the other extreme.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The virtue which I. T. explains here, owing to the inadequacy of the Hebrew terms, is the one which Aristotle calls <i>magnificence</i> (I. T.'s טוב לב). The excess is <i>want of taste</i> or <i>vulgar profusion</i> (יתרון טוב הלבב), and the defect <i>paltriness</i> (הגבלה). See <i>Eth. Nic., loc. cit.</i> According to Aristotle, <i>magnificence</i> is a higher kind of liberality (נדיבות), and consists of the spending of money on a grand scale, with taste and propriety. It is prompted by a desire for what is noble, concerning itself with the services of religion, public works, and so forth. The vulgar man, whose object is ostentation, offends with excessive splendor, while the mean man, on the other hand, through timidity and constant fear of expense, even though he does expend large amounts, mars the whole effect by some petty characteristic of meanness (<i>ibid.</i>, IV, 2). I. T. has, accordingly, incorrectly explained the terms גבלה ,לב מוב, and יתרון טוב הלבב.</i>] Gentleness is the mean between irascibility and insensibility to shame and disgrace; and modesty, between impudence and shamefacedness.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>H. Deot</i>, I, and II for a list and discussion of the virtues. Aristotle mentions and discussess the following virtues in <i>Eth. Nic.</i>; courage (II, 7, and III, 6-9), perfected self-mastery or temperance (II, 7, and III, 10-11), liberality (II, 7, and IV, 1), magnificence (II, 7 and IV, 2), greatness of soul (II, 7, and IV, 3), love of honor (II, 7, and IV, 4), gentleness (II, 7, and IV, 5), friendliness (II, 7, and IV, 6), truthfulness (II, 7. and IV, 7), jocularity or liveliness (II, 7, and IV, 8), and modesty (II, 7, and IV, 9). Cf., also, <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, II, 3, where a formal table is given contaning fourteen virtues and their respective pairs of extremes; and <i>Mag. Mor.</i> I, 20 ff.</i> [The explanation of these latter terms, gleaned from the sayings of our sages (may their memory be blessed!) seems to be this. In their opinion, a modest man is one who is very bashful, and therefore modesty is the mean. This we gather from their saying, "A shamefaced man cannot learn".<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, II, 5.</i> They also assert, "A modest man is worthy of Paradise"<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, V, 20.</i>, but they do not say this of a shamefaced man. Therefore, I have thus arranged them."<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Hebrew text, c. IV, p. 21, n. 16.</i>] So it is with the other qualities. One does not necessarily have to use conventional terms for these qualities, if only the ideas are clearly fixed in the mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Aristotle also mentions the paucity of terms to express the nice distinctions he makes (<i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 7).</i>
It often happens, however, that men err as regards these qualities, imagining that one of the extremes is good, and is a virtue. Sometimes, the extreme of the <i>too much</i> is considered noble, as when temerity is made a virtue, and those who recklessly risk their lives are hailed as heroes. Thus, when people see a man, reckless to the highest degree, who runs deliberately into danger, intentionally tempting death, and escaping only by mere chance, they laud such a one to the skies, and say that he is a hero. At other times, the opposite extreme, the <i>too little</i>, is greatly esteemed, and the coward<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Better, "the apathetic"; see Hebrew text, c. IV, p. 21, n. 27.</i> is considered a man of forbearance; the idler, as being a person of a contented disposition; and he, who by the dullness of his nature is callous to every joy, is praised as a man of moderation, [that is, one who eschews sin]. In like manner, profuse liberality and extreme lavishness are erroneously extolled as excellent characteristics.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 9, "for we ourselves sometimes praise those who are defective in this feeling (anger), and we call them gentle; at another, we term the hot-tempered manly and spirited."</i> This is, however, an absolutely mistaken view, for the really praiseworthy is the medium course of action to which every one should strive to adhere, always weighing his conduct carefully, so that he may attain the proper mean.
Know, moreover, that these moral excellences or defects cannot be acquired, or implanted in the soul, except by means of the frequent repetition of acts resulting from these qualities, which, practised during a long period of time, accustoms us to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yoma</i>, 86 b; <i>Sotah</i>, 22a, "As soon as a man has committed a sin and repeated it, it becomes to him a permitted act".</i> If these acts performed are good ones, then we shall have gained a virtue; but if they are bad, we shall have acquired a vice. Since, however, no man is born with an innate virtue or vice, as we shall explain in Chapter VIII, and, as every one's conduct from childhood up is undoubtedly influenced by the manner of living of his relatives and countrymen,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, "VI, 1, "The natural disposition of the human mind occasions man to be influenced in his opinions and actions by those with whom he associates, and his conduct to be dependent on that of his friends and countrymen".</i> his conduct may be in accord with the rules of moderation; but, then again, it is possible that his acts may incline towards either extreme, as we have demonstrated, in which case, his soul becomes diseased.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">On the acquisition of virtues and vices, see <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 1—3; and <i>H. Deot</i>, I, 2, 7. See below c. VIII, p. 85ff.</i> 
In such a contingency, it is proper for him to resort to a cure, exactly as he would were his body suffering from an illness. So, just as when the equilibrium of the physical health is disturbed,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 2, "for excessive training impairs the strength as well as deficient; meat and drink, in like manner, in too great or too small quantities, impair the health; while in due proportion they cause increase, and preserve it".</i> and we note which way it is tending in order to force it to go in exactly the opposite direction until it shall return to its proper condition, and, just as when the proper adjustment is reached, we cease this operation, and have recourse to that which will maintain the proper balance, in exactly the same way must we adjust the moral equilibrium.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 2. The same thought is expressed by Aristotle in <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 9. If we find ourselves at one of the faulty extremes, we must drag ourselves away in the opposite direction, for by bending ourselves a long way back from the erroneous extreme, allowing for the recoil, as when one straightens a crooked piece of timber, we shall at length arrive at the proper mean. Punishment of sin also, according to M., forces the culprit to the other extreme of the sin committed. Thus, if a man sin as regards property, he must spend his money liberally in the service of God; if he has indulged in sinful bodily enjoyments, he must chastise his body with fasting, privation, and the like. This practice should even extend itself to man's intellectual failings, which may cause him to believe some false doctrine, a fault that is to be remedied by turning one's thoughts entirely away from wordly affairs, and devoting them exclusively to intellectual exercises, and carefully reflecting upon those beliefs in which he should have faith (<i>Moreh</i>, III, 46). Compare with this Aristotle's theory as regards correction, according to which the remedies are of such a nature as to be the contraries of the ills they seek to cure (<i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 2).</i> Let us take, for example, the case of a man in whose soul there has developed a disposition [of great avarice] on account of which he deprives himself [of every comfort in life], and which, by the way, is one of the most detestable of defects, and an immoral act, as we have shown in this chapter. If we wish to cure this sick man, we must not command him merely [to practise] deeds of generosity, for that would be as ineffective as a physician trying to cure a patient consumed by a burning fever by administering mild medicines, which treatment would be inefficacious. We must, however, induce him to squander so often, and to repeat his acts of profusion so continuously until that propensity which was the cause of his avarice has totally disappeared. Then, when he reaches that point where he is about to become a squanderer, we must teach him to moderate his profusion, and tell him to continue with deeds of generosity, and to watch out with due care lest he relapse either into lavishness or niggardliness.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 2, "How shall he cure them (the moral ills)? The sages tell the wrathful man that if he is accustomed to scold and curse he should train himself never to give vent to these feelings, and that he should continue this course a long while, until he has eradicated wrath from his heart. If he is haughty let him train himself to be humble, let him clothe himself in ragged garments which humiliate those who wear them, and let him do similar acts, until he has uprooted his pride, and returned to the middle course which is the moral one; and, when he has done so, let him continue in it all his days. He should act in a similar way with all his characteristics. If he is far from the middle course, at one extreme, let him force himself to go to the other, and accustom himself fully to it, until he returns to the proper course, which is the medial trait as regards each characteristic”.</i> 
If, on the other hand, a man is a squanderer, he must be directed to practise strict economy, and to repeat acts of niggardliness. It is not necessary, however, for him to perform acts of avarice as many times as the mean man should those of profusion. This subtle point, which is a canon and secret of the science of medicine, tells us that it is easier for a man of profuse habits to moderate them to generosity, than it is for a miser to become generous. Likewise, it is easier for one who is apathetic [and eschews sin] to be excited to moderate enjoyment, than it is for one, burning with passion, to curb his desires. Consequently, the licentious man must be made to practise restraint more than the apathetic man should be induced to indulge his passions; and, similarly, the coward requires exposure to danger more frequently than the reckless man should be forced to cowardice. The mean man needs to practise lavishness to a greater degree than should be required of the lavish to practise meanness. This is a fundamental principle of the science of curing moral ills, and is worthy of remembrance.
On this account, the saintly ones<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>infra</i>, c. VI; and M.'s <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, V, 7. 11.</i> were not accustomed to cause their dispositions to maintain an exact balance between the two extremes, but deviated somewhat, by way of [caution and] restraint, now to the side of exaggeration, and now to that of deficiency. Thus, for instance, abstinence would incline to some degree towards excessive denial of all pleasures; valor would approach somewhat towards temerity; generosity to lavishness; modesty to extreme humility,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">M. departs from strict adherence to the Aristotelian doctrine of the mean, which Aristotle himself does, at times, and especially as regards the virtue of justice. M. states here that the deviation from the mean on the part of the saints was because of caution and restraint. Later, in <i>H. Deot</i>, I, 5, he expands this thought in drawing a distinction between the wise man (חכם) and the saint (חסיד). Wise men cling to the exact middle course, but “the early saints were accustomed to deviate in their characteristics from the middle course towards either one or the other extreme, now making one characteristic tend towards the extreme of deficiency, and now another towards that of excess. This is doing ‘more than the strict letter of the law demands’.” In regard to the two characteristics, pride and anger, M. states, in some instances, the Aristotelian view which considers the medium course the virtue, only to depart from it at other times, and, following the Bible and Talmud, considers the extreme the virtue. Thus, in this chapter, pride (גאוה) is the one extreme, self-abasement (שפלות הרוח) the other, and humility (ענוה), the mean, is the virtue; anger (כעס) is the excess, insensibility to shame and disgrace (העדר הרגשה חרפה ובוז) the deficiency, and mildness (סבלנות), the mean, is the virtue. In <i>H. Deot</i>, I, 4, the medium course (בינוני), likewise, in respect to anger, is designated as the virtue. Man should not be insensible to anger (ולא כמת שאינו מרגיש), although he should give vent to his wrath only at great provocation (ולא יכעוס אלא על דבר גדול). In his <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, IV, 4 (Rawicz, <i>Commentar</i>, pp. 78—80), and in <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 3, M. asserts, however, that excessive humility and complete absence of anger are the virtues, and not the medium course. The passage in <i>Deot</i> is as follows, “There are, however, some dispositions in regard to which it is wrong to pursue even a middle course, but the contrary extreme is to be embraced, as, for instance, in respect to pride. One does not follow the proper path by merely being humble. Man should be very humble and extremely meek. To this end, Scripture says of Moses, our master, that he was ‘very humble’ (Num. XII, 3), and not that he was simply humble. Therefore, the sages command us, ‘Be thou very humble’ (Abot, IV, 4), and say, furthermore, that all who are proud-hearted deny an important principle of our faith, for Scripture says, ‘Thy heart will become uplifted, and thou wilt forget the Lord thy God’ (Deut. VIII, 14), and they also say, ‘he who is presumptuous, even to a slight degree deserves excommunication’. In like manner, anger is a very bad characteristic; one should go to the opposite extreme and school himself to be without wrath, even as regards a matter at which it might seem proper to show anger....... The Rabbis of old said, ‘Whoever allows himself to be carried away by his wrath is like a worshipper of idols’ (<i>Nedarim</i>, 22a). Futhermore, they said, ‘If a wise man becomes angry, his wisdom forsakes him; if a prophet, his inspiration departs from him’ (<i>Pesaḥim</i>, 66b), and, ‘Those that abandon themselves to their angry passions do not deserve to live’ (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 113b). Therefore, they recommend total absence of anger, so that a man may thus train himself never to feel it, even at those things which naturally would provoke one to wrath. The proper course to pursue, and the way of the righteous, is that ‘they are insulted, but do not insult; they hear themselves reviled, and answer not; they do good from pure motives of love; they rejoice amidst their sufferings, and of them it is said, ‘Those that love him are like the sun going forth in its might’ (Judges V, 31, <i>Shabbat</i>, 38b)”. See Rosin, <i>Ethih</i>, p. 87, n. 5; Cohen, <i>Charakteristik</i>, in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I, pp. 112—116. See, however, <i>supra</i>, p. 54, note 1, for biblical and Talmudical passages which support the doctrine of the medium course.</i> and so forth. This is what the rabbis hinted at, in their saying, “Do more than the strict letter of the law demands.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Baba Meẓï‘a</i>, 35a: עשית הישר והטוב זו לפנים משורת הדין.</i> When, at times, some of the pious ones deviated to one extreme by fasting, keeping nightly vigils<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">To study <i>Torah</i>.</i>, refraining from eating meat or drinking wine, renouncing sexual intercourse, clothing themselves in woolen and hairy garments, dwelling in the mountains, and wandering about in the wilderness, they did so, partly as a means of restoring the health of their souls, as we have explained above, and partly because of the immorality of the towns-people.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, VI, 1, and <i>H. Nedarim</i>, XIII, 23.</i> When the pious saw that they themselves might become contaminated by association with evil men, or by constantly seeing their actions, fearing that their own morals might become corrupt on account of contact with them, they fled to the wildernesses far from their society, as the prophet Jeremiah said, “Oh that some one would grant me in the wilderness the dwelling of a wanderer, and I would quit my people and abandon them; for they are all adulterers, a troop of faithless evil-doers.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. IX, 1.</i> 
When the ignorant observed saintly men acting thus, not knowing their motives, they considered their deeds of themselves virtuous, and so, blindly imitating their acts, thinking thereby to become like them, chastised their bodies with all kinds of afflictions, imagining that they had acquired perfection and moral worth, and that by this means man would approach nearer to God, as if He hated the human body, and desired its destruction. It never dawned upon them, however, that these actions were bad and resulted in moral imperfection of the soul. Such men can only be compared to one who, ignorant of the art of healing, when he sees skilful physicians administering to those at the point of death [purgatives known in Arabic as] colocynth, scammony, aloe, and the like, and depriving them of food, in consequence of which they are completely cured and escape death, foolishly concludes that since these things cure sickness, they must be all the more efficacious in preserving the health, or prolonging life. If a person should take these things constantly, and treat himself as a sick person, then he would really become ill. Likewise, those who are spiritually well, but have recourse to remedies, will undoubtedly become morally ill. 
The perfect Law which leads us to perfection—as one who knew it well testifies by the words, "The Law of the Lord is perfect restoring the soul; the testimonies of the Lord are faithful making wise the simple"<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. XIX, 9.</i>—recommends none of these things (such as self-torture, flight from society etc.). On the contrary, it aims at man's following the path of moderation, in accordance with the dictates of nature, eating, drinking, enjoying legitimate sexual intercourse, all in moderation, and living among people in honesty and uprightness, but not dwelling in the wilderness or in the mountains, or clothing oneself in garments of hair and wool, or afflicting the body. The Law even warns us against these practices, if we interpret it according to what tradition tells us is the meaning of the passage concerning the Nazarite, "And he (the priest) shall make an atonement for him because he hath sinned against the soul."<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Num. VI, 11.</i> The Rabbis ask, "Against what soul has he sinned? Against his own soul, because he has deprived himself of wine. Is this not then a conclusion <i>a minori ad majus</i>? If one who deprives himself merely of wine must bring an atonement, how much more incumbent is it upon one who denies himself every enjoyment."<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nazir</i>, 19a, 22a; <i>Ta'anit</i>, 11a; <i>Baba Ḳamma</i>, 91b; <i>Nedarim</i>, 10a; cf. M.'s <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, V, 15.</i> By the words of our prophets and of the sages of our Law, we see that they were bent upon moderation and the care of their souls and bodies, in accordance with what the Law prescribes and with the answer which God gave through His prophet to those who asked whether the fast-day once a year should continue or not. They asked Zechariah, "Shall I weep in the fifth month with abstinence as I have done already these many years?"<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Zech. VII, 3.</i> His answer was, "When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh (month) already these seventy years, did ye in anywise fast for me, yea for me? And if ye do eat and if ye do drink are ye not yourselves those that eat and yourselves those that drink?"<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, VII, 6.</i> After that, he enjoined upon them justice and virtue alone, and not fasting, when he said to them, "Thus hath said the Lord of Hosts. Execute justice and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother."<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, VII, 9.</i> He said further, "Thus hath said the Lord of Hosts, the fast-day of the fourth, and the fast-day of the fifth, and the fast of seventh, and the fast of the tenth (month) shall become to the house of Judah gladness, and joy, and merry festivals; only love ye truth and peace."<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, VIII, 9.</i>. Know that by "truth" the intellectual virtues are meant, for they are immutably true, as we have explained in Chapter II, and that by "peace" the moral virtues are designated, for upon them depends the peace of the world.
But to resume. Should those of our co-religionists—and it is of them alone that I speak—who imitate the followers of other religions, maintain that when they torment their bodies, and renounce every joy, that they do so merely to discipline the faculties of their souls by inclining somewhat to the one extreme, as is proper, and in accordance with our own recommendations in this chapter, our answer is that they are in error, as I shall now demonstrate. The Law did not lay down its prohibitions, or enjoin its commandments, except for just this purpose, namely, that by its disciplinary effects we may persistently maintain the proper distance from either extreme. For, the restrictions regarding all the forbidden foods, the prohibitions of illicit intercourse, the fore-warning against prostitution, the duty of performing the legal marriage-rites which, nevertheless, does not permit intercourse at all times, as, for instance, during the period of menstruation, and after child-birth, besides its being otherwise restricted by our sages, and entirely interdicted during the daytime, as we have explained in the <i>Tractate Sanhedrin</i>—all of these God commanded in order that we should keep entirely distant from the extreme of the inordinate indulgence of the passions, and, even departing from the exact medium, should incline somewhat towards self-denial, so that there may be firmly rooted in our souls the disposition for moderation.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, III, 35, and <i>H. Deot</i>, III.</i> 
Likewise, all that is contained in the Law concerning the giving of tithes, the gleaning of the harvest, the forgotten sheaves, the single grapes, and the small bunches in the vineyards for the poor, the law of the Sabbatical year, and of the Jubilee, the giving of charity according to the wants of the needy one, all these approach the extreme of lavishness to be practised in order that we may depart far from its opposite, stinginess, and thus, nearing the extreme of excessive prodigality, there may become instilled in us the quality of generosity.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, III, 39.</i> If you should test most of the commandments from this point of view, you would find that they are all for the discipline and guidance of the faculties of the soul. Thus, the Law forbids revenge, the bearing of a grudge, and blood-revenge by saying, "Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge";<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. XIX, 18.</i> "thou shalt surely unload with him"<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. XXIII, 5.</i> (the ass of him who hates you); "thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again"<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XXII, 4.</i> (thy brother's ass or ox which has fallen by the way). These commandments are intended to weaken the force of wrath or anger. Likewise, the command, "Thou shalt surely bring them back"<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., XXII, 1.</i> (thy brother's ox or lamb which has gone astray), is meant to remove the disposition of avarice. Similarly, "Before the hoary head shalt thou rise up, and honor the face of the old man",<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. XIX, 32.</i> "Honor thy father and thy mother"<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. XX, 12.</i> etc., "thou shalt not depart from the sentence which they may tell thee"<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XVII, 11.</i> etc., are intended to do away with boldness, and to produce modesty. Then, in order to keep away from the other extreme, i. e. of excessive bashulness, we are told, "Thou shalt indeed rebuke thy neighbor" etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. XIX, 17.</i> "thou shalt not fear him"<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XVIII, 22.</i> (the false prophet) etc., so that excessive bashfulness, too, should disappear, in order that we pursue the medium course. Should, however, anyone who would without doubt be foolish if he did so try to enforce these commands with additional rigor, as, for instance, by prohibiting eating and drinking more than does the Law, or by restricting connubial intercourse to a greater degree, or by distributing all of his money among the poor, or using it for sacred purposes more freely than the Law requires, or by spending it entirely upon sacred objects and upon the sanctuary, he would indeed be performing improper acts, and would be unconsciously going to either one or the other extreme, thus forsaking completely the proper mean. In this connection, I have nerver heard a more remarkable saying than that of the Rabbis, found in the <i>Palestinian Talmud</i>, in the ninth chapter of the treatise <i>Nedarim</i>, where they greatly blame those who bind themselves by oaths and vows, in consequence of which they are fettered like prisoners. The exact words they use are, "Said Rabbi Iddai, in the name of Rabbi Isaac, 'Dost thou not think that what the Law prohibits is sufficient for thee that thou must take upon thyself additional prohibitions?'"<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yer. Nedarim</i>, IX, 1; ed. Krotoschin, 41b: אלא שאתה מבקש לאסור עליך.</i>
From all that we have stated in this chapter, it is evident that it is man's duty to aim at performing acts that observe the proper mean, and not to desist from them by going to one extreme or the other, except for the restoration of the soul's health by having recourse to the opposite of that from which the soul is suffering. So, just as he who, acquainted with the science of medicine, upon noting the least sign of a change for the worse in his health, does not remain indifferent to it, but prevents the sickness from increasing to a degree that will require recourse to violent remedies, and just as when a man, feeling that one of his limbs has become affected, carefully nurses it, refraining from things that are injurious to it, and applying every remedy that will restore it to its healthy condition, or at least keep it from getting worse, likewise, the moral man will constantly examine his characteristics, weigh his deeds, and daily investigate his psychic condition; and if, at any time, he finds his soul deviating to one extreme or another, he will immediately hasten to apply the proper remedy, and not suffer an evil aptitude to acquire strength, as we have shown, by a constant repetition of that evil action which it occasioned. He is, likewise, bound to be mindful of his defects, and constantly to endeavor to remedy them, as we have said above, for it is impossible for any man to be free from all faults.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, III, 36.</i> Philosophers tell us that it is most difficult and rare to find a man who, by his nature, is endowed with every perfection, moral as well as mental.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.'s <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, V, 14 (Rawicz, <i>Commentar</i>, p. 100). See <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, VII, 1, "it is a rare thing for a man to be godlike".</i> This thought is expressed often in the prophetical books, as, "Behold in his servants he putteth no trust, and his angels he chargeth with folly",<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Job IV, 18.</i> "How can man be justified with God? or how can be pure one that is born of woman?"<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., XXV, 4.</i>, and Solomon says of mankind in general, "For no man is so righteous upon earth that he should do always good, and never sin".<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. VII, 20.</i>
Thou knowest, also, that God said to our teacher Moses, the master of former and later ages, "Because ye have not confided in me, to sanctity me"<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Num. XX, 12.</i>, "because ye rebelled against my order at the waters of Meribah"<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., XX, 24.</i>, "because ye did not sanctify me".<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XXXII, 51.</i> All this (God said) although the sin of Moses consisted merely in that he departed from the moral mean of patience to the extreme of wrath in so far as he exclaimed, "Hear now ye rebels"<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Num. XX, 10.</i> etc., yet for this God found fault with him that such a man as he should show anger in the presence of the entire community of Israel, where wrath is unbecoming. This was a profanation of God's name, because men imitated the words and conduct of Moses, hoping thereby to attain temporal and eternal happiness. How could he, then, allow his wrath free play, since it is a pernicious characteristic, arising, as we have shown, from an evil psychic condition? The divine words, "Ye (Israel) have rebelled against me" are, however, to be explained as follows. Moses was not speaking to ignorant and vicious people, but to an assembly, the most insignificant of whose women, as the sages put it, were on a plane with Ezekiel, the son of Buzi.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekilta</i> to בשלח (Ex. XV, 2).</i> So, when Moses said or did anything, they subjected his words or actions to the most searching examination.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Moreh</i>, I, 4, on the interpretation of Ex. XXIII, 8.</i> Therefore, when they saw that he waxed wrathful, they said, "He has no moral imperfection, and did he not know that God is angry with us for demanding water, and that we have stirred up the wrath of God, he would not have been angry with us". However, we do not find that when God spoke to Moses about this matter He was angry, but on the contrary, said, "Take the staff ... and give drink to the congregation and their cattle".<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Num. XX, 8.</i> We have, indeed, digressed from the subject of this chapter, but have, I hope, satisfactorily solved one of the most difficult passages of Scripture concerning which there has been much arguing in the attempt to state exactly what the sin was which Moses committed. Let what others have said be compared with our opinion, and the truth will surely prevail.
Now, let me return to my subject. If a man will always carefully discriminate as regards his actions, directing them to the medium course, he will reach the highest degree of perfection possible to a human being, thereby approaching God,<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">See below, c.

This is the most acceptable way of serving God which the sages, too, had in mind when they wrote the words, "He who ordereth his course aright is worthy of seeing the salvation of God, as it is said, 'to him that ordereth his course aright will I show, will I show the salvation of God!'<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ps.

Chapter 5

<b>CHAPTER V</b> <br><b>CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF MAN'S PSYCHIC FACULTIES TOWARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF A SINGLE GOAL</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of the contents of this chapter, see Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr</i>, XLVI, pp. 2—13, and Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 105 ff.</i> <br>As we have explained in the preceding chapter, it is the duty of man to subordinate all the faculties of his soul to his reason. He must keep his mind's eye fixed constantly upon one goal, namely, the attainment of the knowledge of God<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ibn Daud, <i>Emunah Ramah</i>, III, and <i>Moreh</i>, III, 51. See I. Friedlaender, Der <i>Stil des Maimonides</i>, in <i>Moses b. Maimon</i>, I, p. 430.</i> (may He be blessed!), as far as it is possible for mortal man to know Him. Consequently, one must so adjust all his actions, his whole conduct, and even his very words, that they lead to this goal, in order that none of his deeds be aimless, and thus retard the attainment of that end. 
So, his only design in eating, drinking, cohabiting, sleeping, waking, moving about, and resting should be the preservation of bodily health, while, in turn, the reason for the latter is that the soul and its agencies may be in sound and perfect condition, so that he may readily acquire wisdom, and gain moral and intellectual virtues, all to the end that man may reach the highest goal of his endeavors. Accordingly, man will not direct his attention merely to obtain bodily enjoyment, choosing of food and drink and the other things of life only the agreeable, but he will seek out the most useful, being indifferent whether it be agreeable or not. There are, indeed, times when the agreeable may be used from a curative point of view, as, for instance, when one suffers from loss of appetite, it may be stirred up by highly seasoned delicacies and agreeable, palatable food. Similarly, one who suffers from melancholia may rid himself of it by listening to singing and all kinds of instrumental music, by strolling through beautiful gardens and splendid buildings, by gazing upon beautiful pictures, and other things that enliven the mind, and dissipate gloomy moods. The purpose of all this is to restore the healthful condition of the body, but the real object in maintaining the body in good health is to acquire wisdom. Likewise, in the pursuit of wealth, the main design in its acquisition should be to expend it for noble purposes, and to employ it for the maintenance of the body and the preservation of life, so that its owner may obtain a knowledge of God, in so far as that is vouchsafed unto man.
From this point of view, the study of medicine has a very great influence upon the acquisition of the virtues and of the knowledge of God, as well as upon the attainment of true, spiritual happiness. Therefore, its study and acquisition are pre-eminently important religious activities, and must not be ranked in the same class with the art of weaving, or the science of architecture, for by it one learns to weigh one's deeds, and thereby human activities are rendered true virtues. The man who insists upon indulging in savory, sweetsmelling and palatable food although it be injurious, and possibly may lead to serious illness or sudden death ought, in my opinion, to be classed with the beasts. His conduct is not that of a man in so far as he is a being endowed with understanding, but it is rather the action of a man in so far as he is a member of the animal kingdom, and so "he is like the beasts who perish".<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. XLIX, 13.</i> Man acts like a human being only when he eats that which is wholesome, at times avoiding the agreeable, and partaking of the disagreeable in his search for the beneficial. Such conduct is in accordance with the dictates of reason, and by these acts man is distinguished from all other beings. Similarly, if a man satisfy his sexual passions whenever he has the desire, regardless of good or ill effects, he acts as a brute, and not as a man.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Deot</i>, III, 2, and <i>Moreh</i>, III. 8, "Those who desire to be men in truth, and not brutes, having only the appearance and shape of men, must constantly endeavor to reduce the wants of the body, such as eating, cohabiting, drinking, anger, and all vices originating in lust and passion."</i> It is possible, however, for one to shape one's conduct entirely from the point of view of utility, as we have stated, with no aim beyond that of maintaining the health of the body, or guarding against disease. Such a one does not deserve to be called virtuous, for, just as he strives for the enjoyment of good health, another like him may have as his aim the gratification of eating, or of sexual intercourse, none of which actions leads towards the true goal. The real duty of man is, that in adopting whatever measures he may for his well-being and the preservation of his existence in good health, he should do so with the object of maintaining a perfect condition of the instruments of the soul, which are the limbs of the body, so that his soul may be unhampered, and he may busy himself in acquiring the moral and mental virtues. So it is with all the sciences and knowledge man may learn. 
Concerning those which lead directly to this goal, there is naturally no question; but such subjects as mathematics, the study of conic sections,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, p. 38, n. 1.</i> mechanics, the various problems of geometry,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Sachs, <i>Beiträge</i>, vol. II, p. 78; and Rawicz, <i>Commentar</i>, p. 22.</i> hydraulics, and many others of a similar nature, which do not tend directly towards that goal, should be studied for the purpose of sharpening the mind, and training the mental faculties by scientific investigations, so that man may acquire intellectual ability to distinguish demonstrative proofs from others, whereby he will be enabled to comprehend the essence of God. 
Similarly, in regard to man's conversation, he should speak only of those things that will be conducive to the true welfare of his soul and body, or that will tend to avert injury from them, whether his words concern themselves with science, or virtue, or praise of virtue or of a virtuous man, or with censure of vice or of a vicious person; for to express contempt for those who are loaded with vice, or to depict their deeds as contemptible—if done for the purpose of disparaging them in the eyes of other men who may avoid them, and not do as they do—is indeed a virtuous duty. Does not Scripture say, “After the doings of the land of Egypt ....... ye shall not do, ....... and after the doings of the land of Canaan”?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. XVIII, 3.</i> Also, the story of the Sodomites and all the passages occuring in Scripture, which censure those laden with vice, and represent their doings as disgraceful, and those passages which praise and hold the good in high esteem, endeavor, as I have said, to induce man to follow the paths of the righteous, and to shun the way of the wicked.
If man has this as his ideal, he will dispense with many of his customary deeds, and refrain from a great deal of ordinary conversation.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>H. Deot</i>, II, 4, and 5, for a further discussion of this subject.</i> He who follows this line of conduct will not trouble himself with adorning his walls with golden ornaments, nor with decorating his garments with golden fringe, unless it be for the purpose of enlivening his soul, and thus restoring it to health, or of banishing sickness from it, so that it shall become clear and pure, and thus be in the proper condition to acquire wisdom. Therefore, our Rabbis of blessed memory say, “It is becoming that a sage should have a pleasant dwelling, a beautiful wife, and domestic comfort”;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i>, 25b.</i> for one becomes weary, and one’s mind dulled by continued mental concentration upon difficult problems. Thus, just as the body becomes exhausted from hard labor, and then by rest and refreshment recovers, so is it necessary for the mind to have relaxation by gazing upon pictures and other beautiful objects, that its weariness may be dispelled. Accordingly, it is related that when the Rabbis became exhausted from study, they were accustomed to engage in entertaining conversation<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i>, 30b: כי הא דרבה מקמי דפתח להו לרבנן אמר מילתא דבדיחותא וכ׳.</i> (in order to refresh themselves). From this point of view, therefore, the use of pictures and embroideries for beautifying the house, the furniture, and the clothes is not to be considered immoral nor unnecessary.
Know that to live according to this standard is to arrive at a very high degree of perfection, which, in consequence of the difficulty of attainment, only a few, after long and continuous perseverance on the paths of virtue, have succeeded in reaching. If there be found a man who has accomplished this—that is one who exerts all the faculties of his soul, and directs them towards the sole ideal of comprehending God, using all his powers of mind and body, be they great or small, for the attainment of that which leads directly or indirectly to virtue—I would place him in a rank not lower than that of the prophets. Such a man, before he does a single act or deed, considers and reflects whether or not it will bring him to that goal, and if it will, then, and then only, does he do it.
Such striving does the Almighty require of us, according to the words, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might”,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. VI, 5.</i> that is, with all the faculties of thy soul, each faculty having as its sole ideal the love of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 39 (end) which refers to this passage in the <i>Peraḳim</i>, and to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (<i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, II, 2).</i> The prophets, similarly, urge us on in saying, “In all thy ways know Him”,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. III, 6.</i> in commenting upon which the sages said, “even as regards a transgression (of the ritual or ceremonial law),”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakot</i>, 63a. This does not imply that the end justifies the means; that crime may be committed to bring about religious or charitable ends. It refers only to the violation of the ceremonial or ritual laws, as the breaking of the Sabbath, and eating on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, for the sake of saving life, etc. Cf. <i>Ketubot</i>, 5a, “You must remove debris to save a life on the Sabbath”; and <i>Shabbat</i>, 30b, “Better to extinguish the light on the Sabbath than to extinguish life, which is God’s light”, etc. The distinction in regard to the various kinds of transgressions which M. makes below, Chapter VI, pp. 76—78, applies here. See <i>Shemonah Peraḳim</i>, ed. Wolf, 1876, p. 53, n. 5.</i> meaning thereby that thou shouldst set for every action a goal, namely, the truth, even though it be, from a certain point of view, a transgression.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.’s <i>Commentary on Berakot</i>, IX, 5: ובכל לבבך בשני יצריך ביצר הטוב וביצר הרע. Cf. also his <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, V, 20 (Rawicz, <i>Commentar</i>, p. 108), and <i>Moreh</i>, III, 22 (end).</i> The sages of blessed memory, too, have summed up this idea in so few words and so concisely, at the same time elucidating the whole matter with such complete thoroughness, that when one considers the brevity with which they expressed this great and mighty thought in its entirety, about which others have written whole books and yet without adequately explaining it, one truly recognizes that the Rabbis undoubtedly spoke through divine inspiration. This saying is found among their precepts (in this tractate), and is, “Let all thy deeds be done for the sake of God”.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, II, 12.</i> This, then, is the thought we have been dwelling upon in the present chapter, and what we have said must be considered sufficient for the needs of this introduction.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the <i>Shemonah Peraḳim</i>, which constitute M.’s introduction to his <i>Commentary on Abot</i>. See <i>Introduction</i>, p. 5. <i>H. Deot</i>, III, 3 contains a summary of the contents of the latter part of this chapter.</i>

Chapter 6

<b>CHAPTER VI</b> <br><b>CONCERNING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SAINTLY [OR HIGHLY ETHICAL] MAN AND HIM WHO [SUBDUES HIS PASSIONS AND] HAS SELF-RESTRAINT</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">On the contents of this chapter, see Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr</i>, XLVI, pp. 13—14, and Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 92ff. See <i>Schechter, Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology</i>, p. 201 if., on <i>Ḥasidut</i> (Saintliness). Cf. <i>Eth., Nic.</i>, VII, on <i>Self-control</i>.</i> <br>Philosophers maintain that though the man of self-restraint performs moral and praiseworthy deeds, yet he does them desiring and craving all the while for immoral deeds, but, subduing his passions and actively fighting against a longing to do those things to which his faculties, his desires, and his psychic disposition excite him, succeeds, though with constant vexation and irritation, in acting morally. The saintly man, however, is guided in his actions by that to which his inclination and disposition prompt him, in consequence of which he acts morally from innate longing and desire. Philosophers unanimously agree that the latter is superior to, and more perfect than, the one who has to curb his passions, although they add that it is possible for such a one to equal the saintly man in many regards. In general, however, he must necessarily be ranked lower in the scale of virtue, because there lurks within him the desire to do evil, and, though he does not do it, yet because his inclinations are all in that direction, it denotes the presence of an immoral psychic disposition.
Solomon, also, entertained the same idea when he said, "The soul of the wicked desireth evil",<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. XXI, 10.</i> and, in regard to the saintly man's rejoicing in doing good, and the discontent experienced by him, who is not innately righteous, when required to act justly, he says, “It is bliss to the righteous to do justice, but torment to the evil-doer”.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. XXI, 15.</i> This is manifestly an agreement between Scripture and philosophy. When, however, we consult the Rabbis on this subject, it would seem that they consider him who desires iniquity, and craves for it (but does not do it), more praiseworthy and perfect than the one who feels no torment at refraining from evil; and they even go so far as to maintain that the more praiseworthy and perfect a man is, the greater is his desire to commit iniquity, and the more irritation does he feel at having to desist from it. This they express by saying, “Whosoever is greater than his neighbor has likewise greater evil inclinations”.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i>, 52a. See Lazarus, <i>Ethics</i>, II, pp. 106—107.</i> Again, as if this were not sufficient, they even go so far as to say that the reward of him who overcomes his evil inclination is commensurate with the torture occasioned by his resistance, which thought they express by the words, “According to the labor is the reward”.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, V, 23.</i> Furthermore, they command that man should conquer his desires, but they forbid one to say, “I, by my nature, do not desire to commit such and such a transgression, even though the Law does not forbid it”. Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel summed up this thought in the words, “Man should not say, ‘I do not want to eat meat together with milk; I do not want to wear clothes made of a mixture of wool and linen; I do not want to enter into an incestuous marriage’, but he should say, ‘I do indeed want to, yet I must not, for my father in Heaven has forbidden it’”.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifra</i> to Lev. XX, 26, and <i>Midrash Yalḳuṭ</i> to <i>Wayiḳra</i>, 226, although referred to as the words of R. Eleazar b. Azariah.</i>
At first blush, by a superficial comparison of the sayings of the philosophers and the Rabbis, one might be inclined to say that they contradict one another. Such, however, is not the case. Both are correct and, moreover, are not in disagreement in the least, as the evils which the philosophers term such—and of which they say that he who has no longing for them is more to be praised than he who desires them but conquers his passion—are things which all people commonly agree are evils, such as the shedding of blood, theft, robbery, fraud, injury to one who has done no harm, ingratitude, contempt for parents, and the like. The prescriptions against these are called <i>commandments</i> (מצות), about which the Rabbis said, “If they had not already been written in the Law, it would be proper to add them”.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i>, 67b. See <i>infra</i>, p. 78, n. 2.</i> Some of our later sages, who were infected with the unsound principles of the <i>Mutakallimun</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>supra</i>, p. 41, and n. 2; <i>infra</i>, p. 90.</i> called these <i>rational laws</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">M. refers especially to Saadia who, in <i>Emunot we-De’ot</i>, III, 2, divides the divine commandments into rational (מצות שכליות), and revealed laws (מצות שמיעות). See Scheyer, <i>Psychol. Syst. d. Maim.</i>, pp. 24 and 106; Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, p. 503; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 93, n. 5; Schreiner, <i>Der Kalâm</i>, etc., pp. 13-14; Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, p. 45, n. 1; Goldziher, <i>Kitâb mȧânî al-Nafs</i>, Berlin 1907, p. 22*f., and text p. 17, n. 6; and Cohen, <i>Charakteristik</i>, etc., in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I, p. 77 ff. M. refers also to Saadia in <i>Moreh</i>, I, 71: ומה שנתגלה מזה הענין לקצת הגאונים, ואצל הקראים, הם ענינים לקחום מן המדברים מן הישמעאלים. See Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 336, n. 1. On Saadia’s relation to the <i>Kalām</i>, see Kaufmann, <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 3, n. 5, <i>et al.</i></i> There is no doubt that a soul which has the desire for, and lusts after, the above-mentioned misdeeds, is imperfect, that a noble soul has absolutely no desire for any such crimes, and experiences no struggle in refraining from them. When, however, the Rabbis maintain that he who overcomes his desire has more merit and a greater reward (than he who has no temptation), they say so only in reference to laws that are ceremonial prohibitions. This is quite true, since, were it not for the Law, they would not at all be considered transgressions. Therefore, the Rabbis say that man should permit his soul to entertain the natural inclination for these things, but that the Law alone should restrain him from them. Ponder over the wisdom of these men of blessed memory manifest in the examples they adduce. They do not declare, “Man should not say, ‘I have no desire to kill, to steal and to lie, but I have a desire for these things, yet what can I do, since my Father in heaven forbids it!’” The instances they cite are all from the ceremonial law, such as partaking of meat and milk together, wearing clothes made of wool and linen, and entering into consanguinuous marriages.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 94, n. 4.</i> These, and similar enactments are what God called “my statutes” (חקותי), which, as the Rabbis say are “statutes which I (God) have enacted for thee, which thou hast no right to subject to criticism, which the nations of the world attack and which Satan denounces, as for instance, the statutes concerning the red heifer, the scapegoat, and so forth”.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i>, 67b: תנו רבנן את משפטי תעשו דברים שאלמלא לא נכתבו דין הוא שיכתבו ואלו הן עבודה זרה וגלוי עריות ושפכות דמים וגזל וברכת השם [ו]את חקתי תשמרו דברים שהשטן משיב עליהן ואלו הן אכילת חזיר ולבישת שעטנז וחליצת יבמה וטהרת מצורע ושעיר המשתלח ושמא תאמר מעשה תהו הם תלמוד לומר אני ה׳ אני ה׳ חקקתיו ואין לך רשות להרהר בהן.</i> Those transgressions, however, which the later sages called <i>rational laws</i> are termed <i>commandments</i> (מצות), as the Rabbis explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, V, 10, where the “just” is spoken of as of two kinds, the natural and the conventional, the former corresponding to “commandments” (חקים), and the latter to “statutes” (חקים). The former, says Aristotle, have everywhere the same force, while the latter may be this way or that way indifferently, except after enactment, being, in short, all matters of special decree, such as, for instance, the price of a ransom being fixed at a <i>mina</i>, or sacrificing a goat instead of two sheep, etc. M. discusses the nature of the commandments in <i>Moreh</i>, III, 26. He makes, as here, a distinction between commandments whose object is generally evident, such as the prohibition of murder, theft, etc., and those whose object is not generally clear, such as the prohibition of wearing garments of wool and linen, boiling milk and meat together, etc. The former he calls <i>judgments</i> (משפטים, termed מצות here), and the latter he designates <i>statutes</i> or <i>ordinances</i> (חקים). See Scheyer, <i>Dalalat al Haiirin</i>, Part III (Frankfurt am Main, 1838), p. 178, n. 2; and Lazurus, <i>Ethics</i>, I, pp. 118—119.</i> <br>It is now evident from all that we have said, what the transgressions are for which, if a man have no desire at all, he is on a higher plane than he who has a longing, but controls his passion for them; and it is also evident what the transgressions are of which the opposite is true. It is an astonishing fact that these two classes of expressions should be shown to be compatible with one another, but their content points to the truth of our explanation. This ends the discussion of the subject-matter of this chapter.

Chapter 7

<b>Chapter VII</b> <br><b>Concerning the Barrier (Between God and Man) and its Signification</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a discussion of the contents of this chapter, see Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr</i>, XLVI, pp. 14—15; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 113ff., and Graetz (Eng. ed.), vol. III, pp. 483–484 on M.’s views on prophecy.</i> <br>Many passages are found in the <i>Midrash</i>, the <i>Haggadah</i>, and also the <i>Talmud</i>, which state that some of the prophets beheld God from behind many barriers, and some from behind only a few, according to the proximity of the prophet to Him, and the degree of his prophetic power.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For a detailed discussion of prophecy, see Moreh, II, 32-48. See <i>supra</i>, c. I, p. 45, n. 3. See also Bloch, <i>Charakteristik und Inhaltsangabe des Moreh Nebuchim</i>, in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I, pp. 35–39.</i> Consequently, the Rabbis said that Moses, our teacher, saw God from behind a single, clear, that is transparent, partition. As they express it, “He (Moses) looked through a translucent <i>specularia</i>”.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yebamot</i>, 49b: כל הנביאים נסתכלו באספקלריא שאינה מאירה, משה רבינו נסתכל באספקלריא המאירה. Cf. also <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i>, I. In <i>Pereḳ Ḥeleḳ</i>, M. describes the four points in which the prophecy of Moses was distinguished from that of the other prophets. See Holzer, <i>Dogmenlehre</i>, pp. 24–25. Cf. also <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, <i>Sefer Maddaʾ</i>, I, 7, 6; <i>Moreh</i>, I, <i>Introduction</i> (beg.), and II, 35.</i> <i>Specularia</i> is the name of a mirror made of some transparent body like crystal or glass, as is explained at the end of <i>Tractate Kelim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The passage in his commentary on <i>Kelim</i>, XXX, 2 to which M. refers is as follows: אספקלריא היא המכסה אשר יעשה לראות מאחוריו והוא אצלי מלה מורכבת ספק ראיה וזה שיראה אחורי המכסה שהוא מזכוכית או מן בלאר או מן דבר ספירי לא יראה במקומו האמתי וכן לא יראה על שיעורו האמתי ויקראו החכמים המכסה הבהיר מאד אשר לא יסתיר דבר מאחוריו אספקלריא המאירה ואמר על צד המשל בהשגת מרע״ה לאלהות שהוא השיג הבורא יתברך על תכלית מה שאפשר האדם מאשר הוא בחמר ההשגה שישיגהו כמו שאמר יתברך מזה כי לא יראני האדם וחי. <i>Specularia</i> (Lat.) = <i>windowpanes</i>, <i>a window</i>. Job 28,17, זְכוּכִית, glass = אִסְפַּקְלָרָא (<i>Targum</i>). Cf. <i>Sukkah</i>, 45b; Gen. <i>Rabbah</i>, sect. 91; etc.</i>  
Let me now explain the above statement. In accordance with what we have made clear in Chapter II, virtues are either intellectual or moral. Similarly, vices are intellectual, as ignorance, stupidity, and want of understanding; or they are moral as inordinate lust, pride, irascibility, anger, impudence, avarice, and many other similar defects, a list of which we have given and explained in Chapter IV. Each of these defects is as a partition separating man from God, the Most High. This is what the prophet meant when he said, “But your iniquities have ever made a separation between you and your God”;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. LIX, 2.</i> which means that our sins—which, as we have said, are the evil qualities—are the partitions which separate us from God.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On man’s nearness to God being determined by the conduct of man, and God’s removal from the earth by sin, see Schechter, <i>Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology</i>, pp. 33, 83, 232–3, 241.</i> 
Know, then, that no prophet received the gift of prophecy, unless he possessed all the mental virtues and a great majority of the most important moral ones. So, the Rabbis said, “Prophecy rests only upon the wise, the brave, and the rich”.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i>, 38a; <i>Shabbat</i>, 92a: אין השכינה שורה אלא על חכם גבור ועשיר ובעל קומה. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, II. 32.</i> By the word “wise”, they undoubtedly refer to all the mental perfections. By “rich”, they designate the moral perfection of contentment, for they call the contented man rich, their definition of the word “rich” being, “Who is rich? He who is contented with his lot”,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, IV, 1.</i> that is, one who is satisfied with what fortune brings him, and who does not grieve on account of things which he does not possess. Likewise, “brave” stands for a moral perfection; that is, one who is brave guides his faculties in accordance with intelligence and reason, as we have shown in Chapter V. The Rabbis say, “Who is brave? He who subdues his passions”.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., IV, 1. See, also, <i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, VII, 1, for an account of the characteristics necessary for a prophet. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, II, 36, and III, 51, where M. briefly describes those who form the class of prophets as directing all their minds to the attainment of perfection in metaphysics, devoting themselves entirely to God, and employing all their intellectual faculties in the study of the universe, in order to derive a proof for the existence of God, and to learn in every way possible how God rules things.</i> 
It is not, however, an indispensable requirement that a prophet should possess all the moral virtues, and be entirely free from every defect, for we find that Scripture testifies in reference to Solomon, who was a prophet, that "the Lord appeared to Solomon in Gibeon",<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">I K. III, 5.</i> although we know that he had the moral defect of lust, which is plainly evident from the fact that he took so many wives, a vice springing from the disposition of passion which resided in his soul. It plainly says, "Did not Solomon sin by these things?"<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Neh. XIII, 26.</i> Even David—a prophet, according to the words, "To me spoke the Rock of Israel"<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">II Sam. XXIII, 3.</i>—we find guilty of cruelty, and, although he exercised it only against the heathens, and in the destruction of non-believers, being merciful towards Israel, it is explicitly stated in Chronicles that God, considering him unworthy, did not permit him to build the Temple, as it was not fitting in His eyes, because of the many people David caused to be killed. So, God said to him, "Thou shalt not build a house to my name, because much blood hast thou shed".<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I Ch. XXII, 8.</i> We find, also, that Elijah gave vent to his anger, and although he did so only against unbelievers, against whom his wrath blazed up, the sages declared that God took him from the world, saying to him, "He who has so much zeal as thou hast is not fit to guide men, for thou wilt destroy them".<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i>, 113a.</i> Likewise, we find that Samuel feared Saul, and that Jacob was afraid to meet Esau. These and similar characteristics were so many partitions between the prophets (peace be unto them!) and God. He of them who had two or three qualities which did not maintain the proper medium, as is explained in Chapter IV, is said to have seen God from behind two or three partitions.
Thou must not be surprised to learn, however, that a few moral imperfections lessen the degree of prophetic inspiration; in fact, we find that some moral vices cause prophecy to be entirely withdrawn. Thus, for instance, wrath may do this, as our Rabbis say, "If a prophet becomes enraged, the spirit of prophecy departs from him".<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesaḥim</i> 66 b. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, II, 36 (end)</i> They adduce proof for this from the case of Elisha, from whom, when he became enraged, prophecy departed, until his wrath had subsided, at which he exclaimed, "And now bring me a musician!"<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">II K. III, 15. See <i>Pesaḥim</i> 117 a.</i> <br>Grief and anxiety may also cause a cessation of prophecy, as in the case of the patriarch Jacob who, during the days when he mourned for Joseph, was deprived of the Holy Spirit, until he received the news that his son lived, whereupon Scripture says, "The spirit of Jacob, their father, revived",<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. XLV, 27.</i> which the <i>Targum</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">M. attached a great deal of importance to the <i>Targum</i> of Onkelos in the elucidation of many biblical passages, and refers to it many times in the <i>Moreh</i>. In <i>Moreh</i>, I, 27, he speaks of Onkelos, the proselyte, as being thoroughly acquainted with the Hebrew and Chaldaic languages. See Frankel, <i>Hodegetik</i>, p. 322, and Bacher, <i>Die Bibelexegese Moses Maimunis</i>, pp. 38-42.</i> renders, "And the spirit of prophecy descended upon their father, Jacob". The sages, moreover, say, "The spirit of prophecy rests not upon the idle, nor upon the sad, but upon the joyous".<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i>, 30 b; <i>Pesaḥim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>: שאין השכינה שורה לא מתוך עצלות ולא מתוך עצבות ולא מתוך שחוק ולא מתוך קלות ראש לא מתוך דברים בטלים אלא מתוך דבר שמחה של מצוה. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, II, 36 (end).</i>
When Moses, our teacher, discovered that there remained no partition between himself and God which he had not removed, and when he had attained perfection by acquiring every possible moral and mental virtue, he sought to comprehend God in His true reality, since there seemed no longer to be any hindrance thereto. He, therefore, implored of God, "Show me, I beseech Thee, Thy glory".<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. XXXIII, 18.</i> But God informed him that this was impossible, as his intellect, since he was a human being, was still influenced by matter. So, God's answer was, "For no man can see me and live".<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, XXXIII, 20.</i> Thus, there remained between Moses and his comprehension of the true essence of God only one transparent obstruction, which was his human intellect still resident in matter. God, however, was gracious in imparting to him, after his request, more knowledge of the divine than he had previously possessed, informing him that the goal (he sought) was impossible of attainment, because he was yet a human being.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The corporeal element in man is a screen and partition that prevents him from perceiving abstract ideals, as they are. It is absolutely impossible for the human mind to comprehend the Divine Being, even though the corporeal element were as pure as that of the spheres. The Scriptural passages Ps. XCVII, 2 and XVIII, 12 express in figurative language this idea, that, on account of our bodies, we are unable to comprehend God's essence (<i>Moreh</i>, III, 9).</i> The true comprehension of God, Moses designates by the term "beholding the Divine face", for, when one sees another person face to face his features become imprinted upon the mind, so that one will not confuse him whom he has seen with others; whereas, if he sees only his back, he may possibly recognize him again, but will more probably be in doubt, and confuse him with others. Likewise, the true comprehension of God is a conception of the reality of His existence fixed in the mind (of the knower) which, as concerns this existence, is a conception not shared by any other being; so that there is firmly implanted in the mind of the knower a knowledge of God's existence absolutely distinct from the knowledge the mind has of any other being (that exists). It is impossible, however, for mortal man to attain this high degree of comprehension, though Moses (peace be unto him) almost, but not quite, reached it, which thought is expressed by the words, "Thou shalt see my back parts".<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. XXXIII, 23. Cf. <i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, I, 10. "But my face shall not be seen" (Ex. XXXIII, 23) means that God's true existence, as it is, cannot be comprehended (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 37), and "thou shalt see my back" (Ex. <i>loc. cit.</i>) signifies that!; God allowed Moses to see that which follows Him, is similar to Him, and is the result of the Divine Will, i. e., all things created by God (<i>Moreh</i>, I, 39). Cf. also <i>Moreh</i>, I, 21 and 54. See, on the interpretation of "my back" (אתרי) and "my face" (פני), Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, p. 405, and n. 72.</i> I intend more fully to discuss this subject in my <i>Book on Prophecy</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>supra</i> c. I, p. 45 n. 3.</i> <br>So, since the sages (peace be unto them) knew that these two classes of vices, that is, the mental and the moral, separated man from God, and that according to them the rank of the prophets varied, they (the Rabbis) said of some of their own number, with whose wisdom and morality they were acquainted, "It is fitting that the spirit of God should rest upon them as it did upon Moses, our teacher".<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i>, 28a; <i>Baba Batra</i>, 134a. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 114, n. 5.</i>Do not, however, mistake the intention of the comparison. They did, indeed, compare them with Moses, for they were far (God forbid!) from giving them equal rank. In the same way they speak of others, characterizing them as being "like Joshua". This is what we intended to explain in this chapter.

Chapter 8

<b>Chapter VIII</b> <br>Concerning the Natural Disposition of Man<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The title applies only to the first part of the chapter which is mainly a discussion of human free will, and is be supplemented by parts of M.'s <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, by <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V and VI, and <i>Moreh</i>, III, 16 21. On the contents of this chapter, see Jaraczewski, <i>ZPhKr</i>, XL VI, pp. 15-15; and Rosin, Ethik, p. 62 ff.</i> <br>It is impossible for man to be born endowed by nature from his very birth with either virtue or vice, just as it is impossible that he should be born skilled by nature in any particular art. It is possible, however, that through natural causes he may from birth be so constituted as to have a predilection for a particular virtue or vice, so that he will more readily practise it than any other.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 1, "The virtues, then, come to be in us neither by nature nor in despite of nature, but we are furnished with a capacity for receiving them, and are perfected in them through custom". This applies to nations as well as to individuals; see <i>Pirḳe Mosheh</i>, c. XXV, fol. 53a.</i> For instance, a man whose natural constitution inclines towards dryness, whose brain matter is clear and not overloaded with fluids, finds it much easier to learn, remember, and understand things than the phlegmatic man whose brain is encumbered with a great deal of humidity. But, if one who inclines constitutionally towards a certain excellence is left entirely without instruction, and if his faculties are not stimulated, he will undoubtedly remain ignorant. On the other hand, if one by nature dull and phlegmatic, possessing an abundance of humidity, is instructed and enlightened, he will, though with difficulty, it is true, gradually succeed in acquiring knowledge and understanding. In exactly the same way, he whose blood is somewhat warmer than is necessary has the requisite quality to make of him a brave man. Another, however, the temperament of whose heart is colder than it should be, is naturally inclined towards cowardice and fear, so that if he should be taught and trained to be a coward, he would easily become one. If, however, it be desired to make a brave man of him, he can without doubt become one, providing he receive the proper training which would require, of course, great exertion.
I have entered into this subject so thou mayest not believe the absurd ideas of astrologers, who falsely assert that the constellation at the time of one's birth determines whether one is to be virtuous or vicious, the individual being thus necessarily compelled to follow out a certain line of conduct. 
We, on the contrary, are convinced that our Law<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, III, 17, <i>Fifth Theory</i>.</i> agrees with Greek philosophy, which substantiates with convincing proofs the contention that man's conduct is entirely in his own hands, that no compulsion is exerted, and that no external influence is brought to bear upon him that constrains him to be either virtuous or vicious, except inasmuch as, according to what we have said above, he may be by nature so constituted as to find it easy or hard, as the case may be, to do a certain thing; but that he must necessarily do, or refrain from doing, a certain thing is absolutely untrue.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Saadia was the first Jewish philosopher to dwell at length upon the question of free will (<i>Emunot we-Deot</i>, III), being influenced by the discussions of Arabic theologians, although Philo, who generally followed the system of the Stoics, professed a belief in this doctrine (<i>Quod Deus Sit Immutabilis</i>, ed. Mangey, p. 279). He was followed by Baḥya (<i>Ḥobot ha-Lebabot</i>, III, 8); Ibn Zaddiḳ (<i>Olam Ḳaṭon</i>, p. 69, ed. Jellinek, Leipzig, 1854); Yehudah ha-Levi (<i>Cuzari</i>, pt. V, ed. Cassel, p. 418); Abraham Ibn Ezra (<i>Yesod Morah</i>, VII); and Ibn Daud (<i>Emunah Bamah</i>, p. 96, ed. Weil, Frankfurt a. M., 1842). For references to passages in M.'s works where he discusses free will, see p. 85 n. 1. M. undoubtedly had <i>Eth. Nic</i>. III in mind when he said that "Our Law agrees with Greek philosophy". See especially <i>Eth. Nic</i>. III, 5. 7, where are found the following statements, "So it seems as has been said, that man is the originator of his actions", and "if it is in our power to do and to forbear doing what is creditable or the contrary, and these respectively constitute the being good or bad, then the being good or vicious characters is in our power". See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 5, n. 4, and p. 66, n. 1. Consult on this subject I. Broydé, in <I>J. E.</I>, vol. V, art. <i>Free Will</i>, and works mentioned there; Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel, Excursus</i>, III, pp. 84—85; and Cohen, <i>Characteristik</i>, etc., in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I, p. 76.</i> 
Were a man compelled to act according to the dictates of predestination, then the commands and prohibitions of the Law would become null and void, and the Law would be completely false, since man would have no freedom of choice in what he does. Moreover, it would be useless, in fact absolutely in vain, for man to study, to instruct, or attempt to learn an art, as it would be entirely impossible for him, on account of the external force compelling him, according to the opinion of those who hold this view, to keep from doing a certain act, from gaining certain knowledge, or from acquiring a certain characteristic. Reward and punishment, too, would be pure injustice, both as regards man towards man, and as between God and man.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">M. mentions the same argument in the <i>Moreh</i>, but it had often been advanced before him. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 67, n. 2.</i> Suppose, under such conditions, that Simeon should kill Reuben. Why should the former be punished, seeing that he was constrained to do the killing, and Reuben was predestined to be slain? How could the Almighty, who is just and righteous, chastise Simeon for a deed which it was impossible for him to leave undone, and which, though he strove with all his might, he would be unable to avoid? If such were the true state of affairs, all precautionary measures, such as building houses, providing means of subsistence, fleeing when one fears danger, and so forth, would be absolutely useless, for that which is decreed beforehand must necessarily happen. This theory is, therefore, positively unsound, contrary to reason and common sense, subversive of the fundamental principles of religion, and attributes injustice to God (far be it from Him!). 
In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, "See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life",<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V, 3.</i> giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, "If thou wilt hearken", and "If thou wilt not hearken".<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XI, 27. 28.</i> Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, "Ye shall teach them to your children",<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., XI, 19.</i> "and ye shall do them and observe to do them",<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., V, 1.</i> and, similarly, all the other passages referring to the study of the commandments. It is also necessary to take all the precautionary measures laid down in the Law, such as, "Thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house",<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., XXII, 8.</i> "lest he die in the battle",<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i> XX, 5 or 7.</i> "wherein shall he sleep?"<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. XXII, 26.</i> , and "no man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone",<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XXIV, 6.</i> and many other passages in regard to precautions found in the Law and the Prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V, 4, and <i>Moreh</i>, III, 20; cf. Ibn Baud, <i>Emunah Ramah</i>, II, 6, 2, p. 96.</i> 
The statement found in the sayings of the Rabbis, "All is in the power of God except the fear of God"<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakot</i>, 33b; <i>Niddah</i>, 16 b; <i>Megillah</i>, 25 a.</i> is, nevertheless, true, and in accord with what we have laid down here. Men are, however, very often prone to err in supposing that many of their actions, in reality the result of their own free will, are forced upon them, as, for instance, marrying a certain woman, or acquiring a certain amount of money. Such a supposition is untrue. If a man espouses and marry a woman legally, then she becomes his lawful wife, and by his marrying her he has fulfilled the divine command to increase and multiply. God, however, does not decree the fulfillment of a commandment. If, on the other hand, a man has consummated with a woman an unlawful marriage, he has committed a transgression. But God does not decree that a man shall sin. Again, suppose a man robs another of money, steals from him, or cheats him, and then uttering a false oath, denies it; if we should say that God had destined that this sum should pass into the hands of the one and out of the possession of the other, God would be preordaining an act of iniquity. Such, however, is not the case, but rather that all of man's actions, which are subject to his free will, undoubtedly either comply with, or transgress, God's commands; for, as has been explained in Chapter II, the commands and prohibitions of the Law refer only to those actions with regard to which man has absolute free choice to do, or refrain from doing. Moreover, to this faculty of the soul (i. e. the freedom of the will) "the fear of God" is subservient, and is, in consequence, not predestined by God, but, as we have explained, is entirely in the power of the human free will. By the word "all" (הכל), the Rabbis meant to designate only natural phenomena which are not influenced by the will of man, as whether a person is tall or short, whether it is rainy or dry, whether the air is pure or impure, and all other such things that happen in the world, and which have no connection with man's conduct. 
In making this assertion that obedience or disobedience to the Law of God does not depend upon the power or will of God, but solely upon that of man himself, the sages followed the dictum of Jeremiah, who said, "Out of the mouth of God there cometh neither the bad nor the good".<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. lll, 38. This verse is, however, generally translated, "Out of the mouth of God, the Most High, cometh there not evil as well as good?", which is exactly the opposite of M.'s interpretation. This verse is also quoted in <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V, 2, where M. states that it is wholly in the power of man to be as righteous as Moses or as wicked as Jeroboam.</i> By the words "the bad" he meant vice, and by "the good", virtue; and, accordingly, he maintains that God does not preordain that any man should be vicious or virtuous. Since this is so, it behooves man to mourn and weep over the sins and the transgressions he has committed, as he has sinned of his own free will in accordance with what the prophet says, "Wherefore should a living man mourn? Let every man mourn because of his sins".<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. III, 39.</i> He continues, then, to tell us that the remedy for this disease is in our own hands, for, as our misdeeds were the result of our own free will, we have, likewise, the power to repent of our evil deeds, and so he goes on to say, "Let us search through and investigate our ways, and let us return to the Lord. Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God, in the heavens". <sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>., III, 40—41. Of. <i>H. Teshubah, loc. cit.</i></i>
As regards the theory generally accepted by people, and likewise found in rabbinical and prophetical writings, that man's sitting and rising, and in fact all of his movements, are governed by the will and desire of God, it may be said that this is true only in one respect. Thus, for instance, when a stone is thrown into the air and falls to the ground, it is correct to say that the stone fell in accordance with the will of God, for it is true that God decreed that the earth and all that goes to make it up, should be the centre of attraction, so that when any part of it is thrown into the air, it is attracted back to the centre. Similarly, all the particles of fire ascend according to God's will, which preordained that fire should go upward.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Aristotle uses the example of a stone and fire, in <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, II, 1, to show that nature is not affected by custom. A stone by custom can never be brought to ascend, nor fire do descend. Moral virtues are, however, the result of custom.</i> But it is wrong to suppose that when a certain part of the earth is thrown upward God wills at that very moment that it should fall. 
The <i>Mutakalllimun</i><sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>supra</i>, c. I. p. 41, n. 2; and p. 77.</i> are, however, of a different opinion in this regard, for I have heard them say that the Divine Will is constantly at work, decreeing everything from time to time.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 73. <i>Sixth Proposition</i>. See Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 286, n. 3.</i> We do not agree with them, but believe that the Divine Will ordained everything at creation, and that all things, at all times, are regulated by the laws of nature, and run their natural course, in accordance with what Solomon said, "As it was, so it will ever be, as it was made so it continues, and there is nothing new under the sun".<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Eccles. I, 9.</i> 
This occasioned the sages to say that all miracles which deviate from the natural course of events, whether they have already occured, or, according to promise, are to take place in the future, were fore-ordained by the Divine Will during the six days of creation, nature being then so constituted that those miracles which were to happen really did afterwards take place. Then, when such an occurence happened at its proper time, it may have been regarded as an absolute innovation, whereas in reality it was not.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">M. reiterates this view of the miracles in his <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, V, 6, which enumerates ten things created on the eve of the Sabbath of the week of creation. See Lipmann Heller, in <i>Tosefot Yom-Tob</i>, on this passage; and Hoffman, <i>Mischnaioth</i>, <i>Seder Nezikin</i>, Berlin, 1889, p. 353. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 66, and Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 296. M. also supported this view in <i>Moreh</i>, II, 29 where he refers to <i>Genesis Rabbah</i>, V, 4, and <i>Exodus Rabbah</i>, XXI, 6, which read, "When God created the world He made an agreement that the sea should divide, the fire not hurt, the lions not harm, the fish not swallow persons singled out by God for certain times, and thus the whole order of things changes whenever he finds it necessary." Consult on this subject Joel, <i>Moses Maimonides</i>, 1876, p. 77 ; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 69, n. 5; "Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel, Excursus</i>, IV; Lazarus, <i>Ethics</i>, II, p. 77, n. 1; Kohler, art. <i>Miracles</i>, in <I>J. E.</I>, vol. VIII, pp. 606-607; Geiger, <i>Judaism and its History</i>, p. 348.</i> The Rabbis expatiate very much upon this subject in the <i>Midrash Koheleth</i> and in other writings, one of their statements in reference to this matter being, "Everything follows its natural course".<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>`Abodah Zarah</i>, 54b. See Lazarus, <i>ibid.</i>, II, p. 74 ff.</i> In everything that they said, you will always find that the Rabbis (peace be unto them!) avoided referring to the Divine Will as determining a particular event at a particular time. When, therefore, they said that man rises and sits down in accordance with the will of God, their meaning was that, when man was first created, his nature was so determined that rising up and sitting down were to be optional to him; but they as little meant that God wills at any special moment that man should or should not get up, as He determines at any given time that a certain stone should or should not fall to the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.'s <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, IV, 23 (Rawicz, <i>Commentar</i>, pp. 89 90); <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V, 4, and <i>Moreh</i>, III, 17, <i>Fifth Theory</i>. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 69, n. 6.</i> The sum and substance of the matter is, then, that thou shouldst believe that just as God willed that man should be upright in stature, broad-chested, and have fingers, likewise did He will that man should move or rest of his own accord, and that his actions should be such as his own free will dictates to him, without any outside influence or restraint, which fact God clearly states in the truthful Law, which elucidates this problem, when it says, "Behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil".<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. III, 22.</i> The <i>Targum</i>, in paraphrasing this passage, explains the meaning of the words <i>mimmenu lada'at ṭob wara</i>'. Man has become the only being in the world who possesses a characteristic which no other being has in common with him. What is this characteristic? It is that by and of himself man can distinguish between good and evil, and do that which he pleases, with absolutely no restraint. Since, then, this is so, it would have even been possible for him to have stretched out his hand, and, taking of the tree of life, to have eaten of its fruit, and thus live forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V, 1.</i> Since it is an essential characteristic of man's makeup that he should of his own free will act morally or immorally, doing just as he chooses, it becomes necessary to teach him the ways of righteousness, to command and exhort him, to punish and reward him according to his deserts. It behooves man also to accustom himself to the practice of good deeds, until he acquires the virtues corresponding to those good deeds; and, furthermore, to abstain from evil deeds so that he may eradicate the vices that may have taken root in him. Let him not suppose that his characteristics have reached such a state that they are no longer subject to change, for any one of them may be altered from the good to the bad, and vice versa; and, moreover, all in accordance with his own free will. To confirm this theory, we have mentioned all these facts concerning the observances and the transgressions of the Law.
It now remains for us to explain another phase of this problem, which arises from the fact that there are several Scriptural passages in which some think they find proof that God preordains and forces man to disobedience. This being an erroneous opinion, it becomes our duty to explain these passages, since so many people are confused regarding them. One of these is that in which God said to Abraham, "and they (the Egyptians) will make them (the Israelites) serve, and they will afflict them".<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. XV, 13.</i> "Is it not evident", it is claimed, "that God decreed that the Egyptians should oppress the seed of Abraham? Then, why did He punish them, since, owing to divine predestination, it was inexorably decreed that they should enslave the Israelites?" 
The answer to this is as follows. Suppose God had said that of those who were to be born in the future, some were to be transgressors and others observers of the Law, some pious and some wicked. Such would take place, but it would by no means follow from this divine decree that a certain individual would necessarily have to do evil, or that another pious individual would be forced to do good. On the contrary, every evil-doer would become such of his own free will; if he preferred to be a righteous man, it would be in his power, and nothing could prevent him from becoming such. Likewise, if every righteous man preferred to do evil, nothing would hinder him, for God's decree was not pronounced against any certain individual, so that he might say, "It has already been decreed that I do this or that", but [these words] applied to the race in general, at the same time allowing every individual to retain his own free will, according to the very makeup of his nature. Consequently, every Egyptian who maltreated or oppressed the Israelites had it in his own power not to do them any injury unless he wanted to, for it was not ordained that any certain individual should harm them.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. Teshubah</i>, VI, 5.</i>
The same answer may also apply to another passage in which God says, "Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and then will this people rise up and go astray after the gods of the stranger of the land".<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. XXXI, 16.</i> This is no more nor less than if God had said, "Whoever practises idolatry will meet with this or that treatment", but, if no transgressor should ever be found, then the threat of punishment for idolatry would become nullified, and the curses would all be ineffectual.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>H. T'shubah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i></i> The same is true of all punishments mentioned in the Law. As we cannot say that simply because we find the law of stoning for Sabbathbreakers [in the <i>Torah</i>] that he who desecrates the Sabbath was compelled to violate it, no more can we maintain that because certain maledictions occur there that those who practised idolatry, and upon whom these curses consequently fell, were predestined to be idol-worshippers. On the contrary, every one who practised idolatry did so of his own volition, and so received due punishment, in consonance with the passage, "Yea they have made a choice of their own ways ... so will I also make choice of their misfortune".<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. LXVI, 3. 4.</i>
As regards, however, the words of God, "and I will harden the heart of Pharaoh",<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. XIV, 4.</i> afterwards punishing him with death, there is much to be said, and from which there may be deduced an important principle. Weigh well what I say in this matter, reflect upon it, compare it with the words of others,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">M. probably means Abraham ibn Ezra and Ibn Baud. See Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 24.</i> and give preference to that which is best. If Pharaoh and his counsellors had committed no other sin than that of not permitting Israel to depart, I admit that the matter would be open to great doubt, for God had prevented them from releasing Israel according to the words, "For I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants".<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Ex., X, 1.</i> After that, to demand of Pharaoh that he send them forth while he was forced to do the contrary, and then to punish him because he did not dismiss them, finally putting him and all his followers to death, would undoubtedly be unjust, and would completely contradict all that we have previously said. Such, however, was not the real state of affairs, for Pharaoh and his followers, already of their own free will, without any constraint whatever, had rebelled by oppressing the strangers who were in their midst, having tyrannized over them with great injustice, as Scripture plainly states, "And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel is more numerous and mightier than we, come let us deal wisely with it".<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, I, 9, 10.</i> This they did through the dictates of their own free will and the evil passions of their hearts, without any external constraint forcing them thereto. The punishment which God then inflicted upon them was that He withheld from them the power of repentance, so that there should fall upon them that punishment which justice declared should he meted out to them. The fact that they were prevented from repenting manifested itself by Pharaoh's not dismissing them. This God had explained and told him, namely, that if He had merely wished to liberate Israel, He would have destroyed him and his adherents, and He would have brought out the Israelites; but, in addition to the liberation of his people, God wished to punish him because of his previous oppression of Israel, as it is said at the beginning of the matter, "And also that nation whom they shall serve will I likewise judge".<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. XV, 14.</i> It would have been impossible to have punished them, if they had repented; therefore repentance was withheld from them, and they continued to keep the children of Israel in bondage, as it says, "For even now I have stretched out my hand, etc. ... but for this cause have I allowed thee to remain".<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. IX, 15. 16. The same explanation for the hardening of Pharaoh's heart is given in <i>H. Teshubah</i>, VI, 3. On the withholding of repentance, see Schechter, <i>Some Aspects of Rabbinic Theology</i>, p. 332.</i>
No one can find fault with us when we say that God at times punishes man by withholding repentance from him, thus not allowing him free will as regards repentance, for God (blessed be He) knows the sinners, and His wisdom and equity mete out their punishment. Sometimes, He punishes only in this world, sometimes only in the world to come, sometimes in both. Furthermore, His punishment in this world is varied, sometimes being bodily, sometimes pecuniary, and sometimes both at once. Just as some of man's undertakings, which ordinarily are subject to his own free will, are frustrated by way of punishment, as for instance a man's hand being prevented from working so that he can do nothing with it, as was the case of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">See I K. XIII, 4.</i>, or a man's eyes from seeing, as happened to the Sodomites who had assembled about Lot<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. XIX, 11.</i>, likewise does God withhold man's ability to use his free will in regard to repentance, so that it never at all occurs to him to repent, and he thus finally perishes in his wickedness. It is not necessary for us to know about God's wisdom so as to be able to ascertain why He inflicts precisely such punishment as He does and no other, just as little as we know why one species has a certain particular form and not another. It is sufficient for us to know the general principle, that God is righteous in all His ways, that He punishes the sinner according to his sin, and rewards the pious according to his righteousness. If you should inquire why God repeatedly asked Pharaoh to release Israel which he was unable to do—while he, in spite of the plagues which befell him, persisted in his rebellion and stubbornness, which very rebelliousness and stubbornness was his punishment—and yet God would not in vain have asked him to do a thing which he could not do, then know that, this, too, was a part of God's wisdom, to teach Pharaoh that God can suspend man's freedom of will when it pleases Him to do so. So, God said to him (through Moses), "I desire that thou shouldst liberate them, but thou wilt not dismiss them, so that thou shouldst die". Pharaoh should have consented to release them, and therely disprove the words of the prophet (Moses) that he was unable to obey, but he had not the power. Thus, a great wonder was revealed to the people, as it is said, "In order that they may proclaim my name throughout the earth",<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. IX, 16.</i> namely, that it is possible for God to punish man by depriving him of his free will respecting a certain deed, while he, though realizing it, is, however, unable to influence his soul, and return to his former state of freedom of the will. Such was, likewise, the punishment of Sihon, King of Heshbon; for, on account of his former misdeed, to which he was not forced, God punished him by preventing him from granting the request of the Israelites, as a result of which they put him do death, as Scripture says, "But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, would not suffer our passing by him",<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. II, 30. Cf. <i>H. Teshubah</i>, VI, 3.</i> etc. What has made this passage difficult for all commentators is their impression that Sihon was punished for not permitting Israel to pass through his land, just as they imagined that Pharaoh and his adherents were punished for not releasing Israel, and so they ask, "How could he (Sihon) be justly punished, since he was not a free agent?" These suppositions are incorrect, and the matter is as we have explained, namely, that Pharaoh and his adherents were punished by God because of their previous oppression of Israel, of which they did not repent, so that there befell them all the plagues; while Sihon's punishment, which consisted of his inability to do the will of Israel, thus resulting in his death, was due to the former deeds of oppression and injustice which he had practised in his kingdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">M. cannot, however, point to any biblical passage that substantiates his contention that Sihon had previously committed injustice.</i>
God has, moreover, expressly stated through Isaiah that He punishes some transgressors by making it impossible for them to repent, which He does by the suspension of their free will. Thus, He says, "Obdurate will remain the heart of this people and their ears will be heavy and their eyes will be shut, lest ... they be converted and healing be granted them".<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. VI, 10, quoted also in <i>H. Teshubah</i>, VI, 3.</i> The meaning of these words is so plain and obvious that they need no explanation. They are, however, a key to many unopened locks. Upon this principle also are based the words of Elijah (peace be unto him!) who, when speaking of the unbelievers of his time, said of them, "Thou hast turned their hearts back",<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">I K. XVIII, 37, quoted again in <i>H. Teshubah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, which also refers to Josh. XI, 20.</i> which means that, as they have sinned of their own accord, their punishment from Thee is that Thou hast turned their hearts away from repentance, by not permitting them to exercise free will, and thus have a desire to forsake that sin, in consequence of which they persevere in their unbelief. So it is said, "Ephraim is bound to idols; let him alone",<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Hos. IV, 17.</i> which means that since Ephraim has attached himself to idols of his own free will, and has become enamoured of them, his punishment consists in his being abandoned to his indulgence in them. This is the interpretation of the words "Let him alone". To one who understands subtle ideas, this explanation will appeal as being excellent. Very different, however, is the meaning of what Isaiah said, "Why hast thou let us go astray, oh Lord, from Thy ways, and suffered our hearts to be hardened against Thy fear?"<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. LXIII, 17.</i> These words have no bearing upon the foregoing exposition. Their meaning is to be gathered from the context in which they occur. The prophet, bewailing the captivity, our residence among strangers, the cessation of our kingdom, and the sovereignty of the nations over us, says by way of prayer, "O God, if Israel continues to see this state of affairs in which the unbelievers wield the power, they will go astray from the path of truth, and their heart will incline away from Thy fear, as if Thou wast the cause of making those ignorant ones originally depart from the path of truth, as our teacher Moses said, 'Then will the nations which have heard Thy fame say in this manner that because the Lord was not able',"<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Num. XIV, 15. 16.</i> etc. For this reason, Isaiah said after that, "Return for the sake of Thy servants the tribes of Thy heritage",<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Isa., loc. cit.</i> so that there should not be a blasphemy of God's name (by the heathens). Likewise, in the "minor prophets", there is found the opinion of those who, following the truth, were nevertheless conquered by the nations at the time of the exile, which passage, quoting their own words, reads, "Every one that doth evil is good in the eyes of the Lord, and in them he findeth delight, or else, where is the God of justice?"<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Mal. II, 17.</i> The prophet, quoting their own words which were occasioned by the length of the exile, continues, "Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked contritely before the Lord of Hosts? And now we call the presumptuous happy; yea, built are they that practise wickedness"<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, III, 14. 15.</i>, etc. Then, however, explicitly stating that God, in the future, will reveal the truth, he says, "And ye shall return, and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked".<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i>, III, 18. Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, III, 19.</i> These are the ambiguous passages in the Law and Scripture from which it might appear that God compels man to commit transgressions. We have, however, undoubtedly explained the meaning of these verses, and if one examines it very closely, he will find it a truthful explanation. We, therefore, hold to our original contention, namely, that obedience or transgression of the Law depends entirely upon man's free will; that he is the master of his own actions; that what he chooses not to do he leaves undone, although God may punish him for a sin which he has committed by depriving him of his free will, as we have made clear; furthermore, that the acquisition of virtues and vices is entirely in the power of man, in consequence of which it is his duty to strive to acquire virtues, which he alone can acquire for himself, as the Rabbis in their ethical sayings in this very tractate say, "If I am not for myself who will be for me?"<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Abot</i>, I, 14. Cf. M.'s commentary on this passage.</i>
There is, however, one thing more relating to this problem about which we must say a few words, in order to treat in a comprehensive manner the subject-matter of this chapter. Although I had not intended at all to speak of it, necessity forces me to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">M. feels it necessary here to discuss philosophically the prescience of God, which he does reluctantly, as the <i>Peraḳim</i> are intended for readers not versed in philosophy. See <i>Introduction</i>, p. 11.</i> This topic is the prescience of God,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">For M.'s discussion of God's knowledge, see <i>Pereḳ Ḥeleḳ</i>; <i>H. Teshubah</i>, V, 5; <i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, II, 8-10; <i>Moreh</i>, I, 58, and III, 19-21. See Munk <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 301, n. 4.</i> because it is with an argument based on this that our views are opposed by those who believe that man is predestined by God to do good or evil, and that man has no choice as to his conduct, since his volition is dependent upon God. The reason for their belief they base on the following statement. "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect. If thou sayest that God does not know in advance, then great absurdities and destructive religious theories will result." 
Listen, therefore, to what I shall tell thee, reflect well upon it, for it is unquestionably the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For a list and the opinions of Jewish philosophers before M. who discussed this problem, see Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, p. 73, n. 5.</i> It is, indeed, an axiom of the science of the divine, i. e. metaphysics, that God (may He be blessed!) does not know by means of knowledge, and does not live by means of life,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 57: וכן חי לא בחיים ויודע לא במדע, and <i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, II, 10. See Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, p. 423, and note 94.</i> so that He and His knowledge may be considered two different things in the sense that this is true of man; for man is distinct from knowledge, and knowledge from man, in consequence of which they are two different things. If God knew by means of knowledge, He would necessarily be a plurality, and the primal essence would be composite, that is, consisting of God Himself, the knowledge by which He knows, the life by which He lives, the power by which He has strength, and similarly of all His attributes. I shall only mention one argument, simple and easily understood by all, though there are strong and convincing arguments and proofs that solve this difficulty. 
It is manifest that God is identical with His attributes and His attributes with Him, so that it may be said that He is the knowledge, the knower, and the known, and that He is the life, the living, and the source of His own life, the same being true of His other attributes. This conception is very hard to grasp, and thou shouldst not hope to thoroughly understand it by two or three lines in this treatise. There can only be imparted to thee a vague idea of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">For an exhaustive discussion of the theories which M. merely mentions here, see <i>Moreh</i>, I, 50-51, on the attributes of God. See Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, 50, p. 179 ff., <i>passim</i>; Kaufmann, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 418 ff.; Cohen, <i>Charakteristik</i>, etc. in <i>Moses ben Maimon</i>, I, pp. 89-90.</i> Now, in consequence of this important axiom, the Hebrew language does not allow the expression <i>Ḥe Adonai</i> (the life of God) as it does <i>Ḥe Fara'oh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. XLII, 15.</i> (the life of Pharaoh), where the word <i>ḥe</i> (in the construct state) is related to the following noun, for the thing possessed and the possessor (in this case) are two different things. Such a construction cannot be used in regard to the relation of a thing to itself. Since the life of God is His essence, and His essence is His life, not being separate and distinct from each other, the word "life", therefore, cannot be put in the construct state, but the expression <i>Ḥai Adonai</i><sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth, III, 13.</i> (the living God) is used, the purpose of which is to denote that God and His life are one. <sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Yesode ha-Torah</i>, II, 10, and <i>Moreh</i>, I, 58 (beg.). See Munk, <i>Guide</i>, I, p. 302, n. 3. The expressions חֵי אלהים (II Sam. II, 27), חֵי אל (Job XXVII, 2), and especially חֵי יהוה וחֵי נפשך (I Sam. XX, 3; XXV, 26, and II K. II, 2), and Jer. XXXVIII, 16 substantiate this novel linguistic argument of M. Amos VIII, 14 חֵי אלהיך דן is used in reference to the gods of idolators.</i>
Another accepted axiom of metaphysics is that human reason cannot fully conceive God in His true essence, because of the perfection of God's essence and the imperfection of our own reason, and because His essence is not due to causes through which it may be known.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">See Aristotle's Metaphysics, XXII, 9.</i> Furthermore, the inability of our reason to comprehend Him may be compared to the inability of our eyes to gaze at the sun, not because of the weakness of the sun's light, but because that light is more powerful than that which seeks to gaze into it.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, I, 59, "All philosophers say, 'He has overpowered us by His grace, and it is invisible to us through the intensity of His light', like the sun which cannot be perceived by the eyes which are too weak to bear its rays". Cf. Baḥya, <i>Ḥobot ha-Lebobot</i>, I, 10. See Munk, <i>Guide</i> I, p. 252; Rosin, <i>Ethik</i>, pp. 75, n. 4; Kaufmann, <i>Attributenlehre</i>, pp. 324-325; 445, n.128; and Wolff, <i>Acht Capitel</i>, p. 80, n. 1.</i> Much that has been said on this subject is self-evident truth. From what we have said, it has been demonstrated also that we cannot comprehend God's knowledge, that our minds cannot grasp it all, for He is His knowledge, and His knowledge is He. This is an especially striking idea, but those (who raise the question of God's knowledge of the future) fail to grasp it to their dying day.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">See Hebrew text, c. VIII, p. 55, n. 37.</i> They are, it is true, aware that the divine essence, as it is, is incomprehensible, yet they strive to comprehend God's knowledge, so that they may know it, but this is, of course, impossible. If the human reason could grasp His knowledge, it would be able also to define His essence, since both are one and the same, as the perfect knowledge of God is the comprehension of Him as He is in His essence, which consists of His knowledge, His will, His life, and all His other majestic attributes. Thus, we have shown how utterly futile is the pretension to define His knowledge. All that we can comprehend is that just as we know that God exists so are we cognizant of the fact that He knows. If we are asked, "What is the nature of God's knowledge?", we answer that we do not know any more than we know the nature of His true existence.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Moreh</i>, III, 20-21.</i> Fault is found, moreover, with him who tries to grasp the truth of the divine existence, as expressed by the words, "Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Job XI, 7.</i>
Reflect, then, upon all that we have said, namely, that man has control over his actions, that it is by his own determination that he does either the right or the wrong, without, in either case, being controlled by fate, <sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In his <i>Commentary on Abot</i>, III, 15, M. maintains that the phrase "Everything is foreseen (by God), but freedom of choice is given", is in harmony with his theory of the omniscience of God, which does not, however, deprive man of free will. See Rawicz, <i>Commentar</i> p. 75.</i>and that, as a result of this divine commandment, teaching, preparation, reward, and punishment are proper. Of this there is absolutely no doubt. As regards, however, the character of God's knowledge, how He knows everything, this is, as we have explained, beyond the reach of human ken. This is all that we purposed saying in this chapter, and it is now time for us to bring our words to an end, and begin the interpretation of this treatise<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., <i>Abot</i></i> to which these eight chapters are an introduction.
