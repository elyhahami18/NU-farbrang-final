[Treatise VI] The Soul and Death



Chapter 1

In the essence of the soul and death and what is close to it: Yehuda ben Shaul said. The author said, Our God, may He be blessed and exalted, informed us that the beginning of the human soul is in his heart, with the perfection of the form of his body, as they said (Zechariah 12:1) The burden of the 10th chapter of Israel is that he inclines the heavens and establishes the earth and creates the spirit of man in his midst. And that He put parts to stand in groups. And when He completes, He will separate them, until the number of his souls, which His wisdom obliged to create them, is orphaned, and when He orphans them, He will connect them and between their bodies and their parts, and His prophets gave us the signs and wonders about this, and we soon accepted them. And then we got busy to exist For us it is in the way of study, on the way that we have followed in the other previous articles: and the beginning of what is worthy of inquiry about the very soul, what is it? And it is that I have found human beings divided by itself, wonderful disputes that disturb the hearts, I see that most of them leave memory, and I will bring seven opinions from them, except The first four whose memory precedes, and there will be eleven. Because those four were already tested and refined and all four were lost and voided. And they are spiritual, and you know that the things are from the Creator, and you know that they are from him and speak another and the opinion of the two owners. And since the soul is one of the known things, when he entered it at all Those things, the answer to those articles has already been entered in general, and we don't need to change them, but I will mention these seven, and I say first, I found people who think that the soul is a case of chance, and as it seems to me that which brought them to this article, because it is not They saw it, but they saw its action, and they thought because of its minuteness from those who felt it with the senses, that it was a case of the minutes of cases, and with it five classes were divided, some of them thought it was a self-motivating case, and some thought it was complete for natural rain, and some thought it was a combination of the four naturals, and some thought it called The senses, and some of them believed that it was a case born of the blood. And when I sat down to look at these articles, which are all grouped together by the article that is a case, that the case and the completeness and the connection and the connection and the childbearing in the cases, I found them all false from several sides. One of them, because the accidental thing, this great wisdom did not come from him, and these are the honorable minds in which the world will be fixed, as I remembered in the previous article. And also because the case will not happen in another case, for what is in it from the loss. And here we find the soul in many cases, it will say a wise soul, and a frustrated soul, and it will say a righteous soul, and an evil soul, and it will say that it has love and hatred and desire and foam, and the other well-known manners, and it is not possible with these matters to be a case, but we will see it in this matter From the acceptance of opposites, it is more appropriate to be a bone. And the second I saw people thinking. And the third people considered fire, and I found these second articles still lost, because if there was wind, its nature would be hot and humid, and if these were fire, its nature would be hot and dry, and we do not find it so. And the fourth is the one who said that she is two parts, one part is the instrument of my words, and we are not a bride and he resides in the heart. And the second is essential, and it spreads in the rest of the body and is a bride. And you also adjusted to me because it was a mistake, because the part of this thing was other than the part that is part of the body, there was no place for them to merge, because it is ancient and it is new, and it is a bride and it is not a bride. And these were the verbal part, except for the part that spreads in the body, the rest of the senses will not hear, see, or feel. And it is not in this answer that I answered, that the senses will be little by little, and the bee will speak of them all, when I explained in the first article; But says that what is evident from this article is that there are two souls because each part is alone. And the fifth is the one who said that she is two airs, one of them inside, and the other outside. And it is necessary for this article, that a will will only be fulfilled by drawing the air from outside, and it is believed that it is half, and it is not only to breathe into the warmth of nature in which the soul resides in the heart. When you blow on the fire to keep the bad smoke away from it, you want to say from the fire. And the sixth is the one who thought she was pure blood and was a cloud by himself, when he wrote in his book. And the Torah article (Leviticus 17:11) was mistaken for this because the blood is in the soul. And he did not remember what she said before (there) that the soul of the flesh is in the blood, but it seems that the blood is its abode and center, and in its strength it will show us its strength, and in its weakness it will show us its weakness, and when it rejoices and shows its joy in the thing in which it rejoices, and it shows the blood with it, and when Flee from the sight of a thing that you are afraid of, take it with you. And what the Torah said that the blood is in the soul, is according to the custom of the language, that it calls the thing the name of its dwelling, when wisdom calls it the heart, saying (Proverbs 7:7) A boy without a heart. Because the heart dwells, and the tongue calls a language. In the saying (Genesis 11:1) And let all the earth be one language. For in the language it shall be:

And I agree to trust these things in memory of what those who disagree about the essence of the soul, what it is. And they said, it is more appropriate that it rains, and I found what they said was a coincidence, everyone thinks that it will melt and lose and sink. But those who said that it is from the spiritual, and from its creator alone, and from him and something else, and from two ancient roots, they all think that it will return to its origin from which it was cut, and I have already lost all these articles and the Tolem. But he says that people from those who are called Jews, I found them saying in the Hanots, and the copy reads it, and we answered. With them, the spirit of Reuben will return to Shimon, and then to Levi, and then to Judah, and there are many of them who say, there are times when the spirit of man will be in an animal, and the spirit of an animal in a person, and many things like this madness and confusion, and I looked at what they think brought them to this article, and they found four disturbances, and I I see to their memory, and to answer them, and the beginning is that he holds the spiritual opinion, and the other three opinions, and he who does not know that the people of the change opinion, took it from the second and spiritual opinion, and I have already discovered what is about all of them from the answers and I remembered it. and the second, that they saw many forms of human beings, and that they were similar to the forms of beasts. As those who see him answer like sheep, and evil like animals, and hungry as a dog, and light as a chicken, and the like. And they agreed for the sake of these matters, that these measures were not in humans, until they had the spirits of beasts in them. And may God have mercy on you for most of their frustration, because they think that the human body transforms the soul from its bones, until it becomes a different human soul that was an animal soul. And she turns him from his bones, until he is like beasts, even though his form is human. And it is not enough for them that the soul's essence changes, and they did not establish a true essence for it, until they contradicted their words and its name is the revolution of the body and changes it, and the body changes it and changes it, and this is the departure from the rational: and the third, who bring their words by way of argument, and say that since the Creator judges justly, there was no Brings torment on the wrongdoers, because if it is for a sin that their souls have sinned, while they were in the body that was before their body, and there are many answers to this, you will begin that they forgot the gate of reward that we remembered. Furthermore, because we will ask them about the first issue, do you want to say the beginning of the creation of the soul, if the Creator commanded it to work from the works, if not? And if they say it was not a commandment, the punishments are all nullified, because there was no starting commandment. And if they accept the mitzvah, the soul at that time neither received nor died, and they already admitted that the person will command the future not only the passing, and they will return to our articles in return and leave their agreement, that there is no suffering except for what has passed, and the fourth that they are hung with doubts from the Bible, I saw to remember a few of them and say that they are my words Moshe (Deuteronomy 29:14) For what we slept here with us stands today. And they said this indicates that the spirits of the last are the spirits of the first and therefore they are the ones that are and they are the ones that are not. And the verse simply cancels out what they thought, because it says that what is found is apart from what is not found, and its interpretation is nothing but that it is obligatory for those to whom the words of Moses come, to accept them as accepted by those who are with him. And of them (Psalms 1:1) blessed is the man who did not follow the counsel of the wicked, and they said that because he said he would not go and did not say he would not go, we learned that the punishment for something his soul did was in the first person. And this is the purpose of the error, because the scriptures do not oblige Ashari to be remembered except after he did not go, and they did not oblige him before he did not go. And we see from the scriptures an answer for them, and these were as they said, the reward was for the future victories, not for the passing ones, because they said after him and in his teachings, he would come, and he did not say he came, when they charged the punishment for the past seasons and not for the coming ones, his article did not go and did not say that he will not go. And of them they said (Job 38:14) It shall be turned like sealing clay and they shall stand like a garment, and they believed that they said it shall be turned upon the soul, and they said that this is a teaching that it is always turning in man and beast, and the fools did not understand that he did not say that it was on the earth, because he preceded him to take hold of the wings The earth, and on it he said that it is turned over by the wicked like sealing clay, and they burn it as if it were their clothing, they will not be able to copy from it until God's decree is fulfilled in them. And what are the words of the prophet (Psalms 23:3) My soul will be mischievous. And they thought it was a return from body to body, and the fools did not understand that it is rest and calmness and the silence is from sorrow that was in him, and there is no return after departure, and this is clearly explained in the language of our ancestors, what they said about Samson when he was thirsty And the Creator watered him with water, and his spirit returned and he lived (Judges 15:19) and it no longer went out. And they said about the Egyptian when he was hungry and they fed David, and his spirit returned (1 Samuel 3:12). And they said of the messenger, he is faithful, a messenger is faithful to his senders, and the soul of his master will return (Proverbs 25:13). And they said wisely, the Torah 10 Tamim' restores a soul (Psalms 19:8). And I bear the words of their lightness, and their arrogance reduces them, if I had not feared the sheaah. And at the end of their words they say, "From four spirits in the island of the wind, and I cast away those who are outcasts, and they will live" (Ezekiel 37 ninth'). And says, isn't there something foreign about it? Because he did not say this, but because the winds are quiet for them above and below, and in this island there will be a place where it will be from both sides and from the four winds, which the Creator calls to it, as the disciple said (Job 13:22) and read and I will answer: We complete the sixth article of the book:
