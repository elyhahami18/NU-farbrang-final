We see that in all of the events of our father Jacob's life, there is a type of payback for the debt that he accrued for all of the crooked and roundabout things he did earlier. So the story of the firstborn rights that Jacob acquired, if not by deceit, nevertheless in an unstraightforward manner, came back to his children, as we will see later on. For one, the firstborn rights are taken away from his firstborn son, Reuben, and given to one of his youngest sons, Joseph. Likewise, once the younger Jacob took the firstborn rights from the firstborn Esau, he "merited" that when he sought to marry Rachel, the younger daughter, as a wife, he was given Leah, the firstborn daughter instead.  
Twenty years before this, when he was young, Jacob heard Esau's cry when he found out about the act of trickery to steal the blessing earmarked for him. Trembling and in shock about what happened, Isaac said to his son, Esau: <i>Your brother came with trickery and took your blessing</i> (Genesis 27:35). So we see clearly that Jacob was blamed for the trickery. 
What goes around comes around: Behold, after seven years of work with Laban's flock in order to marry his beloved Rachel, Jacob is given a different wife instead. So, similarly to Esau, Jacob feels compelled to cry out in front of Laban: <i>I was in your service for Rachel; why did you deceive me?</i> It was trickery for trickery! And not only that, Jacob even earned Laban's stinging observation: <i>It is not the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the older</i> (Genesis 29:27). When Laban said to him, "<b>In our place</b> it is not the practice," he was intentionally hinting that our place is different from what is done in your family and in your father's household. In other words, <b>in the place you come from</b>.
The Midrash goes deeper in recounting this event in the most dramatic way possible — when Jacob gets up in the morning, he berates Leah for the trickery she perpetrated against him that night: The whole night, he would call her Rachel, and she would answer; [but] in the morning, <i>behold, it was Leah</i> (Genesis 29:25). He said to her, "You are a trickster, the daughter of trickster." She said to him, "Is there a scribe who does not have students? Did your father accordingly not call you Esau? Yet you answered him. So too, you called me, and I answered you."

After its temporary conquest by Joshua bin Nun, it appears to have returned to being a Jebusite city. And by force of his substantial foundation, and as it sounds from the verses, it was King David who turned it into our Jerusalem. It was also he who decided to establish the Temple in it, even though he was not given permission to actualize the fulfillment of this commandment, as it is known from the word of the prophet. So he was forced to pass it on to his son, Solomon.

Section 13


The homiletic approach has the holiness of Jerusalem predate everything else, even the creation of the world. And, according to the midrash, the <i>even hastiah</i> (foundation stone) is located in the ground of the temple mount; and it is from it that the world was founded and created.
The Aggadah also recounts that it was from the dirt of this place that Adam, the first man, was built.
Beginning at a very late time, close to the second temple period, the temple mount was also called Mount Moriah. This name is mentioned only once in Scripture: <i>Then Solomon began to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah</i> (II Chronicles 3:1).
As is well-known, Chronicles was composed in the second temple period and we have no testimony that even hints that the temple mount was called Mount Moriah during the first temple [period].
As opposed to this, it is known that it was called the Mountain of Mount Zion. But it is probable that the appellation, Mount Moriah, came from a trend that identified [the location of the temple] with the place in which the binding of Isaac occurred. Yet it is only tradition that identifies Mount Moriah with the Land of Moriah (Genesis 22:2) [mentioned in the story of Isaac].
