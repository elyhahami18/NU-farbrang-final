Chapter 1

In this world, man needs company. It is like they said in Berakhot (6b), "The whole world was only created to accompany this one." We understand from this that he needs the company of the creations. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 54a), "[In the case of] someone walking without accompaniment on the road, let him study Torah." And all of this world is called walking on the road. It is as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 21a) about the verse, "When you walk, it will lead you" (Proverbs 6:22), "in this world." So when he has no company, he should occupy himself with Torah [study]. For it is the model of the story of creation and of all the creatures, as they said in Bereishit Rabbah 1. So it comes out that he has the company of all the creation and all of the world. And it is because of this that the world is called, "when you walk" - because walking is another way to say preoccupation. It is as they said in Berakhot (11a), "'And when you walk, etc.' (Deuteronomy 6:7), that is preoccupation with a commandment." And all of this world is a preoccupation. That is why, in the Talmud, the day of death is called [when] his soul rests; as one rests from his preoccupation. And that is why they said in the Yerushalmi (Berakhot 2:4, 17b), "In all of my days, I have never concentrated [in my prayers]" - since preoccupation is the opposite of concentration, as it is found in Berakhot there. And hence full concentration is totally impossible in this world. So that is why Shabbat is called similar to the world to come, since it is the day of rest; while this world is a time of preoccupation. (It is like they said in Avodah Zarah 3b,) "Whoever busies himself on the eve of Shabbat, etc."
