Chapter 1

In this world, man needs company. It is like they said in Berakhot (6b), "The whole world was only created to accompany this one." We understand from this that he needs the company of the creations. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 54a), "[In the case of] someone walking without accompaniment on the road, let him study Torah." And all of this world is called walking on the road. It is as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 21a) about the verse, "When you walk, it will lead you" (Proverbs 6:22), "in this world." So when he has no company, he should occupy himself with Torah [study]. For it is the model of the story of creation and of all the creatures, as they said in Bereishit Rabbah 1. So it comes out that he has the company of all the creation and all of the world. And it is because of this that the world is called, "when you walk" - because walking is another way to say preoccupation. It is as they said in Berakhot (11a), "'And when you walk, etc.' (Deuteronomy 6:7), that is preoccupation with a commandment." And all of this world is a preoccupation. That is why, in the Talmud, the day of death is called [when] his soul rests; as one rests from his preoccupation. And that is why they said in the Yerushalmi (Berakhot 2:4, 17b), "In all of my days, I have never concentrated [in my prayers]" - since preoccupation is the opposite of concentration, as it is found in Berakhot there. And hence full concentration is totally impossible in this world. So that is why Shabbat is called similar to the world to come, since it is the day of rest; while this world is a time of preoccupation. (It is like they said in Avodah Zarah 3b,) "Whoever busies himself on the eve of Shabbat, etc."

3. ... The miracle of Purim was allowed to be written, for it was “the end of all miracles” (Yoma 29a) paralleling the attribute of Yesod-Malchut, which is “the end of the body” (Tikkunei Zohar 17a). And it was the preparatory step for the miracle of Chanukah, which is the only one of the miracles that were not allowed to be written that was [nonetheless] established for all generations. This is because the miracles that were not allowed to be written down have yet to be revealed in their full manifestation, and it is impossible to establish every one of them for all generations. But the miracle of Chanukah is the sum total of all the miracles throughout the period of exile, which cannot be written down, and it was established eternally. And it is only through the light of a candle, which is the light of revealing the holiness of the Yesod [foundation] in the outermost realms, in manifest reality, that also shines its light inward into all manners of confusion. And once this became clear through means other than [written] words of Torah, it continues to be revealed through the specifics of all the myriad forces throughout the entire duration of exile...
