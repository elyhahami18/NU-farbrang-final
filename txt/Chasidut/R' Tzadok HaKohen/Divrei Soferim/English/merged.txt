Divrei Soferim



Chapter 1


A person who is clean of [material] desires, and efforts himself [in divine service] will surely experience a strong sense [of the divine] when he fulfills "the commandments of God are upright, bringing joy to one's heart (Psalms 19:9). And even though this [service] will result in the loss of wealth and other [material benefit], [it is worthwhile] since this is a mitzvah and God's mitzvah is dearer than one's own. But if he feels sorrow, it is a sign that it is not a mitzvah. And this is what the [sages] taught [regarding a debt after the seventh year] in Tractate Gittin [37b] "Rabbah said: [The creditor] may lift [his eyes] until the [debtor] says [nonetheless, I will pay you]." And afterwards, an episode of Rabbah is recounted where [his debtor did not repay and] he was saddened [as a result of his ruling to merely hint at repayment]. And it seems to me that based on this incident where he stood on a matter of Jewish law, that this commandment [to forgive loans in the seventh year] was a command relating to speech [that the creditor] will say "I fogive [the loan]" but this does not apply in practice [as he held that the creditor] will raise [his eyes]. Meaning, the command is not to actually forgive [the loan]. And therefore he was saddened. And even though Rabbah held himself to be a person of average quality [Berakhot 61b], that he still did not [attain the stature to] have his heart entirely hollowed inside him. Nevertheless, he knew in his soul that he was ready to listen to the advice of his good inclination and to overcome the evil inclination to perform the commandments of God with joy  and not to be saddened by it, if it were a mitzvah. And this is only for the remnants whom God calls.

Chapter 16

A Jewish person should not despair from anything, whether in physical matters as it is written (Brachot 10, end of side a) "Even if a sharp sword rests upon a person's neck, he should not refrain himself from the Mercy",  or whether in spiritual matters though he has sunk to the place where he has sunk in a matter which our Sages said (Zohar, Section 1, 219:2) that repentance does not help G-d forfend, or that repentance is difficult, or that he sees himself sink in matters of this world, he should not despair of himself to say he cannot separate himself anymore, because there is no despair at all for a Jewish man, and G-d Blessed be He can help with every matter, and the entire building of the Israelite nation came about after total despair that "Abraham and Sarah were old" [Bereishit 18, 11] and "Who is the One Who said to Abraham, 'she would nurse' etc." [Bereishit 21, 7], that it would not occur to a person to yet believe this and even after the promise of the angel. And Sarah the righteous woman knew and believed that G-d Blessed be He can do everything, and even so "she laughed internally", that it was far for her to believe this with her knowledge of Abraham's advanced age..........as it is written in Bereishit Rabbah (Chapter 48, 17) and her own advanced age,  and if it had been the will of G-d Blessed be He to remember them he would have remembered them from the outset since reducing the miracle is preferred and He does not perform a miracle where it is not necessary, but the truth is "this has emanated from Hashem" [Psalms 118, 23] that the building of the nation should expressly be after the total despair that no person would believe, even Sarah, that she would yet be remembered, for this is for every Israelite person to believe that he should not despair at all because G-d Blessed be He is always able to help and "is anything beyond Hashem?" [Bereishit 18, 14], and one should not question why Hashem did things this way, and so too of the future salvation it is said (Isaiah 53, 1) "who can believe what we have heard? etc.", and so they said (Sanhedrin 97, end of side a) "the son of David will not come until they despair from the redemption", and therefore it says (Isaiah 51, 2) "Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who gave birth to you", that also the basis of your nation's founding (literally, the beginning of your building) was also after despair, and also I found in Tanchuma (commentary on Parshat Va'yeira  [16]) on the verse "And Hashem remembered" [Bereishit 21, 1] this same thing, you should study it there, and it will be helpful (translation of vi'ahanyain?).  
And Abraham our father, upon him be the peace, head of our nation, he is the one who began (literally, opened) this matter of not despairing from anything, when Lot was taken prisoner and all had despaired of saving anything, and therefore the king of Sodom said "take the possessions for yourself" [Bereishit 14, 21] because the kings had despaired and our father Abraham acquired [the possessions] afterward by the change of ownership, and Abraham our father girded himself with 318 of those born in his house to chase after the four kings, and in Nedarim (32, end of side a) [it says] that this is the Gematria of Eliezer, and the meaning of the name is stated explicitly in the Torah (Shemot 18, 4) referencing Moshe our Rabbi, upon him be the peace,  "for the G-d of my father came to my aid and he saved me etc.", that the sword of Pharoah was already on his throat and G-d blessed be He can help even after despair so there should be no despairing from anything, and this is the secret of the number 318 which is in Gematria  the same as the word despair with one added for the Kollel, that is to say that this number [318] is what delivers one from despair and teaches that G-d blessed be He helps with everything that a person thinks to despair of, and it seems to me that this is the meaning of the words of that old lady (Sukka 31, 1) "a woman whose father had three hundred and eighteen slaves etc.", you should study it there, that is to say that she thought perhaps they are of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon (Bava Kama 114a) that outright robbery implies despair of the owners, and in particular the servants of the Exliarch who took by force.......and by Rabbi Nachman and the rabbis with him it was considered a change of ownership and therefore they did not pay attention to her, therefore she said "whose father had etc." that she is from the seed of Abraham that girded himself with 318 of his servants to arouse this matter that there is no despair at all, and why should they not pay attention to her to believe her that she had not despaired at all since she is also from the seed of Abraham our father, trusting in G-d blessed be He as he did, and knows that G-d blessed be He can help her against anything and he should have paid attention to her words and not sit in a stolen Sukkah.
