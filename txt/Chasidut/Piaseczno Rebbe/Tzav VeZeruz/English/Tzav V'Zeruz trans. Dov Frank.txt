The human soul relishes sensation. Not only joy, but simply the emotive experience itself, thus the soul also wants to feel sadness and to cry, which is why men enjoy seeing frightening sights, and hearing heartrending stories in order to bring themselves to cry, all to engender a pathic, stimulating experience. This is an intrinsic, constitutive need of the soul, among all its other constitutive needs. Thus, only the person who incorporates this need into his growth in Torah and prayer protects his soul, unlike those who perform their divine service devoid of emotion. Such people will either be driven to cheap – even forbidden – stimulation or their souls will become emotionally ill from lack of stimulation.
