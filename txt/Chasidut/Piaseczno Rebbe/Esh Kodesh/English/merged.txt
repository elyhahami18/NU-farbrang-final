Esh Kodesh

Preface



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3






We called this book, Holy Fire (<i>Esh Kodesh</i>), since it is a memorial monument to the holy ones thrown into the fire, and for the sake of the messenger that went up in fire. And he was entirely a holy flame that was written in black fire on white fire. And likewise is the name of our honorable holy rabbi, may his memory be blessed, hinted to in it, as is the name of his holy honorable father, the great rabbi, may the memory of the righteous one be blessed, and also the name of his son who died the death of the holy ones while it was still the early days of the war. May there memory be sanctified! 
These flames of holy fire (contents of this book) are in the aspect of Majesty in Strength; they burst out from the preoccupied heart of our rabbi, may the memory of the the righteous one be blessed, in the actual days of the Holocaust and the Destruction that occurred on every street corner [to] every youth and elder, babe and infant. And it is with these flames of fire, that were spoken to encourage his holy people even at the entrance to the open abyss, that our rabbi separated from his congregation on his final path towards the sacrifice. And with [these words], he strengthened their spirit with faith and trust in the Eternal One of Israel. And he arose with the second act of strength and sanctified the name of the Heavens among the masses - he ascended in a chariot of fire towards the Heavens, may his merit protect us and all of Israel, Amen!

Rosh Hashanah

"In distress I called on Yah; Yah answered me and brought me relief"; "Hear my plea; Do not shut Your ear to my groan, to my cry."
In Midrash Kohelet [Kohelet Rabbah] 8, "Rabbi Mona of Shaab and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse as regarding Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. This is analogous to a province that owed taxes to the king. The king dispatched a tax collector from the treasury to collect it. [When he was] at a distance of ten mil, the prominent leaders of the province emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. At a distance of five mil, the middling ones emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. When he neared [and was right outside the province], men, women, and children emerged to greet him, and he forgave it in its entirety, etc."

Chayei Sara

"And the life of Sarah was... years... these were the years of the life of Sarah" (Bereishit 23:1). Rashi explains that the repetition of "years" in each clause indicates that at twenty she was without sin, as she was at one hundred. This phrase, "the years of the life of Sarah," highlights that all her years were equally good. We must understand what this teaches us, for it seems that no other righteous woman in the Torah is described with such greatness. Furthermore, it is puzzling that even though the Torah later uses similar wording regarding Avraham Avinu and Rashi also comments that he was without sin, it does not repeat the phrase "the years of Avraham" to emphasize that all his years were equally good.
The holy books, specifically in the work Ma’or VaShemesh at the beginning of Parashat Va'era by the holy Rebbe Menachem Mendel of Rimanov, explain the Talmudic statement that "the covenant was established through salt" and "the covenant was established through suffering." Just as salt preserves meat when used in the right measure but becomes unbearable when overused, so too suffering must be balanced to be bearable and mixed with mercy.Rashi comments that Sarah’s death is juxtaposed with the Binding of Isaac because upon hearing about it, her soul departed from her body, and she died. The faithful shepherd, Moshe Rabbeinu, juxtaposed Sarah’s death with the Akedah to advocate on our behalf, illustrating that excessive suffering can cause even the greatest soul, like Sarah’s, to leave the body. If Sarah, who was as pure at one hundred as she was at twenty, and whose years were all equally good, could not withstand such intense suffering, how much more so can we not endure.
Additionally, it can be said that Sarah herself internalized the Akedah to such a degree that it caused her soul to depart—also for the sake of Israel. She showed Hashem that Israel cannot withstand excessive suffering. Even those who survive severe suffering often have their strength, spirit, and minds diminished. There is little difference between partial death and total death in such cases.
This explains why the Torah emphasizes "the years of the life of Sarah." It might seem that Sarah failed compared to her previous years by allowing the Akedah to affect her so deeply. However, since she did so for the sake of Israel, the Torah affirms that all her years, including those affected by the Akedah, were equally good. May Hashem have mercy on us, all of Israel, and quickly bring salvation, both spiritually and physically, with revealed kindnesses.

Purim

It is found in the Tikkunei Zohar (57b:4) that Purim is like Yom Kippurim (an alternative way of referring to Yom Kippur). It could be that this also hints to the following: That just like on Yom Kippur, the fast and the repentance on that day are not [dependent] on whether a person wants to them; that he does them only then. Rather, whether one wants to or not, he has to do them because they are a decree of the Holy One, blessed be He. So too with the joy of Purim, it is not only if a person is joyful on his own, or at the very least is able to bring himself to joy, that he must rejoice. Rather, even if he is low and his heart is broken, his mind and all of his spirit trampled, it is a statute that he must, at the very least, bring a spark of happiness to his heart.
And likewise is it from above to below: Just as on Yom Kippur, the essence of the day atones, such that even if one did not complete all of his repentance, Rabbi (R. Yehudah HaNasi) says that [the day] atones for him (Yoma 88); so too is it on Purim: Even if the Jew was not as joyful as he should be, so that it follows that all of his duty on Purim was not carried out; the salvation and joy of Purim [itself] nevertheless has impact upon the Jewish people even then, and acts [upon it].

"You shall sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am the Lord your God." As it is related in the Gemara in Tractate Berachot (28a), when Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai fell ill, his disciples came to visit him, etc. They said to him, "Our rabbi, bless us." He said to them, "May it be the will [of God] that the fear of Heaven be upon you like the fear of flesh and blood," etc. He said to them, "If only you knew, when a person sins, he says 'No one should see me.'"
One must understand - were his students, the holy Tannaim, not filled with fear of Heaven more than fear of flesh and blood? Especially when he said to them "If only you knew when a person sins" - what connection is there between this and his holy students, among whom were Rabbi Eliezer the Great, Rabbi Yose ben Chaninah, etc., and Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, as it is written in Pirkei Avot (2:8). And we have heard from the righteous of the generation, especially the holy elder, the Rebbe Rabbi Elimelech and his holy brother the Rebbe Rabbi Zusha of blessed memory, that they had the fear of angels. And in general, it is difficult to understand how he blessed them with fear of Heaven - that God should give them fear of Heaven - for everything is in the hands of Heaven except for the fear of Heaven.
However, it is known that He does not abandon any of His people. Meaning, when a person comes, God forbid, to a lowly state of sinning, and especially when this causes him to fall further, then God does not abandon him. It is stated in the holy writings that in the full spelling of the word "yetzer" (inclination) are the letters of the Name Shaddai - yud, tzaddi, reish. So that a person should not fall into it, God forbid, He placed the Name Shaddai at its end. When a person reaches the end, the Name does not let him fall further. Thus far his holy words. Therefore, now with this fear - that one should not fall completely into sin, God forbid - it is possible to bless a Jewish person, since he is in God's hands. However, with the supreme level of fear, it is impossible to bless, since this is in the hands of the person himself - he needs to elevate himself to it. And when they said "Our rabbi, bless us," and he saw their intention was that they wanted him to bless them with fear of Heaven, he said to them that he could only bless them with the fear of Heaven of not sinning, but the supreme level of fear, they themselves had to elevate themselves to it.
This is what the verse means when it says "And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God demand of you? Only to revere..." etc., "to walk in all His paths and to love Him..." etc. The fear of not sinning, even God can give you. But what He demands of you is the fear to walk in all His paths and to love Him, etc. - to elevate yourself in all matters.
Behold, even when God forbid God punishes a Jewish person, it is a preparation for this, that He should not abandon him, etc., in order to return him. But since through suffering it is difficult to elevate oneself higher, therefore a person needs to then arouse within himself a will and yearning to elevate himself higher, and also to strive to elevate himself. And then, whether he elevates himself or God forbid not, through this he sweetens the judgment, since the ultimate intent is not for the person to remain at this lower level of fear alone of not sinning. As we have already discussed, God's intent and the ultimate purpose for a Jewish person is not merely that he should not harm others, but rather that through this lower level of fear he should elevate himself higher. And if he does not elevate himself, then on the contrary, through the suffering he becomes shattered and falls, and it becomes impossible for him to elevate.
This is the meaning of "You shall sanctify yourselves" etc. - constantly yearn to become sanctified, and become sanctified more and more, even when you are already holy. And then "for I am the Lord your God" - even the level of judgment, "Elokim," will be drawn into the level of compassionate kindness, "Havayah."

However we must know why it is only in the future that Isaac will say to the Holy One, blessed be He, "Behold, I sacrificed." And why did he not say it with the destruction of the temple and not with all of the calamities of Israel, that the Holy One, blessed be He, should atone for them because "I sacrificed my soul." Yet the actions of the ancestors are a portent for the children, so this was the beginning of the service of the Jewish people. And in all of our service, we say, "The Lord of Abraham, the Lord of Isaac, and the Lord of Jacob, etc." Hence the binding was not only a test just for Isaac. Rather it was the beginning of the service of giving up one's life for God and the Jewish people. But since the test of Abraham and Isaac was one of will and thought that was not totally completed in action — for the angel said to him, <i>"Do not send your hand upon the lad, etc."</i> (Genesis 22:12) — that is why there have been all the actions of the Jews being killed by the idolaters. As that is the opposite, actions without thought, [so] it is the completion of the binding of Isaac. For there, it was the beginning with thought and will, and here, it is the culmination with the deed. That means that the binding [of Isaac] and all of those Jews that were killed afterward is one story.

Shabbat Shuva



For in the Gemara, Chullin 7a, it is found that when Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair went to redeem captives, he said to the Ganai [River], "River, part your water for me." So it said to him, "You are going to perform the will of your Maker and I am going to perform the will of my Maker. It is uncertain whether you will do [it successfully]. But I will certainly do [it successfully]. He said to it, "If you do not part, I will decree upon you that water will never flow through you." The river parted for him, etc. Rav Yosef said, "How great is this man, like Moshe and the six hundred thousand." And what is this answer to the words of the river? Did it not, at first glance, make a strong claim - "You, etc. and I am going to perform the will of my Maker. It is uncertain whether you, etc." And see Maharsha, may his memory be blessed, who is precise about this. But besides his words, may his memory be blessed, it is possible to say that since Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was going for the sake of the Jewish people, as he was going to redeem captives and to save a life, He, may He be blessed, negates, as it were, His will. This is so even with a doubt that one will save a life, we need to desecrate the Shabbat (Yoma 87). Hence even if the river is going to do the will of its Maker, and even if it certain, and that of Rabbi Pinchas be Yair is a doubt - even for a doubt about saving the life of a Jew, the river should have negated its actions and parted. For its actions to do the will of its Maker are not any better than the will of God about keeping the Shabbat. And nevertheless, we violate it even for a doubt [about saving a life].
And it is possible that, that which we pray in the penitential prayers, "O holy Torah, pray pleadingly," that prayer - besides its straightforward meaning - is that since He, may He be blessed, observes the entire Torah, He should also observe this law of the Torah. For how great is the life of a Jew, to the point that according to the law of the Torah, even if there is a doubt that a life can be saved, we need to negate the laws of the Torah. And now a great portion of the Jews are in such great distress and danger, God forbid! And this is [the meaning of], "O holy Torah, pray." As this is the law of the Torah, to save the Jewish people!

Shemini Atzeret

On the eighth day, it shall be a convocation for you, etc. And Rashi explained in the name of the midrash, "It is because all the days of the festival, they offered sacrifices corresponding to the nations, etc. The Omnipresent said, 'I plead with you, make me a small meal, so that I may benefit from you.'" And we should try to understand, why, in fact, a small meal? And had God commanded to offer many sacrifices, would they not have offered them? And also why a small meal specifically on Shemeni Atzeret, after the offering of the seventy bulls, and not on another holiday?
