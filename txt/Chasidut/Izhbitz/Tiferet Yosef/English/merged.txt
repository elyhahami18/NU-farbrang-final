...The Blessed Name flows the light of Divine Will even toward the needs of this world as well, as has been explained “For when I freed your ancestors from the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them or command them concerning burnt offerings or sacrifice (Jeremiah 7:22).” My grandfather questioned how it could be said that they were not commanded about the sacrifices, for isn’t the Torat Kohanim (Leviticus) filled with the laws of sacrifices?
The matter is that, truthfully, when a person stands with great clarity as at Mt. Sinai, at the moment when God spoke the first commandment “I am Yhvh your God,” at that moment they stood with such clarity that it wasn’t even necessary to say even the second commandment. as we learned in Talmud (Shabbat 88b). All of them recognized that the earth and all that’s in it is God’s and how everything is from God. So there was no need for any [animal] sacrifice since the essential purpose of the sacrifice is that a person takes from their wealth and absorbs it in the supernal fire and so sees how the self is absorbed into its source.
However, when a person stands in such clarity and knows how s/he is included in the source, there is no need to bring a sacrifice. Thus we learn in the Zohar (Sh’mini 38a), “[One who gives a gift to the king,] Would s/he take it from the house of the king to give to the king?” It’s not necessary to offer a sacrifice when one realizes that it’s not mine to start with.

Shabbat HaGadol



Pesach



Shabbat Chol HaMoed Pesach




<b>Rav Huna said that Rav said, "On Shabbat that is on the intermediate days of a Festival, whether on Passover or on Sukkot, they read: <i>See, You say to me</i> (Exodus 33:12). They read as the haftara, on Passover, from the portion of the dry bones (Megillah 31a:16)."</b><br>And the content of the dry bones is that God, may He be blessed, asked the prophet Ezekiel: <i>Will these bones live</i> (Ezekiel 37:3). [So] it must be understood, [how] could God, may He be blessed, ask the prophet Ezekiel if he has faith that God, may He be blessed, is able to give them life? For with God, may He be blessed, that which has not been, can be; is it not all the more so [about] that which has been?!? Rather, it is that He asked him whether it was in the realm of his comprehension, meaning if he knows it from the understanding of what he can comprehend. And Ezekiel answered Him: <i>You know</i>. That is that my comprehension is also from You, and in the next moment, You are able to give me such comprehension that I could understand with my comprehension how it is that they are full of life. And God, may He be blessed, answered him: <i>Come, O ruach [breath or spirit], from the four winds, and breathe into these slain, etc.</i> — the dry bones say: <i>Our bones are dried up, our hope is gone; we are doomed</i> (Ezekiel 37:11). That is since in all of the salvations that come to man if it is not within his comprehension and he did not previously have a link to the Holy One, blessed be He, about this salvation, then he has no share in it and is not considered living at all. And about this, God, may He be blessed, said to the prophet Ezekiel that even though the dry bones say, "Our bones are dried up, our hope is gone" — meaning, even though it appears to them from their perspective that there is no hope for them — it is nevertheless not possible that there is no hope for the Jewish people. And that is why He said, "Come, O spirit, from the four winds, and breathe into these slain." As within a man, there is the life force, the spirit, and the soul. And the soul is completely from the higher ones, and no sin or blemish reaches it. It is as we say [in the morning blessings], "My God, the soul that You have placed in me is pure." And the life force is the moisture of the bones which remains in the grave, while the spirit is the intermediary between the life force and the soul. And that is [the meaning of] that which He said, "Come, O spirit, from the four winds, and breathe into these slain." And their souls are, as it were, a portion of the divine above, as it is written: <i>He blew into his nostrils a living soul</i> (Genesis 2:7). And it is found (in the Sefer HaKaneh), "One who blows, blows from within himself." It follows that he sees how he has a connection with God, may He be blessed. And even though he does not feel it with his comprehension, nevertheless, since the Jewish people has complete faith that it has a connection with God, may He be blessed, it is aroused from this to also see with its comprehension how it has a connection with God, may He be blessed. So it is not possible with it that there should be no hope. Hence it can see that even its garments are full of life as well.
