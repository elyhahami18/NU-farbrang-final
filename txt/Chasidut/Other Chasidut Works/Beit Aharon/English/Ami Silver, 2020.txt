Chanukah

























“The Holy Blessed One is called a candle, and Israel is called a candle. And the Holy Blessed One said, ‘since your light is My light, and My light is your light, let us walk together and light up Zion’. This is as it is written, ‘arise, My light, for your light has arrived’”
It is written, “for with You is the source of life, in Your light we will see light” (Psalms 36:10). For every member of Israel must first awaken themselves through the light of the Blessed God that is within them. For each and every one possesses this, each according to their own state and level. But it is merely buried and covered up by nonsense and worldly vanities. And one must first awaken themselves with all their strength, to cause this light to shine, each according to their own level. And then, the light from above will reach them to cause them to shine more and more. And this is [the meaning of the words] “in Your light” (Psalms 36:10) meaning in the light of the Blessed God that is within us, “we will see light” (ibid) referring to the light of abundance that pours upon one from above. And [the Karliner Rebbe] spoke above this in terms of the statement from the Holy Zohar: “The white light does not dwell until there is a dark light below.” As we see, that the bottom of a candle is black, and there is a white light that rests upon the black light from above. And this relates to what is mentioned in a number of places in the Holy Zohar, “the darkness of the morning.” For before the light of day arrives, it becomes increasingly dark, as we see with our own eyes. And likewise within a person. For the arousal from below is called “a black light”, for a person needs to awaken themselves specifically in their time of darkness. As the verse says, “and she rises when it is still night” (Proverbs 31:15). And when one is roused sufficiently, then a white light from above rests upon them. And this is [the meaning of] “arise, My light” - the black light from below - “for your light has arrived” - the white light from above is ready to pour upon you. And what is the meaning of “arise” [kumi]? For a person needs to be a complete edifice [komah shleima]. And this is [the meaning of], “arise [kumi] My light” - you shall seek to cause your entire stature to shine.
