Introduction



Kuntres Meirat Einayim



Section 1



Section 2

The soul of the Baal Shem Tov was so high that it was impossible for it to enter this world if his father had had any physical desire.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There is a classic teaching, stretching as far back as the Midrash, that the thoughts of the parents during marital relations affect the nature of the children who are born. The soul of the Baal Shem Tov so transcended physicality that he could only be born to elderly parents, who no longer had physical desires.</i> Therefore, his father was one hundred years old when the Baal Shem Tov was born. His desires had already been annulled, and the Baal Shem Tov was only born with G-d’s help.<br><i>Imrei Noam</i>

Section 3

A soul like that of the Baal Shem Tov comes into this world once in a thousand years.<br><i>R. Yisroel of Koshnitz, in the name of the Tzaddikim of Karlin</i>

Section 4

The Baal Shem Tov said that his soul did not want to descend into this world because of the poisonous serpents in each generation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the time of the Baal Shem Tov, this most likely refers to members of the <i>Haskala</i>, the nascent “Jewish Enlightenment” movement.</i> For he [feared that] would not be able to stand against them, G-d forbid, and that they would upset him to the point that he could not function. Therefore, [heaven] gave him sixty warriors – the souls of Tzaddikim – to protect him. One of them was [Rabbi Meir Margoliot] the author of <i>Meir Nesivos</i>, and others like him.<br><i>Nesiv Mitzvosecha, Nesiv HaTorah</i> 1:13

Section 5

The Baal Shem Tov had one disciple [who was so great] that anyone who came within four feet of him when he prayed would die, because of the great holiness of the Shechinah that rested upon him.<br><i>From the personal manuscripts of Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac of Komarna</i>

Section 6



Section 7



Section 8



Section 9

Rabbi Dov Ber (the Maggid) of Mezritch did not want to subjugate himself to the Baal Shem Tov and come to see him. It was only due to his extremely poor health that he sought the Baal Shem Tov’s help and treatment. And so, the Baal Shem Tov began his recovery through prayers, supplications to G-d, and miracles. Eventually, he transmitted to him all of the wellsprings of his wisdom, so that the Maggid was worthy to become the leader of the generation. The light of his holiness still shines via his disciples from generation to generation. From their words we live, until the coming of the Redeemer, may it be soon in our days. The Baal Shem Tov had to show him miracles in order to draw him under his wings.<br><i>Tiferes Shlomo, rimzei Purim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See also, <i>In</i><i> Praise of the Baal Shem Tov,</i> side 37(?).</i>

Section 10

I heard that when Rabbi Dov Ber saw the Baal Shem Tov eat, it seemed that he ate like an angel, and not a human being. And once, he saw that he wasn’t eating like an angel, because he saw him eat like a human being.<br>Ohr HaChochma, Beshalach

Section 11

When the Maggid of Mezritch wanted to take leave of the Baal Shem Tov, the latter opposed and delayed him for a longer time. When the Maggid asked the Baal Shem Tov why he kept him, he replied that his mind was like a flowing spring, and the more you draw from a spring, the more it flows.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"></i><br><i>Lev Sameach, Bereishis,</i> p. 6

Section 12

When the Baal Shem Tov would study Torah with his holy students, they would be surrounded by fire, and the ministering angels would gather around them, and they would hear the voices and thunder [of Mount Sinai], and hear the words “I am the L-rd your G-d,” from the mouth of G-d. This is very famous.<br><i>Heical HaBracha, Va’eschanan</i>

Section 13



Section 14

Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye, author of <i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, was also opposed to the path of the Baal Shem Tov at first, though he eventually bound himself to the Baal Shem Tov with great love and awe. Though there are many versions of how this came about, the author of <i>Sivchei HaBesht</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The first book of stories about the Baal Shem Tov, published in 1814, 55 years after his death. Rabbi Yaakov Yosef passed away in 1782.</i> relates an account that he heard directly from Rabbi Yaakov Yosef.<br>The first time that Rabbi Yaakov Yosef prayed in a house where the Baal Shem Tov was staying, he began to weep in the middle of his prayers more than ever before in his life. He realized that his feelings did not originate in himself, but came through the influence of the Baal Shem Tov. And so, he attached himself to the Baal Shem Tov in love.<br>Because of this [source], I did not copy here the lengthy stories from the books <i>Notzer Tenah<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">By Shimon Rebi, published in Krakow, 1899.</i></i> or <i>Ma’asiyot u’Ma’amarim Yikarim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">By Yeshaya Wolf Tzikernik, published in Zhitomer, 1903.</i><br><i>Tzror HaChayim, </i>p.<i> </i>10d

Section 15



Section 16

In the city of the Baal Shem Tov lived a brilliant scholar, an expert in the entire Talmud and legal codes, who refused to listen to the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, and did not believe in his lofty perceptions. However, the Baal Shem Tov wanted dearly to claim him for a student.<br>Once, this scholar learned a very complex law and a certain Tosephos<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Thirteenth century commentary on the Talmud.</i> that he could not understand. And though he devoted great mental energy in trying to understand it, he was unsuccessful. This troubled him greatly.<br>One night, in a dream, he saw that they were lifting him up to the supernal worlds, taking him into ever more recondite chambers, until he could no longer see due to the great supernal illumination, and had to shut his eyes. Finally, they brought him to one inner chamber and said to him, “Open your eyes.” He opened them and beheld many great sages and Tzaddikim sitting and studying Torah, with the Baal Shem Tov sitting at the head of them all. The Baal Shem Tov said to him, “Why are you having so much trouble understanding the Tosephos. The answer is as follows…”<br>When the scholar awoke in the morning, he took his Gemara and looked over the words of the Tosephos. He saw that the Baal Shem Tov’s answer was remarkably clear. Nevertheless, he still thought that it was only a dream. When the holy Shabbos arrived, he went to the Third Meal<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Seudah Shelishit</i>, held before sundown at the conclusion of Shabbos – traditionally a time when Chasidim gather together with their Rebbes to sing and hear words of Torah.</i> of the Baal Shem Tov. As soon as he walked into the house, the Baal Shem Tov said to him, “Welcome! Did you look over explanation of the Tosephos that I told you to see if it is true?” From that day on, he attended to the Baal Shem Tov and became a great Chasid.<br>I heard this from honest individuals.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i> 2, p. 16a

Section 17

The Zohar says: “If a person is worthy, they give him the <i>nefesh-</i>soul. If he is worthy, they give him the <i>ruach-</i>soul. If he is more worthy, they give him the <i>neshama-</i>soul. If he is more worthy, they give him the <i>neshama</i> to the <i>neshama-</i>soul.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 2:94b</i> Rabbi Mordechai of Chernobyl said that the Baal Shem Tov attained the <i>neshama</i> to the <i>neshama-</i>soul.<br>It is known that the <i>nefesh</i> comes from the world of Asiyah (Action), the <i>ruach</i> from <i>Yetzirah</i>, the <i>neshama</i> from <i>Beriyah</i>, and the <i>neshama</i> to the <i>neshama</i> from <i>Atzilus.</i> The soul of Baal Shem Tov was from the world of <i>Atzilus</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The highest of the four spiritual worlds. See the work <i>Zohar Chai</i>, by the Komarno Rebbe: “Our Master the Baal Shem Tov merited the <i>nefesh-</i>soul from the world of <i>Atzilus</i>, and our Master the Arizal merited the <i>ruach</i>-soul [from the world of <i>Atzilus</i>].”</i><br><i>Tzror HaChaim</i>, p. 29a, in the name of the Trisker Rav

Section 18

When the Baal Shem Tov visited the home of Rabbi Meir of Premishlan and his son Rabbi Aharon Aryeh, there was an infant lying in a crib. The Baal Shem Tov asked the infant, “Who am I?” and he answered, “Master is the G-dly Rabbi Isaac Luria.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Isaac Luria, the Arizal, lived in sixteenth century Tzefas in northern Israel, and was one of the greatest Kabbalists in history.</i> The Baal Shem Tov replied, “So you shall live, and the verse shall be fulfilled in you: ‘…My spirit that is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, nor from of the mouth of your seed’s seed, says the L-rd, from now and forever.” (Isaiah 59:21)<br><i>Ma’aseh Yechiel, Bereishis</i> 4

Section 19



Section 20

Rabbi Nachman said that descendents of the Baal Shem Tov<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Nachman was himself a great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov.</i> are particularly accustomed to crying out to G-d at all times. This is because they are descendents of King David, whose whole life was devoted to this – that he should break his heart constantly to G-d. This is the essence of the Book of Psalms.<br><i>Likutey Moharan </i>II:100

Section 21

Another positive trait of our Rabbi, the Baal Shem Tov, was that the light of the Messiah began to shine with him – a tradition we have received from Tzaddikim, the foundations of the world. The Baal Shem Tov himself asked the Messiah, “When will Master come?” and the latter replied, “When your teachings are known throughout the world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“It is known that the Messiah told the Baal Shem Tov that his coming depends upon the spreading of the Baal Shem Tov’s disciples throughout the world. Therefore, whenever a book based upon the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov is introduced to the world, it hastens the redemption.” (<i>Divrei Shalom</i>, p. 12a)</i> Thus G-d arranged for many great Jewish sages to become his students.<br><i>Divrei Shalom,</i> Introduction

Section 22

The holy Rabbi of Kaidnov said that the whole path of the Baal Shem Tov is to learn how to draw upon oneself the type of worship that will be practiced in the Messianic Era. For from the time of the Baal Shem Tov onward, sparks of the Messiah’s soul are manifest in the leaders of each generation. This is as the Talmud says: “Two thousand years of the days of the Messiah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 97a: “The world will exist for six thousand years: Two thousand desolate (i.e., without Torah), two thousand of Torah, and two thousand of the days of the Messiah (i.e., in readiness for the Messiah).”</i> “<i>Alaphim</i>” (Thousands) has the meaning of “Teaching,” as in “And I will teach you wisdom – <i>ve’a’alephcha chochmah</i>” (Job 33:33). He should teach himself the path of devotion that will be practiced in the days of the Messiah. In general, the entire path of Hasidism revolves upon these two wheels: humility and joy.<br><i>Zecher Tzaddik</i>, p. 10a

Section 23



Section 24

The great sages from the time of the Baal Shem Tov until the complete revelation of the Messiah are an illumination of the Messiah, as is known.<br><i>She’eris Yisroel</i>, <i>Sha’ar Hiskashrus </i>4:43

Section 25

The holy rabbi of Ruzhin said, many people claim that the he was called the Baal Shem Tov because he used holy Names,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“Baal Shem Tov” literally means, “Master of the Good Name.” The Baal Shem Tov used these names for contemplative and healing purposes.</i> but this is not the case. Rather, “The Tzaddik rules with the fear of G‑d” (II Samuel 23:3), for “G‑d decrees and the Tzaddik annuls.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 16b.</i> He was called the Baal Shem because he annulled many decrees issued by G‑d against all the Jews, as it were.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the words “Master of the Name” – Baal Shem – are read as “Master of HaShem (G‑d),” for the Tzaddik has the power to annul heavenly decrees.</i><br><i>Yeshuos Yisroel</i>, 2:6

Section 26



Section 27

My teacher and father-in-law, Rabbi Abraham Mordechai of Finshtov told me that once, one of the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov asked our Master, “What will be my livelihood?” The Baal Shem Tov answered him, “You will be a cantor.” The disciple said, “But I can’t sing!” And the Baal Shem Tov replied, “I will bind you to the World of Melody.” My father-in-law told me that he knew that man, and said that there was not another cantor in the entire world equal to him.<br>Once, this cantor came to our Rabbi, Rebbe Elimelech of Lizensk. An argument ensued between the Rebbe and his son, the Tzaddik, Reb Elazar, over whether or not to honor the cantor with <i>Kabbalas Shabbos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">“Receiving the Shabbat”; i.e. leading the Friday night prayers.</i> Rebbe Elimelech was afraid that the cantor would disrupt him from his holiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, they were afraid that the cantor would not sing well, or that he was on a low spiritual level, that would be reflected in his voice. This would disturb the spiritual attachment of Rebbe Elimelech.</i> The Cantor had two men who accompanied him: a bass singer, and another singer.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Yiddish, “<i>meshorer zinger.</i>” Perhaps, one who would sing a harmony line.</i><br>After the debate, they decided to honor the cantor with his two accompanists. This was out of their great fear of the holiness of the Baal Shem Tov, for the cantor was known as “the Cantor of the Baal Shem Tov.” Out of respect, they were forced to honor him, and whatever would be, would be.<br>When the cantor began to receive the Sabbath, Rebbe Elimelech sent word that the second accompanist should leave, and only the cantor and the bass singer should sing together. Afterward, he ordered them both to stop, for he was afraid that he would be completely annihilated in the great light and supernal holiness and illuminations that they opened up for him through their singing.
On subsequent Sabbaths, the Rebbe showed great honor to the cantor,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This may imply that he honored him to sing songs at the Shabbat table.</i> but he would not let him pray before the congregation, out of fear, as we explained.<br>From the Manuscripts of R. Yitzchok Isaac of Komarna
After Shabbat, Rebbe Elimelech invited the cantor to tell him about the holy level of the Baal Shem Tov. The cantor told him awesome things that no one has ever heard before. The main thing was about the Baal Shem Tov’s fear and love [of G-d], and how he would perform soul-ascensions to all the worlds, while fully conscious and without agitation, and gaze in all the chambers of Torah and the Divine Chariot. And that when he would recite the Great <i>Hallel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Psalm 136, that praises G-d for the various miracles he performed for the Jewish people.</i> he would not say the verses until he saw the angel [that recites that verse] and heard the exquisiteness of his song, and recited the verse with him. He related the awesome holiness and sanctity of the Baal Shem Tov, from the day of his birth, and how he would speak to the souls of Tzaddikim and with Elijah the Prophet, and especially with the G-dly Arizal,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yitzchok Luria (1534-1572), one of the most influential Kabbalists in history.</i> who was with him constantly.<br>Once, the Baal Shem Tov asked the Arizal why he had taught mystical secrets in an open manner, and not in terms of worship.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">All of Chasidic teachings are based upon Kabbalistic principles. However, Chasidism is primarily concerned with the spiritual transformation of the individual, and clothes these principles within the elements of practical religious life, such as prayer, study, ritual observance, repentance, etc.</i> The Arizal answered that had he lived another two years, everything would have been rectified.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Arizal passed away at the age of 39. Most of his teachings were delivered during the two-year period that he lived in Tzefat, Northern Israel.</i><br>The cantor spoke about the Baal Shem Tov’s soul-ascensions while his body lay still. And how he would speak with the Messiah, and with the Faithful Shepherd (Moses), and what they would answer him. How he was an expert in the “Work of Creation,” and the “Work of the Chariot,” and in the entire Torah, and in the language of every creature, and the language of the angels, and how he was filled with love and fear of G-d, and all possible virtues, piety, humility, and love of Israel.<br>Rabbi Elimelech commented on this that all the spiritual attainments attributed to the Arizal also applied to the Baal Shem Tov, and even more. Only, that which is written about the Arizal is a drop in the ocean compared to who he really was.<br><i>From the Manuscripts of R. Yitzchok Isaac of Komarna</i>

Section 28

The cantor also told R. Elimelech how every Friday afternoon, during the <i>mincha</i> prayer, tens of thousands of souls would gather around the Baal Shem Tov, and he would fix them and raise them all to their source.

Section 29

Afterward, as the conversation continued, the cantor told Rabbi Elimelech how the Baal Shem Tov could gaze from one end of the earth to the other. Once, when his students were sitting before him, the Baal Shem Tov chuckled a little, as he was wont. They asked him why he chuckled, and he said that in a certain city in a very distant land, a nobleman spent several years building a beautiful castle. Just now, a Tzaddik went to pray the afternoon prayers, and it started to hail very heavily, so that he had to run and take shelter in that castle. When the Tzaddik left for the synagogue, the palace collapsed. “How can I not laugh over how much G-d’s direction of the world is hidden? The main purpose of this great building was only to give shelter to this Tzaddik for a short while, and through this, the Tzaddik rectified all of the stones and all of the sparks [of holiness] that were in them. Why, then, did they need to remain standing? That is why they immediately collapsed.”<br>Later, we saw in the newspaper the story of this building, and its unexplainable collapse. And it happened exactly at that hour [the Baal Shem Tov laughed].<br><i>From the Manuscripts of R. Yitzchok Isaac of Komarno</i>

Section 30

He told him that when the Baal Shem Tov would look at any object, such as a bench or a table, he could tell all the thoughts that the craftsman had when he made that object. Rabbi Elimelech was astounded by this.<br><i>From the Manuscripts of R. Yitzchok Isaac of Komarno</i>


Section 31

Then, the cantor stood up and swore that he once learnt Torah from the Baal Shem Tov, and fired burned around them until they were so purified that they heard the Torah from our Master like Israel received it at Mount Sinai, with thunder and lightening and the mighty blasts of the shofar. It was exactly like Mount Sinai! 
For the sounds [of Mount Sinai] never ceased, being Divine; however, a person needs holiness and purity [to hear them].<br>Rabbi Elimelech replied, “I have not achieved that, though it comes as no surprise, for the service and holiness of our Master Israel [Baal Shem] was extremely great. Especially, in that his holy practices were in that pure place, the Nestir river, and from Achiya HaShiloni.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov learned Torah from the prophet Achiya HaShiloni, who lived in the land of Israel during the First Temple Period</i> Fortunate is the person who merits this.”<br>The G‑d-fearing who hear this will understand that all the above mentioned levels were attained by Rabbi Elimelech, or ones similar to them.<br><i>From the Manuscripts of R. Yitzchok Isaac of Komarno</i>

Section 32

Some time after, the cantor died. One Friday afternoon, within the thirty days [of mourning], his bass accompanist returned home after bathing and immersing in the mikvah. “Hurry!” he said to his wife. “Call the burial society and prepare …, for in heaven, they are honoring my cantor to greet the Sabbath, and he refuses to do so without me. He lay down on his bed and died.<br><i>From the Manuscripts of R. Yitzchok Isaac of Komarno</i>

Section 33



Section 34

Once, a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov accompanied him to the mikvah in the depths of the winter, when the icicles were hanging from the rooftops. Using mystical intentions,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yichudim</i> – mystical Unifications.</i> they immediately heated up water in the mikvah, for all the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov could do this – to warm a mikvah until it was very hot. The Baal Shem Tov stood in the mikvah for quite some time, until the candle began to go out. The disciple said to him, “Our Rabbi, the candle is about to be extinguished!” The Baal Shem Tov replied to him, “Take an icicle and light it. The One who told oil to burn will tell this to burn.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon the Talmud, <i>Ta’anis</i> 25a “One Friday afternoon, [Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa] saw that his daughter was upset. ‘Why are you upset, my daughter?’ he asked. She answered, ‘By mistake, I took a bottle of vinegar instead of one of oil and used it for the Shabbos lights.’ ‘What difference does that make to you?’ he replied. ‘The One who told oil to burn will tell the vinegar to burn!’ The vinegar burned the entire day, and they used a flame from it for Havdalah.”</i> The icicle lit and burned until they returned home a few hours later. When the disciple arrived home, only a little bit of water remained in his hand.<br><i>Notzer Chesed</i>, chapter 6


Section 35

Once, the Baal Shem Tov was outside the city with his students, and the time for the afternoon prayer arrived. His disciples said to him, “There is no water to wash our hands for prayer.” He took his walking stick and struck the earth, and a spring of water burst from the ground. It flows until today, near Mezebuzh, and is called after his name, even by the non-Jews. The water has the power to heal a person of fever immediately.<br>The Baal Shem Tov did many miraculous things, the likes of which were not seen since the days of the Tannaim, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa. And all of it was due to his constant attachment to G‑d.<br><i>Notzer Chesed</i>, chap. 6

Section 36



Section 37



Section 38



Section 39



Section 40



Section 41

Once, when the Baal Shem Tov was in a certain place, he opened the window on a cold winter day and said, “I see here a great light from a Tzaddik that lived hundreds of years ago.” However, the place was a garbage heap, for the house had long since collapsed. From here we see that the holiness of the Baal Shem Tov will last forever, and is impossible to extinguish.<br><i>Toldos Adam, remazim l’Pesach.</i>


Section 42



Section 43

The holy Rabbi Yitzchok of Nechshiz, author of <i>Toldos Yitzchok</i>, said in the name of his father, that he does not take seriously any stories told about Tzaddikim, for many are false and filled with mistakes. Not so, however, the stories told about the Baal Shem Tov. Because even if it didn’t actually happen, the Baal Shem Tov always could have done it.<br><i>Zichron Tov</i>, p. 9b

Section 44

The Holy Rabbi of Kobrin said, “We must believe all the stories, miracles and wonders attributed to the Baal Shem Tov. We should believe that even if they didn’t happen, they could have happened.”<br><i>Imros Tahoros</i>, p. 34

Section 45

“If a person were to come and tell me, “I saw the Baal Shem Tov build a ladder and climb to heaven alive, physically, in his clothing,” I would believe him. For whatever they say about the Baal Shem Tov is possible to believe.”<br>The Seer of Lublin. From a letter of the <i>Da’as Torah</i>

Section 46



Section 47



Section 48

The great sage Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Lubavitch, author of <i>Tzemach Tzedek</i>, said in the name of his father (the Baal HaTanya), that the Maggid of Mezritch was able to imbue a one day old child with the supernal fear [of Heaven], and that the Baal Shem Tov was able to imbue even inanimate objects with this fear.<br><i>Beis Rebbe</i>, p. 90b

Section 49

There are Tzaddikim, such are Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and our Master, Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (the Baal Shem Tov) whose souls were a burning fire with an awesome light, yet they had no ego at all. They humbled themselves in the light of wisdom before every Jew, with unity and love, in complete equality. Through this, they annulled all the Harsh Judgments, for it impossible for the <i>kelipot</i>, to attach themselves to their light. Their service was to bind Malchus together with Chochmah and Binah, though with the worship of burning fire, which is the truest form of divine service.<br><i>Nesiv Mitzvosecha</i>, <i>Nesiv Emunah, Shevil </i>3:24

Section 50

Our master the Baal Shem Tov said to his disciple, the Rabbi of Kalamaya, “I love the [Jew] who is least significant in your eyes more than you love your only son.”<br><i>Leket Imrei Peninim</i>, p. 208b

Section 51

They once asked the Baal Shem Tov, “Why is it that although we study Torah, pray and perform mitzvos and good deeds, our prayers remain above; yet your prayers and words are heard in heaven, for we see that your supplications bear fruit.”<br>He answered them with a parable. There was a king’s son who became lost, and found himself in a field of grazing flocks. He was very hungry, thirsty and tired. A shepherd found him and invited him to his home. But what does a poor shepherd have to host him graciously? He took the cleanest and best piece of cloth from his knapsack and spread it on the table. Then, he lay the prince down on the ground on a clean, white blanket. [For the poor man had nothing else with which to honor the prince, neither bread to put on the tablecloth, nor pillow and pillowcase to put on the blanket, but he did what he could do with great honor and courtesy.] Later, when the prince returned home, he summoned the shepherd before him, and exalted him higher than all the other noblemen. They asked the prince, “Why do you exalt this shepherd so much? We always do your will in whatever task you appoint us.” But the prince answered, “All the honor and prestige that I bestow upon him is only because he gave me a clean, white sheet, and a white blanket on the earth.”<br>This is what the Baal Shem Tov said. Understand these words, for they are very profound.<br><i>Shoshana l’Dovid, Tehilim</i> 2

Section 52



Section 53



Section 54

The rabbi of the town Sadeh Lavan, author of VaShev HaKohen, was a great opponent of the Baal Shem Tov. So much so that he ordered all the people of his city never to give the Baal Shem Tov a place to stay, should he come to town. And this is precisely what happened. When the Baal Shem Tov once visited the town of Sadeh Lavan, not one Jew let him into his home, and he was forced to leave. After he departed, the rabbi was presented with a question concerning a women’s issue, which he permitted. Later that night, he saw in a sefer what seemed to be the very same question, and that it was, in fact, forbidden. He immediately sent a message that it was forbidden, but it was too late.<br>The rabbi became extremely agitated, for he feared G-d greatly. He became so upset over the terrible error he had caused that, in his bitterness, he nearly lost his mind. His family turned to doctors, but not one of them could help. Then, they heard that not far from the town of Mezhbuz, lived an expert in incantations, and they took the rabbi to see him. On the way, however, they met some men. When these men saw that they were taking a great man to an enchanter, they said, “It would be much better if you take him to the Baal Shem Tov, since you are not far from Mezhibuz.” Now, even though they were great opponents of the Baal Shem Tov, as their father had instilled in them, they still heeded these words and traveled to Mezhibuz.<br>Immediately, they noticed a change in the rabbi’s condition, which continued to improve the whole length of the journey. When they finally arrived in Mezhibuz, he had completely regained his composure, and he went in to see the Baal Shem Tov with a clear and settled mind, like any other man. The Baal Shem Tov took a sefer and showed him that he had actually judged the case that had come before him correctly. He had not made a mistake at all. However, because he did not want to see the Baal Shem Tov when he was in his city, it was arranged that he should to go to Mezhibuz to meet him there.<br><i>From a letter of the rabbi of Mezhibuz</i>

Section 55

I heard from my teacher and father-in-law, who was the chief disciple of Rabbi Yechiel Michal of Zlotichov, that once when the Baal Shem Tov was traveling on the road, he stepped into a wooded area to pray the afternoon prayer. His disciples were dumbfounded to see him hitting his head against a tree, crying and screaming. Afterward, they asked him what had happened. He explained that he had seen, with divine inspiration, that in the generations before the coming of the Moshiach there would be a multitude of rabbis, and that they would be the very ones who would impede the redemption.<br><i>Otzar Chayim</i>, p. 134c

Each true Tzaddik has such a person opposing him, who obstructs him from accomplishing his holy goals.</i> For they have whatever exists in the realm of holiness. The Baal Shem Tov saw this trouble in the last generation and cried out over it. For because of these “thorns,” and their strange and distorted ways, he was unable to fix the souls of Israel by means of Torah study and Divine service.<br>Indeed, every Tzaddik and Chasid has an opposing force, which draws to itself all the rejected souls. At times, the wicked are able to overcome the Tzaddik.<br><i>Notzer Chesed</i>, chap. 2:4

Section 57

The great scholar, author of the sefer <i>Kitzos HaChoshen</i>, once asked the holy Rabbi Tzvi of Zidichov: “What is the difference between one day and another? For from the day the Baal Shem Tov became known, the number of Chasidim who follow him has multiplied. However, the Baal Shem Tov bases himself upon the roots and foundations of the teachings of the Arizal, yet we don’t find that any special groups attached themselves to the Arizal. What did the Baal Shem Tov innovate in the roots of Chasidus that attracts such a large following, with groups in every city?
Rabbi Tzvi answered him with a fine parable. Once, the citizens of a certain country had to appoint a king. Now, they heard that in a very distant land, there was remarkable man – towering in stature and wisdom, beautiful to look upon, with flowing hair pure as wool. He was complete with every virtue, and there was no other as fit as he for the kingship.<br>However, because it was so far away, it was impossible for them to get a detailed picture of each of his merits, though they did have an overall image of his wondrous virtues. Still, many of the townspeople could not grasp or comprehend the essence of the matter. Finally, someone who had been in that place, and had seen that man with his own eyes, came to them and was able to describe him in every detail. His words entered the hearts of a number of the townsfolk, who could understand him. However, the majority of the people still could not understand everything based upon testimony alone. Finally, one wise man actually brought that man and set him before them, so that all who desired could see him. Then, multitudes flocked to him and devoted themselves to him in love, and set a crown of monarchy on his head, for they saw for themselves and they understood with their own minds that he was fit to be king.
The parable can be understood as follows. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his companions, in the Holy Zohar and especially in the two Idras,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Idra Rabbah </i>and Idra<i> Zutra</i>; two parts of the Zohar.</i> were the first to reveal a little of “G‑d’s secrets to those who fear Him” (Psalms 25:14). However, they greatly hid the meaning of their words. Thus it remained until the “World of Repair” was revealed in the generation of the Arizal. For he came to make known and explain that which Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his companions had concealed. However, all the holy words of the Arizal deal with supernal lights and supernal worlds, and are not graspable by every person. All his words are in the highest heavens, and relate to spiritual matters, and the multitude cannot become enlightened by them. Finally, our Master and Teacher, the Rabbi of the entire Diaspora, the holy Baal Shem Tov, revealed Divinity even in this lowly world, in each and every detail, and specially, in human beings. He showed how everything – every limb and gesture – is a garment for a Divine power hidden within it. So too, with everything in the world, for there is no place devoid of Him. And he revealed the great power of Tzaddikim, who liken the form to its Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. who see within the forms of creations, and especially the human form, a reflection to supernal realities, as the verse says: “From my flesh, I will behold G‑d” (Job 19:26).</i> For there is no movement or word that does not contain awesome and wondrous unifications, and every person is created upon this earth in order to achieve greatness and wonders, and to act in this world, while alluding to the Supernal world. He taught us how to bind ourselves in <i>devekus</i> to G‑d with every action – even the mundane conversation, as it says: “‘And their leaves shall not wither’ – this refers to the common talk of Torah scholars.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkot</i> 21b.</i> Thus, he brought the king before our eyes – the King of kings, the Holy One, may He be blessed.<br><i>Divrei Tzaddikim</i>

Section 58

From the year 1775<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Three years after the death of R. Isaac Luria, the Arizal.</i> and onward, most of the world was still groping in the dark [over the study of Kabbalah] and many opponents challenged its study. Many of those who did study this wisdom were unaware as to how to deal with its abstract concepts, and they even stumbled in anthropomorphism, G‑d forbid.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they began to imagine that the spiritual concepts found in Kabbalah, many of which are explained in images drawn from human physiology, were actually describing the physical proportions of G‑d, G‑d forbid.<br></i> Until G‑d sent us the holy soul of the Baal Shem Tov, who enlightened us as to how to study these concepts, and derive a pure and whole-hearted service of G‑d from their wisdom, for he clothed the details of this wisdom in the intellectual faculties of the soul, Furthermore, know well that the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov directed their words only to a person who toils in this holy wisdom in order it to deepen his understanding of the service [of G‑d].<br><i>Notes on the sefer Sur M’Ra</i>

Section 59

Rabbi Yaakov Tzemach<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">One of the students of R. Shmuel Vital, the son of R. Chaim Vital.</i> wrote that the revelation of the soul of the Arizal was absolutely necessary for that generation, so that the Arizal should reveal the wisdom of Kabbalah, and provide that low generation with a shield and a shelter to serve our Father in Heaven.<br>So too, it is truly heaven-sent that the great soul of our Rabbi, the holy Baal Shem Tov, descended from the highest world to become revealed in our time – this generation before the Moshiach – in order to illuminate the world and its inhabitants with the light of the holy Torah.<br>True, in previous generations, there were many individual who served G‑d with all their heart and soul, toiling at Torah day and night; nevertheless, they accomplished this in one of two ways. Either they were blessed by G‑d with prosperity, which allowed them to set aside time for Torah study and prayer. Or, they turned their backs on the cares of this world and accepted poverty with love, rejecting everything to toil at Torah. Everyone else, however – the poor who could only make a living with great effort, whether at home, in the fields, in the markets or streets – could taste nothing of the light of G‑d in Torah study and prayer. Indeed, they were very far from it.
Furthermore, even among those people who could set time aside for Torah study, there were few who were wise enough to find protection in the Torah from the great enemy that lurks in the heart of man from birth. For the little Torah study and prayer they do is negated by their evil desires and bad character traits, such as gossip, falsehood, jealousy, hatred, insincerity, bad temper, cruelness, and especially ego, which is the root of evil, that ruins all good deeds and positive traits.
Yet G‑d took compassion on us in this lowly generation, when everyone is pressed to make a living, when no one has money and everything is expensive, when there are fewer and fewer diligent students of Torah each day, and no one searches [for G‑d]. He sent us an angel from heaven to enliven us – our holy rabbi, the light of Israel, the Baal Shem Tov. He enlightened our eyes so that even in the most laborious times we can still remember G‑d and His Torah. Then, we will always be careful to separate the evil from the good in everything we do, in our paths and our words.<br>Abridged from <i>Seder HaDorot HaChadash</i>
The essence of Hasidism is to always remember the work one needs to do in each situation, whether one is studying Torah, involved in mitzvos or prayer, in physical activities, or the myriad daily responsibilities, or in idle conversation. For everything has a good aspect and a bad one, and one must always identify the bad in that activity in order to reject it, and the good, in order to highlight and strengthen it.
The <i>misnagdim<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The opponents of Hasidism.</i></i> lie when they claim that the Hasidism discourages Torah study and claims instead that the main thing is the fear of G‑d. Such accusations are false; for in this world, the Holy One only has “the four cubits so halacha.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 8a: “R. Chiya bar Ami said, Since the day the Beis HaMikdash was destroyed, the Holy One only has the four cubits of Halacha.”</i> The essence of Hasidism is to remember that even during Torah study, prayer and the performance of mitzvos and good deeds there is also a side from the evil inclination, and that one must make every effort to reject it.
While it is also written in the Shulchan Aruch<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Orach Chayim #231.</i> that all of a person’s deeds should be for the sake of G‑d, this is in general; whereas the essence of Hasidism lies in understanding how this applies to the particular, and is manifest in every thought, desire and intention. This means to recognize clearly the true nature of one’s intention, even when involved in Torah study and mitzvos. It is not as simple-minded people think, that the main service of G‑d lies in doing good, whereas one fulfills the obligation to “turn from evil,” by never transgressed the serious sins of the Torah. This person knows that he has never committed adultery, murder, robbery, theft, etc, and is happy with his lot, for he has fulfilled the verse: “Turn from evil” (Psalms 34:15)). Furthermore, he is among those who “do good.” He knows that he performs the commandments, such as donning tallis and tefillin, praying from a <i>sidur</i>, washing his hands before eating bread, making the after-blessing and giving charity to the poor.<br>All of this shines before him in the heavens and he is sure that he fulfills all of G‑d’s commandments, and makes crowns for his Creator. And if he is a Torah scholar who has studied a lot, he certainly feels superior to his fellow men who do not learn at all, or who learn less than he. He also feels that everyone owes him respect, and whoever offends him, G‑d forbid, has offended the Torah itself, so that he becomes filled with anger and wrath to take revenge. After he calms down, as is natural, he imagines that he is as forbearing and as humble as Hillel. And so, he deserves even more respect in virtue of the great humility he feels in himself.
However, if he were to look at himself truthfully, he would realize that he completely lacks humility. Rather, his attitude comes from the evil inclination that has accompanied him since birth and blinds him to the truth, making him think that he is humble, though he becomes only prouder. For were he truly to be humble, he would not become angry and belittle [the reproof], but consider it appropriate that he listen to this chastiser, for perhaps he might learn something from the words that he rejects – perhaps they are sent from heaven.
Now, though, we must thank G d for sending us, in His great love and compassion, an angel and redeemer to enlighten our eyes in the way of hasidism. For every Jew can follow this path, strengthening himself to fear G d even amidst suffering, hardship and poverty. And the little bit of goodness that he derives from Torah study and the performance of mitzvos will be a great light for him, to prevent him from following after his eyes and heart. For instance, when he is preoccupied by his daily activities and in business, he will not lie, as it says in our holy Torah “You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely, nor lie to one another” (Leviticus 19:11). Likewise, he will be just in his measurements: “a just <i>ephah</i> and a just <i>hin</i>” (Leviticus 19:36), because this is G d’s will in His Torah. Likewise, he will be careful not to speak malicious gossip or other foul language so as not to [spiritually] damage his mouth. Nor will he look at women or their beautiful clothing, so as not to damage his eyes. And all because this is G d’s will.<br>It comes out that he is always serving G d – the same as if he were actually studying Torah – when he is involved in business or walking through the market. This is even truer if he knows the secret of how to make Unifications. Then he can make Unifications even with mundane things, as the Baal Shem Tov taught us, so that he is actually considered to by studying the secrets of Torah and the writings of the Arizal even when involved in business, in the market or in conversation with people. Thus, he serves G d constantly, and does not take his thoughts G d’s holiness. This is the meaning of binding oneself to G d. It is the essence of Hasidism.<br>Abridged from <i>Seder HaDoros HaChadash</i>

Section 60

The main work of Tzaddikim throughout the generations, such as Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his companions, Rabbi Yitzchok Luria, and the Baal Shem Tov and his disciples, was to bind the souls of the Jewish people to their [spiritual] roots, and to remove the partitions and physical desires that separate them [from G-d], so that their souls become bound to their roots, until it becomes impossible to separate them from there. So, too, that they should fear G-d, even in private, and not transgress even the slightest decree of the Rabbis.<br>[The Tzaddikim] bind their souls to G-d by stripping themselves of their physicality and completely transcending their corporeality. They bind their souls to the light of the Infinite, and by means of this, lift up the souls of the Jewish people with them and bind them to their root.
However, as the Baal Shem Tov said, even when they attach their own souls to their supernal root, they must be careful not to nullify their existence, so that they are able to return to physicality. They should remain attached [to G-d] in such a way that even when they are busy with physical activities, their thoughts are not separate from the Creator. And even when they are involved in the material world, their intention is to serve G-d. This is serving G-d in the aspect of “Smallness,” as is known.<br><i>Ma’or VaShemesh</i>,<i> Pinchas</i>

Section 61

The holy Rabbi Pinchas of Koretz<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A disciple of the Baal Shem Tov (1726-1791).</i> said: “From the Ramban<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (1194-1270).</i> until the Ari,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534-1572).</i> and from the Ari until the Baal Shem Tov, and from the Baal Shem Tov until me, there were many souls lost in the <i>kelipot</i>, with no one to uplift them.”<br>He also said: “From the Ramban until the Ari, and from the Ari until the Baal Shem Tov, and from the Baal Shem Tov until me, there was no one [else] who could ascend to the supernal worlds. And after me, there won’t be another, until the coming of the Moshiach.”<br><i>Midrash Pinchas HaChadash</i> 120

He had been waiting all that time for the Baal Shem Tov to come and fix his soul, for he was unable to go to the Tzaddikim of the previous generations.

Section 65



Section 66

A great Tzaddik who knows how to perform unifications and combinations of Divine Names can rectify a person just by looking at him. Through these unifications, he immediately causes the person to have thoughts of repentance. The Baal Shem Tov said that he could fix a person instantly by merely looking at him. But if the person stubbornly refused to be fixed, the Baal Shem Tov would complete remove the holy spark from within him.<br><i>Toldos Aharon</i>, <i>Vayera</i>

Section 67



Section 68

Until the Baal Shem Tov, the [predominant] form of worship was through self-affliction. This gave power to the angels of the L‑rd (Elokim), in the aspect of limitation (<i>zimzum</i>). However, from the Baal Shem Tov and onward, the service of G‑d was reconceived through Unifications. Then, power was given to the angels of G‑d (<i>Haveyeh</i>) and the angels of the G‑d of H-sts (<i>Haveyeh Tziva-os</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">G‑d’s Name “Elokim” symbolizes forces of restraint and constriction, whereas the Tetragrammaton (<i>Havayeh</i>) represents forces of Mercy. Before the Baal Shem Tov, the common service of G‑d was through self-affliction, and thus empowered the Divine Name of Judgment. After the Baal Shem Tov, the service of G‑d changed to one of supernal unifications through prayer. This empowered the forces of loving-kindness in the universe.</i><br><i>Sheiris Yisroel</i> p. 15c,d

Section 69

They asked the Baal Shem Tov, “What is your essential contribution to the service of G‑d? We know, and our fathers have told us, that there were great men in the past who fasted from Shabbat to Shabbat. But you annulled this practice, and declared that whoever fasts will ultimately be held accountable, and be called a sinner for afflicting his soul. What, then, is the essence of your form of worship?”<br>The Baal Shem Tov replied: “I came into this world to teach a different way. That a person should draw upon himself three things: love of G‑d, love of Israel, and love of Torah. Self-affliction is unnecessary.”<br>This is what R. Baruch of Mezhibuz said, in the name of his grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov.<br><i>Botzina d’Nehora</i>, p. 18d

Section 70

From the time of the Baal Shem Tov and on, when the Rectifications began to be accomplished by attaching oneself to G‑d-fearing people, and not through ascetic practices, the light of the Messiah began to shine. Nevertheless, if a person knows that he has the strength, he should afflict himself a little.<br><i>Sheiris Yisroel</i>, p. 17c

Section 71

In our time, prayer is the main purification of the soul, allowing us to enter into the service of G‑d. From the time the Baal Shem Tov came, the holy light of prayer’s power began to shine in the world, upon all who want to worship G‑d. However, in order to merit pure prayer, one must serve the Sages, and toil day and night at the Torah and good deeds. Through this, he will be able to truly know how to pray with great fear and love, as is known.<br><i>Ma’or VaShemesh</i>, <i>Vayechi</i>

Section 77

The Tzaddik, Rabbi Yosef of Yampeleh, the son of Rabbi Michal of Zlotichov used to pray with intense concentration, especially the evening prayer. So much so that he was critical of anyone who would not pray that prayer with great concentration. About him, his holy father once: “My son, Yosef, is able to pray.”<br>Once, he became sick and fell into a coma. His soul ascended Above and was immersed in the Dinar River.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A river of fire that souls must immerse in before being admitted into heaven.</i> Afterward, he beheld the Heavenly Court weighing all of his merits. They brought forth all the prayers he had ever recited, from his childhood onward, with not one missing. Suddenly, a fearsome angel came and declared: “What, are these prayers!?” He blew upon them and they scattered, until nothing was left but a single letter <i>hey</i> that shone with a pure light. R. Yosef stood before the heavenly court with his hands shaking.<br>However, on that very day, his holy father suddenly passed away during the third meal of Shabbos. For about two years before his death, his family needed to watch him during that time, so that that his soul not leave him due to his intense attachment to G‑d. He would eat the third meal of Shabbos in his private room with some of his sons. Then he would go to the study hall to deliver words of Torah and to sing, until the meal was finished.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, he would then retreat to his private study to pace the floor.</i> Then he would walk back and forth in deep mystical attachment, repeating the words: “In that [time of] will, Moses departed,”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Zohar states that Moses died at Mincha time of Shabbos, the highest point of the week, when the inner will of G‑d (<i>ra’ava d’ra’avin</i>) is revealed.</i> until his face burned like a fire. Once, his student Rabbi Yosef of Zhemigrad said to his brother, the Tzaddik, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai: “Do you see how the heels of our Rabbi are standing in the Upper Garden of Eden.” Thus, he required special supervision.<br>This time, however, there was no one there, and he ran back and forth in his room saying: “In that [time of] will, Moses departed.” Suddenly, his daughter saw him, and rushed to tell her brother, Rabbi Yitzchok. He ran into the room and grabbed R. Michal in an attempt to disrupt his thoughts, and bring him down from his <i>devekus</i>. R. Michal fell on his son’s shoulder and cried, “<i>Shema Yisroel, Hashem Elokeinu, Hashem Echad</i>” and departed.<br>Now, R. Yosef was still Above, until Sunday morning. As he stood before the Court, he heard a proclamation that all the Tzaddikim should go to welcome Rabbi Michal of Zlotichov who was now arriving. All the Tzaddikim went, and among them was our Master, the Baal Shem Tov, who was R. Michal’s teacher. When he saw R. Yosef standing before the court, he asked him: “Yosef, my son, what are you doing here?” R. Yosef told him everything. The Baal Shem Tov went before the court and said: “How can you claim that the prayers of my dear friend, R. Yosef, are not pure. I will tell him to pray the morning prayer, and you will see that his prayers are indeed sincere and true.” He called to him and said: “Pray here, my son, before the Creator of all, and He will save you.” He began to pray, and with this one prayer, he uplifted all the other prayers so that they all shone brightly. Because of the great intensity with which he prayed, his body down below began to sweat, and he awoke and was healed of his sickness. His mother and sisters were there, and he said to them: “Why do not you remove your jewelry? Our father has passed away.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps this event occurred in a different town, and so his mother and sister had not yet learned of R. Michal’s passing, or perhaps they had been to busy taking care of R. Yosef to remove their jewelry as a sign of mourning.</i><br><i>Nesiv Mitzvosecha: Nesiv Emunah, Shevil</i> 3:25

<b>In the beginning – <i>Bereishis</i>…</b> (Genesis 1:1)<br>When the Moshiach comes, may it be speedily in our days, he will expound upon the letter combinations of each word in the Torah, from beginning to end.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The letters of the Torah, though inscribed in a pattern that tells the story of the creation of the world, and the history and laws of the Jewish people, are not fixed. It is possible to rearrange the letters to gain new insights into the meaning of the text, and G-d’s will for man. Furthermore, the letters of Torah represent the creative energies of G-d that enter the world, and arranging them in different patterns can affect the flow of energy from above. By meditating on the letters, in their different combinations, mystical states of consciousness can be obtained. There are various techniques for letter combination, such as <i>tzerufi osiyos</i>, letter recombination; <i>gematria</i>, using the numerical value of each Hebrew letter, <i>roshei tevos </i>and <i>sofei tevos</i>, words derived from the first and last letters of words in a verse; the division of letters into their component parts.

Comment 2

<b>In the beginning, G-d created the heaven and the earth.</b> (Genesis 1:1)<br>All the early commentators<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rishonim</i> – usually a reference to the Torah sages of eleventh to fourteenth century Europe, many of whom were involved in philosophical speculation, such as Maimonides, R. Chasdei Crescas, Ibn Pakuda, etc.</i> asked a question: Why did G-d not create the world earlier, for to action is always better than inaction. Furthermore, why did G-d’s will change from not wanting [to create] to wanting at that time, and not earlier? G-d is not subject to change, as it is written: “I am G-d, I do not change” (Malachi 3:6).
The answer lies in the fact that G-d is not like a human worker. For a human worker’s knowledge is acquired. He knows something now that he did not know before. Furthermore, he is a creature of lack. For instance, because he needs a place to live, when he acquires enough knowledge to build himself a house. However, G-d’s wisdom is intrinsic and not acquired, nor does He lack. Therefore, His desire to create the world was not something that originated at the time of creation; rather, just as He is eternal so His will is eternal. From time everlasting, He had the intention to create the world when He did, and not before. Thus, when the world was created, it was exactly in its correct time, as it was in G-d’s immortal will, and it is therefore correct to say that He never had a change of will.
A proof for this is the fact that the world as it will exist in the world-to-come is certainly better that the world as it is now. Then, the world we be entirely Shabbat, Tzaddikim will sit with crowns on their heads,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 17a.</i> and G-d alone will be exalted on that day (Isaiah 2:11). The existence of such a creation is certainly better than its lack of existence. So why does not G-d speed its arrival? The reason is because everything must come exactly in its right time. Just as the Shabbat comes only after six week days, so too, in the creation of the world. Although G-d knew that [the existence of] the creation was better than its lack, nonetheless, His will opposed His knowledge. From of old, just as He knew that the act [of creation] was good, so, immediately, did He have the will not to perform the act then, until the time came. Therefore, he relinquished His knowledge and followed His will. Before the creation, it was, in a sense, a world that was entirely Shabbat. This is what is written: “He has made everything beautiful in its time” (Ecclesiastes 3:11) – even the world. This is a very deep secret, and the wise will understand it.
This idea explains the paradox of G-d’s omniscience and human free will. Do not ask why a Tzaddik should receive rewarded and a wicked person punishment, seeing that G-d knew [what they would be]. He gazed at all the generations and knew before hand that this person would be a Tzaddik – which therefore means that he <i>must</i> be a Tzaddik – so that it is unreasonable to reward him. Likewise, G-d knew from beforehand that this other person would be wicked, which makes it improper to punish him, for he could not change what G-d already knew.
But this is not the case. For although G-d has foreknowledge, He desires for people to improve themselves, which is reason the He gave us the Torah and the commandments – to do His will. Thus, His will opposes His knowledge, from the beginning of His thought. A person is therefore able to be drawn after G-d’s will and not His knowledge; that is, His will overrides His knowledge, since He does not desire this knowledge and this action. The knowledge was not desirable. If a person so desires, he can improve his actions as is G-d’s will, and not draw upon himself the knowledge [that he will sin]. For the knowledge of evil was created to test the righteous, as it is written: “…for the L-rd your G-d is testing you…” (Deuteronomy 13:4). This world is a world of trials, and the soul is sent into this world to be tested. If it sins, it follows G-d’s knowledge, and if it does not sin, it follows the will and command, that contradicts foreknowledge.

The Talmud states about the Ten Utterances of Creation<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The opening chapter of Genesis contains nine verses that state: “And G-d said….” Yet, the Talmud calls these the “Ten Utterances” (<i>Megilah</i> 21b).</i> that the word “<i>Bereishis</i>” is also an utterance. Why then does the Torah not use the words “And He said”?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. “And G-d said, Beginning!”</i><br>This is because the brilliance of that first utterance is too great to perceive.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech Shapira of Dinov (<i>Bnei Yissaschar, Chodesh Kislev-Teves</i> 4:49) explained that each of the Divine Utterances used in creating the world were actually channels that funneled the Divine light into creation. In the same was as human speech both limits the flow of thought at the same time as it reveals it, so these Utterances limited G-d’s infinite light in the process of revealing the creation. These channels are the letters and words through which G-d creates. The word <i>Bereishis</i> refers to a level <i>before</i> the creation of letters. It is the world in G-d’s mind, as it were, before the contraction of His light into letters and channels. Thus it transcends all means of perception. According to R. Shapira, this is alluded to in the verse itself: “In the beginning, G-d created…” “<i>Bereishis bara es…</i>.” The particle <i>es</i> (את) alludes to the entire Hebrew alphabet. The verse implies that “In the beginning, G-d first created the letters from <i>aleph</i> to <i>tav</i>, א-ת.” The word <i>Bereishis</i>, however, precedes the creation of the letters.</i><br><i>Kisvei Kodesh</i>, p. 26a

<i><b>Bereishis…</i></b><br>And the faithfulness of your times shall be a storehouse of salvation – wisdom and knowledge, and the fear of G-d is His storehouse. (Isaiah 33:6). “Faithfulness” is the Mishnaic Order of <i>Zeraim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Mishnah is constituted of six major sections: Zeraim – Agricultural laws; Mo’ed – Seasons; Nashim – Marital Issues (lit. “Women”); Nezikin – Damages; Kodshim – the Sacrificial Order; Taharos – Ritual Purity. The Talmud finds an allusion to each of these sections in the verse from Isaiah.</i> “Your times” is <i>Mo’ed.</i> “Stock” is <i>Nashim</i>. “Salvation” is <i>Nezikim</i>. “Wisdom” is <i>Kodshim</i>.<i> </i>“Knowledge” is <i>Taharos.</i> Nevertheless, “the fear of G-d is his storehouse.” <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, this is the main thing, as the Talmud explains with a parable.</i><br>This is like a man who said to his worker, “Put a bushel of wheat in the loft for me.” He went and did it. “Did you mix in a handful of salt?” <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To prevent it from becoming bug-infested.</i> he asked him. “No,” he replied. “Then it would have been better if you had never put it up there,” he said.<br>My grandfather [the Baal Shem Tov] pointed out a discrepancy in this parable. According to the parable, the salt is secondary to the wheat, which is the main thing. However, in the [Talmud’s interpretation of the] verse, the fear of G-d is the main thing, while the Torah is secondary.<br>With pure words, he gave a great answer. His mouth spoke mighty things, of the innermost hidden secrets. The essence of what he said is as follows. When the Holy One created the world, it was unable to exist, for everything kept returning to its source in the Infinite. But when He finally created Israel, the world could exist. Now, the name Israel, ישראל, alludes to this. The <i>reish </i>is <i>Chochmah</i>, the <i>lamed</i> is <i>Binah</i>, the <i>aleph</i> is <i>Da'as</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Chochmah, Binah and Da'as – Wisdom,</i> and the remaining letters – <i>yud-shin</i> – are the substance (<i>yesh</i> – יש) through which the world exists, making it something from nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yesh m’ayin</i> – יש מאין.</i> This is Israel, and the existence of all the worlds that were created <i>ex nihilo.</i> Therefore, Israel sustains all the worlds and the creation, for if they did not, everything would return to its original state of nothingness. It is the existence of Israel that maintains all the worlds. However, this is only when a Jew has no more existence than is necessary to maintain the world, as opposed to when he has too much, G-d forbid.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <i>yesh</i> means “existence” or “substance” – both material and spiritual. An overabundance of <i>yeshus</i> (pl.) means having more ego and a sense of self than is necessary.</i> This is the essence of his awesome words. The mouth cannot express all that is implied by them. Words would be exhausted by their great depth and our limited understanding. To my mind, they allude to the entire Torah.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Ve'eschanan</i>


Comment 5

<b>In the beginning, G-d created the world…</b><br>It was impossible to create the world, for it would have expanded infinitely. Therefore, G-d looked at the deeds of the wicked, <sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash states that before the creation, G-d foresaw the deeds of the righteous, and created the world on their account. However, the world that G-d desired to create on their account was overflowing with love for them. As such, it was unable to exist in the Divine Effulgence. G-d therefore looked at the deeds of the wicked, which resulted in a withholding of His light. But it was precisely this withholding that allows the world to exist. There is a constant pendular movement, between the desire to create and the desire to restrain. This is known as “below and not below” – מטי ולא מטי.</i> and greatly contracted His light. <sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to the teachings of the Arizal, the first stage in creation was the <i>tzimzum; </i>the contraction of G-d’s light to make room for the existence of a finite universe.</i> Then he looked at the deeds of the righteous and drew down a line of life, in the mystery of “below and not below.” All of this is known from the writings of our Master, the Arizal, and the Light of Israel, the Baal Shem Tov.<br><i>Heichal HaBracha</i>, <i>Bereishis</i>


Comment 6

When it arose in the Will of the Blessed One to bestow upon the creation – that is, when He beheld the deeds of the righteous – there was an arousal of Will, and a great longing to give to them. Because of this, it arose in His Mind to create the world. However, the great outpouring of love would have completely annihilated the creation, and it therefore had to be restrained. That is, G-d looked at the deeds of the wicked and <i>Gevuros</i> were aroused in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gevurah</i> (pl. <i>Gevuros</i>) means “strength” or “power,” and refers to the forces of contraction and restraint that G-d used in creating the world. (As the Mishnah says in Pirkei Avos 4:1: “Who is strong? One who subdues his own nature.”)</i> This made it possible to create the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Implied in both this teaching and the previous one is that deeds of the wicked also contain a point of goodness, since they provide the context in which G-d could create the world. This reflects the Baal Shem Tov’s teaching that there is a spark of holiness in all things, and that light shines greater when it comes out of darkness.</i><br><i>Teshuos Chen, Chaye Sarah</i>

Comment 7

A human being is composed of matter and form, body and soul. Now, the soul constantly burns to become attached to its Maker. Physicality, however, blocks this desire with its own longings, such as for sex and food, though these too serve a lofty purpose, for they redeem the sparks [of holiness]. There are times, however, when spirit can overcome physicality and cling to G‑d, in the mystery of: “The living creatures ran and returned” (Ezekiel 1:14). This is known as “Smallness” and “Largeness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. a constricted or expanded state of consciousness.</i> I heard this from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) concerning the mystery of the <i>zimzum</i>, that is was within G‑d, and of G‑d, in the mystery of the “three heads.”<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 55b (Yisro)

<b>And it came to pass at midnight, that the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon . . .</b> (ibid. 12:29)
The verse says: “For L‑rd G‑d (YHVH Elokim) is a sun and a shield” (Psalms 84:12). The name YHVH is compared to the sun, [and the name Elokim] to a screen that shields us from its rays. For just as it is impossible to gaze at the light of the sun except through a filter, which allows the weak of vision to benefit from its rays, so the light of G‑d’s name YHVH is so intense that it must be diminished and contained within the name Elokim, which has the equivalent numerical value as the word “nature.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is impossible for human beings, in their present state of existence, to perceive G‑d through His name YHVH, as G‑d said to Moses: “No man shall see Me and live” (Exodus 33:20). Instead, G‑d conceals this revelation within the natural order of creation, corresponding to the name Elokim.</i>
Thus, our Sages taught: “In the future, G‑d will take the sun out of its shield, the righteous will be healed by it, and the wicked will be judged in it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Nedarim 8b, on the verses from Malachi: “For, behold, the day comes, it burns like a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall set them ablaze, says the L‑rd of hosts, and it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth, and gambol as calves out of the stall” (Malachi 3:19-20). See also, Isaiah 30:26: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, in the day that the L‑rd binds up the bruise of His people and heals the stroke of their wound.”</i> That is, [He will take the name YHVH] out of the name Elokim – nature –which now conceals it. Then the verse will be fulfilled: “And your eyes shall behold your Master” (Isaiah 30:20). G‑d will lead them above the natural order, and they will perceive His great light and compassion. The wicked, however, will be burned by [this revelation], as the prophet said: “YHVH will go forth as a mighty man” (Isaiah 42:13). That is, even though the name YHVH represents the attribute of compassion, when it leaves of its “sheath,” it wreaks vengeance like a warrior. Because for the wicked, the trait of Compassion is transformed to the trait of Judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the World to Come, the revelation of G‑d will be perceived differently by each individual. Those who lived lives of holiness will have the vessels to perceive this light in a way that heals. Those whose lives are impure will experience this revelation as a destructive force.</i> As the verses say: “And YHVH smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 11:4: ‘Thus says the L‑rd: At about midnight, I will go out in the midst of Egypt,” which Unkelos translates as “I will <i>reveal</i> myself in the midst of Egypt.” In other words, the same revelation which killed the Egyptian firstborn brought about the redemption of the Jews. See R. Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin, Tzidkas HaTzadik 171, for a similar idea.</i> and “And YHVH said: ‘I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth” (Genesis 6:7).<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 24c

<b>And it was evening and it was morning, one day</b> (Genesis …)
In your prayers, imagine that you are going palace to palace. If you have a stray thought, it means that they are ejecting you [from the palace].

And if you do pray passionately, pay close attention to your extraneous thoughts.

Thus it is the archtype for all forms of communication.</i> And each one contains ten.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Each of the seven lower sefiros contains within it a microcosm of the entire sefirotic chart, which is comprised of ten sefiros in all.</i> Every bad thought gives life to the seven nations, G-d forbid. This is the meaning of the <i>Midrash Ne’elam</i>: “The world was crumbling. The Holy One said, Behold, it is time for Abraham to enter the worlds.” Meaning, the attribute of love. “Behold, it is time for Ishmael to enter.” That is, illicite loves, for when you think about illicite desire, you enliven Ishmael and the nine others that are with him. “Behold, Isaac” – the attribute of fear. “Behold, Esau” – meaning, murder.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Murder is the negative aspect of fear, in that the emotion of fear implies an emotion of constraint and limitation, the negative expression of which is the absolute denial of the validity of another person’s life.</i> When you have negative fears, G-d forbid, you enliven Esau and the nine others that are with him.

However, if you think about illicite love, and say in your heart, “What have I done? How could I bring a part of the World of Thought to such a filthy place?” you will be humbled, and will raise this thought to the aspect of <i>Ayin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Divine Nothingness.</i> Afterward, when you think: “If I love something, like a woman, who comes from putrid drop, how much more should I love G-d.” [You will then enter] the world of Love. So too, if you hear something funny and become happy, you should think, “This is a portion of the World of Pleasure.” Be very concerned not to physicalize this pleasure. Then “you will delight over G-d” (Isaiah 58:14). That is, above G-d, as it were. Rather, put all of your might into that pleasure, for it is a portion of the World of Pleasure, and you will come to the World of Pleasure. You can sit here and eat, but you are there, in the World of Pleasure. And when you need to experience some pleasure, you bring pleasure to G-d and to all of the worlds.
Likewise, when you see someone frightening, you should say, “Why should I be scared of this person? He is a human being like me. And all the more so, a beast or wild animal. Rather, it is the awesome G-d who clothes himself in this thing. I should fear Him much more!” Likewise, if you become proud of yourself in the middle of prayer, or the people praise you over your level of concentration when studying, make sure that you are ashamed before G-d. And if it is competitiveness, he should defeat this very trait, or, as best as he understands it, he should fortify (hold) himself in the victory of G-d. and so, with thanksgiving and with relationships – you should be bound only to G-d.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 19a<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See also Likutey Amarim, p. 18b.</i>

When a king has a son in a filthy place, he goes there to take him out, out of his love for his son. Likewise, sometimes a person has a thought because the [supernal] worlds have descended from above, and so that thought comes to him. If he is wise enough to discern the nature of the thought, whether it is of love, or fear, or pride, even though it pertains to the sensual nature of this world, he can elevate it. You should know tht that thought needs a rectification at that moment, whether it is of love, fear, or pride; for it was damaged in the Breakage [of the Vessels], and now is the time to elevate it. Thus, it descended from the upper worlds and came to a person so that he raises it from its broken state.<br>Likutey Amarim p. 3d<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See, also <i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 3c.</i>

In the final analysis, whatever a peson sees or hears, and all that happens to him, is all in order to wake him up, whether it is a matter of love, or fear, or pride, of competition, or praise, or relationships, or general forms of authority. They have two aspects. Either they come to him during prayer as thoughts of bad thingshe has already done. They enter his thought in order that he fix them and elevate them. This is like looking in a mirror – you see a face in front of you. So too, the thoughts of his own deeds. Or they are letters from the Breakage, and one must discern if they are letters from love, or fear, or other traits. This also happens during prayer.
There are also times when a person suddenly becomes afraid of something, or of some creature. Everything comes to him in order to be elevated. Sometimes, he sees some manner of love or fear. For instance, a person who is makes constantly ridicules things, is shown the mockery of idolatry. That is, if he suddenly sees some idol, he should understand that it was not accidental. Or if he hears some mockery, it is all in order that he fix the mockery and “sweeten” (meliorate) it in its source, that he should elevate it to its source, which is love.<br>Therefore, for every forbidden thing, there is a permitted one.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chulin</i> 109b.</i> Understand this! For above all, all of one’s actions should be done with cleaving to G-d. He should take note of everything he sees or hears, and all the more so, what he does. Thus, it says about King Solomon: “And he spoke about the trees… and also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes” (I Kings 5:13).

The Talmud discusses the astrological influence of various planets and constellations (Shabbos 156a): “One born under the influence of <i>Shabtai</i> will be a person whose plans are all fail.”</i> that receives from Binah, etc. Therefore, he contemplated his actions, and inevitably, [knew that the truth] was opposite.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The point, as will become clearer below, is that Dovid knew the right thing to do by contemplating on the bad.</i> Thus, he said: “I considered my ways, and then, I turned my feet (“<i>RaGLai</i>”) to Your testimonies.” That is, “I turned to accustom myself (“<i>l’haRGeL</i>”) in Your testimonies.” Understand this, for the moon is the mystery of “David, King of Israel, lives forever!”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashana</i> 25a.</i> It has no light of its own, other than what it receives from the sun, as is known to astronomers.
Now, there is a superiority to light that emerges from darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A play on the words of Ecclesiastes 2: 13: “Then I saw that wisdom is superior to folly, like light is superior to darkness.”</i> That is, the superiority of light becomes apparent because of the existence of darkness. Likewise, a wise person is recognizable because of the existence of folly. And the greatness of the Tzaddik is apparent because of the existence of the wicked, and pleasure (“<i>oneg</i>”) is appreciated because of affliction (“<i>nega</i>”).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Oneg</i> and <i>nega</i> have the same letters: ענג – נגע.</i> Therefore, one becomes a “throne” for the other, like a person who extends his hand upward – he is there himself. And this is the greatness of a <i>gezirah shava</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A hermeneutical device in which two verses are …</i> for spiritually, when two things are in some way similar, they become one. As Maimonides, writes that a mustard seed is similar to firmament, in that both of them are round.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, part I, chap. 56.</i>
Yet, this makes it possible for idolators to err. Since one thing serves as a throne for the other, then everything is embraced in the single unity.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The implication being that even sin or idolatry has a place, in that it serves the purpose of the good. Thus, it is permissible.</i> But this is incorrect, for there is a difference. Only the pleasure that is drawn down after the concealment has been removed is included in oneness, while the rest descends below, in the mystery of <i>havdala</i>. This is the meaning of the Midrash: “I would not know which one G-d prefered” – since even the deeds of the wicked are a throne for deeds of the righteous, and so everything is one. Thus it states: “And G-d saw that the light was good – these are the deeds of the righteous.” For the deeds of the wicked require <i>havdala</i>. This explains the four types who give charity. For the one who doesn’t give at all becomes a throne for the one who gives.
Now, let us return to my Master’s explanation of the verse. There are “wicked deeds” – eating, drinking, joyfulness and frivolity, etc,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">These are considered “wicked” in as much as they are mundane, and can lead to frivolity and sin.</i> and there are righteous deeds – fasting, weeping, mourning, etc. However, when a person becomes saddened with depression and self-affliction, he must make use of the evil trait: to eat, drink and rejoice, and remove his depression. But when he sees that his evil inclination is becoming strong, he should dress in black and become depressed.<br>All this must be carefully weighed in his mind. Thus it says: “I do not know which one He prefers.”<br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 104b

Comment 42

He doesn’t go and he doesn’t learn…</b><br>Why is his counted among those who go to the study hall? The answer is that evil is what makes the good discernable. If there were no evil, the good would be indiscernable. “Like the advantage of light out of darkness.” Therefore, even the wicked person and the fool are called those who go to the study hall. For this fool serves a purpose for the wisdom. And the Baal Shem Tov said about this, that this almost gives evil enough power to ascend, since the world needs it. However, it says: “I will bring you down from there, says G-d” (Ovadiah 1:4). Amen!<br><i>Notzer Chesed</i>, chap. 5:14

Comment 43

One must separate and remove the externalities, the shells and the darkness, which are the extraneous thoughts, and to remove from it the light of holiness that was hidden within. After making this separation, then you will take pleasure, and the advantage that light has when coming from darkness makes one a throne for the other. This is as I wrote in the name of my Master, on the Midrash: “And it was evening – these are the deeds of the wicked, etc.” Thus it is written: “And it was evening, and it was morning, one day.” Meaning to say, after making the separation, [evening] becomes a throne for morning, and therefore, the two together – evening and morning – are called “one day.”<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 109a, 116d<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See also Rav Yeibi, in his name, on Psalms 50.</i>

Comment 44

“Like the advantage of light when it is drawn from darkness.” This also refers to the advantage of light of one’s own darkness, or the darkness of another. And this is the meaning of the verse: “And it was evening, and it was morning, one day.”<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 70b, 176a

When a person is in a state of “smallness” regarding his Torah study and service of G-d, when he comes to “days of Largeness,” which is the pleasure of his Torah and service, there is an advantage to the lihgt that is drawn from the power of the time of darkness.<br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 2b

“Light” – these are the deeds of the rightous”. A wise person can eat good food and enjoy other pleasures, yet still afflict himself.

He does not make the slightest movement, only in his soul, his heart is burning up, and he cries out in silent over the fire (passion).

A person’s life and vitality is his power of speech, as the verse says: “And He blew in his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living soul” (Genesis 2:7), which is translated “and the man became a speaking spirit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Targum Onkelos on this verse.</i> Thus, when a person speaks, his words are his very life-force, which goes out from in those words. it is only because a person’s life-force is attached to its source do those ery words draw him new life from his root. Through this, he reminas alive, since with every word, his life-force is spent, only, each word itself brings him new life.<br><i>Arvei Nachal</i>, <i>Vayishlach</i>

When you speak, you should feel fear, for the World of Speech is the World of Fear. But when you speak about matters of love and fear, you should first feel fear, and then fiery enthusiasm.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 10b

Comment 96

Whatever people speak is the World of Speech. Whatever they think is the World of Thought. When they speak about good thing and put their thoughts into words, they unite the World of Speech and the World of Thought and cause good things to happen. But when they speak badly, they cause evil to happen, G-d forbid. There is great wisdom in this. It is the meaning of: “you choose the tongue of the crafty” (Job 15:5). This means to say, do not accustom yourself to speak about bad things, which are from the Side of Din. Train yourself to speak about good things, which are from the side of Chesed. Do this also with your thoughts.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 2c<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Likutim Amarim, p. 3d</i>

Comment 97

When you think about bad things from the Side of Din, you reduce your mind to the level of those bad things and cut yourself off from the overflowing Supernal Love of the Infinite.

Why is the Divine Presence in exile? Because “with the word of G-d, the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6).

However, because of our sins, we speak only about is physical desires. Even our words of prayer and Torah are filled with foreign thoughts and self-interests. Thus speech is in exile.<br><i>Kisvei Kodesh</i>, p. 22b

<b>The everyday speech of Torah scholars deserves study.</b> (Sukkah 21b)<br>The highest goal of a Tzaddik is to be attached to G-d without a moment’s break.

Comment 114

You must serve G-d with all of your might, for everything is needed. For G-d wants us to serve Him in all situations. Meaning, sometimes a person talks with others and is therefore unable to study. But he must remain attached to G-d and to make Unifications. Likewise, when a person is on the road and is unable to pray or study Torah as usual, he must serve G-d in different ways. But he shouldn’t get upset. For G-d wants him to serve Him in all ways, sometime like this, sometimes like that.

The great principle is that there are sparks of holiness within all things in the world. Wood, stones, and within every human action – nothing lacks these sparks.

For when a person repents of his sin, he lifts up the sparks that were there to the Supernal World. Thus it is written: “who bears sin…” That is, he bears and raises the sin Above.

Comment 1

<b>These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, faultless in his generation…</b> (Genesis 6:9)<br>A person is called a Tzaddik – in the mystery of “A Tzaddik is the foundation of the world” (Proverbs 10:25) – when he takes great pleasure in serving G‑d, for “From my flesh, I will behold G‑d” (Job 19:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Chasidic writings often cite this verse to support the idea that a human beings physical, emotional and mental constituents parallel and reflect the workings of the supernal Sefiros through which G‑d directs the world. Through considering our physicality, we can understand how the divine superstructure of creation functions. The Sefirah of Yesod, (literally “Foundation”) corresponds on the human dimension to the phallus. And just as this organ is the focus of physical pleasure, so a Tzaddik, who is the “foundation” of the world, takes intense spiritual pleasure in serving G‑d. This pleasure is itself a rarified and uplifted expression of sexual pleasure. The Baal Shem Tov develops this idea in the next piece, below.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Va’eschanan</i>, p. 179b

Comment 2

“From my flesh, I will behold G‑d.” Just as sexual intercourse cannot result in birth unless the male organ is vibrant and full of desire and joy, so too spiritual union, through words of Torah and prayer, can only give birth if it is with a vibrant organ,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the entire person must should be experiencing joy and ecstasy during prayer.</i> and with pleasure and joy. Thus, a person who studies Torah and serves G‑d for the sake of heaven, to give satisfaction to G‑d without receiving any reward, merits to taste a sweetness, pleasantness and delight in the Torah and Divine service. Then, he gives birth spiritually, just like physical union, when performed with pleasure and joy. But when a person studies Torah and serves G‑d not for the sake of heaven, this does not happen. He has no pleasure and delight, and does not give birth.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef, Noach,</i> p. 19d

Comment 3

I heard from my Master that someone asked Nachmanidies, “What is considered the service of G‑d?” and he answered, “Whatever gives delight and joy, combined with fear.”<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Mishpotim</i>, p. 70b

Comment 4

In the material world, where there is fear, there is no joy, and where there is joy, there is no fear. However, in servicing G‑d, where there is fear there is love. I later found this in the work of Algazi.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Either Israel Jacob Algazi (1680-1756) or Yom Tov Algazi (1727-1802).

Comment 5

Serve G‑d with fear and joy – these are two friends that are never apart. For fear without joy is depression, and it is wrong to suffer over how to serve G‑d – only to be constantly happy. For even then, you must serve Him, and there is no time to consider how or what.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i> 13b.

Comment 6

<b>These are the generations of Noah; Noah was a righteous man…</b> (Genesis 6:9)<br>Some need preparation, but do not require thought, thought and preparation, thought without preparation, no preparation and no thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah, Uktzin</i> 3:1. In the laws of ritual purity, all foodstuffs can become <i>tumeh</i> (impure). Some however, such as those intended for human consumption, need to first come in contact with one of seven types of liquid (water, dew, oil, wine, milk, blood, or bee honey). This is called <i>heksher</i>, or “preparation.” Other foods do not require preparation to become impure, such as the carcass of an impure animal. Furthermore, some foods require “thought” or “intention” to contact types of <i>tumah</i>. That is, food not initially intended for human consumption (such as animal fodder), needs to be <i>intended</i> for human use in order to contact <i>tumah</i> through contact with liquid. The Baal Shem Tov uses these categories homiletically.</i><br>I heard from my friend, the famous Rabbi and Chasid, our teacher Shlomo of Dalina, in the name of the holy Rabbi Moshe ben Rabbi Dan, a question raised on this Mishnah from the Baal Shem Tov. Why was it written out of order? [It should have been written] “preparation without thought, thought without preparation, thought and preparation, no thought and no preparation”?
The Baal Shem Tov explained that the main form of worship – in which vitality, <i>devekus</i> and joy, and the Divine light and radiance of the Shechinah pour down – depends upon a person completely purifying himself. He then enters into a single bond with the Holy One,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar</i> 3:288a.</i> and with no need for preparation or exertion to attain it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is “preparation and thought.” First, the person prepares himself, and then he experiences the light of the Shechinah.</i> But a person who is not yet pure must prepare himself through the performance of many good deeds and by subduing his lower inclination. Even then, there is no guarantee that he will merit to “see his world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A phrase from the Talmud; i.e. he will merit to see his spiritual reward in this world.</i>
However, thought without preparation is nothing, leaving a person with neither thought nor preparation. For even though the main thing really is the thought,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the <i>devekus</i>.</i> for the practice of making Unifications is much greater than studying Torah, in that one actually draws down the light of the Infinite to enliven all the worlds, and gives satisfaction to one’s Creator, and sustains the holy Shechinah who is in exile, still, this is only for lofty and holy souls. For the upper worlds are not moved by the thoughts of man, unless he is fit to draw upon them supernal light, and enliven them with new vitality from the <i>Ayin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“Nothingness” – a reference to the infinite, unperceivable G‑d.</i> with the light of the Infinite. Then, in that joy, the same light will also be drawn upon him, until he is actually bound and attached to the light of the Infinite and the pleasantness of the glow of the Shechinah. Then his soul goes out in his words,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">From Song of Songs 5:6.</i> and he loses his power of speech in the powerful light, radiance, and pleasantness.
However, if he is unable to draw upon himself the supernal light of the Infinite, they<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Heaven, or the supernal forces.</i> do not pay attention to him at all. They do not desire to draw near to him, neither to help him or to drawn his thoughts above. For his thoughts are empty, inefficacious and of no import.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sha’arei Kedusha</i>, part 3, sha’ar 5.</i> Therefore, the thoughts of a simple person who has not completely purified himself are vacuous and of no consequence. If he wastes his life on thoughts without first preparing himself through Torah and mitzvos, G‑d considers it as if he has neither preparation nor thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov seems to be addressing those people who wish to study and meditate on the mysteries of Torah without purifying themselves through Torah study and mitzvah observance. In the end, they have neither preparation nor thought; i.e. devekus to G‑d.</i> He returns naked to his source. Furthermore, he exposes himself to the dangerous heresy of that uncouth heathen Aristotle, may his name be erased, who defamed the Torah and mitzvos.<br>However, the Torah is not addressing those who are as dead. Rather, it is necessary to admonish the remnant of our people, so that they realize the importance of preparation through Torah and mitzvos. Even the Arizal, whose mind ascended to the Infinite, claimed to have grasped so much only due to the joy and light of the mitzvos. For one must focus on the preparation of Torah and mitzvos.<br>These are the holy words of our teacher, Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, with added commentary.<br><i>Ma’aseh Oreg</i>, on tractate <i>Uktzin</i>

When a father wants to teach his infant son to walk, what does he do? He stands his son between his outstretched arms so that the boy does not fall, and the child walks between his father’s arms. When he comes close to his father, his father backs up slightly so that the child can approach him again. This way, the child learns to walk well. If his father didn’t keep moving back, the child would only walk that short distance from where his father first put him to where his father now stands. However, because the father moves back, the child walks further.<br>This is how G-d relates to His creatures. When a person is aflame with spiritual attachment, G-d must distance Himself from him, for if not, his <i>devekus</i> would be neither strong nor consistent. However, because G-d keeps moving away, the person must continually renew and strengthen his <i>devekus</i>. This is what King David alluded to when he said: “…He will lead us eternally” (Psalms 48:15), as Rashi explains: “Like a man leads his small son slowly.”<br><i>Turei Zahav, Rosh Hashanah</i>

Comment 8

For this reason, G-d is called “the hidden G-d.” For a Tzaddik never feels that he has reached perfection in serving G-d, and always feels far from Him. This is in order that he comes even closer. It is the meaning of “He will lead us eternally.” G-d is called “He” when He is hidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See below.</i> This is in order that “He lead us eternally (<i>al’mus</i>, עלמות<i>)</i> – like a child (<i>al’miah</i>, עלמיה<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Aramaic.

Comment 10

Why did G-d create the possibility for a person to become separate from Him?
If a son is constantly with his father, the father does not take so much delight in him. If a person eats stuffed goose every day, he has no pleasure from it. This is not the case if a person at times distances himself from his Father, and afterward draws near. Then the pleasure is great.<br><i>Kisvei Kodesh</i>, p. 24c

Comment 12

<b>The living creatures ran and returned.</b> (Ezekiel 1:14)<br>Constant pleasure becomes second nature, and is no longer pleasurable.

Comment 13

<b>The living creatures ran and returned.</b> (Ezekiel 1:14)<br>Everything desires to return and cling to its source. The soul constantly longs to cleave to its source Above, through its desire for Torah and serving G-d. However, if it were to burn constantly, it would be annihilated, as it was prior the World of Rectification. This is the mystery of <i>Kivrot HaTa’avah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 11:34: “And the name of that place was called 'Graves of Craving' (<i>Kivrot-HaTa'avah</i>), because there they buried the people that lusted.”</i> as is written in the sefer<i> Brit Menucha</i>. It is also the inner meaning of: “And the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the flood of Noah.</i><br>Thus, G-d saw to it that we must devote time to the needs of the body, eating, drinking, and working a little for our livelihood – even a person with few needs. By ceasing from serving G-d during these times, the soul rests and the power of intellect renews itself so that it can serve G-d again.<br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 33b, 85d, 89a

Comment 14

The Baal Shem Tov told a nice parable to illustrate this. When a person enters a fine-foods store, the owner lets him taste a bit of everything so that he knows what to buy. But once he has tasted and knows what is sweet and good, if wants to taste more, the owner tells him, “Pay for it! You don’t get anything for free here!”<br>This refers to the illumination that a person experiences when he first sets out on the path of Chasidism. With this taste and light, he can subdue all the evil and return everything to the ultimate good. They give him this so that knows the taste of serving G-d, and so that a residue should stay with him when these levels depart. Then he knows what to search for.<br><i>Otzar HaChayim, Naso</i>, p. 3d

Comment 26

When a person prays with the mystical intentions, he can only use those intentions that he knows. But when he recites each word with great passion, all the mystical intentions are included in his words automatically. For every letter is a complete world, and when you say the words with great emotion, you arouse those worlds above. Therefore, a person should pray with great attachment and fervor, which will definitely have a great effect in the upper worlds, because every letter makes its mark above.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash </i>14b

Comment 27

If your prayers are pure and clear, the holy breath that leaves your mouth will attach itself to the Supernal breath that clings to you and enters you constantly. This is as our Rabbis have said: “Everything that has a soul, praise G-d!” (Psalms 150:6). That is, over each and every breath a person takes, [he should praise G-d].”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah, Bereishis</i> 14:9. The word “soul” (<i>neshama</i>) and “breath” (<i>neshima</i>) are related. The entire passage from the Midrash reads: “Rabbi Bisni and Rabbi Acha and Rabbi Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Meir, ‘The soul fills the entire body, and when a person sleeps, it rises to draw down life from above.’ Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Chanina, ‘Over each and every breath that a person takes, he should praise the Creator…” (I.e., G-d renews one’s breath every minute, not just during sleep.)</i> For the breath leaves him from below to above, and returns to him from above to below. Surely, it is easy to attach your inner portion of G-d to its root.<br><i>Likutim Yikarim</i>, p. 12a

The Baal Shem Tov’s soul said to him, the reason that you merited all these supernal revelations was not because you learned a lot of Talmud and legal codes, but because you always pray with intense concentration. This is what brought you to your high level.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 4b

Comment 29

Even when you pray with great <i>devekus</i>, and with the proper love and fear [of G-d], you must also be careful to humble yourself before G-d, as well. Once, the Baal Shem Tov and his disciples prayed with great <i>devekus</i>. But because they lacked the proper humility, a great accusation was aroused [against them] Above. One alone among them prayed with humility, and he saved all the rest.<br><i>Darchei Tzedek</i> 5

Comment 30

If a person reads the Torah and sees the lights of its letters, though he does not properly understand the cantillation marks and fails to pronounce the words properly, G‑d is not critical of him, since he reads with great love and passion. This is like a child who asks something from his father, who loves him greatly. Even though he stutters and doesn’t say the words right, his father doesn’t insist that he say them properly. This is like what our Sages said: “‘…His banner over me is love’ (Song of Songs 2:4). Don’t read the word as ‘His banner over me is love’ (<i>diglo alai ahava</i>); rather, read it as ‘over the mistakes I make, there is love’ (<i>laglago alai ahava</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah, Shir HaShirim</i> 2:3.</i><br><i>Likutim Yikarim</i>, p. 1

Comment 31

Be very careful what you say [in the morning, before praying]. Our Sages were strict even regarding permissible words, such as greeting someone before prayer,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Berachos 14a.</i> because this can also cause a blemish. It is known that the world was created with thought, speech and action. The first level is thought. Speech is an offshoot of thought, and action an offshoot of speech. When a person rises each morning, he is also a new creation, as the verse says: “They are new every morning” (Lamentations 3:23). If his first words are mundane (and all the more so, if they are forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Such as profanity, gossip or slander.</i>), everything he says later will be influenced by them, even his prayers and Torah studies. Because just as speech follows from thought, so the second word follows from the first.<br>This is similar to the teaching of the Zohar<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 3:83a.</i> and the Arizal on the obligation of siblings to honor the firstborn.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Arizal writes that just as children are obligated to respect their parents, so must they respect their firstborn sibling. For the firstborn represents the initial creative act of the parents, from which all subsequent births draw their vitality. Thus, Jacob said about Reuben: “Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the beginning of my strength…” (Genesis 49:3).</i> The firstborn takes the main portion, whereas all other siblings are like offshoots from him. In our case too, one must be very careful to sanctify and purify his first words and thoughts, and attach them to holiness, so that all subsequent words should follow them. Then, when he starts to pray, amidst the joy of having fulfilled the mitzvah of sanctifying his speech and thoughts, his words will surely be answered.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, 20b

Whatever you see, remember the Holy one. If it is something you love, remember the love of G‑d; if it is something you fear, remember the fear of G‑d.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Once, when the Baal Shem Tov was walking alone in the forest, he encountered a lion. He started to meditate on the letters of the word “lion” – <i>aryeh</i>, and how they also compose the word “fear” – <i>yirah</i> (אריה, יראה). He came to such an intense fear of G‑d, that the lion was suddenly ripped in half. (<i>Kovetz Eliyahu</i>, p. 6)</i> Even when you go to the bathroom, you should think to yourself: “I am now separating the bad from the good, so that the good should remain for the service of G‑d.”<br>This is the meaning of <i>Yichudim</i> (Unifications).<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 3b

Comment 33

<b>Righteousness shall go before him, and he will set his steps on the way.</b> (Psalms 85:14)<br>This is meant as an admonition. There are some people who, on their way to perform a mitzvah, pray, etc., stop to speak with others. Even though they fulfill the mitzvah afterward, they sinned in that they did not go quickly. After death, their punishment is reciprocal, as is known from numerous books. They pass the soul over a river on a very narrow crossing. This is very painful to the soul, which experiences fear and dread, and must run very fast, as is the way to get across. However, in the middle of the way, G-d sends an angel to obstruct him. This is the same angel that was created when he performed the mitzvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Every mitzvah we do creates an angel.</i> Now, that angel suffered pain, because the thought that the person had in his house to go do a mitzvah created the soul of the angel. Whereas, the body is created through the performance of the mitzvah. But because the person delayed in creating the body because he stopped to talk, the angel also comes to stop him in the middle of the way, so that he cannot run, and suffers fear.<br>This is the meaning of “Righteousness shall go before him.” The simple meaning is that all of a person’s mitzvos go before him after his death. However, you should make sure that when you go to perform a mitzvah or to pray in synagogue that you do so quickly, and not lazily, so that, “he will set his steps on the way,” and they won’t stop you when you pass over the river.<br><i>Tzivos HaRivash</i> p. 14a

<b>To you, G-d, is kindness; for You repay each man according to his deeds.</b> (Psalms 62:13)<br>The question on this verse is well known.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> </i> But it seems that it can be explained according to something the Baal Shem Tov once said, that once, there was a great accusation on Yom Kippur (against the Jews). The Satan said that he was not accusing wicked people at all; rather, the problem was with the G-d-fearing, who pray each day in synagogue. For on their way to prayer, they may see a wagon full of wood, and they stop to bargain over the price. For the small discount the seller gives them, they come late to services, and miss <i>Borchu</i> and <i>Kedusha</i>.
All the defending angels couldn’t find a rebuttal to this, but the Baal Shem Tov came to their defense. It’s true, he said, that a mitzvah can be lost before its fulfillment due to some trifling amount. However, once they <i>did</i> the mitzvah, they would not sell it for the greatest fortune, even the most imprudent.<br>With this argument, he sweetened the harsh judgments. And this is the meaning of: “To you, G-d, is kindness; for You repay each man according to his deeds.” That is, just as the mitzvah is beloved to him <i>after</i> he does it, not before.<br><i>Degel Machane Reuven</i> 59

Comment 35

A person should strengthen his mind before praying so that he will, at least, not have foreign thoughts, or [ideally, pray] with devekus.

Thus, it says: “One gives a lot and another a little, as long as his heart is directed to heaven”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachos</i> 110a.</i> – as long as he has the consciousness to pray, in which case, they are equal.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 92a

Do not recite too many psalms [in the morning] before prayer, so as not to weaken yourself and become unable to say your daily obligation – the Verses of Song, the Shema, and the Amidah – with great spiritual attachment.

Comment 39

Always be careful to pray before sunrise, whether in the summertime or the winter. That is, you should recite most of the prayers, until close to the Keriyat Shema, before sunrise. The difference between praying before or after sunrise is as great as the east is from the west. Because then is still possible to annul [the Harsh Judgments easily]. This is alluded to in the verses: “He has set a tent in them for the sun. which is like a bridegroom coming out of his canopy, rejoicing like a strong man . . . there is nothing hidden from its heat” (Psalms 19:5-7). Do not read the word as “heat,” <i>chamaso</i>, but as “wrath,” <i>chemaso</i>. For when the sun is already out, it is impossible to hide from the Harsh Judgments that come from the angels of wrath.<br>Do not take this lightly, for it is extremely important.

Comment 41

Before you begin to pray, imagine that you are going to die in that prayer in the intensity of your concentration. There are those who concentrate (focus) so intensely that at times it would be natural (the natural thing for them) to die after two or three words that they say before G-d. When you think this, think in your heart: “What point is there for me to feel proud or self-conscious (?) during this prayer, since I’m willing do die after a few words.”<br>Really, it is only because G-d, in His great love, gives him the ability to finish his prayers and remain alive.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 4b

Comment 44

When a person speaks without thinking, it is as though he is spilling seed, G-d forbid. For a person’s thought is a complete entity (<i>shi’ur komah</i>). The proof for this is that when a man thinks of something else during intercourse, he gives birth to an “exchanged son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim</i> 20b. According to the Talmud, if a husband thinks about another woman at the time when he is with his wife, he can cause a blemish in the child that is conceived. This is called an “exchanged child.” The Baal Shem Tov’s point is that thought is a complete entity, which can influence the nature of another human being in the moment of conception.</i> Likewise, when he does not think about intercourse, he is unable to copulate. For thought is Chochmah and speech is the birth. There are also letters in thought, for a person thinks in letters.

When a person is on a low level, it is better for him to look in the prayer book while he prays, because seeing the letters will give him the ability to pray with more concentration.

A person should proceed level by level in his prayers, and not spend all his energy at the beginning. Rather, he should start slowly, and in the middle, attach himself with great cleaving [to G-d].

Comment 48

Likewise, if a person falls from his level [of attachment] in the middle of the prayers, he should say the words with even a little bit of concentration – as much as possible.

The Baal Shem Tov taught, “Concentration (or “intention”) is the soul, and this is mystical attachment.” When a person puts all of his concentration into the words of prayers, he divests his soul of its physicality. The soul can then enter into the letters, which now give birth to new revelations of G-dliness.

A person should think it sufficient if G-d helps him fully concentrate for half of the prayer service, or most of it.

When I see that at times this consciousness leaves me, G-d forbid, then ‘from where (<i>m’ayin</i>) will my help come?’ Because I see and understand this, my heart is broken and I become nothing (<i>ayin</i>). Therefore, my help will come from the Infinite (the <i>Ein Sof</i>).”<br>The meaning of this passage is that when a person, having lost the connection with G-d, becomes humble and contrite, making himself like nothing – <i>ayin</i> – then a new light shines on him from the Source of All, which is the <i>Ein Sof</i>, the One Without End.</i> like a person who climbs a ladder. Thus it is written: “Send Your light and Your truth, they will lead me” (Psalms 43:3) – that is, the supernal light.<br><i>Likutey Ikarim</i>, p.3d

Sometimes, a person can only serve G-d with constricted consciousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>Katnus</i> – “smallness” (often referred as <i>Mochin d'Katnus,</i> “small-mindedness”) as opposed to <i>Gadlus</i> – “largeness” (or <i>Mochin d'Gadlus</i>, “expanded consciousness”).</i> That is, he does not enter the Supernal Worlds at all, but merely thinks how the entire world is filled with His glory, and that He is close to him. Then he is like a child, whose mind has developed only a little bit. Nonetheless, though he serves G-d in smallness, he does so with great spiritual attachment.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 7b

Comment 53

Even when you fall from your [spiritual] level, you should cleave to G-d with small thoughts, for at times there is also “smallness” above in <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zeir Anpin</i> is one of the central configurations on the Sefirotic realm. Paralleling human growth, it goes through stages of gestation, birth, smallness and largeness. These represent different steps in the process of revelation, as the light of G‑dliness passes through the Sefiros to reach this world. The point here is that constricted consciousness is inherent in the very supernal processes of creation. It should not be avoided, but worked with and transformed.</i> By means of this “smallness,” you can come to “largeness.” Like coals, as long as one spark remains, it can be fanned into a great bonfire. But if not even a small spark remains, it cannot be stoked into a flame. So too, if a person does not constantly cling to G-d with small thoughts, his soul can be extinguished completely, G-d forbid.<br><i>Likutey Ikarim,</i> p. 15b

Comment 54

At times when you are unable to pray, don’t think that you won’t be able to pray at all that day; rather, push yourself more, and draw more and more fear upon you. For this is comparable to a king who disguises himself and goes out to war. Wise people will recognize the king by his gestures, while those who are not so wise can recognize him by the signs. For in the place where there is great joy, that is where the king is.<br>Likewise, why you can not pray with concentration, realize that right there, the guards are around the King. The King is really there, only you can not draw near to him due to all the protection. Therefore, you must push yourself to fear, and with great efforts to have greater concentration, so that you can draw near and pray to Him. Then you will be able to pray with great concentration (focus).<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 5a

Comment 55

Don’t think, “I will pray with enthusiasm when I can, but I won’t push myself when I cannot.” The opposite is true! For example, when a king enters the battlefield, he changes his clothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">So that the enemy will not recognize him and try to kill him.</i> While the servants close to him can recognize him through his gestures, those who are far from the king can still tell that the troops are guarding a certain place, and that the king is probably there.
This is also true of prayer. The [distracting thoughts and emotions] are guarding the King so that you cannot see Him. You should therefore apply yourself even more, for the King <i>is</i> there; they are merely hiding Him from you.<br><i>Ibid. </i>10a


Comment 56

Even when you are in a state of constricted consciousness, you should still be in a state of great attachment to the Shechinah. Afterward, in one second, when you think about the Supernal Worlds, you will be there, for a person is where he places his thought, and if he was not in the Supernal World, you would not be able to think [of them] at all.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 5a

Comment 58

When you want to pray, it should first be with awe, for this is the gate to enter before the Blessed One.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shabbat</i> 31b.</i> You should say in your heart: “To Whom do I want to attach myself?

Comment 59

There are those who pray out of depression, because they are overwhelmed by melancholy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Marah shechora</i>, literally, “black bile.” This is based upon a medical theory that the body produces various types of bile that affect the emotions, as is clear in the continuation this piece. The point is that one may feel that they are praying with <i>devekus</i> – spiritual attachment – whereas their emotions are merely a product of their physiology.</i> Yet they think that they are praying with great fear [of G‑d]. Others think that are praying with great love for G‑d, though it really due to red bile. However, when [a person prays] out of love of G‑d, and then suddenly feels ashamed, longs to glorify G‑d and to overcome his own evil inclination for His sake, that it is good.<br>Because a person is not called a servant of G‑d unless it is in fear and love. The fear must fall upon him [suddenly], and not through his own initiation, which is the uplifting of the “Feminine waters.” True fear happens when fear and trembling come upon him until he does not know where he is, his mind becomes purified, and tears flow by themselves. But when it is not like this, though he thinks that he loves the Creator, it doesn’t amount to anything. For <i>this </i>is the gate to G‑d. Fear is the gate to love, and if he is not in the gate of fear, how can he be in love? A person like this isn’t even a servant, and certainly not on a level for fear to descend upon him. He isn’t performing the type of worship that is fit for a Jew at all. He is only serving G‑d by rote. He imagines that he is serving G‑d in joy, but it is only the joy of debauchery. Therefore, he should return to G‑d with all of his heart and soul.<br><i>Likutey Yikarim</i>, p. 3a

Comment 60

Joyous prayer is certainly more acceptable to G-d than that depressed and tearful prayers. For example, even though a poor man might entreat the king with great tears and cries, he still receives only a little. However, when a prince joyfully praises the king, and then makes his request, the king bestows upon him greatly, as they give to royalty.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i> p.13a

Comment 61

<b>We will make you circlets of gold with dots of silver.</b> (Song of Songs 1:11)<br>“Circlets of gold” is fear [of G‑d]. “Dots of silver” means love [of G‑d].<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Kabbalistically, gold corresponds to the Sefirah of Gevurah, which is the root of fear of G‑d.

Comment 63

A person should not think, “On Shabbat I will pray with concentration, but not during the rest of the week.” He should not be like those servants who serve the king only when he is present, but are lax in their work when he is absent.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">G‑d is more present on the Shabbat, so to speak,.</i> This is not a faithful servant.

The congregation sins greatly by drawing out their prayers and not allow the prayer-leader to conclude a section of the liturgy he wants to finish.

Comment 66

At times, a person may desire to pray with enthusiasm, but cannot due to heaviness in his limbs. About this King David prayed: “Do not cast me off in the time of old age…” (Psalms 71:9). That is, when my limbs feel heavy like those of an old person.<br><i>Ohr Torah</i>,<i> Ekev</i>

Comment 67

“Do not cast me off in the time of old age….” That is, do not cast time into old age, for it can happen that with the passing of time a person’s service of G-d falls into old age.<br><i>Ohr HaMeir, Yisro</i>

Comment 68

Sometimes, a person becomes impassioned to serve G-d through Torah study or prayer, but his desire does not age [slowly]; rather it becomes immediately lost, as though the mitzvah has become old.

You should accustom yourself to praying in a low voice, even the verses of praise.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>pesukei d’zimrah</i> – the section of the morning prayers composed of Psalms.</i> You should cry out in a whisper.

Comment 70

At times, a person should serve G‑d in his soul alone; that is, in his thoughts, while the body stands still so as not to weaken those thoughts with extraneous movements. And sometimes, a person can say the prayers with love, awe and great passion without any physical movements, until it seems to another person that is praying without any attachment [to G‑d] at all. A person can do this when he is deeply attached to G‑d. Then he can serve Him in his soul alone, with a great and powerful love.<br>This form of worship is better, and goes faster and deeper in its attachment to G‑d, than prayers that outwardly affect the body.

Sometimes, you can pray extremely quickly because of the love of G‑d that burns powerfully in your heart. Then, the words will leave your mouth by themselves.<br><i>Ibid. </i>p.4b

Comment 72

I received from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) that to purify your thoughts, you should concentrate on the name כוז"ו.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This name is constructed from the four letters of the Hebrew alphabet that follow the letters of the Tetragrammaton: כ follows י, ו follows ה, etc.. Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac of Komarno writes that this alludes to the heavenly dew that will revive the dead in the World to Come, for the word “dew” – <i>tal</i> – has the numerical value of 39, as does this Name. Each day, as well, there is a personal aspect of the Resurrection of the Dead, when the sparks of the Fallen Kings are enlivened. This happens by concentrating on the names טפטפי"ה כוזו כף ואו זין ואו. In the future, there will be a universal resurrection, through the influence of <i>Mocha Setimah</i> (the Concealed Mind), which is the Dew of Onyx Stone, that removes all impurity and enlivens all the souls and the Kings that died.

Comment 74

The mystery of the [Divine] Name <i>Kehas</i> (כהת), which is a substitute for [the Name] Sha-dai, is the name with which Moses killed the Egyptian,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Exodus 2:14.</i> and removed the spark that rested in an filthy place back to its root. This name is especially effective to do this, as is known from the Baal Shem Tov, how to use this name to uplift all the sparks.<br><i>Otzar HaChayim</i>, p. 58a

Comment 75

The name <i>Kuzu</i> is the “backside” of the Tetragrammaton.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In that the letters of this Name follow the letters of the Tetragrammaton, it is considered to be “behind” the Y-H-V-H; i.e. its backside, and an aspect of concealment (in that the back conceals a person’s face or identity).</i> The Tetragrammaton is the attribute of compassion, and the Name <i>Kuzu</i> is the attribute of <i>Gevurah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">“Strength” or “Power.” The untempered attribute of <i>Gevurah</i> manifests itself in negative ways, such as in violence or destructiveness.</i> Now, the letters <i>Ku</i>, from this Name, have the same numerical value of the Tetragrammaton itself (כ"ו, 26). It turns out that the name <i>Kuzu</i>, which is the attribute of <i>Gevurah</i>, exceeds the Name Y-H-V-H, which is the attribute of compassion, by the letters <i>zu</i>.

Comment 80

When you pray, you should concentrate on arousing the letters through which the heaven and earth, the upper and lower creatures, and all the worlds were created. Then, all the worlds and the entire creation will recite the words of prayer and praise with you, for the letters you invoke are the vitality of [all] creatures. This intention elevates all of creation, in heaven and on earth.<br>When people of a high spiritual level pray with this intention, they also arouse the letters of individuals on a low level, so that they too can pray with greater concentration and exuberance, and become better people.<br>The Baal Shem Tov also told his disciples to pray even for the chirping bird flying overhead.

Comment 81

I heard in the name of Rabbi Menachem Mendel (of Vitebsk), that before you admonish the congregation, you must bind yourself to G‑d, and then attach and bind yourself to them in unity and inclusion; for the leaders of the generation and the people share the same root.

There is no speech without thought, for a person first thinks what he is going to say. Now, when you think before you speak, you will certainly feel fear and shame.

Thus it says: “These are the generations of the heaven and the earth in their creation” (Genesis 2:4)<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The word “in their creation” – <i>behiboram</i> – is written in the sefer Torah with a small letter <i>hey</i>: בְּ<b>הִ</b>בָּרְאָם, as if to suggest the reading: “These are the generations of the heaven and the earth – with [the letter] <i>hey</i> they were created.”</i> – that is, with the five parts of the mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Sefer Yetzirah (2:3) divides the letters of the Hebrew alphabet into five groups, depending upon the different parts of the mouth used in their pronunciation: the throat (אחהע, the gutturals), the tongue (דטלנת, linguals), the palette (גיכק, palatals), the teeth (זסשרצ, dentals), and the lips (בומפ, labials). According to Kabbalah, these correspond to the five <i>Gevuros</i>: forces of constriction that limit and make accessible the infinite light of G‑d. See Likutey Moharan I:38.</i> This should lead you to think about the splendor of G‑d, and how the vitality of the words is from speech. This itself is the World of Fear. For the Shechinah constricts herself to rest in your words and mouth, as it says in the <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> – “He established them in the mouth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> 2:3</i><br>Furthermore, if speech is so great, imagine what the World of Thought must be like, not to mention the luminous worlds that are without limit. When you begin to realize that the immense World of Thought has been contracted into the mind, the attributes of Chochmah and Binah, it is only right that you become ashamed before G‑d.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i> II, p. 21a<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Likutim Amarim</i>, p. 18a</i>

Comment 92

The speech of Israel is the World of Speech that enlivens the world. The thought of Israel is the World of Thought. And this world<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the physical world.</i> receives the letters of speech by way of the character traits – <i>Hesed</i>, <i>Din</i> and <i>Rachamim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Love, Judgment, and Compassion.</i> Because this world has limited dimensions, and must receive through the traits.<br>This can be understood by way of example. It is impossible to look at the sun because of its great brilliance, but one can look at the light it emits, to grasp and derive benefit from it because the sun’s strength has been diminished. Whereas, were the light of the sun to have the same brilliance as the sun itself, it would also be impossible to look at it. This is what is written: “Sun and shield is Hashem Elokim” (Psalms 84:12).<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 19d<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Likutim Amarim</i>, p. 19a.</i>

Comment 93

When a person speaks with love and fear, the Shechinah desires his words, like a mother who longs to hear her son speak words of wisdom, so that she should be admired by her husband. So too, when through a person’s efforts the words are bedecked and rise Above, a great splendor is born, and the angels declare: “Who is like Your people Israel, a unique nation in the earth” (I Chronicles 17:21).<br>Therefore, try and say [at least] one word of prayer with love and fear, for that arouses all the angels to sing to G‑d. And when you serve G‑d, you arouse all of the worlds to serve G‑d as well.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 5a<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">See also ibid, p. 5b.</i>

Comment 94

<b>…from His Temple He heard my voice…</b> (Psalms 19:7)<br>Speech is called a “temple.” You must pray only so that your words come to G-d. For when you pray this way, all the gatekeepers leave you alone. As, for example, when a simple villager carries the king’s seal. Even though he is unfit to come before the king, the guards rush him in; for the king longs for his seal, and they want him to enjoy it quickly.<br>So too, G-d longs for the words [of prayer]. And this is the meaning of: “from His Temple He heard my voice” – that is, because of the words.<br><i>Ohr Torah, Likutim, </i>p. 54a

Comment 95

I heard from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) that the morning prayers should reflect what is written: “I wake up the dawn, and the dawn does not wake me up.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>Orach Chaim</i> 1, based upon the verse: “Awake, my glory; awake, lyre and harp; I will awake the dawn” (Psalms 57:9). The simple meaning is that a person should rise early to pray, and not be woken up by the sun.</i> That is, a person should make an effort to gradually ascend until he reaches the words “Blessed is He who speaks.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Baruch she’omar</i> – the beginning of <i>Pesukei d’Zimrah.</i></i> This section corresponds to the world of Asiyah,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">There are six sections to the morning prayers: the sacrificial offerings, the songs of praise, the Keriyat Shema and its blessings, the Amidah, Tachanun, and the concluding psalms. The first four sections correspond to the four worlds Asiyah (Action), Yetzirah (Formation), Beriyah (Creation) and Atzilut (Emanation), the last being the highest level. The remaining sections deal with drawing down and integrating of the light.</i> which exists below, in the place of the “impure shells.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of <i>kelipot</i> – impure shells – was discussed in earlier chapters translated from <i>Sefer Baal Shem Tov.</i></i> He should then concentrate more, until “May He be blessed,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Barchu.</i></i> which is the world of Yetzirah, where there are not as many “shells.” And from “May He be blessed,” until the Amidah, he should concentrate even more. Finally, in the Amidah, which is the true embrace and union, he should divest himself of physicality, as it is written in the <i>Tur</i>, <i>Orach Chaim</i> 98.<br>This generates “Feminine Waters,” which are followed by the “Masculine Waters,” so that a “male” is born. This is not the case when a person is aroused spontaneously, which indicates trouble, G-d forbid, and is the meaning of the verse: “his prayer will be turned into sin” (Psalms 109:7). The solution is to realize what is going on, fear greatly, and pray from the depths of one’s heart.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, <i>Acharei</i> <i>Mot,</i> p. 97d

Comment 96

When a person begins to pray, as soon as he says the words “L-rd, open my lips,”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">“L-rd, open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Your praise” (Psalms 51:17). This verse is recited at the beginning of the Amidah prayer. The implication is that the mouth declares G-d’s own words of praise, not merely our praise of Him.</i> the Divine Presence clothes itself in him and speaks his words [of prayer]. If a person believes this, he will certainly experience fear and awe. G-d also contracts Himself, as it were, and rests with him, as it says: “He peers through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9), that is, through the letters, which are palaces. A person goes from palace to palace [during the prayer service], and is judged in each one whether he deserves to enter. If he would only realize that they are judging him when extraneous thoughts enter his mind,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov explains elsewhere that the extraneous thoughts that enter a person’s mind during prayer are really the “guards” of the King, meant to keep the unworthy away. A person who loves the King, however, will push through all of these barriers, until he experiences a Divine revelation. See <i>Sefer Baal Shem Tov on the Torah</i>, <i>parashas VaYakhel</i>, “The Pillar of Prayer.”</i> he would certainly pray with more concentration. The problem is that he forgets that they are judging him.<br><i>Likutey Amorim</i>, p. 1b

Comment 97

The Baal Shem Tov explained the Zohar’s statement that a person is judged in each palace, and is expelled [if he is unworthy].<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I:234a</i> Words are called “palaces,” for the intellect dwells within them. When a person prays, he goes from letter to letter and from word to word. But if he is unfit, they expel him by hurling distracting thoughts at him, and automatically, he is outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">R. Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk writes that extraneous thoughts can only enter the mind of a person who is unhappy with his level of worship. He compares this to a peasant who tries to enter the palace of the king. Since he does not belong there, the guards push him out. So too, a person who tries to pray and serve G-d on a higher level than is appropriate for him will be pushed away by foreign thoughts. However, a person who is happy with his level, even if it is not very high, will be able to pray with clarity. Since he is in his place, nothing can push him out.</i><br><i>Ibid.</i> p. 7b

Comment 98

If an extraneous thought suddenly enters your mind [during prayer], you should feel humiliated, for they are pushing you out of the King’s palace. You should return to the palace with great shame and submission. For the sin of having foreign thoughts is like that of giving birth to an illegitimate child, as the Gemara states: “one sheep follows the other”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesuvos</i> 63a. I.e. the acts of the children follow the acts of the parents.</i> For thought is masculine and feminine, and voice and speech are masculine and feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Voice is non-differentiated sound, and is considered masculine. Speech gives it shape and meaning, and is considered feminine. This follows the principle that the vessel – the feminine aspect – gives form to the expansive masculine element.</i> If you have a foreign thought and speak words of holiness, those words are like a bastard, whose body is normal, but whose soul is bad.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages consider the soul of an illegitimately conceived individual to be blemished by the sinful act of his parents.</i> So too, the speech uses holy letters, but the thought is bad; for by thinking about something else, you give birth to a bastard with these holy words.<br>You should also imagine that G‑d is asking you, “Why have you come into the word, while I am not in the word?”– for you thoughts are in other things.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 10b<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Likutey Agados</i>, and the end of the <i>sefer Ohr Torah</i>, and <i>Likutim Amarim</i>, p. 18b.</i>

Comment 99

If you have foreign thoughts when you pray, G‑d forbid, the “impure shell”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kelipah</i>; i.e. a force of unholiness.</i> rides on your words; for thought rides upon speech. This is the meaning of: “to the horses in the chariot of Pharaoh, I have compared you, my beloved” (Song of Songs 1:9). Speech is called “horses,” and when Pharaoh – the foreign thought – rides upon it, then “I have compared you (“<i>dimisicha</i>”), my beloved.” For it would be better to be silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The grammatical root of the word “<i>dimisicha</i>” is “<i>domeh</i>,” which is related to the word <i>dumiah</i> –”silence.” Thus, at a time when foreign thoughts ride on one’s words of prayer, it would be better to be silent.</i>
However, “a word that comes from the heart, enters the heart” – that is, the Supernal Heart, by means of the breath, as is known.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 8a


Comment 100

The meaning of Unification (<i>Yichud</i>) is not to allow the intellect and the words to become separate, so as not to mix good and evil. This is “the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil” (Genesis 2:9), and “a handmaid who is heir to her mistress” (Proverbs 30:23). It is the meaning of Upper Waters.<br><i>Likutim Yikarim</i>, p. 5c

Comment 101

If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if I am for myself, what am I?<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 1:14.</i><br>In prayer, one must be completely divorced from physicality, and not feel one”s existence in this world. This is the meaning of: “If I am not for myself, who is for me?” Meaning, when I come to the level that I neither know or feel “if I am for myself”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov is stressing the words: “If I am not…” (אם אין אני). That is, if I have negated my existence to G‑d, then no foreign thoughts can distract me.”</i> – that is, if I am in this world or not – then I will certainly not be afraid of foreign thoughts. For which foreign thoughts can approach me when I am separated from this world? This is, “who is for me?” – meaning to say, which foreign thought can approach me?<br>However, “When I am for myself,” that is, when I consider myself as a separate entity in this world, then the opposite is true – I am not considered anything. This is the meaning of “What am I?” That is: “In what way am I important, and in what way is my worship important to G‑d? For foreign thoughts will distract me,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, when a person has a sense of ego and independent self, he becomes subject to extraneous thoughts in prayer.</i> and it is as though I am not in this world at all. For a person is created to serve G‑d, which I can not due to these thoughts.”<br>This also explains what the Sages said: “If I am here, all are here.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Succah</i> 53a.

Comment 102

When the Jewish people pray and attach themselves to G‑d, a voice calls out: “Go out and see, O Daughters of Zion” (Song of Songs 3:11). That is, if a person is neither fit nor disposed to this union, they tell him, “Go out.” But one who is fit and disposed to it will see – that is, “…and see.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., he will have spiritual perceptions.</i><br>When the impure shells hear this voice, they seek to disrupt this person”s prayers with foreign thoughts about passing fancies. But a wise person will cling in love and fear to the Creator and through this, uplift the sparks of life within these thoughts. “Why should I cling to the physicality of the thing?” he should say to himself. “It is better for me to cling to its inner vitality, which derives from G‑d”s attribute of Wisdom (<i>Chochmah</i>), as it says: “You have made them all with wisdom” (Psalms 104:24).

Comment 103

<b>“You will direct their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear…”</b> (Psalms 10:17)<br>A sign has been given to man. If he can direct his heart to G-d in prayer, without extraneous thoughts, at least, or [ideally] with fear and love, each person according to his level, then he knows that his prayers were accepted. Thus is says: “You will direct their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear….” That is, when a person prays, he can know if [his words] were accepted, and that G-d has listened.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, <i>Behaloscha</i>, p. 138c

Comment 104

I heard from my Teacher, the Baal Shem Tov, about the alacrity and precaution that people on our level must exert in prayer, in order to be saved from foreign thoughts. The Baal Shem Tov told a parable in the name of his brother-in-law, Rabbi Gershon Kutover, concerning people who do not even realize that their prayers are full of extraneous thoughts.<br>There was a very dangerous road that passed through a forest. Hidden in the woods were enclaves of murderers and bandits, just waiting for travelers to pass by. They would emerge from their hiding places and rob and beat them. A person who had to pass through this forest would do so at top speed, so that the bandits would be able to get him. Once, two men set out on the road together. One was very drunk, and the other not. As they passed through the woods, the sober man traveled at great speed until he passed through the forest safely. His friend, the drunk, however trod on step-by-step through the forest. The murderers grabbed hold of him, beat him, and wounded him; yet he did not feel a thing due to his great intoxication.<br>When the two friends met later, the first one couldn’t believe what happened to the second. He asked him how he had survived all the blows he received. But the drunk was amazed at his friend’s amazement, and professed that he wasn’t aware of anything having happened. To his mind, he passed through the forest without harm. Finally, the first one showed him in a mirror all of his wounds and bruises, and the blood spots on his clothing. But he was still amazed, since he didn’t remember anything.<br>The parable is understood by itself.<br><i>Divrei Moshe, Bo</i>

Comment 105

The fact that a person experiences foreign and confusing thoughts during prayer is actually a good sign. We can explain this by way of example. A human king surrounds himself with numerous walls and guards so that no one can approach him. Sometimes a person wants to present the king with a request, and the guards sense that it will be bad for them. If they are sure that he is an unimportant person, and that the king will certainly not heed him or fulfill his request, they let him through; for what difference does it make? However, if he is one of the king’s important ministers, the guards do all they can to prevent him. They do not want him to see the king, for they know that it will be bad for them, as the king will heed his words.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this case, the gate-keepers represent the forces of illusion that keep people from recognizing and drawing close to G-d. These manifest themselves in the consciousness as the distracting thoughts and desires that arise during prayer. These forces (and thoughts) are only enlivened by a spark of holiness that is exiled among them. The Tzaddik (the minister) wants to redeem this spark, and bring it to the King, thereby robbing them of their power, and negating them. Thus, they opposed his entry into the palace.</i><br>The same applies to prayer, which is attachment [to G-d] in order to uplift all the holy sparks from the side of evil, and from all the low things. This is bad for them. But if a simple person approaches G-d – whose prayers are anyway not so good, and make no impression – they leave him alone, and do not confuse him too much. Not so, a G-d-fearing person, whose prayers bear fruit below and in their supernal root. The side of evil does everything it can to disturb him with foreign thoughts. If a person is wise enough to realize this, he will strive with all his might and cry out in a bitter voice, “Father, save me!” Then, the Holy One, who longs for the prayers of Israel, will open all doors for him, and bring about a proper rectification, uplifting the holy sparks and bringing the redemption.<br><i>Sefas Emes </i>(from R. Meshulam Feivush of Barzan), <i>Va’erah</i>

Comment 106

When you have foreign thoughts [in prayer], you should think that everything comes from letters, which are holy. It is just that in you mind, they form foolish patterns. If you can rearrange these letters [to spell out] holy matters, it would be very good. Alternatively, you can rearrange the words of the foreign thoughts, or divide one word into two, or [extract] the first letters of the words, so long as you do not break your spiritual attachment.<br><i>Darchei Tzedek</i> 25

Comment 107

A human being is composed of numerous forces, and each one is necessary for another [supernal] world. When his soul ascends to all the worlds that it must rise to, they examine it in each world to see if he is fit to enter. If not, they push him out. Sometimes, they send him extraneous thoughts to push him away. But if he is wise, he can bind himself to G‑d even more through that very thought. Because the thought is made of letters, which are the “limbs” of the Divine Presence. These fell among the “shells” due to the force of the Breaking [of the Vessels], so that the letters became arranged in an evil pattern. This is like a person who serves delicacies that are all mixed together. Each one alone is good, but when they are combined, they are repulsive. So too, this has become bad.
But when he understands the nature of the thought – if it is desire, then it has fallen from the World of Desire,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This is related to the Sefirah of Chesed.</i> if negative fear, from the World of Fear,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Related to the Sefirah of Gevurah.</i> if pride, from the World of Tiferes, and so on, all that fell from the “Seven Days of Building”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the seven days of creation, which correspond to the seven lower Sefiros, from Chesed to Malchus, that fell during the primordial Breaking of the Vessels.</i> – and he binds them to G‑d in love and fear of the Creator, he returns them to their source. The same holds true of the other attributes, each thought according to the attribute from which it fell. When he binds it to that attribute, the shell falls away, and it forms a good combination. This is what is said: “They open the cords and the sacks fall”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 153a</i> – that is, the shells fall.
G‑d takes great pleasure in this. Like the son of a king who has fallen into captivity. When they bring him to the king, the king is much more pleased than had his son been with him all the time.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 3a, <i>Likutey Amarim</i> p. 4a

Comment 108

When a person has a foreign though during prayer or Torah study, he should break that thought and attach himself to G‑d. Through this, he repairs the holy spark that is in that thought. This is like a person who was counting money, and whose son was in captivity. He comes to his father and says, “Look, you have money. Redeem me from captivity.”<br><i>Likutey Yikarim</i>, p. 15c

Comment 109

If a person does not study Torah and pray with love and fear of G‑d, his words do not ascend.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tikunei Zohar</i>, p. 25b.</i> All the more so, if he has extraneous thoughts, which are called invalid offerings,” for they are given to the “externalities.” When he repents, though, he uplifts those holy sparks, and they then enter his mind as foreign thoughts during prayer or Torah study. These are his very sins that attack him like in a battle. However, their real desire is that he repair and redeem them from the depths of the impure shells. He does this by trembling at the realization that they are his sins, and acknowledging that he must regret them.<br>I received this explanation from my Teacher, and there is no need to explain it further.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 158a

Comment 110

I heard from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) the inner meaning of the Alphabet, and how one apply to each word the principles of subjugation, separation, and amelioration.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hamtaka</i>; literally, “Sweetening.”</i> Meaning to say, all the mystical intentions needed [to annul] the 320 and 280 Judgments,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>shach</i> (ש”ך) and <i>par</i> (פ”ר) <i>dinim.</i></i> alluded to in the first word of the <i>Amidah</i> – <i>Ado-nai</i> – must be applied to each word of prayer, in order to sweeten the judgments. For the letter <i>aleph</i> (אלף) is the mystery of <i>peleh</i> (פלא). It is clothed in the letter <i>beis</i>, which is two <i>alephs</i>, then the letter <i>gimel</i>, which<i> </i>is three <i>alephs</i>, until the letter <i>tav</i>, which is four hundred <i>alephs.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew letter <i>tav</i> has the numerical value of 400.</i> For the further a letter is from the beginning of the alphabet, the further it is from vitality, and the more it becomes clothed in the impure shells, until Malchus of Malchus,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov is drawing a correlation between the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the ten <i>Sefiros</i>. The nature of the <i>Sefiros</i> is holographic, so that each one contains within it aspects of all the rest. (Thus, for instance, we count 49 combinations of <i>Sefiros</i> during the days of <i>Sefiras Ha’Omer</i>, between Passover and Shavuos. The first day of the Omer is <i>Chesed</i> in <i>Chesed</i>, and the last day of the Omer is <i>Malchus</i> in <i>Malchus</i>.) The Baal Shem Tov means that just as there is a downward progression from the highest Sefirah to the last, so there is a degression from first letter of the alphabet to the last; from <i>aleph</i> to <i>tav</i>. On this last level, the letters arise in the mind in the form of negative patterns and thoughts. However, when a person recalls that even there, the Divine Presence is concealed, he can disperse all the bad thoughts, and direct his mind again to G‑d.</i> which is the place of bad thoughts. But when a person remembers that the Divine Presence is in exile [there], and that a spark of the Shechina is clothed in this odious shell, he will feel appalled. Then, “all the workers of iniquity will be dispersed” (Psalms 92:10), and a Unification will be made between “fear” and “awesome.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is the union between the <i>Sefiros</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malchus</i>.</i> The spark of holiness will be removed and reunited with the life-force above, in the mystery of “the living creatures ran and returned” (Ezekiel 1:14). This is its redemption from captivity. And this is the meaning of “submission.” It is as though you are not speaking, only the Divine Presence. Whereas “separation” means removing the “shell,” and “amelioration” means uplifting it and sweetening it in its root.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 208d

Comment 111

<b>Our oxen are bearing</b> (<i>alupheinu mesubalim</i>), <b>with no breach, and no bad tidings, and no outcry in our streets.</b> (Psalms 144:14)<br>When a person knows that the Master of the World (<i>Alupho shel Olam</i>) is in every movement in the world, he can bear everything. Then there is “no breach and no bad tidings.” I also heard from the Baal Shem Tov that when a person knows that G‑d’s glory fills the whole world, and that every action and thought comes from Him (even though the words of certain prayers seems to contradict this), then, “all the workers of iniquity will be disbanded” (Psalms 92:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. all the forces of evil will dissipate.</i><br>I also heard from him that a person needs to do subjugation, division, and amelioration,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hachna’ah</i>,<i> Havdalah</i>, and <i>Hamtaka</i>; the last literally meaning “Sweetening.” See this year’s teaching on Purim from the Baal Shem Tov.</i> on account of the Breakage of the Vessels that caused the holy sparks to fall among the “shells.” That is, one must separate adverse and foreign thoughts from the Shechinah.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This is the second stage. The first stage is “subjugation,” in which the foreign thoughts are brought under control.

The third stage, “amelioration,” entails uplifting that truth and incorporating it in the service of G‑d.</i> And this can be done in two ways, in general and in particular, as I heard from him on the Gemara: “How does one dance before the Bride?<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. how does one praise a bride at a wedding?</i> Beis Shammai said: ‘The bride, as she is.’ Beis Hillel said, ‘A pleasant and gracious bride!’” Beis Shammai felt that in the period of exile, the general way is enough, as she is.

However, if you cannot, you should at least know in a general way that everything is from G‑d. Then you can stand firm and not be pushed from your level by the “shells.” You will remain attached to G‑d, which is His promise: “And I will give you a path between these standers” (Zechariah 3:7).

How does one dance before the bride? Beis Shammai said: “The bride, as she is.” Beis Hillel said, “A pleasant and gracious bride!”<br>The Baal Shem Tov explained their disagreement as follows.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov interprets this Mishnah as applying to prayer, which is a manifestation of the Shechinah, the spiritual “bride” of the Holy One. Beis Shammai sees prayer as being mixed with good and evil, with holy words, yet many distracting thoughts. Thus, he can only praise it “as it is.” Beis Hillel knows how to extract the fallen sparks of holiness even within the foreign thought, thereby uplifting that thought, and making prayer a beautiful bride of G  d.</i> Beis Shammai said to praise the bride as she is, even in a general way, by knowing that G‑d’s glory is hidden everywhere. Beis Hillel said to praise the grace and beauty of the bride, for he knew the specific sparks of holiness that had fallen among the shells, and how the foreign thoughts come to mind during prayer in order to be repaired. Then, one must separate and remove the shell, and to raise and adorn the holy spark from among it, making it into a lovely and graceful bride.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 8d

When a person knows and believes that G‑d’s glory fills the whole world, and that everything – each and every movement and thought – is from Him, then “all the workers of iniquity will disband” (Psalms 92:10).

Rav Zeirah said: “If a person says ‘<i>Shema</i>, <i>Shema’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, if he recites <i>Keriyas Shema</i> twice in a row.</i> we silence him.” Rav Papa said to Abaye, ‘But perhaps he wasn’t concentrating the first time.” … “Is he G‑d’s friend?” [Abaye] replied.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That he can be so casual when addressing him in <i>Keriyas Shema</i>.</i> “If he doesn’t concentrate the first time, we hit him with a blacksmith’s hammer until he does.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 33b.</i><br>But the question remains, maybe he <i>didn’t</i> concentrate the first time, and is now trying to concentrate in order to fulfill his obligation. Furthermore, why did Rav Zeirah choose the example of repeating “<i>Shema</i>, <i>Shema</i>,” as opposed to another verse in the <i>Keriyas Shema</i>, or somewhere else?<br>The answer lies in the meaning of “accepting the yoke of heaven” (<i>kabalas ol malchus shamayim</i>). A person must believe that the entire world is filled with G‑d’s glory, and that no place is empty of Him. G‑d’s existence is found in all of a person’s thoughts, and each one of them is a complete structure. Adverse and foreign thoughts enter one’s mind during prayer in order to be fixed and uplifted. If a person fails to believe this, he has not fully accepted the yoke of heaven, for he limits G‑d’s being.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">As though He were not in the thought, G‑d forbid.</i> This is the meaning of “<i>Shema</i>, <i>Shema</i>.” Why did he say it twice? Most likely because he was not concentrating the first time, for he was having a foreign thought. Yet, had he realized that G‑d’s Presence is there too, he would not have had to say it twice.<br>This is captured in the Talmud’s terse language: “We hit him with a blacksmith’s hammer.” Meaning, one’s own thoughts strike him like a hammer, in order to be fixed and uplifted. But by say Shema twice, it is as though G‑d wasn’t there the first time. This person limits on G‑d’s existence and his own acceptance of the yoke of heaven. Thus, we silence him.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 50b-c
This explains the statement of the Talmud: “If a chick dies in its shell, from where does its spirit leave.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bechoros</i> 8b.</i> And it answers: “From the same place that it came in.” For it says in tractate <i>Berachos</i>: “One who sees eggs in a dream, his supplications are in abeyance; broken ones – his supplications are answered.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 57a.

If you reject that thought, you have rejected and killed a complete entity.<br>Yet, at times, a certain thought must be pushed away. And if you want to know how to differentiate between those you should reject and those to draw close and uplift, think what happened when the thought came to you. If it immediately occurred to you how to fix and elevate it, then draw it close and do so. But if it does not immediately occur to you how to fix it, then it is most likely coming to distract you from your prayers, and disturb your thoughts. Then, you are allowed to push it away, for “if a person comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 72a.</i><br>This is the meaning of “If a chick dies in its shell, from where does the spirit leave.” Meaning to say, a foreign thought during prayer, which is called “an egg,” that “dies” that is, that you reject and kill, “from where does its spirit leave?” Meaning, how dare you reject and kill a complete entity? The answer is, “The same way it came in.” Just as it came in to distract you and push you away [from G‑d], that’s how it leaves. You are allowed to reject it from your thoughts.
Someone once asked the Baal Shem Tov if he was allowed to go back and repeat several words of the <i>Keriyas Shema</i> or prayers that he said without concentration. The Baal Shem Tov answered as follows: “It is well known that G‑d’s existence is in everything. Even extraneous thoughts contain sparks of holiness. Therefore, if you say a few words of prayer without concentration, while lost in the extraneous thoughts, you should know that that thought has come to have its spark removed. By repeating the word, you demonstrate that G‑d was not there the first time you said them, and you thus limit G‑d’s existence. You should not say them twice; rather, you should think about and concentrate on those words [in your mind] that you first said without concentration.”<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 50b-c, 53d

<b>Whoever says “<i>Shema</i>, <i>Shema</i>…”</b><br>Foreign thoughts that come to mind during prayer or Torah studying contain the very sparks of holiness that fell among the <i>kelipos</i> on account of that person, whether in this incarnation or in a previous one, or due to the sin of Adam, who had in him all the souls of Israel. Thus, each Jew must fix the sparks that belong to him. For when a person stands in prayer and wants to be attached to holiness, those sparks also come to be repaired.<br>I heard this myself from the Baal Shem Tov, who said: “One must be very insightful<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">To be able to discern the point of holiness that the thought contains.</i> concerning the foreign thoughts that come during prayer, for they are one’s own potencies that come to be fixed.”<br><i>Divrei Moshe</i>, <i>Lech Lecha</i>

Comment 119

<b>May his prayer be turned into sin… May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow… May the creditor confiscate all that is his…” (Psalms 109: 7,9,11).</b><br>Why is the wicked man punished by his wife and children being widowed and orphaned? The Baal Shem Tov explained this with a statement from the Talmud: “What is more important? Torah study or deed?... Study is greater because it leads to deed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kidushin</i> 40b.</i> But this implies that action <i>is</i> greater. Rather, Torah study has two aspects, as our Rabbis have said: “Whoever studies the teachings of the <i>Olah</i> sacrifice, is considered to have offered it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachos</i> 110a.</i> Therefore, he achieves them both, which is not the case with action alone.<br>Now, the <i>nefesh</i>-soul enclothes the <i>ruach</i>, and the <i>ruach</i> enclothes the <i>neshama</i>. Therefore, the <i>nefesh</i> is the “wife” in relationship to the <i>ruach</i>, and the <i>ruach</i> is the “wife” in relationship to the <i>neshama</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This follows the kabbalistic division of the world into “lights” and “vessels,” which correspond to the archetypes of “masculine” and “feminine.” Lights are always enclosed in vessels (as the soul is enclothed in the body). Thus, that which is outer is feminine to that which it contains.</i> as our Sages have said: “He swallows up a Tzaddik greater than him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megilah</i> 6b: “Rav Huna said, What does it means: ‘Why do You look on when they deal treacherously, and hold Your peace when the wicked swallows up one who is more righteous than he?” (Habakkuk 1:13)? One who is more righteous than he, he can swallow up, but the perfectly righteous (<i>Tzadik gamur</i>) he cannot swallow up.” The Baal Shem Tov uses this as another example of the paradigm of lights and vessels. In this case, the corrupt “vessel” of the evil man “swallows up” (i.e. covers) the Tzadik. In this sense, the wicked are feminine in relationship to the Tzadik. This was the case of King David and his two enemies: Do’eg Ha’Adomi (a servant of King Saul – I Samuel 22), and Achitofel HaGiloni (who sided with David’s son, Avshalom, during the latter’s rebellion – 2 Samuel 15). Thus, the Baal Shem Tov states that they learned Torah (despite their wickedness), which makes them feminine in relationship to David, who was the embodiment of prayer (that descends from Above).</i> Thus, David was also speaking about<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse from Psalms, above.</i> Do’eg and Achitofel, who did learn Torah, which is considered the “feminine waters”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">“Feminine waters” or “masculine waters” refer to spiritual influences that either ascend from below, or descend from above, respectively.</i> in relationship to prayer, as the Maharsha writes, that the whole Torah is a preparation for attaining “fear of G‑d,” which is prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This cannot be found in the commentary of the Maharsha. Still, see Rashi on <i>Yoma</i> 72b, s.v. “<i>Va’tirah sh’peiresh</i>.”</i><br>Then, in prayer, they bestow upon the person “masculine waters,” corresponding to the “feminine waters.” When a person studies Torah selflessly, the masculine waters reflect back the feminine waters,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">With pure prayers.</i> but when he studies for personal motives, <i>that </i>becomes reflected back to him in his prayers. Then, his “prayers are turned to sin,” for they confound his prayers with extraneous thoughts. His “wife,” who is his <i>nefesh</i>, becomes a widow, for she does not clothe the <i>ruach</i>, providing it with “feminine waters.” And his “children” which are his good deeds, become orphans. For the Torah is called “deed,” as we mentioned above, and because he studied for ulterior motives, his good deeds wander off and do not ascend. Thus, they are orphans.<br>“May the creditor confiscate all that is his…” This is the evil inclination who “loans” him mitzvos to feel haughty, or to study Torah, which is called “deed,” for the sake of honor. And so will they give him “masculine waters” from above – great evils and troubles. Then his creditor, the evil inclination, comes to collect his loan, as it is written: “May the creditor confiscate all that is his.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov may mean here, “all the is the creditor’s,” since it was he who gave the person these mitzvos in the first place.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 108d

Comment 120

It is explained in the writings of the Arizal that until the coming of the Messiah, no two day’s prayers ever share the same aspect. This is the meaning of the Mishnah: “If a person makes his prayers fixed, his prayers are not a supplication.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 18b.</i> A proof of this is found in the extraneous thoughts that enter a person's mind during prayers, which derive from the mystery of the Breaking [of the Vessels] and the 288 sparks that a person must extract each day.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In the primordial Shattering of the Vessels, 288 sparks of holiness fell into the lower worlds. Fragments of these sparks are uplifted each day through the work Torah study and mitzvos.

Thus, the foreign thoughts of one day are not like those of the next, as is clear to anyone who pays attention.<br>Now, I heard from my Master a way to rectify these thoughts. If a man has fantasies about women, he should uplift them and attach them to their root in <i>Chesed</i>, in the mystery of the verse: “If a man takes his sister . . . and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., if they have sexual relations.</i> it is kindness (<i>Chesed</i>)” (Leviticus 20:17).

The reference here is to the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferes</i>, embodying the Divine forces of Beauty and Harmony.

Comment 122

I also learned from my Master how to tell if a foreign though comes from the side of <i>Chesed</i> (“Love”), having fallen in the Breaking of the Vessels and that now needing to be rectified and uplifted. Whereas, on the other hand, there are also sinful thoughts. When these enter one’s the mind, a person should realize that there are Judgments upon him that want to punish him. In such a case, he should be extremely concerned and make a unification between “fear” and “awe.” Then “all the workers of iniquity will disband” (Psalms 92:10).<br>Thus, he explained the verses: “And it came to pass, when [Abraham] approached to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife: I know now that you are an attractive woman” (Genesis 12:11), and “When the local men asked [Isaac] about his wife, he said: ‘She is my sister’; for he was afraid to say: ‘My wife’; ‘lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebecca, because she is fair to look upon.’“ (ibid. 26:7).

Comment 124

I received from my teachers and from <i>seforim</i> that each day’s prayers must have a different mystical intention. Thus, it says in the Talmud: “…if a person is able to say something new.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 28b, 29b: “Rabbi Eliezer said, ‘If a person makes his prayers routine, they will not be heard… What does ‘routine’ mean? Rabbi Yosef said: ‘Whoever is not able to say something new in his prayers.’”</i> This is because the essence of prayer is to extract the 288 sparks of the broken vessels, which is the mystery of raising the “feminine waters,” to Malchus, in order to reunite the wife to her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Shechinah with the Sefirah of <i>Tiferes</i>.</i> This occurs when [extraneous] thoughts arise in one’s mind during prayer. A wise person knows how to extract the essence of these thoughts, which is the holy spark in the impure shells.<br>For instance, if a person has lustful thoughts, which come from the side of <i>Chesed</i>, as it is written: “If a man takes his sister<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., has incestuous relations with her.</i>… it is a shameful thing (<i>Chesed</i>)”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to most Biblical commentators, the word <i>chesed</i>, in Aramaic, means “shameful.” The Baal Shem Tov, however, follows the Hebrew meaning of the word, which is “love,” or “kindness.” The underlying idea is that all desire, even the most illicit, has a root in holiness. However, as a result of the primordial Breaking of the Vessels, that emotion fell to an impure, material state. The task of man is to uplift all thoughts and emotions to their supernal root.</i> (Leviticus 20:17), he should realize that this pleasure’s whole existence derives from the one holy spark within it, [How much greater, then, is the pleasure] of clinging to its root, where it is beyond limit. The same applies if a person has thoughts of idolatry, G-d forbid, or murder, which is from the left column.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Sefiros on the right-hand column of the Sefirotic chart are expansive, and are the root of human emotions, such as love, desire, and pleasure. The Sefiros of the left-hand column are contractive (<i>Binah, Gevurah, Hod</i>), and are the supernal root of emotions such as fear, anger and bloodthirstiness.</i> However, it is dangerous to expound on this theme, and a wise person will be silent.<br>Now, we see for ourselves that one day’s thoughts can never be like another’s. And so too, the prayers one formulates according to these thoughts. But for this, one needs a truly broad mind and tremendous concentration in order that his mouth and heart be aligned. This is not the case of one who prays by rote, each day the same. His mouth routinely utters the words, and his head bows automatically when he reaches “<i>Modim</i>.” His heart is absent, as Tosephos writes in the name of the Jerusalem Talmud: “We are grateful to the head that bows by itself at <i>Modim</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b.</i><br>For this reason, it seems to me, there are ten types of prayer, which correspond to the ten qualities of <i>Malchus</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Malchus,</i> the lowest Sefirah, contains within it a reflection of all the upper Sefiros.</i> which is called “prayer” (<i>tefilah</i>) and is the last quality of <i>Malchus</i> – <i>Malchus</i> of <i>Malchus</i>. Now, each day of a person’s life, he must repair one spark of these ten qualities, until the very end of his life, when he repairs the last quality of <i>Malchus</i> and returns in perfect repentance to <i>Malchus-</i>prayer – each individual according to his level and his personal channel of influence. This is similar to the generation before the Moshiach, when the entire world will be repaired down to the “heels,” and all the sparks of the universal <i>Malchus</i> will ascend. Then “death will be swallowed up forever” (Isaiah 25:8), and the Moshiach will come. So too, the life of each individual is a complete structure.
Thus, a person should thus realize that prayer is not for his own sake, but for the sake a higher purpose – for the good of the Shechinah. The Arizal wrote that if a person prays for himself, the Shechinah laments over him: “G-d has delivered me into their hands; I am unable to rise” (Lamentations 1:14). But if he is concerned with the good of the Shechinah, he is answered immediately. Thus, it is written in the <i>Tikunei Zohar</i>: “If the Shechinah is there, they immediately open [the supernal gates] for him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tikunei Zohar</i> p. 55a. See, also, the end of <i>Tikun</i> 33.</i> Furthermore, his requests are included in <i>Binah</i>, which is the “mother of all living.” For all souls are part of the Shechinah, and he too will be answered.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. by praying for the benefit of the Divine Presence, he draws down goodness to everyone who needs the same thing that he is praying for, including himself, for all souls are offshoots of the Shechinah.</i> However, if he prays for the Shechinah in order to be answered, he creates a barrier. May G-d enlighten us to serve him in truth and simplicity!
Now, the sign that your prayers have been answered is alluded to in the verse: “You will direct their heart, Your ear will hear” (Psalms 10:17). If [Heaven] helps him so that he can concentrate on his prayers, then certainly “Your ear will hear.” For were it not a propitious time for him to enter the King’s chamber and be answered, he would be unable to concentrate. But since he has come before the King, his request will certainly be fulfilled, for nothing can keep G-d from fulfilling his desires and requests, for He is the ultimate love and compassion.
Still, there are those who come before the King and are not answered. This is like a king whose consort has sinned. The King eventually dismisses her and she travels far away. One day, the king must go to that place on royal affairs. When his consort hears that he is coming, she devises a plan to see him. She comes before him and pleads with him. She tells him how bitter her life has been since she left the king, and she relates to him everything that happened to her since then. Ultimately, the king forgives her and fulfills her requests. However, if she comes before him with threats and accusations, claiming that he betrayed her, her words will go unheard – unless she finds the king in good spirits. Then her words will make an impression on him, and he will realize that her claim that he abandoned her is correct, and that his actions were inappropriate for a king. Then he will fulfill her will, and answer her favorably, despite the fact that she spoke accusingly.<br>This is called the “Shechina quarrels with her husband.” It is enough of an explanation for one who understands.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 181a

By way of example, a certain person has a deep and burning desire to speak with the king. The king issues a decree that anyone who presents him with a request will have it granted. When this person who longs to speak to the king presents his request, he is actually afraid that the king will fulfill it, and then he will have nothing more to talk to him about. He prefers, rather, that the king <i>not </i>fulfill his request, so that he has a reason to come before the king and speak to him again.<br>This is the meaning of: “A prayer of the poor, when he faints, and pours out his words before G‑d” (Psalms 102:1).

Once, in a period of drought, Shmuel HaKatan declared a public fast. The rains fell that same day, although after sunset. (This was considered late, as another story in the gemara tells of the rain falling immediately in the morning.) The people assumed that it was because G‑d desired to hear the prayers of the congregation the entire day. Shmuel HaKatan, however, rejected this assumption.<br>However, see the <i>Zohar</i> 2:15a: “Once, the world needed rain. Rabbi Eliezer came and decreed forty fasts, but the rain did not come. He prayed, but the rain did not come. Rabbi Akiva rose to pray. He said: ‘Who makes the wind blow,’ and the wind started to blow. ‘Who makes the rains fall,’ and the rains started to fall. Rabbi Eliezer became dejected. Rabbi Akiva looked in his face and stood before him. ‘I will tell you a parable,’ he said. ‘What is this like? Rabbi Eliezer is like the beloved of a king. The king is pleased when he comes before him, and does not grant him his request speedily, in order that he not leave him, for he is pleased to talk with him. But I am like a servant of the king that makes a request. He does not want me to enter the palace gates, and all the more so, to talk to him. Thus, the king says, “Fulfill his request quickly, and do not let him in.” Thus, Rabbi Eliezer is a beloved of the King, and I am a servant. The King wants to talk to [Rabbi Eliezer] the entire day, and not have him leave. But the King does not want me to enter the gates of the palace.’ Rabbi Eliezer was placated.”</i><br>This is the meaning of: “in order <i>not to</i> receive a reward.”<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, <i>Haftarah Ki Setze</i>, s.v. “<i>Rani</i>”

The Shechinah is called “prayer,” as it is written: “And I am prayer” (Psalms 109:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The pronoun “I” (<i>Ani</i>) refers to the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Malchus</i>, the lowest of the <i>Sefiros</i> in the Divine structure, and paralleling the Shechinah, that dwells (<i>shochen</i>) within creation.</i> When you pray, intent on uniting the Shechinah with her Husband, and don’t think of your own benefit, G-d forbid, for of this it is said: “The L-rd has delivered me into the hands of those I cannot withstand” (Lamentations 1:14).

I heard from my Master about prayer in the Diaspora.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">According to the editor of <i>Sefer Baal Shem Tov</i>, this should read “prayer during the week.”</i> The main thing is faith. That is, to believe that G-d’s glory fills the entire world.

And if you wonder why, at times, you do not get what you asked for; the reason is because it is concealed from you.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the manner of its fulfillment is concealed from you.</i> For instance, your request may have been fulfilled on a universal level. And although you asked as an individual for the problem be alleviated, really, [the suffering] is for your own good, such as to cleanse you of your sins, etc. Whereas if you have in mind to be answered yourself, you have made physical your request, when it should be purely spiritual – for the sake of the Shechinah, and not for the sake of this world. Therefore, it became an obstruction.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 127a

Comment 128

There are many aspects of prayer, one higher than the other. On the lowest level, a person prays for his own needs. This is the level of the world, as it is written: “All flesh is grass, and all their goodness is like the flower of the field” (Isaiah 40:6), and “Their acts of kindness are only for themselves.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tikunei Zohar</i>, <i>Tikun</i> 30, p.73b</i><br>The next higher level is to pray to fill a lack in the Shechinah. Indeed, by rectifying the supernal source, the deficiency below is also filled; for Above and below are one. However, you should not <i>intend</i> to repair both Above and below, for this is like “uprooting the shoots”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">A Rabbinic term for heresy.</i> to create a division.
I also heard an explanation of the Talmud’s statement: “There are things that stand at the height of the world, yet people belittle them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to prayer.</i> Meaning, the effects of prayer are Above, in the heights of the world, and not always below. Therefore, people belittle prayer and think that their supplications are worthless. But this is not so.
There is yet a higher level, when a person does not demand that even the supernal rectifications be accomplished, for there is a danger in that as well. As our Sages said on the verse: “Do not awaken and do not arouse love until it please.” And the story of Rabbi Yosef d’LeReina is proof.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">A fifteenth century kabbalist who tried to force the coming of the Messiah, but in failing, caused the Spanish exile instead.</i> Therefore, the best thing for a wise person is to do what is required of him, to pray over whatever happens, and let the Master of desire do as He knows best. This is the most exalted level – a service that is not for the sake of receiving recompense.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 144b

For you must believe that, if you have intention, you certainly unite the World of Speech with the World of Thought.

When a person puts himself into his words, they testify on his behalf, but only so long as his whole intention is to join the World of Speech to the World of Thought. This is the meaning of the three books that are opened on Rosh Hashana. “Books” has the implication of “speech.” The words of Tzaddikim, whose whole intention is to unite the World of Speech with the World of Thought, are immediately inscribed for life.

Comment 131

A person must consider himself as nothing, forgetting himself completely and praying only for the good of the Shechinah. Then he can attain a level that transcends time – the world of thought, where everything is equal: life and death, ocean and land. This is the meaning of the Zohar: “‘Why do they cry to Me?’ (Exodus 14:15) – ‘to Me’ specifically, for the matter depends upon <i>Atik</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar</i> 2:48a. When the Jewish people stood before the Red Sea, they cried out to G‑d. G‑d responded to Moses: “Why do they cry out to Me. Speak to the Children of Israel and tell them to travel on.” The <i>Zohar</i> explains that their prayers were to a lower level of Divine manifesation – “to Me” – whereas the redemption depended upon the revelation of <i>Atik</i>, which is the most recondite level of Divinity, the place above all duality and difference.</i> They had to abandon themselves completely and forget their own danger in order to enter the World of Thought, where everything is equal.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by transcending their own concerns and reaching the World of Thought, the sea turned into dry land, allowing them to pass though.

How then can he rise above temporality, to absolute Oneness? So too, when he considers himself as something and prays for his own needs. Then, G‑d is unable to clothe Himself in him, for G‑d is infinite, and no vessel can contain Him. This is not the case if he considers himself as nothing.<br><i>Likutim Amarim</i>, p. 18c<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kesser Shem Tov</i> II, p. 20d for a shorter version of this teaching.</i>

As long as you can still intend to pray the words: “Blessed are You,” you have not yet reached the peak of prayer. For a person must be so empty of physicality that not an ounce of awareness or strength remains in him.<br><i>Avodas Yisroel</i>, <i>Metzorah</i>

Comment 133

I heard from my Master a commentary on: “A prayer to a poor man, when he is enwrapped, and pours out his words before G‑d” (Psalms 102:1), for the verse should say, “A prayer <i>from</i> a poor man.”<br>He explained this by way of example. There was a great and compassionate king, who announced that all who needed something of him, should come and ask, and he would grant it. Some came for silver and gold, others sought positions of authority. However, there was one wise fellow who asked to find grace in the king’s eyes, and be allowed to speak with him three times a day. The king was pleased with his cleverness, seeing that he preferred the king’s words to gold and silver, and so the king decreed that whenever this wise man would want to enter the his inner chamber to speak with him, he should pass by way of the king’s treasuries and take whatever he wants without question.<br>Now, the king is best defined as a “poor man,” for he really does not have anything. Everything is under the supervision of his treasurer. Thus it says: “A prayer <i>to</i> a poor man.” Meaning, this person beseeches and prays to the King, the Poor One, that he should be able to speak to Him. “When he is enwrapped” – that is, in his request is wrapped up all the delights and treasures of the King. And he prays that “before G‑d” Himself “he pours out his words” – that he should speak to the King himself. For this includes everything.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 178c

Comment 134

Even though Rabbi Nechunia ben HaKaneh knew all the mystical intentions of prayer, he still prayed like a small child.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. with simplicity.</i> This is because there are the two aspects of <i>avodas Hashem</i>, one on the left, when G-d pushes a person away, and the other on His right, which draws a person closer. This also relates to the <i>Tur’s</i> statement: “When you refer to G-d [by the Name] ‘Ado-nai,’ remember that He is L-rd over everything. At the same time, keep in mind the written meaning of the Tetragrammaton, that G-d is, was, and will be, and that He brings into existence all the worlds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 5.</i><br>Thus, when you say the words “Blessed are You,” you should realize that G-d is right before you, and that His Name means “is, was, and will be." Indeed, there no greater pleasure than mentioning this Name and speaking to the King of the world face to face, as it is written: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth” (Song of Songs 1:2). This is called “His right hand will embrace me” (ibid. 2:6). On the other hand, if a person’s sins separate him from his Creator, so that when he says: “Blessed are You,” mundane thoughts enter his mind, making it him unable to concentrate, and causing him to lose the wondrous pleasure of “the kisses of his mouth,” this is called the “left hand” of the Holy One.<br>Nevertheless, even when His left hand completely pushes a person away, it is only in order for His right hand to receive him in repentance.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See also, <i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, <i>Beshalach</i>, p. 47c: “I heard from my Master, that the pushing away of the left hand is done by G-d Himself, in order to draw a person closer with His right hand.”</i> A wise person will realize that G-d Himself is there, even when His left hand rejects him. For when one person pushes another, he is right there. Therefore, he will lovingly accept this rejection, kiss it and be in great fear, knowing that this rejection is for the sake of bringing him even closer to G-d. For His right hand is outstretched to embrace the penitent.<br>So too, one should use the experience of externally generated fears to come to an inner fear [of G-d]. And from bad thoughts themselves, to understand [their inner point of goodness]. And even though G-d’s kisses are better than His rebuffs, nevertheless, do [as I have explained].<br><i>Ketones Passim</i>, p. 43b

If a perfected individual<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Adam sholem</i>” – referring to a Tzadik.</i> finds himself wasting time from Torah study or prayer, he should see this as G-d’s hand pushing him away in order to draw him nearer.

Comment 137

A person’s many sins cause him to become far from the service of G-d. Because in his lowliness, he does not believe that his prayers and Torah study draw Divine blessing into all the worlds, and that even the angels are nourished by his Torah and prayer. For if he believed this, he would serve G-d in joy and fear, and would be careful to say each letter and word properly. He would remember what it says: “When you lie between the sheepfolds (<i>sefasoyim</i>)” (Psalms 68:14) – that G-d watches a man’s lips (<i>sefasayim</i>), to kiss them when he says words of Torah and prayer in reverence and love. Who would not be filled with fear and dread upon realizing that the great and awesome King watches the lips of a man who is “despised and forsaken of men” (Isaiah 53:3)?<br>This reflects our Sages’ statement: “The humility of Rabbi Zechariah caused the destruction of the Temple.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gitten</i> 56a.</i> For a person should remember that he is a “ladder standing upon the earth, with his head reaching heaven” (Genesis 28:12), and that his every gesture, word, step and action makes its mark high above. Then, he will certainly be careful that all of his deeds are for the sake of G-d. This is not the case when a person thinks, “Am I really significant enough to damage or repair what is above and below. Are all of my deeds really recorded above?” This person will feel unaccountable for his deeds, saying “I will have peace” (Deuteronomy 29:18). But this is not true. Because through a person’s good deeds, he actually clings to G-d, as it is written: “And you shall go in His ways” (ibid. 29:9). By being compassionate below, he arouses the attribute of compassion in all the worlds above.<br>This is as I wrote on the phrase: “Know what is above from you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 2:1.</i> That is, from you yourself, from the different emotions that you feel, know that <i>that</i> is what is above you.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 181c-d

I heard a parable in the name of the Baal Shem Tov. A person is hungry, and desires food which is tasty to him. He sees the food up on a high place, beyond his reach. So he imagines that he is eating it. But does that really help? In fact, the more he thinks about the food, the hungrier he gets. So too, there are people who practice lofty and awesome mystical intentions which are at the height of creation, yet these people’s minds cannot reach there, for they are far from performing mystical intentions. How, then, does their practice help? It would be better for them not to try and reach this high place so beyond their level and comprehension.<br><i>Ohr HaMeir</i>, <i>Vayerah</i>

The reason we recite “For the sake of the unification of the Holy One and His Shechinah”<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This formula was established by the Arizal to be recited before each prayer and the performance of mitzvos.</i> is to unite Tiferet to Malchus,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “Beauty” to “Kingship.” The union of Tiferet and Malchus is the principle mystical union achieved by our prayers and mitzvos.

G‑d’s words constantly enliven the worlds. When a person performs a commandment, the Holy One takes pride in Malchus; that is, in His speech which is within the worlds. Then the person brings Malchus to G‑d; that is, G‑d takes pride in the world of speech. This is the meaning of the union of the Holy One and his Shechinah – that G‑d should take pride in his Kingship that is within the worlds. And he should reveal His Kingship, so that everyone will recognize that He is the Ruler of the worlds. This is a great delight for the Holy One.<br>Now, [a revelation] of His Kingship is from our side.

Comment 141

Why do we say “Our G-d and G-d of our fathers”? Because there are two types of people who believe in G-d. The first believes in the Holy One because he follows the path of his forefathers, and he remains strong in his faith. The second comes to religious belief through investigation. There is a difference between them. The first has the advantage that it is impossible to entice him [away from his beliefs]. Even if you present him with numerous refutations, G-d forbid, his faith is strong, in that he received it from his fathers. Furthermore, he never investigated it at all. However, the disadvantage is that his faith is like a commandment done by rote, without reason or understanding.<br>The second type of person also has an advantage, in that he recognized his Creator through extensive investigation; thus he is strong in his perfect faith and complete love. However, the disadvantage is that he can be easily dissuaded. If people present him with evidence that refutes his conclusions, he will be convinced, G-d forbid.<br>However, one who has both these traits is the highest of all. That is, he relies fully upon his forefathers, and has also come to [his belief] as a result of his own investigation. This is a good and pure faith. And this is what we say: “Our G-d and G-d of our fathers.” This can also explain the verse: “Taste and see that G-d is good” (Psalms 34:9). Meaning, taste [for yourself] as a result of your own investigation, and see – that is, see the conduct [of others], the same as our fathers conducted themselves.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, p. 19c; <i>Likutey Yikarim</i>, p. 16b

I heard [a teaching] from my Master on the subject of bridal adornments. That is, a bride is bedecked in various garments to make her desirable for marital union. At the time of union, however, “they remove their garments in physical intimacy.”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tikunei Zohar</i>, 66.</i><br>Now, “from my flesh, I shall behold G‑d.”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Job 19:26. Meaning, from the various aspects of human life – actions, emotions, cognitive processes – one can discern the workings of the Supernal Worlds.</i> Prayer is the Shechinah, the Supernal Bride, and the Tzaddik is the bridesmaid. When he prays from the depths of his heart, he unites prayer, the Bride, with the G‑d of Israel. This is the supernal union. Therefore, before the union, he must bedeck the bride with many adornments. However, he needs to know which garments are the proper ones. For, as is known, the Tzaddik is like the fruit and the wicked are like the “garment” or chaff. Now, it is against nature for fruit to grow without chaff, except in the future era, when: “the Land of Israel will put forth pastries and clothing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesuvos</i> 111b.</i> No, however, is a time when “one man rules over another to his detriment” (Ecclesiastes 8:9), that is, to his <i>own</i> detriment; i.e. to remove the spark of holiness that enlivens them.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the wicked are like the chaff surrounding a kernel, or a tight garment constraining the Tzaddik.

It has already been explained that all of a person’s prayers should be for the sake of the Shechinah, which is called “Prayer,” for she beseeches and prays to her Beloved One to fulfill her needs. Now, whatever a person lacks derives from a lack in the Shechinah.

It turns out that prayer is really for a supernal need – that G-d’s will to bestow upon creation should be fulfilled. This was the trait of Nachum Ish Gamzu (See <i>Ta’anis</i> 21a), who understood that there was a hidden goodness in all that happened to him, for evil does not issue forth from G-d.

Tzaddikim are the messengers of the Matron,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Shechinah.</i> and through their own suffering and deprivation they know the privations of the Shechinah, and pray for them to be filled.

This is the greatness of prayer.<br>This answers the age-old question as to the necessity of prayer, since G‑d surely knows our needs, “He tests the loins and the heart.” (Jeremiah 11:20). Rather, prayer is for a higher purpose. So that a person, by realizing that his own lacks derive from the privations Above, should pray for the Shechinah’s own needs to be filled.

Comment 157

I heard from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) how to pray for one’s enemies, and the benefit that comes from doing so. It is written: “A Tzaddik falls seven times and rises” (Proverbs 24:16). Meaning, the <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i> and <i>neshama</i> of the Tzaddik are incarnated in the seven [lower] Sefiros.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod</i> and <i>Malchus</i>.</i> That is, his <i>nefesh</i> is his servants and livestock.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>nefesh</i> is the lowest of the souls, corresponding to the world of <i>Asiyah</i> – Action, and is manifest as the basic life energy. This is personified by one’s servants and animals. Furthermore, the Divine Name that corresponds to the <i>nefesh </i>is <i>B’an</i> (ב”ן), which has the same numerical value as the word “beast” (<i>behemah</i>).<br>Although the Baal Shem Tov has just stated that the Tzaddik’s soul is incarnated in the Sefiros, he apparently means physical objects that <i>correspond</i> to the Sefiros above, as he subsequently explains. This reflects a cardinal teaching of the Baal Shem Tov that a person’s soul is not merely located in his body, but extends outward to be found in everything he possesses.</i> His <i>ruach</i> is his wife. Speech, too, is a union in the mouth, and is also referred to as his wife. Thus, the Sages said: “If he is worthy, she is a helper. If he is unworthy, she is against him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot</i> 63a, on Genesis 2:18: “And G‑d said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper against him’” (<i>ezer-kenegdo</i>).</i> That is, if he blemishes his power of speech, such as by speaking gossip and slander, he creates enemies who will speak against him.<br>The <i>neshama</i>, which is in the mind, is his children, so that by blemishing one’s thoughts, he suffers from his children. The same, too, of his <i>nefesh</i>. If he ruins his deeds, he will suffer from his servants and livestock.<br>It is possible to elevate the <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, and <i>neshama</i> in all the Sefiros, except for the seventh Sefirah, which is Malchus. For the <i>kelipat nogah</i> leeches onto there, making it is difficult to uplift the parts of the soul from there. Therefore, a person’s enemies that come from a blemish in speech must be fixed and uplifted through words of prayer, for if he pushes them away, they will hate him more due to their denseness and physicality.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the only way to defeat one’s enemies is by realizing that they are a part of one’s own soul, haven been created by one’s own misdeeds. By uplifting them, they are repaired. But if a person pushes his enemies away, he only casts them deeper into corporeality and further from spirituality, and so they will hate him even more.</i> Therefore, “for a Tzaddik to punish is not good”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This is a Chasidic interpretation of the verse. The literal meaning is: “even punishment for the Tzaddik is not good” – i.e. it is not good for a Tzaddik to receive punishment.</i> (Proverbs 17:26), for a Tzaddik’s enemies are his very spirit. Rather, one must pray for one’s enemies, to fix and uplift them. And through means of prayer, they are sweetened in their root, he removes their spirit from them, and what remains vanishes by itself. “May a wise man hear, and add understanding!” (Proverbs 1:5).
This was the greatness of Moses, who uplifted and rectified his speech. At first, they were the flocks that he tended,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, the Baal Shem Tov is now speaking about Moses’ <i>nefesh</i>-soul, which was first incarnated in his flock, and later, in his students.</i> and then they were reincarnated as his students, to whom he gave the Torah and studied with.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 126d

Comment 158

I heard from my Master that a person’s <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, and <i>neshama</i> are embodied in the seven [lower] Sefiros, and that his <i>nefesh</i> corresponds to his servants and livestock.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There are three levels of soul found within the human being: <i>nefesh, ruach</i> and <i>neshama</i> (the other two, <i>chaya</i> and <i>yechida</i>, are considered to surround a person from without). They correspond to a person’s physical, emotional and mental faculties. The <i>nefesh</i>, being the lowest, corresponds to those things that are most material in relationship to a person, in this case, his servants and livestock.</i> If he blemishes his <i>nefesh –</i> his actions – then his servants and animals will cause him pain.<br>The <i>ruach</i> – the “speaking spirit”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">On the words of Genesis 2:7, “…and the man became a living soul,” the Targum Unkelos translates: “and the man became a speaking spirit (<i>ruach m’malelah</i>).</i> – is his power of speech. If he damages his speech with slander, gossip and the like, it becomes people who will abuse him, and gossip about him. “Speech” also corresponds to marital union, as our Sages have said: “he sees her speaking.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kesuvos</i> 13a. The Mishnah states: “They [the court] saw [an unmarried woman] speaking with someone.” In the Gemara, Rav Assi explains that this is a euphemism for sexual relations.</i> Therefore, one’s wife is also his <i>ruach</i> – “if he is worthy, she is a helper, if not, she opposes him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Genesis 2:18: “And the L-rd G-d said… I will make him a helper opposite him.'</i><br>The <i>neshama</i> dwells in the mind, where the sperm originates.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash and Kabbalistic literature speak of the formation of sperm as occurring in the mind (i.e. whiteness from whiteness), from where it descends to the reproductive organs.</i> Thus, it corresponds to his children.

However, as the <i>kelipas</i> <i>nogah</i> attaches itself to the seventh Sefirah of Malchus, it is very difficult to elevate the parts of one’s soul from there.<br>All this teaches us that a person’s enemies come from his own blemished speech, and that he must elevate and repair his speech with words of prayer. He should pray that his enemies repent and be rectified, as in the story of Rabbi Meir and Beruria: “Let the sins be erased, but not the sinners.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 10a. That Talmud relates that Rabbi Meir had a neighbor who was an apostate, who constantly abused him. Rabbi Meir wanted to pray for the man to die, but Beruria, Rabbi Meir’s wife, taught him the verse: “Let sin cease from the earth” (Psalms 104:35). “It is written ‘sin’ (<i>chatayim</i>),” she said, “not ‘sinners’ (<i>chotayim</i>).” Rabbi Meir prayed for the man to repent, and he did so.</i> If you do not do this, but reject them further, they will become even more material and hate you more.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is, since they derive from the lowest part of your soul, which is trapped in the impure shells, if you push them away, they fall even lower and become more grossly physical; thus, they will hate you even more.</i> Thus, the Sages said: “Punishment, for the righteous, is also not good” (Proverbs 17:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 3a. This is an interpretive reading of the verse, which actually states: “To punish the righteous is also not good.” The Talmud means that it is not good for a Tzaddik to punish others.</i> Because a Tzaddik’s enemy is his own <i>ruach</i>, which becomes a human being who hates him. He must fix this person and elevate him with his prayers, which "sweeten" him in his root. Then his <i>ruach </i>will be removed from him, and what is left will disappear by itself. <sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See, also, <i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 23b.</i> Thus, Moses was first a shepherd; later he gave them the Torah, and they became his disciples.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the souls of the Jewish people, who were all part of Moses’ soul, were embodied in Moses’ flocks.

Comment 160

<b>He fulfills the desire of those who fear Him; He will hear their cry and save them.</b> (Psalms 145:19)<br>There is a problem with this verse. If G‑d already fulfilled the desire of those who fear Him, why must He hear their cry and save them? It should have been written in reverse: “He hears their cry, and fulfills the desire of those who fear Him.”<br>The answer lies in the fact that G‑d listens to all who call upon Him, for good or for bad. Thus, our Sages said: “A thief on the verge of a break-in calls out to the Compassionate One.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ein Yaakov</i>, <i>Berachos</i> #139.</i> And if you then ask, wherein lies the difference between a Tzaddik and a sinner, the answer is that there is a very big difference. Because when a thief, whose prayers to steal are answered, gets caught, G‑d will not answer his prayers to be released, for he chose this himself. But when a Tzaddik prays for something, G‑d gives it to him, even though He knows it is not for his good – “He fulfills the desire of those who fear Him.” Later, when the Tzaddik himself sees that it is bad for him and prays to G‑d, He, in His compassion, “will hear their cry and save them.”
Along these lines, I heard from Rav Yoel an explanation of the Midrash: “… If only they forsook Me, and kept My Torah!”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eicha Rabbosai</i>, 2, on Jeremiah 16:11: “…they have forsaken Me, and not kept My Torah.”</i> This is an astounding statement! He explained it with the Sages’ comment about the thief. For, really, why <i>are</i> his prayers answered when he transgresses G‑d’s will? It must be that were they not answered, he would have no free will, in that he would not be able to sin. In addition, the fact that they were answered will lead him pray to do good, since he sees that there is a Higher Power who hears his prayers – even those that cause another person harm. Surely, then, He will listen to him when he seeks to do good.<br>It turns out that these people only sin because they trust that G‑d will listen to their prayers. Otherwise, they would never dream of stealing, and would keep what the Torah says: “Thou shall not steal.” This is the meaning of: “If only they forsook Me and kept My Torah.” Meaning to say, “If they didn’t trust me to help them sin, they would keep My Torah, which states: ‘Thou shall not steal.’ But this is not the case now, when they steal because they trust in Me.”<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 186c

Wouldn’t it be better for them not to be found?<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., not to look for them at all.</i> Furthermore, in the Messianic era, all of the problems that require our prayers will be annulled. Yet prayer is a limb of the Shechinah. Is it possible to annul it, G‑d forbid?<br>The answer is that there are four types of prayer. (1) Prayer for the sake of G‑d’s glory, that is diminished and desecrated among the nations. It is right to pray for this; (2) it is [also] right to pray for forgiveness of sin, for sin is worse than death. Death atones for and purifies a person from sin; whereas sin causes numerous deaths and spiritual excisions, G‑d forbid; (3) prayer for livelihood, and (4) for life.<br>Now, the limbs of the Shechinah are enwrapped in these four types of prayer,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">That is, G‑d sends us various difficulties and needs in order that we pray for them. It is as though the Divine Presence is within the difficulty itself, encouraging us to pray. However, this Presence is only redeemed when we can transcend out personal travails, and pray on behalf of the Shechinah. For whatever is lacking in this physical world is also lacking in its spiritual root.</i> in that a person should pray for them, remove the physicality and uplift the inner spark of the Shechinah. But when these four types<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. deficiency in four areas: G-d’s glory, sin, livelihood, and life.</i> are missing, one does not know what to pray for. This is what the verse says: “The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for,” in order to pray about it, “and there shall be none.” Likewise, “the sins of Judah,” which are the types of lacks mentioned above, “shall not be found” – it shall not be found what to prayer for.

When there are harsh Judgments upon a person, G‑d forbid, you should pray only in your thoughts to annul them, so that they can not accuse you.<br><i>Toldos Adam</i>, <i>Vayigash</i>

Comment 167

It is known what my Grandfather (the Baal Shem Tov) said, that following prayer, a person should be cautious with his actions, for he can fall into anger or some other improper behavior, G‑d forbid. Meaning, if he prays with the attribute of fear, he can fall into anger.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Anger is a lower manifestation of feelings of awe and fear of G‑d. Every emotion and character trait has both an elevated form, which is manifested in moments of spiritual awakening, and a debased form, that surface in times of distance from G‑d.</i> And if he prays with the attribute of great love, he can come at times to unnecessary love. From these examples, you can understand how this applies to every character trait. The recommendation, then, is immediately after prayer to study Torah or do some work.<br>These words require a broad and deep explanation, which is impossible to put in a book. Rabbi Yaakov Yosef HaKohen<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Author of <i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef,</i> and other early works of Chasidism.</i> found support for [the Baal Shem Tov’s] words in a Mishnah: “All Torah that is not accompanied by work, will ultimately be nullified and lead to sin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 2:2.</i><br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Ki Sisa</i>

Comment 168

There is another way by which a person can know if his prayers have been answered. That is, if he feels happy after he prays, and the opposite applies if he feels depressed. Based on this, I heard an explanation of the Talmud’s statement: “One day [Rabbi Buna] joined Redemption to Prayer and he did not stop smiling the entire day.” The question on this is famous,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 9b. The simple meaning of this is that he recited the blessing: “Redeemer of Israel” (<i>go’al Yisroel</i>) adjacent to the Amidah prayer. However, since the contiguity of these prayers is a normal part of the daily morning liturgy, the Talmudic commentators have sought alternative ways to understand this statement. Tosephos, <i>loc. cit.,</i> writes that Rabbi Buna joined these two prayer together at dawn. He finished the blessing “Redeemer of Israel,” and started the Amidah prayer at the exact moment of sunrise. This is known as praying like the <i>vatikin</i>. The Baal Shem Tov offers a different explanation.</i> for surely he joined Redemption to Prayer every day. However, he never knew if his prayers had any effect Above. On the day that he joined Redemption to Prayer and did not stop smiling, he realized that he had caused a Supernal Unification. Thus he was overjoyed.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Ekev</i>

<b>For the heart of man is evil from his youth.</b> (ibid. 8:21)<br>Our Rabbis have said: “[G-d says], I created the evil inclination, and I created the Torah as a spice for it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. as a means to rectify it. <i>Kiddushin</i> 30b.</i> And this is what is written: “Great is G-d, and highly to be praised, in the city of our G-d, His holy mountain” (Psalms 48:2). Meaning to say, Your love and affection for us is very great, as it is written: “Israel, in whom I am glorified” (Isaiah 49:3). For G-d takes great pride, pleasure and delight from the deeds of Tzaddikim in Torah study and prayer. Even though everything is from You – You created the evil inclination and You created the Torah, and you give us the ability to overcome our inclination and to rectify it through the Torah, like spice in a stew. It comes out that everything is from you, and from You and Your power we do all this. Nevertheless, you take great delight in this, and you are proud of us, as if we did it ourselves. Through this, Your love for us becomes apparent, and the great affection is known to us, that we are called the children of ….<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 3:14: “…”</i>
This is like a father and his beloved son. A guest comes to visit and wants to test the son in his studies. However, the son could not understand the law in question at all, due to its great depth and complexity. But the father, in his great affection for his son, could not bear to see his son suffer in his struggle and inability to understand (answer). What does the father do? He opens and opening in the law, and shows him the way to go in and out in the argument. (blah!). He almost tells him the entire law. Now, when the visitor comes to ask the son the law and to test him before the father, and the son begins to answer him, and the guest asks him more questions and challenges him, and he answers each one correctly, with a clear understanding. His father sees and is happy, and takes pleasure and pride in this. Even though it is from his own influence that he does this, he still takes pride in it.
Now, when the guest sees that the father takes pleasure in this, he wants to add to the fathers pleasure and tries to defeat (overcome) the son, and so he asks him new and more difficult questions. But since the son trusts (knows he can rely on) his father, he himself wakes up to answer all the questions on his own. This is what the Sages have said: “Whoever is greater than his friend, has a greater [evil] inclination.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 52a.</i> And they likewise said: “The Satan intents for the sake of heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Basra</i> 16a.</i><br>The meaning of the parable can be understand that when the Satan sees that the Tzaddik has defeated his evil inclination, and that G-d takes delight in this, he attacks him again each day, and so he ust overcome and defeat his inclination. This is what the Sages said: “The Holy One called Jacob El,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megilah</i> 18a.</i> which has the implication of strength and might,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamos</i> 21a.</i> as in “…” (Ezekiel 17:…). This, that He called him El is because the Tzaddik is called a mighty one, for he conquers his evil inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pirkei Avos</i> 4:1: “Who is mighty? One who conquers his inclination.”</i> And concerning the future, the Sages have said: “For Tzaddikim, the evil inclination will appear like a great mountain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sukkah</i> 52a.</i> Then the strength (might, power) of the Tzaddikim will be obviously apparent to all, that they conquered this great mountain. Possibly, in the future, everyone will call the Tzaddikim by the name El, as is alluded to in the verse: “As in the time when they will say to Jacob and Israel, What has El done?” (Numbers 23:23). For it is known that “Israel” is a name for the Tzaddik, and thus the verse says: As in the time when they will say to Israel – who is the Tzaddik – what has El done? This is like one person asking another: “How are you? What do you do?” So they will say to the Tzaddik: “What do you do, you who are El?”<br>And this is the continuation of the verse: ““Great is G-d, and highly to be praised…” – that is, we must exalt and praise Him over all the good that He bestows upon us. For all the greatness and glroy that G-d has from our efforts, is all due to him. “In the city (<i>ir</i>) of our G-d, His holy mountain” (Psalms 48:2). <I>IR</I>, from the word <i>hisORerus</i> of our G-d, for He arouses us, and gives us the ability to serve Him and to overcome our evil inclination. As our Rabbis have said: “If the Holy One did not help a person, …”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid.</i> 52b.</i> Nevertheless, G-d takes pleasure and pride in this, and rewards a person as though he did it all himself. However, really, the true work should have been because or our own arousal, for we are a portion of G-d above. This is b’<i>, meaning with the arousal of the goood inclination, the portion of G-d within us. This is, b’Ir</i>, meaning, with the arousal of the good inclination, the portion of G-d within us.

<b>And God said to Abram, “Go out from your land, from your birthplace, and from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you.”</b> (Genesis 12:1)<br>“I will make your nature known in the world” (Rashi).<br>I heard from my Master in the name of Rav Sa’adiah Gaon, that a person is created solely to break his negative, inborn character traits. Through this, he raises up the level called “your nature” [i.e. what is natural for you] “in the world” - [i.e. into the world] Above.” It is called “world” (<i>olam</i>) from the word “hidden” (<i>he’elam</i>) and “concealed.”<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, p. 3b

Comment 4

For instance, if the heat of his liver makes him hot-tempered,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Anger was thought to be a result of too much heat in the liver.</i> he should break his inclination and anger as much as possible. Likewise, if an over-excitable nature causes him to spill seed, G‑d forbid, he should break this [characteristic]. And there is no virtue in being depressed by nature, to bemoan and complain even when serving G‑d. And if a person’s is a hedonist and reveler by nature, he should break his trait and do the opposite.<br>This is what the Sages said: “One who is born on a Tuesday will be wealthy and adulterous (<i>atir v’zanai</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat 156a</i> The problem is that these are opposite traits. If he is adulterous, it is more likely that he will be poor, as it is written: “On account of a harlot, a man is brought to a loaf of bread…” (Proverbs 6:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sotah</i> 4b: “Rava said, ‘Whoever has relations with a harlot will end up begging for a loaf of bread.’”</i> “He with big pumpkins and she with small ones.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Megilah 12a/b. The verse from the Scroll of Esther states: “On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded . . . to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look upon (Esther 1:10-11). The gemara comments that just as King Achashverus had licentious intent, so was Queen Vashti willing to appear for the same reason. “He with big pumpkins and she with small ones” – i.e. both their intentions were for evil. However, it is not clear how this proves the Baal Shem Tov’s point that promiscuity leads to poverty.</i><br>Rather, this must refer to a person who by nature is adulterous, but who breaks his nature and becomes a <i>zanai</i> – one who sells different types of foodstuff (<i>mazon</i>), as Rashi says about Rachav: “A woman of <i>zonah</i>” (Joshua 2:1) – that she sold different types of <i>mazon</i>.

…and in you will be blessed all the families of the earth</b> (Genesis 12:3)
When there are a number of wicked people in a city or in a country who act deceitfully, and there is one Tzaddik among them who acts truthfully, when he studies Torah, prays and attaches himself to truth, “all the workers of iniquity and liars will be dispersed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">From Psalms 92:10.

And Abram took Sarai his wife, his nephew Lot, and all their belongings, as well as the souls that they made in Haran; and they left to go into the land of Canaan…</b> (Ibid. 12:5)<br>When a person is in a state of small-mindedness (<i>mohin d’katnus</i>), he gives birth to the souls of converts.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This idea, found throughout the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, is based upon the principle of root and branch souls. When a root soul falls to a lower level, it is in order to raise up the “branch” souls that are connected to him, who themselves are on a low level. Although converts may have very high souls – according to the Talmud, they observe the mitzvos with more exactitude than born Jews – before their conversion, their souls are locked in a Gentile body. A similar teaching can be found in the writings of the Baal Shem Tov concerning <i>ba’alei teshuva</i> – returnees to Judaism. Their ability to repent comes from the influence of a Tzaddik who has fallen to a lower level and raised himself again. See <i>Kedushas Levi</i>, by R. Levi Yitzchok of Berditchov, on the verse: “Your ointments have a goodly fragrance” (Song of Songs 1:3): “It is necessary to understand why G-d created a situation in which a Tzaddik falls from his level. It would certainly be better for him to remain constantly on his level and serve G-d with an expanded consciousness and to love Him perfectly. The Baal Shem Tov and my Master, Rabbi Dov Baer (the Maggid of Mezritch) explained it as follows. When the Tzaddik falls from his level and endeavors to regain his strength, he creates the souls of converts. This is like someone who wants to take his friend out of the mud. He also has to go down into the muck to raise him up.”</i> This is the meaning of: “the souls that they made in Haran,” which is the three aspects of Elokim in Smallness,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See R. Yitzchok Luria, <i>Etz Chayim, Sha’ar HaKelalim</i>, chapter 13.</i> having the numerical value of the word Haran.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">G-d’s Name “Elokim” has the numerical value of 86. When multiplied by three, gives the number 258, which is the numerical value of the word “Haran.” The implication is that when Abraham and Sarah were in the land of Haran – in a state of small-mindedness – they gave birth to the souls of converts: “the souls that they had made in Haran.”</i><br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, Vayera, p. 5.

<b>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?

Comment 9

<b>And Abraham went up out of Egypt.</b> (Genesis 13:1)<br>I heard a parable from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov):<br>A road passed through a forest wherein a den of thieves lurked. Anyone traveling on the road was in great danger. Once, two men went through the forest together. One was completely drunk and the other sober. The thieves attacked them both, robbed them and beat them. They barely escaped with their lives. Afterward, they encountered a group of travelers. Some of the travelers asked the drunk if he had passed through the woods safely. He replied that he had, and that it was not dangerous at all. But when they asked him to explain his wounds and bruises, he could not. Others asked the sober man, and he told them at length just how they must be careful of the robbers. There is a difference between these two individuals. The sober one could warn others as to how to pass through quickly, with guns, etc., but drunk could not warn them at all.

This is how a tzaddik serves G‑d. He knows the battle with the evil inclination, and the robbers that lurk on the way. He realizes that the path is dangerous, and he lives in constant concern as to how to escape its trap. And he knows how to warn others of this dangerous thief, for “He that increases knowledge, increasing suffering” (Ecclesiastes I:18). This is not the case of a wicked person, who rejoices in the pleasures of the evil inclination, and declares “Peace! There is no danger in this world.”<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 203c

Comment 10

A human being is called a “riser and faller,” for it is impossible to stand always on one level. However, there are two types of people. There are those who “go down and come up,”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “who enter and exit.” Based upon the Zohar, 292a: “Fortunate is the lot of him who enters and exits… For one who does not enter and exit who have been better not to have been born.”</i> as it says of Abraham: “And Abraham went up from Egypt.” He descended and rose up with all the lowest levels. The second type, however, descends but does not arise, G‑d forbid.<br>This is like the parable I heard from my Teacher, of the two men who passed through a dangerous area. One was drunk and besotted, and the other was alert. The latter felt the blows of the thieves, and was able to warn others of how to be cautious on the way. <i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 41a

<b>And it came to pass, as they approached Egypt, that [Abraham] said to his wife Sarai: Behold, please (<i>na</i>), I realize now that you are a good-looking woman.

They will then be good to me for your sake, and enliven my soul through your efforts.</b> (Genesis 12:11).<br>The word <i>na</i> (נא) represents the descent of Malchus fifty levels<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew letter <i>nun</i> has the numerical value of fifty, and represents the lowest level of the sefirotic structure. If the sefirah of <i>Binah </i>is counted as one, and each of the seven lower <i>Sefiros</i> are comprised of seven (such as <i>Chesed </i>within <i>Chesed</i>, <i>Netzach</i> within <i>Yesod</i>), then <i>Malchus</i> in <i>Malchus</i>, is the fiftieth level down.

This implies the supernal Source of vitality.</i> from the life-force, which is the letter <i>aleph</i>. It yearns to return and draw close to the <i>aleph</i> again.<br>Now, before Divine retribution strikes, a person will have evil and foreign thoughts, such as licentiousness or idolatry.

Then he will feel fear and trembling, and “all the workers of iniquity will be disbanded.” A unification will occur between “fear” and “awesome” (<i>yirah v’norah</i>), and the person will be delivered from death.<br>This explains the verse: “<b>Behold, please, I realize now that you are a good-looking woman….</b>” That is, because he [suddenly] had illicit thoughts, he feared that “<b>they will kill me</b>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. that he was deserving of death from heaven.</i> “<b>Say, please, that you are my sister</b>” – which the Zohar connects to the verse: “‘Say to wisdom, you are my sister’ (Proverbs 7:4), based upon the extra word “you.” Meaning to say, a person must share in the Shechinah’s pain, which is called “<b>my sister</b>.” Through this: “<b>they will enliven my soul through your efforts.</b>”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">His soul will be saved from death.</i>

Comment 12

<b>And it came to pass, as they approached Egypt, that [Abraham] said to his wife Sarai: Behold, please (<i>na</i>), I realize now that you are a good-looking woman.</b><br>Is it possible that he never saw her before? Rather, Abraham was a “chariot” for the Divine, and his thoughts were constantly bound to the Root of Thought. He never saw her physical beauty before, for he was very distant from it. Though he saw her all the time, his thoughts never connected to physical vision. Thus, he did not recognize [her beauty] until now. Only when he went to Egypt does it say: “And Abram <i>descended</i> to Egypt” – he descended from his prior level. For the wicked people in the time of the Great Flood cast the aspect of Torah and thought down into the impure shell of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The scattering of holy sparks that occurred in the Breaking of the Vessels before creation can either be redeemed, or further scattered, depending upon the actions of each generation. The sins of the generation preceding the Great Flood cast down many holy sparks into the degenerate nation of Egypt. This is the kabbalistic reason for the exile of the Jewish people there – to redeem the fallen sparks. Likewise, Abraham, several generations earlier, also went to Egypt to achieve this.</i> Thus, Israel had to descend there to collect the sparks and unite them as before. For the Egyptians were filled with lust, whose root is the World of Love,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. from the nature of the “impure shell” (<i>kelipah</i>) that conceals the spark, the essence of the spark can be discerned. In physical desire is a spark of love of G‑d. In mortal fear is a spark of the fear and awe of the Divine.</i> and it fell to Egypt from the Torah, which is the aspect of love (<i>chesed</i>), as it is written: “And the Torah of love is upon her tongue” (Proverbs 31:26).<br>Israel, however, did not descend into lust, as the verses testify: “<i>HaReubeni</i>, <i>HaShimoni</i> – the letter <i>hey</i> on one side, the letter <i>yud</i> on the other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Shir HaShirim</i> 4:24, on Numbers 26. When the verses list all the different tribes, <i>HaReubeni</i> – the tribe of Reuben; <i>HaShimoni</i> – the tribe of Shimon, with the prefix <i>hey</i> and the suffix <i>yud</i>. The letters <i>yud</i> and <i>hey</i> spell out G‑d’s Name. G‑d was testifying that even in Egypt, they did not fall into licentiousness and lose their connection with Him; thus, they were able to uplift the fallen sparks of Divine love.</i> And thus, they were able to raise the fallen love to its root, and to the Torah, that is called “love.” And this reason, they could receive the Torah immediately, in the third month [after the exodus], because they had redeemed the aspect of the Torah that had been in exile.<br>However, in the time of Abraham, the redemption of the sparks had not been completed. Therefore, when Abram went to Egypt and descended from his level, he started to have thoughts that reflected the Breakage, as it says: “For a tzaddik falls seven times, and rises again…” (Proverbs 24:16). Meaning, a tzaddik falls in the aspect of seven, which are the seven types of thoughts that fell from their source.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Corresponding to the seven supernal attributes, or sefirot, from <i>Chesed</i> to <i>Malchus</i>.</i> But because he is a tzaddik, he rises and unites the thoughts with their root in the Source of Thought, which is called <i>Chochmah </i>(Wisdom), the aspect of “My sister.” Thus, his service is considered even higher.<br>Therefore, Abraham said: “<b>Behold, please, I realize now</b>” that I have fallen from my level, so much so that I realize “<b>that you are a good-looking woman,</b>” which I did not see before. And he her taught how one escapes from this – from Egypt – by saying that “<b>you are my sister.</b>” Meaning, by clinging to the aspect of “My sister,” which is the supernal Wisdom. Then the thought that is in Egypt, that came not to disrupt him, but to be elevated to its source, to serve G‑d [will be redeemed]. And this is “<b>They will… enliven my soul through your efforts.</b>”<br><i>Me’or Einayim</i>, <i>Lech Lecha</i>

“The steps of a man are arranged by G‑d, who delights in his way. Though he falls, he shall not be cast down” (Psalms 37:23-24).<br>A person must do everything possible to perfect himself. He must examine his personality traits and his opinions to see if he is flawed in any way. Thus, the verse says: “Seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms 34:15). That is, look into yourself to see if you have flaws, and seek to perfect yourself in that area.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The root of the Hebrew word for peace, <i>SHaLoM</i>, is the same as that for the word perfection, <i>SHeLeiMot</i>.</i> However, this only applies to a person who can perfect himself, if he cannot, he should “pursue it” – perhaps he will find a wise man who can help him fix himself.<br>At times, a person can perfect himself where he lives, in his town, without needing to travel afar, for no parts of him have fallen there.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">According to the writings of the Arizal, when G‑d created the world, due to a flaw in creation, sparks of holiness were dispersed throughout the world. It was the job of Adam to reunite these sparks with their source. When Adam sinned, he cause even more sparks to be scattered, and the job of collecting them fell to all of humanity, and ultimately, to the Jewish people. This explains the reason for the many exiles the Jews have suffered – their purpose was to regain the lost sparks of holiness. The Baal Shem Tov implies here that this process occurs on the individual level as well as the cosmic; that is, each soul, on descending into this world, also experiences a dispersal of essential sparks, which must be regained in the course of ones life, and integrated into the service of G‑d. This is the true path of self-perfection.</i> At other times, parts of his life-force have fallen to other places, and he should have to travel to redeem them; however, if he is great in Torah, he can extract them all from where he is, because Torah study is equal to everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnayos Pe’ah 1:1. The mishnah lists various mitzvos for which a person receives reward in this world and in the next, such as respecting one’s parents, welcoming guests, visiting the sick, and concludes that the study of Torah is equal to them all. By quoting this mishna, the Baal Shem Tov implies that all these good deeds serve the purpose of redeeming lost sparks. However, the act of Torah study, which “restores the soul,” can accomplish the same effect, without the physical exertion. See later, <i>parashas VaYetze </i>9, and <i>parashas Ki Tavo </i>1, for more on this idea.</i> Thus it says: “The Torah of G‑d is perfect, it restores the soul” (Psalms 19:8), that is, by means of the Torah a person studies, he can restore the lost fragments of his soul. It also says: “One who studies Torah selflessly, merits many things.”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 6:1.</i> That is, he merits extracting the life-force from all places, because all these places themselves were created from the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash states that G‑d looked in the Torah and created the world, and that He used to Torah as a blueprint of reality (<i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>1:2). Since all reality is based upon the Torah, a person who learns Torah can extract the sparks of soul that are scattered in all places of the world.</i><br>However, it is rare to find a person who can do this. This was the quality of Jacob, who could extract the life-force scattered in all places by means of his Torah study. Thus, he was “a simple man, who dwelt in tents.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The verse uses the plural. Rashi explains that this means the study halls of the prophets Shem and Ever.</i> Though he studied Torah in his one tent, where he lived, it was as if he dwelt in many places and many tents.<br>Others, however, must travel to various places in order to repair their life-force. Sometimes a person wishes to travel to one destination, yet ends up arriving somewhere else. This is no accident, for he must repair his life-force that has fallen there. At times, it may be enough to merely eat or drink in that place, in order to perfect himself.<br><i>Ohr HaChochmah, Vayerah</i>

“Guest” – <i>Oreach </i>(<i>אורח</i>) is <i>Or Chet</i> – the Light of Eight (אור ח').

<b>For I have known him, to the end that he will command his children and his household after him, that they may keep G‑d’s way, doing charity and justice. G‑d will bring about for Abraham everything He promised.’</b> (Genesis 18:19)<br>The Baal Shem Tov refuted the question of the heretics, who asked how a person can serve G‑d in the “days of understanding,” as the Sages said: “At forty, to wisdom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos </i>5:21: “…at twenty to pursuit, thirty to strength, forty to wisdom…”</i> For if he served G‑d until then, he will have to keep serving G‑d that way: “Since most of his years have passed and he has not sinned, he is guaranteed not to sin henceforth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 38b.</i> But in that case, he does not deserve reward or punishment for his acts; yet a person was created to receive reward or punishment, as is known. And if he has not served G‑d until now, we have learned: “From a bad person, no good comes out,”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 129a.</i> and there is no point in admonishing him further.<br>The Baal Shem Tov replied with a parable. A son once asked his aging father for advice on choosing an profession. His father answered him: “Listen to me. Don’t take up my occupation, which I worked so hard at. I am a slave to it day and night, so that my strength has left me, and my eyes have become dim. Choose something better. And don’t ask me why I am still working at this job, for I am already lost. I have been stuck in this job since my youth, and I cannot leave it in my old age.”<br>This person’s words reveal that he hates his job. And the proof is that he prohibits someone he loves from entering it. This is not the case of someone who dearly loves his job. He would tell his children and grandchildren what to do even before they ask him: “Do not let the work seem onerous to you. Get up and grab hold of it! For it is more precious than pearls, gold and rare coins. Don’t exchange for ten times the price, for you are wise and intelligent people.”<br>This is the meaning of the verse: “For I have known him, to the end that he will command his children and his household after him – before [they ask] – that they may keep G‑d’s way.” Meaning, G‑d considers a good thought like a deed. Since this person’s service of G‑d is so precious to him that he commands his children and his household, he deserves reward for servicing G‑d even on the levels he attained after reaching middle-age, since it is not his fault that he did not reach these levels earlier.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, since he was busy serving G‑d his whole life, he could not have reached the spiritual levels he attained after forty at any time earlier. Yet, because of the person’s great love of his work, G‑d rewards him for his later efforts as if he had done them earlier.</i><br><i>Teshuos Chen, Likutim; Sifsei Tzaddikim, Lech Lecha</i>

<b>And G‑d remembered Sarah as He had said, and G‑d did what he had promised for Sarah. And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which G‑d had spoken to him.</b> (ibid. 21:1-2)<br>Whoever prays for mercy on behalf of his friend, and he needs the same thing, will be answered first. (<i>Bava Kama</i> 92a)<br>It is known what the Sages said on the verse: “‘Ruler over men shall be the Tzaddik; he that rules with the fear of G‑d” (II Samuel 23:2) – “Who rules over Me? The Tzaddik; for the Holy One decrees and the Tzaddik annuls its.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mo’ed Katan</i> 16b. The full verse from Samuel reads: “The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘Ruler over men shall be the righteous; he that rules with the fear of God.’” However, by changing the punctuation, the Sages derive a different reading of this verse: “The Rock of Israel is ruler over men, the righteous rules over G‑d.’”</i> How does he annul the G‑d’s decree? The answer is as follows.<br>All evil and suffering are Judgments, and Judgments are only sweetened in their root, as the Zohar says: “From the side of Binah, the Judgments issue forth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 2:175b. See, also, Zohar 3:65a.</i> The Tzaddik raises all the Judgments to Binah, where they are sweetened in their root.<br>According to this, we can understand why a Tzaddik is unable to do this for himself. That is, when he himself suffers, he is unable to raise the Judgments to Binah. And although our Rabbis have stated: “A prisoner cannot release himself from jail,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 5b.</i> we still need to understand why.<br>The reason is that he can only achieve this through <i>Da’at</i> (“Knowledge”), and what can he do when they take the <i>Da’at</i> and the <i>Mohin</i> away from him?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In Chasidism, <i>Da’at</i> refers to a state of mystical attachment to G‑d. <i>Mohin</i> (literally “Minds”) refers to a state of expanded consciousness – <i>mohin d’gadlus</i> – that accompanies <i>Da’at</i>. When a Tzaddik is in such a state, he can annul all states of narrowness and constriction – whether physical or mental. These are the roots of suffering. He annuls the Judgments (<i>Dinim</i>) by lifting them to their root. There, they are annulled in the light of the Infinite. However, when he himself has fallen into a state of constricted consciousness, he is unable to free himself.</i> Therefore, he can’t help himself at all. For this reason, it is a great mitzvah for others to pray for him and uplift the Judgments.<br>Now, to understand how the Judgments are sweetened in their root, and the meaning of “From the side of Binah, the Judgments issue forth,” we must know that there are fifty gates of Binah. Forty-nine gates are called “her side.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the side of Binah.</i> From there, the Judgments issue forth. However, the fiftieth gate is called <i>Ayin</i> – Nothingness,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the Sefirah of Keter, which reveals the infinite “Nothingness” of the G‑dhead – beyond all limitation and perception.</i> where there is complete mercy, with no Judgments at all. Therefore, when the Judgments are raised to the Gate of Nothingness, they are rectified. This is as the Baal Shem Tov said, that a thing that lacks expanse cannot break.
Therefore, the Baal Shem Tov explained the statement of the Rabbis: “One who prays on his friends behalf is answered first.” Why is he answered first? Because he must uplift the Gevuros and the Judgments to their roots, and he is there (i.e. in the fiftieth gate) first. Afterward, he draws down [illumination] upon the sick person as well. Thus, he is answered first.<br><i>Me’or Einayim</i>, <i>Naso</i>

<b>And it was, after these things, that G‑d (Elokim) tested Abraham.</b> (Ibid. 22:1)<br>When a person undergoes a trial, he is in the aspect of lack of consciousness (loses his awareness).

And it happened after these things, that G-d tested Abraham</b><br>I will give thanks to G-d with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvellous works. (Psalms 9:2)<br>There are questions to be raised on this verse. It is fine what it says: “I will give thanks to G-d with my whole heart,” however, the end of the verse, “I will tell of all Your marvellous works” is difficult. For it states: “Who can express the mighty acts of G-d, or make heard all of His praise?” (ibid. 106:2). For how is it possible to make heard all of His praise?
Perhaps it can be explained according to the Zohar’s statement: “‘G-d tested Abraham’ – it is not written ‘G-d tested <i>l’Avraham</i>, but <i>es Avraham</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 1:119b. The verse could have been written with the prefix <i>lamed</i>, and read: “G-d [gave a] test <i>to</i> Abraham.” However, it was written with the definitive particle <i>es</i> (את)</i> This can be understood with the well-known principle that the trait of Abraham was love (<i>chesed</i>), as it is written: “Give… love to Abraham…” (Micah 7:20). And our Rabbis have said that there are angels that only sing praises to G-d once in seven years. Others sing once in fifty years. And they say it very briefly.

And Abraham said: 'G-d will provide Himself with the lamb to be an offering, my son.' So the two of them went on together.</b> (Ibid. 22:6-8)<br>Why did Isaac ask about the fire and the wood? And why did Abraham answer him: “G-d will provide Himself with the lamb to be an offering (<i>l’olah</i>), my son”? He should have said “for an offering, my son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The verse could have been written: אֱלֹה-ים יִרְאֶה לּוֹ הַשֶּׂה עֹלָה בְּנִי– “<i>Hashem yireh lo ha’she olah, bnei</i>.”</i> This can be explained by an episode in the Gemara,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachi</i><i>m </i>66a.</i> that in the days of Bnei Besirah, they forgot the law if the Pesach sacrifice can be performed on Shabbos or not.

Hillel also forgot the law. “Leave them alone,” Hillel said. “If Israel are not prophets, then they are the children of prophets.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. they will know what to do by themselves.</i> On the eve of Passover, each one came with his offering.

Then the question arose as to whether the people were making desecrating their offerings by using them in a profane way. Hillel explained that the people did not designate their animals as sacrificial offerings until they reached the Temple grounds, and could remove the knives.<br>This was what Isaac had in mind. For at first, it states that Abraham took the fire, etc., split the wood for the offering and put it on Isaac.

<b>And Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and G-d had blessed Abraham with everything</b>. (Genesis 24:1)<br>Based upon what I heard from my grandfather on the verse: “It came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods…” (I Kings 11:4), we see here that [when Abraham was old] “G-d had blessed Abraham with everything.”<br>“Everything” – <i>bakol</i> – has the numerical value of <i>ben</i> – “son.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The words בכל and בן both have the numerical value of 52.</i> The wise will understand this.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The verse says “For the ways of the L-rd are right; the just walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them” (Hosea 14:10). The Torah is comprised of two aspects – spirit and matter, revelation and concealment, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. Thus, the Talmud states: “If a person is unworthy, the Torah becomes a potion of death for him; if he is worthy, it is a potion of life” (<i>Yoma</i> 72b). These two aspects also correspond to the spiritual paradigms of Giver and Receiver, or Lights and Vessels, and Kabbalistically, are represented by the Masculine and Feminine dimensions of creation. Only when they are united can harmony reign in the universe. Even then, however, the influence must be from above to below – from giver to receiver, spirit to matter. When the aspect of receiver dominates, then the vessel can be too strong, and the light can be concealed. This model applies to every word of the Torah, and is the meaning of the verse: “his wives turned away his heart.” Abraham, however, merited “everything” – i.e. a son. He learned Torah from the side of light and revelation.<br>Along these lines, the <i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i> (<i>parashas Masai</i>) writes: “I heard from my grandfather, in the name of the <i>sefer Bris Menucha</i>, that if you see a Torah scholar who has incorrect opinions and acts improperly, he certainly has drunk from the ‘bitter waters.’” Thus, the Rabbis taught in <i>Pirkei Avos</i> (1:11): “Sages, be careful with your words, lest you incur the penalty of exile, and be banished to a place of evil waters, and the disciples who follow you there will drink and die (spiritually) and consequently, the Name of Heaven will be desecrated.”</i><br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, <i>Chayeh Sarah</i>

<b>These are the generations of Isaac, the son of Abraham. Abraham gave birth to Isaac.</b> (Genesis 25:19)<br>This verse contains a question and its answer. The question is, how did Isaac, who represents the forces of limitation, come from Abraham, who is the aspect of loving-kindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">According to Kabbalah, the seven lower sefirot, from Chesed to Malchus, correspond to seven central Biblical figures. Abraham corresponds to Chesed, which represents the forces of love and expansion.

Because when one person lacks something and another person gives it to him, the world becomes founded on loving-kindness, as the verse says: “You have built a world of love” (Psalms 89:3).

<b>Because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge: My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.</b> (26:5)<br>Rashi explains that Abraham observed the commandments of both the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. How is this possible?<br>Our Sages have said that in the future, the commandments will be annulled.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Nidah 61b.</i> I heard from my grandfather [the Baal Shem Tov], in his name or in the name of the Ramban, that in the future, human beings will experience the spiritual vitality that lies within each mitzvah, and how it is the very life-force of the soul and of all the worlds. This is the meaning of the verse: “If My covenant is not upheld day and night, then the laws of heaven and earth I have not established” (Jeremiah 33:25). “My covenant” refers to the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov understands this verse as saying that the vitality of the creation is derived from the Torah, and that only by upholding the latter, can the former continue to exist.</i> Abraham apprehended the entire Torah by himself, not as a commandment – because the Torah had not yet been given – rather, he understood how the life-force of each mitzvah is the very vitality of the soul, and he knew that he needed to fulfill them in order to cling to the Life of all lives. Of the future world, the verse says: “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of G‑d, as the sea is covered with water” (Isaiah 11:9). 
This is also the meaning of the verse: “Your eyes will behold your teacher” (ibid. 30:20). For then, everything will be revealed – the source of the commandments and all their inner secrets, how they illuminate and enliven human beings and all the worlds, and how it is impossible to reach human perfection without them.<br>Then, everyone will apprehend the path of life, as did our father, Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Returning to the opening statement of the Sages, that the commandments will be annulled in the future, we can now understand the Baal Shem Tov’s insight. It is not that the commandments will no longer be <i>observed</i> in the world-to-come, but that the element of <i>commandment</i> will be removed from them. Since their inner light and the connection they forge between G‑d and the soul will be revealed, human beings will be drawn to perform them naturally, without external decree.</i><br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Tzav</i>

<b>Now all the wells that his father’s servants had dug while Abraham was still alive, the Philistines had sealed them up, and filled them with earth.</b> (Genesis 26:15)<br>This is the mystery of all the wells that the Forefathers dug in order to find water – meaning, Torah – in the “earth” – i.e. on the lowest level.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Water is a common metaphor for Torah, as in the verse: “Ho, every one that thirsts, come you for water…” (Isaiah 55:1). Earth is considered the lowest of the four elements of fire, air, water and earth.</i> For each of them, by perfecting his character traits, brought forth a revelation of Torah – “a well of living water” (ibid. 26:19) – from the earth and the lowest levels, so that it not be covered over again.<br>However, after Abraham died, these revelations were sealed up by the “earth” that covered the “water.” This was due to the Philistines – the impure shells that reasserted themselves. But Isaac came and redug the wells, as it is written: He redug the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham” (ibid. 26:18). This too refers to the revelation of Torah by Abraham and Isaac. And even today, Torah lies hidden in those very deeds of Abraham and Isaac.<br>And all of this was to repair the future generations, for were it not for the Forefathers, it would be impossible to have any understanding of Torah, and to draw close to G‑d at all.<br><i>Me’or Einayim</i>, <i>Vayetze</i>

<b>He then moved away from there and dug another well, and this time it was not disputed, so he named it Rechovos (“Expansiveness”), and he said: “Now G‑d has broadened us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”</b> (ibid. 26:22)<br>Inner fear [of G‑d] is called “Rechovos,” for there is no fear of the <i>kelipot</i> there, so that one must limit oneself because of them – through suffering, small-mindedness and [self]-afflictions – to prevent them from leeching on to holiness. Rather, “Now G‑d has broadened us” – with the inner essence of fear that is called Rechovos. Then “we shall be fruitful in the land” – we will give forth fruits, to turn the multitude from sin, to be a Rabbi and a Rebbe, to uplift and create souls.

Comment 7

It is known that the Forefathers corresponded to the sefirot of Chesed, Gevurah and Tiferet. Abraham embodied the quality of Chesed – loving-kindness. He loved and showed generosity to the entire creation, and tried to instill in them faith in G‑d, and a de.sire to serve Him; because the trait of Chesed corresponds to love. Through Abraham’s great dedication to this trait, he came to recognize and comprehend the Creator, and realize that G‑d runs the entire world.<br>Isaac learned and received this approach from Abraham; however, he still wanted to come to his own understanding of G‑d. This is as the verse says: “<i>Know</i> the G‑d of your fathers, and serve Him” (I Chronicles 28:9). One should not merely accept this service as a tradition, to be fulfilled by rote.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">That is, each person must come to his own knowledge of G‑d. In Chasidus, the word <i>da'at</i>, “knowledge,” also has the connotation of mystical union. The use of the word <i>da'at</i> for union can be first found in Genesis 4:1: “And Adam <i>knew</i> Eve, his wife.” And concerning the days of the Messiah, the verse says: “The earth will be filled with the knowledge of G‑d, as the sea is covered with water” (Isaiah 11:9), referring to a direct, mystical knowledge of G‑d that all humanity will then experience.</i> Therefore, Isaac devoted himself to the trait of piety.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Literally “fear,” that corresponds to the sefirah of Gevurah.</i> And out of his great care [to fulfill the will of G‑d], he came to know and comprehend G‑d for himself, besides what he received from his father.<br>Now, Jacob realized that there must be a middle way in the operation of the world, that mediated between Chesed and Gevurah, because the world could not survive if it can only function according to one of these two extremes. Therefore, he devoted himself to the trait of Tiferet.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Tiferet means “beauty” or “splendor,” and is positioned below and between the sefirot of Chesed and Gevurah. It includes them both, and mediates between them.</i> Through this, he arrived at a deeper perception of G‑d than his fathers, and is called the “Chosen of the Forefathers.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesikta Rabotai, Vayishlach</i> 76.</i> He saw that the world could not exist in unmitigated judgment, and so tempered it with the trait of Compassion.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Judgment, <i>Din</i>, is associated with the sefirah of Gevurah, because it has the implication of restriction and uncompromising demands. Compassion is considered an admixture of Chesed-love, and Gevurah-judgment. Because, whereas pure Chesed gives uncompromisingly, and pure Gevurah withholds absolutely, Compassion gives in accordance with the needs of the receiver, neither totally overwhelming, nor denying. The Baal Shem Tov is also alluding to the midrash that states that G‑d first sought to create the world with the attribute of Judgment. When He saw that it could not stand, he added the attribute of Compassion. Likewise, Jacob saw that the world could not serve G‑d following the extreme patterns of Abraham and Isaac, and so combined them in the trait of compassion, which enables all creatures to find a place in the worship of G‑d.</i><br><i>Likutey Yakarim</i>, p. 9b

Elsewhere, I wrote an explanation of the Talmud’s statement:<br>“A place finds favor in the eyes of those who live there.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sota</i><i>h</i> 47a.</i><br>And on tractate <i>Berachos</i>:<br>“Rabbi Yossi ben Chanina said: ‘What is the meaning of, “[Where is G‑d, that brought us up out of the land of Egypt; that led us] . . . through a land that no one passed through, and where no man (<i>adam</i>) settled?’ (Jeremiah 2:6). Since no one passed through, obviously no man could have settled there. Rather, it teaches us that any land that Adam decreed for settlement became settled, and every land that he did not decree for settlement, was not settled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 31a.</i>
We can understand this by means of the Arizal,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pri Etz Chaim</i>, p. 12; p. 45.</i> who taught that Adam’s sin cast all the sparks of the holy souls among the impure shells, causing good and evil became intermingled. These [sparks] must be sifted out through Torah study, serving G‑d, and performing mitzvos – all with G‑d’s help, which is the Divine Presence among us. This is the mystery of “Give strength to G‑d” (Psalms 68:35), for when the sparks are sifted out, they ascend as “feminine waters.” Thus, Israel was exiled among all the seventy nations, to the place of the sparks, and each individual Jew must go into exile to the place of the sparks of his own soul, to extract and rectify them.<br>The exception is Egypt, of which it states: “you shall never see them again” (Exodus 14:13). This is because: “they despoiled the Egyptians” (ibid. 13:36) – “like a trap empty of fish.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 9b.</i> Not one holy spark was left there,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, they do not need to go back to Egypt.</i> though the Shechinah had been in complete exile there. They removed from there all the portions of goodness that had been intermingled with the evil and the impure shells.<br>This happened through the intervention of <i>da’at</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Da’at – knowledge – usually implies a mystical or intuitive knowledge of G‑d.</i> and thought, as it states: “It is sorted out in thought.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar 2:20b.</i> For Moses is the “<i>da’at</i>” of holiness, which is “good,” as it is written: “And she saw that he was good” (Exodus 2:2). About this, the Sages said:<br>“‘And another prophet like Moses did not arise in Israel…’ (Deuteronomy 34:10) – in Israel, he did not arise, but among the nations he did arise. And who was he? Balaam!”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifri</i>, <i>Zos HaBracha</i> §15.</i><br>Moses and Balaam were both in the mystery of <i>da’at</i>, but one was from the side of holiness, and the other from the side of impurity. First, good and evil were intermingled, as a result of the Adam’s sin, and that of Cain and Abel. Later, it was rectified, so that Moses emerged completely good, and Balaam was separated from him. He was equal to Moses, but in the da’at of the impure shells. Thus, it is written: “He knows the knowledge (da’at) of the Most High” (Numbers 24:16). Moses’ generation, too, was known as the Generation of Knowledge (<i>dor de’ah</i>), and Moses is in every generation in order to perfect it.
Now, it is known that the sparks fell into the <i>kelipat nogah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The “bright shell.” There are four impure shells. Three are completely evil, while the fourth – the <i>kelipat nogah</i> – has aspects that can be redeemed. See <i>Sefer HaTanya</i>, chap. 7.</i> and that “<i>nogah</i>” has the numerical value of the word “grace” (<i>chen</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">58. חן – נגה.</i> This is the meaning of: “A place finds favor in the eyes of those who live there.” Because the sparks from the root of a person’s soul fell into the <i>kelipat nogah</i>, which is called <i>chen</i>. Therefore, the place where he lives finds favor in his eyes, so that he will extract his own sparks from the <i>kelipat nogah</i>.
This was also what Rabbi Yossi ben Chanina meant: “Every land that Adam decreed would be inhabited….” That is, any place that the sparks fell due to Adam’s sin, when good and evil became intermingled, was decreed upon to be inhabited, so that a person whose soul-sparks are there should retrieve them.
Now, let us return to the Baal Shem Tov’s explanation of the verse. A person travels from place to place in order to redeem the sparks of his own root soul. But G‑d folded up the entire Land of Israel under Jacob’s head, so that he wouldn’t have to travel. The entire land was gathered beneath him; he could redeem them right there.
Why did G‑d so this for Jacob, and not the other Forefathers, or other individuals. It could as I heard from Rabbi Nachman [Horodenker], on the first Mishnah of tractate <i>Pe’ah</i>:<br>“These are the things that when a person does them, he eats from their fruits in this world, while their primary reward waits for him in the world to come… making peace between friends or between husband and wife, and the study of Torah is equal to them all.”<br>Just as both peace and disharmony exist in throughout the world, so they exist in each person, following the principle of “space, time, and soul.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> talks about three primary co-ordinates of reality: <i>olam, shana, nefesh</i> – space, time, and soul. Whatever manifests on one level, manifests itself similarly on the other.</i> A person can contain two conflicting individuals within him, but if he wants, he can remove the inner division and draw unity into the world. This is by studying Torah, and inevitably, this affects the physical realm as well. Thus, “the study of Torah is equal to them all.” Even though there is an aspect of peace, by means of the Torah, everything is fixed.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, he means that even though there is an way in which peace can be achieved by acting in the world, it can also be achieved by studying Torah.</i><br>But to my mind, the answer is straightforward. Just as the general population rectifies the world through their actions, so Torah scholars can do this through their Torah study. For actions are created from the Torah. The Torah is the tool of the Holy One, and through it, the world was created. Thus, “the study of Torah is equal to them all.”

But to my mind, the answer is straightforward. Just as the general population rectifies the world through their actions, so Torah scholars can do this through their Torah study. For actions are created from the Torah. The Torah is the tool of the Holy One, and through it, the world was created. Thus, “the study of Torah is equal to them all.”

Now, Jacob was the aspect of the Torah itself, as it is written: “The voice is the voice of Jacob” (Genesis 27:22), and “Give truth to Jacob” (Micah 7:20), for the Torah is called “truth.” Therefore, he could sort out [the sparks] in his place, whereas someone else would have had to travel around, because “the study of Torah is equal to all.” Thus, G‑d folded the entire Land of Israel under Jacob, so that he could extract the sparks through the study of Torah, which corresponds to the entire world. This is the meaning of “<b>and you shall spread out to the west, to the east, to the north and to the south</b>.” That is, while you are still in your place, you will sift out all the sparks from the four corner of the earth, and not need to journey around, for “the study of Torah is equal to all.” And thus, the Talmud states that this was not like Abraham, of whom it was written: “Rise and walk the land, its length and breadth” (Genesis 13:17). He needed to travel from place to place to take them out. But of Jacob it is written: “<b>the land upon which you are lying…</b>” for there the sparks have fallen.<br><i>Ketones Passim</i>, p. 35b-c<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 114a.</i>

Comment 10

Jacob was the aspect of Truth, which is the beginning, middle and end.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The sefirah of Tiferet also corresponds to the trait of Truth. Thus the verse says, “Give truth to Jacob (Tiferet), kindness to Abraham (Chesed)” (Micah 7:20). Truth is called the “beginning, middle and end,” because the Hebrew letters that comprise the word Truth – Emet, are <i>aleph</i>, <i>mem</i>, and <i>tav</i>, the first, middle and last letters of the alphabet. The Baal Shem Tov seems to means that since Jacob corresponds to truth, which embraces the entire alphabet, he can redeem the fallen sparks without effort. This is similar to what the Baal Shem Tov said about the Torah (which also corresponds to Jacob and Truth), that through study alone, one can redeem the sparks in one’s place, without having to travel afar. See the previous footnote, and see fn. 4 in parashas Toldos.</i> This is the meaning of G‑d’s folding up the Land of Israel under him, so that he didn’t have to exert himself at all to separate out the sparks.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Bechukosai</i>

<b>Surely, G‑d is in this place, and I did not know it!</b> (28:16)<br>Meaning, “If I had known it, I would not have slept here.”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi’s comment on this verse.</i> That is, if a person knows how to unite this trait, it would not be called sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a very deep and central teaching of the Baal Shem Tov; that the attribute of <i>da'at</i> – knowledge of G‑d – has the ability to cut through all levels of darkness and confusion immediately. <i>Da'at </i>is the ability to remember G‑d, on whatever level a person is on. According to this teaching, all the. A person only needs to remember that the spiritual darkness he finds himself in is <i>also</i> from G‑d, and that G‑d is as present there as He is in the moments of inspiration, to be immediately catapulted to a level of closeness to G‑d, and the dissipation of the darkness; for distance from G‑d <i>only</i> comes into existence because we fail to remember that it too is from Him. Rabbi Yaakov Yosef writes: “If [Jacob] knew he was in the aspect of small-mindedness and sleep (a synonym for spiritual unconsciousness), he could unite this level <i>also</i> [with G‑d], and it would no longer be called the aspect of sleep.” A famous parable of the Baal Shem Tov illustrates this point:<br>There was once a king who wanted to test the loyalty of his servants in all the distant lands of his reign. He send a fleet of his ships across the ocean, bearing the flags of an enemy nation. When the fleet drew close to each port, it sent a message to the citizens of the town, “You have five days to surrender, or we will destroy you.”<br>In every town there was panic. In some towns, the people prepared for war. “We are loyal citizens of the king, and we will fight for him to the death.” In other towns, they were ready to surrender, “The king is so far from here, he has nothing to do with our lives. Why should we die for him.”<br>However, in one town, the people calmly replied, “This is a test! We love our king. He need not test us!”<br>The challenge of the battleships represents the evil inclination in man, that seeks to seduce him to transgress G‑d’s will. Some people fight it, while others give in. In both cases, a test exists, because the individual forgets that the side of evil is also from G‑d, and merely testing him. As soon as a person realizes that the tests is itself from G‑d, and not something outside of Him, the test itself disappears, and one comes close to G‑d again.</i><br>Katones Passim, p. 35a

<b>And Jacob made a vow, saying “If G‑d will be with me, and will protect me on the journey that I am taking, if He gives me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I return to my father’s house in peace, then Hashem shall be my G‑d.”</b> (ibid. 28:20-21)<br>“In all your ways know Him” (Proverbs 3:6) – whether things are going well or not.

This is the meaning of: “…then Hashem (Y-H-V-H) shall be my G‑d (Elo-him).” Perhaps, [thought Jacob], the name Y-H-V-H, which represents the attribute of compassion, is in fact Elo-him – the attribute of Strict Judgment.

<b>He took along his kinsmen and pursued [Jacob] for seven days, and he overtook him in the Gilead Mountains</b>. (ibid. 31:23)<br>It is known that mystically, Jacob corresponds to Da’at,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Da’at means mystical cognition of G‑d.</i> for the aspects of Jacob and Moses are identical.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Moses also corresponds to the Sefirah of Da’at.

Numerous fundaments of Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. essential, unformulated elements of Torah.</i> were scattered on the lowest levels because Da’at was not revealed in the world. Many of them were concealed in the house of Laban. These were the very words of Torah that are written in the sefer Torah describing Jacob’s deeds while there. These deeds held the potential Torah that Jacob removed and purified from the depth of the <i>kelipot</i> of Laban; for though his <i>kelipot</i> was great, Jacob extracted all of them during the twenty years he was there.
Thus, when Laban pursued Jacob, it was because some Torah still remained hidden within him. This made up the very verses that describe his pursuit and debate with Jacob, until the end of the parasha. The Torah in these verses remained clothed in Laban, for Jacob had not yet removed them. G‑d therefore caused Laban to pursue Jacob, in order to bring him the Torah that had not yet been fully removed. When he overtook Jacob, and spoke the words that are written, Jacob extracted them all, until nothing remained. For everything that happened with Laban, and all the events recorded in the verses, was all Torah and <i>avodas Hashem</i>. [His going there] was all in order to reveal Torah from the aspect of Haran, which is the depths of the impure shells, to cause a revelation of holiness, and include it in the supernal Torah.<br><i>Me’or Einayim, Vayetze</i>

<b>And the messengers returned to Jacob and said, We came to your brother Esau, and he is also coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him. Then Jacob was very afraid and distressed”</b> (Genesis 32:7-8)<br>The verse says: “May only goodness and kindness pursue me all the days of my life” (Psalms 23:6). A person does not always know what is good for him; for who is wise enough to think that they always know what is in their best interest? Sometimes, the goodness even runs after a person. G-d, in His mercy, wants to shine His light, deliverance and success upon him; yet the person has no idea that he would benefit from this thing and be successful, and so he turns around and runs away from what is for his own good.<br>Therefore, with holy inspiration, King David asked on behalf of all Israel, “May only goodness and kindness pursue me.” Even when I don’t have enough insight to accept these things in my life, and, in fact, I run away from them; still, I beg You that they should run after me, until they overtake me, and I welcome them and bring blessing into my life.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This teaching reflects the idea that even apparently negative occurrences are actually for our own good. G-d’s nature is ultimately loving and beneficent, and therefore, even suffering will ultimately be revealed to have been for our benefit. Indeed, Kabbalah teaches that there are many things that can <i>only</i> be repaired through suffering, such as purification from certain sins. In such as case, Divine blessing would only come <i>after</i> the experience of purification. However, the Baal Shem Tov, in his great love for the Jewish people, propounded yet another principle: G-d is all-powerful, and can therefore accomplish the same repair that suffering achieves through loving means. The Baal Shem Tov composed the following prayer that reflects this idea: “I know that even the bad is for my good. However, You are G-d, and not a man, and you can transform the bad to real good, so that even though there won’t be any aspect of bad left, even so, it will be completely for my benefit, so that the necessary repair can come from the good itself.” (See <i>Mishmeret Yitamar, Vayishlach.</i>)<br>This can be understood with a parable taught be the Baal Shem Tov: Once, a simple country villager rebelled against the king. Everyone was sure that he would be caught and sentenced to death. However, the king did something else. As soon as he learnt of the rebellion, he appointed the villager to be mayor of his town. Later, he appointed him to a higher position, and then to an even higher one, until he made him one of the dukes of the land. However, the more he promoted the man, the worse the man felt for having originally rebelled against the king, who showed him so much kindness. This was the king’s intention. For had he punished the man once at first, the man’s pain would not have been as great as that which he felt over a long period of time, in the face of the king’s continual beneficence. Likewise, when a person sins, G-d showers upon him even more grace than before. When the person realizes G-d’s goodness to him, despite his behavior, he is immediately humbled and repents of all that he is doing wrong.

<b>And he touched the hollow of his (Jacob’s) thigh, and his thigh was put out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</b> (32:26)<br>“There are those who toils at Torah, with no one to support them, or put money in their pocket; therefore, the Torah is forgotten in every generation, and the strength of Torah is weakened every day”<br>Zohar, parashas Vayishlach, p. 171a.<br>I heard a parable from my grandfather [the Baal Shem Tov]. When a king wages war, he uses many types of soldiers, such as foot soldiers, and horsemen. According to the rules of war, it is the foot soldiers who enter the heat of the battle. They may even be chained together, so that they cannot disperse and flee, but must stand and fight. The horsemen are also involved in the battle; however, when the fighting becomes too dangerous, they escape, and do not risk their lives. The foot soldiers, however, risk their lives for the honor of the king.<br>Yet, when they win the war, with G-d’s help, it is the horsemen who return and carry off all of the spoils, as much as their horses can bear. Whereas the foot soldiers do not take more than a little bread and water to keep themselves alive for another day. They cannot carry heavy booty, and are satisfied just to sustain their lives. They trust that in the time of peace, the horsemen will give them whatever they need, for they certainly deserve the larger portion of the spoils. Furthermore, all of them are serving the same king, and it was they who risked their lives to win the war, for the sake of his honor. However, when that time comes, the horsemen do not agree, and do not want to share their bounty – not even a single meal, for they claim that the victory was on account of them.
What does this parable mean? The foot soldiers are spiritual people,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “men of form,” <i>anshei tzurah</i>, as opposed to “men of substance,” <i>anshei chomer.</i> The Baal Shem Tov uses the classic distinction between “form” and “substance,” the spiritual and the material, to describe the two types of people. Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye writes that there is an inherent conflict between the physical and the spiritual. Whereas the spiritual is drawn to high ideals and seeks to unite with its G-dly source, the physical is drawn after material desires and lower cravings. The test in life is not to abandon the physical, but to uplift it so that it too can serve G-d. This is done when the physical is used in the service of the soul, such as in the performance of the commandments, giving charity, and other good deeds. And just as this applies to each individual, so does it apply to human beings as a whole: there are those who are involved in spiritual pursuits, and those who follow after material gain. When the latter lend financial support to the former, then together, they form one body whose direction in life is transcendence and G-dliness. Not only that, but since all material wealth descends from the spiritual realm, both will be blessed materially as well. However, when “men of substance” do not support the “men of form,” then both of them can fall away from the spiritual realm. According to the Zohar, this is the meaning of the struggle between Jacob and the angel (who was the guardian angel of Esau). Although Jacob, the man of the spirit, subdued him, he still caused Jacob harm by inflicting his legs, which represent the financial supporters of Torah – those who put Torah scholars “on their feet.”</i> who constantly serve G-d, and give their lives for the honor of the king – the King of the world. <i>They</i> win the war, and defeat all the accusing forces that rise against them and try to prevent blessing from reaching this world. It is because of them that material bounty descends into this world. The horsemen are physical people, who ride on large and good horses; that is, their good fate.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, their good constellations.</i> When the war is won, and bounty flows into this world, they grab most of it; whereas the spiritual people make due with just enough for one day, as is the way of the Torah, and all those who trust in G-d. They are satisfied that they won the war, and that the king’s honor will be exalted, and they assume that the physical people will provide for their needs, since the spiritual people are really the more important of the two. However, material people don’t see it that way, and don’t want to give them anything. “All the bounty belongs to us,” they say. Eventually, though, the King will take notice, and will look upon His servants and their actions. Then, in His great goodness, He will certainly reward them with all manner of goodness and prosperity; for He knows the truth, that the victory depended upon them, and that they deserve all the rewards and bounty that descended in the first place.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim,</i>

Comment 12

When a person has a good-heart, studies Torah and prays, all his daily conversations concerning his physical needs (though not idle chatter), become a garment for his holy words. For both are made up of letters, and all the worlds are contingent only on the twenty-two letters of the Torah. The only difference is in the way the letters are arranged. Thus, his holy words outweigh the mundane ones, and transform them and rearrange their order, to form the words of Torah that he studies. These are not as great as the words of Torah themselves, but are like garment for them. This is like a person and his clothing: the person is more important than his clothing – so too, the soul needs garments, though the garments are much lower and cannot be compared to the soul. These are the words of Torah formed from his mundane conversations, making even his mundane conversations a crown for G‑d when their letter order is rearranged. On the other hand, when a person follows a bad path, G‑d forbid, that lacks Torah and good deeds, and when he constantly speaks in forbidden ways, his mundane conversations are also considered to be for the sake of forbidden things; for he never thinks about serving G‑d. The attention he gives to his physical needs is only so that he can engage in meaningless activities. Then his empty and forbidden words outweigh his mundane ones and transform them and their letter combinations into forbidden words. These form a crown for the Other Side, may G‑d save us.<br><i>Arvei Nachal</i>, <i>Vayakhel</i>, <i>BeHa’aloscha</i>

Rabbi Eliezer said: “Warm yourself by the fire of the Sages, but beware of their embers, lest you be burnt – for their bite is the bite of a fox, their sting is the sting of a scorpion, their hiss is the hiss of a serpent, and all their words are like fiery coals.” (</b><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 2:10)<br>The Tannaim<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sages of first and second century Israel.</i> used to open their lectures with a joke. This is because there are aspects of “Smallness” and “Greatness”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">States of constriction and concealment, and states of expansion and revelation.</i> in space, time, and soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> speaks about three primary co-ordinates of creation: <i>olam</i>, <i>shana</i>, and <i>nefesh</i> – world (space), year (time) and soul. Whatever occurs on one of these co-ordinates automatically occurs on the others.</i> and by means of a joke, one can rise from Smallness and cleave to Greatness.<br>Now, at a time of “Greatness,” one can study and pray with fear and love. A person realizes that he is speaking to the exalted King, and can cling to him – there is no greater pleasure than this. On the other hand, in a time of Smallness, a person must wage a great battle to come close to G‑d, although this is also the main source of reward, for a person must force himself [to serve G‑d]. Even when he cannot actualize his good intentions, nevertheless: “I have hidden Your word in my heart” (Psalms 119:11),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., even when outwardly, he seems far from G‑d, in his heart, he still remains close to Him.</i> whereas outwardly, he should be involved with material concerns. Thus, the Sages said of Torah study and labor that “the effort expended at both of them keeps sin out of mind.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 2:2.</i> Also, it is possible to perform <i>Yichudim</i> in the stories that one person tells another. This is the Maharsha explained, that when Nehemiah would talk to the king, he would have in mind to pray to G‑d.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chidushei Agados</i>, <i>Rosh Hashana</i> 3b. See also Maharam m’Pano, <i>Eser Ma’amarot</i>, <i>“Em Kol Chai</i>,” chap. 1:7</i> There are many similar examples.
With this, you can understand the statement: “Warm yourself by the fire of the Sages.” Meaning to say, when the Sages are in a state of Greatness and are on fire with the light of the Torah and prayer, you should obviously warm yourself by their fire. However, “beware of their embers.” Meaning, when they are in a period of Smallness, and lack the fire to burn with an inner light, they are called embers. The student who wants to learn from the proper approach to materialism may not realize that his teacher then fulfills “I have hidden Your word in my heart” – which means to be engaged in physicality, but to have one’s mind on innerwardness and spirituality. The student only learns from what he sees – that his teacher is involved in material pursuits – and will be punished. “For their bite is the bite of a fox, their sting is the sting of a scorpion (<i>akrav - </i>עקרב).” Meaning, the teacher draws the seven levels, each one composed of ten, making <i>ayin</i> (70) – <i>akrav</i> (ע-קרב) – back to their source. But the students do not realize this and think that their teacher is simply involved with material concerns.<br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 31d

I saw in the sefer <i>Nivchar Peninim</i>, in the name of a certain scholar, that a person should not draw too close [to a sage], for proximity can lead to distant. This may be the intention of the Mishnah in Pirkei Avos: “Warm yourself by the fire of the Sages, but beware of their embers, lest you be burnt.” Meaning to say, warm yourself only from a distance, and don’t get too close to the burning embers, so that you do not get burnt.<br>It seems to me that I heard this in the name of my Master (the Baal Shem Tov).<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 20c

<b>These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph was seventeen years old, and shepherded the flock with his brothers.</b> (Genesis 37:2)<br>The word “shepherd” (<i>ro’eh</i>) implies “to unite, join or link together,” as in the words “brotherliness” and “friendship.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <i>ro’eh</i> is grammatically connected to the word for “friendship” – <i>re’ut.</i></i> A shepherd is called a <i>ro’eh</i> because he brings the flock together in one place, lest they become scattered. Thus, Joseph united his brothers – that is, all of Israel and the sparks of the Divine Presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The concept of mystical unifications – <i>yichudim</i> – is one of the central teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, and operates on many levels. The basic level is the recognition of the presence of the Creator in all aspects of creation, be they physical, emotional, conceptual, and even spiritual. Thus, the Baal Shem Tov said: “Whatever you see – remember G-d. If you feel love, remember the love of G-d. If you experience fear, recall the fear of G-d. Even when you go to the bathroom, think to yourself, I am removing the bad from the good, so that the good will remain in the service of G-d. This is the meaning of unification” (<i>Tzivos HaRivash,</i> p.3b). On a deeper level, it means the mystical recombination of the letters of creation, especially in prayer and Torah study, that can produce a revelation of the Divine Oneness in the world. In the verse above, the Baal Shem Tov is saying that Joseph, who represents the Tzaddik, is able to see the divinity in each Jew, and through this, uplift all of Israel to the Father in Heaven. Alternatively, Joseph could see the Hebrew letters that constitute all of reality, and combine them in patterns that would reveal the Divine Presence in creation.</i> He uplifted and repaired all of them by means of the holy mystical unifications that he performed. He did this with the “flock,” which implies Unifications.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The three letters of the Hebrew word for flock, <i>tzon</i>, can be divided into <i>tz-o</i> (<i>tzade aleph</i>), whose numerical value is 91, and <i>nun</i>. The number 91 is also the numerical value (<i>gematria</i>) of two of G-d’s holy names together – the Tetragrammaton, Y-H-V-H (26), and the name Ado-nai (65). The union of these names represents the complete integration of the spiritual and the physical, from the first emanations from G-d, until malchus, the world in which we live. (See Likutey Moharan I:66.) The letter <i>nun</i> usually represents the world of Binah, which corresponds to the revelation of the world-to-come, and is the sefirah through which Divine blessing flows into the world. All this is alluded to in the word <i>tzon</i> – the union of G-d’s two names, which leads to a subsequent outflow of blessing in the world. Thus, R. Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye writes, in the name of the Baal Shem Tov: “A human being in this world is composed of matter and form (i.e., the material and the spiritual), and through him, the lower world and the upper world are joined, and a union is created between the two names Y-H-V-H and Ado-nai, which have the numerical value of 91, from the world <i>tzon</i>. Whereas the effluence that pours forth from there is the expansion of the <i>nun</i>” (<i>Tzafna Paneach, Teruma</i>). It is also possible that the Baal Shem Tov uses the term <i>tzon</i> to represent this idea, because a flock is a group of animals that are joined together, and convey the idea of union. Furthermore, the word <i>tzon</i> is from the Hebrew word <i>tze</i>, which means “to go out,” and represents the idea of that which emanates from a source. (See <i>Torah Ohr</i>, by the Ba’al HaTanya, <i>VaYetze</i>, p. 23c, who discusses this idea).</i><br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Vayeshev</i>

<b>And he said, I am seeking my brothers…</b> (37:16)<br>The Zohar says:<br>Rabbi Yehuda commented on the verse: “O, were you like my brother, who nursed from the breasts of my mother. When I would find you outside, I would kiss you.” (Song of Songs 8:1). I would find You outside – meaning, in the exile, in other lands.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I:184a, on Genesis 37:16.</i><br>In this piece of Zohar, one can find the words of the Baal Shem Tov, that in the Diaspora, special help is available to a person seeking Divine inspiration,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruach HaKodesh.</i></i> despite the fact that the Shechina does not dwell in exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II:5a, 82a.</i> Even if a person is not entirely worthy, heaven is still not so particular with him, as in the Land of Israel. For when a king is on the road, he must sleep in inns and hotels that are not as clean and beautiful as befitting his honor; yet, the king is not disgraced, because everyone knows that he is traveling. Understand this well.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov means that because the Divine Presence is in exile in the world, and no longer focused in the land of Israel and the Holy Temple, it is actually easier to come to a perception of G-d than in the past. On this idea, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye writes (<i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, <i>Ekev</i>, 181b): “Especially in our time, when the Divine Presence is in exile and finds no place to rest, as soon as a person prepares all of his actions for the sake of heaven, he immediately becomes a “throne” for the Shechina, which rests upon him. He is even considered higher than those of earlier generations, when there were many Tzaddikim in the world; whereas today, “the pious man ceases” (Psalms 12:2) – that is, those who are pious before their Creator (Zohar III:281b). A person should strengthen himself like a warrior, and show kindness to the Shechina, so that he becomes a throne for the attribute of Loving-Kindness (Chesed). Just as in Abraham’s time, when there was no one to help the Shechina but him, now too, besides a very few individuals, no one thinks about how to help and support the Shechina in this bitter exile. Thus, a person who is willing to sacrifice will certainly become a throne for the Divine Presence with the trait of loving-kindness.”</i><br><i>Igra d’Pirka</i> 148

It depends upon how a person uses his life. One who puts the strength he receives from eating into the service of G-d uplifts the sparks that were in the food. However, a person who eats for physical gratification, and does not invest his energy into good deeds, merely traps the sparks in a further level of corporeality. However, if this person helps another person fulfill a mitzvah (for instance, a gentile worker in a Jewish religious institution), then the sparks are uplifted from him as well, and the Divine Presence is reconstituted in the world.</i> Extracting these sparks of holiness from among the “shells”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kelipot</i>, the lower realms of reality that cover and conceal the essence of the Divine, as a shell covers a fruit.</i> is the purpose of all a Jews actions, in Torah study, fulfillment of the commandments, and in the mystical intentions of eating.

“Happy is the man who makes G-d his trust…” (Psalms 40:5).

The Baal Shem Tov taught, there is the one who trusts, the one who promises, and the thing that is trusted in; that is, the agent upon which a person relies to receive the promise. For instance, G-d promises to provide a person with all of his needs, if he follows His ways, and the person trusts in this. However, he still needs some causal agent by means of which G-d will send him his livelihood, such as a business deal, or other transaction.<br>Such a person has not reached the essence of faith. Because the main thing is to believe in G-d alone, and nothing else. A person with faith does not need any intermediary agents through which to attain his livelihood. G-d is the ultimate cause and mover of all. Even if he makes <i>no</i> efforts to support himself, G-d can still send him his livelihood, in His great love. This is the meaning of: “Blessed is the man who trusts in G-d, and G-d will be his trust.” That is, our trust is G-d Himself, for He alone is the source of our livelihood. Everything is only G-d, may He be blessed. Even if a person receives support through intermediary means, he must believe fully that it is only from G-d, who wants to support him this way, though it does not necessarily have to come through this channel. Only trust in G-d. This is a very high level.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, BeShalach</i>

The great principle in life is: “Commit you actions to G‑d, and your thoughts will be established” (Proverbs 16:3). Whatever comes to you, imagine that it is from G‑d.

Comment 11

Keep in mind always that the entire world is filled with the Creator, may He be blessed, as it is written: “Do I not fill heaven and earth? says G‑d” (Jeremiah 23:24). Realize that even what happens as a result of human thought and planning is from G‑d. Even the most insignificant event in the world is under His guidance. When a person realizes this, it makes no difference to him if his actions come out as he desires or not, since everything is from G‑d, who knows that it is better for a person’s will not be done. In light of this, a person should never despair when something he wants to do does not succeed, for he believes that G‑d desires the opposite. [He should think:] “If it were good in G‑d’s eyes, He certainly would help me achieve it. But since I am can’t, it certainly is not according to G‑d’s will. In fact, G‑d was much kinder to me than had He fulfilled my will.”<br><i>Hanhagos Yesharos</i>, p. 10a

<b>And Judah drew near to him and said, Oh my lord,</b> (Genesis 44:18)<br>The Talmud says, “A person should always praise G-d first, and then pray [for his needs].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos </i>31a.</i> Yet, in another place, the Talmud states the opposite view.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“Rabbi Eliezer said, a person should first ask for his needs, and then pray.” <i>Avoda Zara</i> 7b.</i> The answer is that there are two separate opinions. The Ramban<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Nachmanidies (1194-1270).</i> writes that the essence of a craftsman can be found in the craft that he creates.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, whenever a person creates something, something of his soul enters into and remains in their handicraft. Great kabbalists, such as the Arizal and the Baal Shem Tov could look at an object, and immediately know everything about the one who made it. Here, the Baal Shem Tov applies the principle to creation itself. Since it is G-d’s handiwork, there must be a remnant of the Creator within it.</i> [Likewise], the Creation is compared to a snail, whose garment is part of itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbosai, Bereishis </i>21:5. Just as the garments of a locust are part of itself, so the creation is not something separate from or outside of the Divine. It is part of Him, and His Presence is continually present within it.</i> In all suffering, there exists a spark of holiness from G-d, although it is hidden within many garments. This is the meaning of the verse: “the seven maids chosen to be given to her, from the king’s house”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The “seven maids” represent the sparks of holiness that have fallen among the “shells” of impurity. The word maid, <i>na’arah</i>, is related to the word “to shake out,” <i>mino’ar</i>, because the holiness found in these sparks has been “shaken out” of them, until almost nothing remains. However, these sparks yearn to return to their root. Thus, the verse from Esther continues: “When it came the turn for each maid to come into the king…” (Esther 2:12); that is, each spark of holiness has a pre-determined time that it will leave the shells of impurity, and come before the King. (See Baal Shem Tov on the Torah, Miketz, on Genesis 41:1.</i> (Esther 2:9). When a person realizes that G-d is with him even there, the garments become transparent and disappear, and the suffering is abated.<br>This is what it means to offer praise first. G-d’s praise is that His glory fills the entire universe. “In all their afflictions, He is afflicted” (Isaiah 63:9) – then, there is <i>no</i> affliction<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>lo </i>in this verse is written different than it is read. It is written <i>lamed vav</i>, which mean “him,” in this case, G-d. However, tradition tells us to read the word <i>lo</i> as though it were written with <i>lamed aleph</i>, which means “no,” in this case, “there is not.” The Baal Shem Tov combines both readings. When a person realizes that G-d is present in all of his afflictions, then the afflictions themselves cease to exist.</i> – and one can pray. When one knows how to praise G-d in this way, the suffering will disappear by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">R. Yaakov Yosef adds here: “I heard from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) that this is the meaning of ‘You will establish their heart, Your ears will hear [their prayers]” (Psalms 10:17).</i><br>The other opinion says to pray first.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., a person who prays for his needs, without first praising G-d; that is, coming to the realization that G-d is present even in the affliction.</i> In this case, a person’s has faith that G-d is also there [in the affliction], so that he can offer his praise [afterward].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, even though a person does not perceive the spark of holiness in the suffering, if he <i>believes</i> that G-d is with him even there, he will eventually come to this realization.</i>
With this, we can understand the verse: “And Judah drew near to him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov reads Judah’s words as not being addressed to Joseph, but to G-d himself. See <i>Pri Tzaddik</i>, <i>Vayigash </i>1, by Rabbi Tzaddok HaKohen of Lublin, who explains that tzaddikim often address their words to the Divine Presence, even when they are speaking to other human beings.</i> He praised the Holy One.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The name Judah – Yehuda – is from the Hebrew word “<i>hodu</i>” – to praise. As Leah said, when he was born: “Now I will praise G-d; therefore, she called his name Judah” (Genesis 29:35). And Jacob said: “Judah, your brothers will praise you” (ibid. 49:8).</i> First, he said, “Oh my L-rd” – because all affliction derives from this name.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew reads: “<i>Bi Adoni</i>.” The Baal Shem Tov sees this as alluding to G-d’s name Ado-nai, which represents the forces of concealment and strict judgment.</i> But when he drew near to Him and praised and exalted Him, the affliction was annulled.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., Joseph revealed himself.

<b>Then Judah drew near to him, and said: ‘Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord’s ears. Do not be angry with your servant; for you are even like Pharaoh.</b> (Genesis 44:18)<br>A careful reading of this verse raises several questions. The words “drew near” (<i>hagasha</i>) denote a sense of confrontation. But in that case, the words “Oh” (בי) and “I pray you” (נא) are redundant. Likewise, in the phrase “Do not be angry,” the word “not” (אל) is redundant, since it would have been more appropriate to say “Be angry; I do not care.” Similarly, the word “like” (כ) is redundant, for it should have said: “For Pharaoh is a person like you, who decrees and does not fulfill.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on this verse. The Baal Shem Tov’s reading is based upon a redundancy in the Hebrew, which contains a double adjective “like” – <i>ki k’mocha k’Pharaoh</i> (כִּי כָמוֹךָ כְּפַרְעֹה) It would have been sufficient to write “<i>ki k’mocha Pharaoh</i>.”</i><br>However, all of these extra letters (בי נא אל כ) form an acronym for the verse: “How shall a young man keep his way pure?

The Talmud says: “The Torah is careful with a Jew’s money.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rosh Hashana</i> 27a.</i> Why? Because in everything a Jew uses, be it clothing, food, or utensils, there is a spiritual life-force from which he derives pleasure. Without this energy, the object could not exist. Furthermore, these sparks of holiness are connected to the person’s own soul, which explains why one person loves one thing, and another person hates it, and loves something else. And even when a person uses the object, or eats the food, just to sustain himself, he can still repairs its sparks, if he later serves G-d with the strength that he received from it. This explains why sometimes, after a person has repaired the sparks in a object related to his soul, G-d removes it from him and gives it to someone else, because it still contains other sparks from a different source.
The Baal Shem Tov said: “We eat people, we drink people, and we use people” – referring to the sparks that are in each thing.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Chaim of Chernovitz, in the famous chasidic work <i>Be’er Mayim Chayim </i>(commentary on the Hagada), gives a slightly different interpretation of these words: “The Baal Shem Tov said, ‘Three people who eat together, and do not share word of Torah, are considered to have eaten from the sacrifices of the dead’ (Pirkei Avos 3:4). This refers to the souls of the deceased that are incarnated in human food, so that people will share words of Torah over them. Through this ‘the dead are resurrected’ (i.e. repaired). However, if they do not share Torah, it is as if they sacrificed that soul and threw it down to the level of inanimate objects.”</i> Therefore, we should be careful with our possessions, because of the sparks that they contain. We should have compassion on our own sparks of holiness.<br><i>Tzivos HaRivash</i>, p.13a

<b>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; every man with his family: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah…</b> (Exodus 1:1-2)<br>When a person experiences fear of G‑d, or a sense of satisfaction in performing a commandment, he begins to feel self-important. This brings exile into the world. Thus, the verse says: “…they have made Jerusalem (<i>Yerushalayim</i>) into heaps” (Psalms 79:1). That is, they made their perfect fear (<i>yira-shalem</i>) into a high and impressive mound. When he serves G‑d, whether in prayer, Torah study or the like, it is without fear and love, but like someone strumming on a harp. And so, all of his worship goes to the <i>kelipos</i>. Thus it says: “They have given the corpses (<i>nivlas</i>) of Your servants as food to the birds of the heaven” (ibid. 79:2). These are the <i>kelipos</i>. And what caused this? Because they performed their service as if on a harp (<i>nevel</i>).

Just as the entire nation of Israel experiences exile and redemption, so does each and every individual, as the verse says: “Draw near to my soul and redeem it” (Psalms 69:19).

<b>And He said, I am the G-d of your father.</b> (Exodus 3:6)<br>This is what is written: “A fool (<i>pesi</i>) believes in everything” (Proverbs 14:15). What is the meaning of “a fool”? A child.

With the Jewish people’s presence in the land, this trait was uplifted. Rabbi Nathan of Breslov, in Likutey Halachot, Milah 3:5, writes that the seven Canaanite nations that inhabited the Land of Israel correspond to the seven days that a Jewish male child must pass through until his circumcision on the eight day.

The essence of the Egyptian exile was that the people lacked <i>da’at</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Da’at </i>refers to a direct, spiritual perception of G-d. See the Torah portion VaYetze, fn. 7.</i> which is the ability<i> </i>to conclude<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov uses a uncommon word to describe this lack of <i>da’at</i>: <i>l’hachria</i> – להכריע, which means to weigh and decide between multiple options in order to reach a conclusion. The nature of the <i>da’at</i> consciousness is the reconciliation of opposites (as in the unified, mystical experience). The lack of <i>da’at</i>, therefore, would mean that a person is trapped between opposites, unable to come to a single conclusion about the existence of G-d.</i> that there is One Creator, “who in His goodness, constantly renews the act of creation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the daily, morning prayers.</i> Not until Moses came, and through the miracles he performed, demonstrated that there is One Creator who constantly renews the world.<br>However, the aspect of <i>da’at</i> that was revealed in the Exodus was Feminine<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Da’at d’nukba, </i>in the Aramaic of the Zohar.</i>; whereas the <i>da’at</i> that will be revealed in the future, in the days of the Messiah, will be Masculine.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Da’at d’d’chura. </i>To briefly explain this complex idea: According to the Sages, there are two levels of prophecy – through a clear lens, and through an unclear lens, <i>aspaklaria d’me’ira</i> and <i>aspaklaria d’eina me’ira</i>. Feminine <i>da’at</i>, that was revealed at the Exodus, means that the Jewish people had a perception of G-d that was filtered through their emotions and intellectual facilities. Only Moses merited perceiving G-d through a clear lens, which means a direct, perception of Divinity and the workings of the supernal worlds. All Israel <i>did</i> attain this level briefly at the revelation at Sinai, although they lost it soon afterward. However, in the World to Come, this level of spiritual perception will be regained.</i> Thus, the verse says: “Your eyes will behold your Master” (Isaiah 30:20). Then, everyone will see with their eyes the letters of Torah and prayers that they are studying and praying, for these are the purified worlds.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to R.

And the entire world will see that everything is His simple Will, and that all that happened was through His direction, down to the smallest detail, and that the Master of the World was in each and every gesture, for the essence of the craftsman is in the object he creates, and the creation is like a snail, whose garment is of itself.” (See <i>Baal Shem Tov on the Torah, parashas Vayigash</i>, for more on the metaphor of the snail.)</i> This is what the Sages said: “[Know what is above you,] an eye sees, and an ear hears.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei Avos 2:1. R. Elazar bemoans the fact that he could not achieve a level of revelation comparable to that of the World to Come; that is, to “mention” the revelation, as one person says to another, “Do you see this before you?” Apparently, the term “Exodus from Egypt” is a general term for the revelation of da'at. In the original Exodus, the feminine da'at was revealed, and in the World to Come, masculine da'at will be revealed. The difference being that in the future redemption, speech itself will be revelatory, as the letters of prayer and Torah study will be seen.</i><br>This is also what is written in the Passover Hagadah: “Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, Though I am like a man of seventy years, I did not merit to mention the Exodus from Egypt in the nights.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., in the evening prayers, in the last passage of the Shema, that speaks of the commandment of tzitzit.

Elazar was able to make mention of the Exodus from Egypt in the night; that is, to reveal the presence of G-d even in exile – a foretaste of the revelation of the World to Come.</i> Then it was possible to demonstrate the presence of the Exodus from Egypt, which would otherwise be impossible until the future,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Komarna Rebbe explains that although this form of revelation will not be fully achieved until the World to Come, certain holy individuals throughout the generations, such as the Arizal, the Baal Shem Tov, or R.

Comment 17

I learned from the Baal Shem Tov the nature of the Egyptian exile, as well this bitter exile today. [That is,] wicked people imagine the world to be ownerless, and “the way of the wicked to prosper” (Jeremiah 12:1). But this is because of a lack of Da’as.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Knowledge,” usually signifying a direct, mystical perception of G‑d.</i> In Egyptian exile, they could not draw the conclusion that there is One Creator, whose glory fills the entire world, and who renews the creation each day in His goodness. Not until Moses came, who was the aspect of Da’as, and revealed to the world, through the miracles he did, that there is a Creator who directs each and every detail [of creation], every step and every word.<br>However, [at that time] only the Feminine aspect of Da’as was revealed. Thus, our present exile is the aspect of “Women are light-headed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shabbat</i> 33b. Literally, “light of Da’as,” meaning that women can be easily swayed by men. However, the Baal Shem Tov interprets it as meaning that the feminine aspect of Da’as is “light” ‘ i.e. impermanent, and was lost in the duration of the exile. This is because the Jews, at the time of the exodus, received a spiritual illumination from Above, without any effort on their part (thus, as receivers the Da’as was feminine.) However, in the future, the Da’as will be achieved as a result of the struggles we overcame during the exile, and thus will be masculine; i.e. more integrated and ever-lasting.</i> Thus, this Da’as withdrew, until heretical beliefs because stronger, that declare: “G‑d does not see” (Psalms 94:7). However, the Masculine aspect of Da’as will be revealed in the future. Then “your eyes shall behold your Teacher” (Isaiah 30:20). Before their very eyes, they will behold the letters of the Torah that they are studying and the prayers they recite, and will see that they are purified worlds.<br>This is the meaning of “I did not merit to mention the Exodus from Egypt in the nights”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnayos Berachos </i>1:5; cited in the Passover Haggadah: “Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, Though I am like a man of seventy years, I did not merit to mention the Exodus from Egypt in the nights.”</i> ‘ that is, to proclaim the glory of G‑d, until every person feels and sees that the earth is filled with His glory. For the darkness of the <i>kelipos</i> brings about concealment and deceit. In the future, though, the glory of His Kingship will be revealed, and the entire world will see that everything is part of His Unified will, and that everything is under His direction, even the smallest detail, for the Master of the World is in every movement, for the essence of craftsman is in the object he creates, and the creation is like a snail, whose garment is part of itself.<br><i>Otzar HaChayim</i>, p. 264b

The cause of the Egyptian exile was that they did not know what they lacked,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The recognition of one’s faults and lacking is the first step in coming to deliverance, since one can then cry out to G-d over what is lacking. This is a common theme in the writings of R. Yaakov Yitzchok of Polnoye.</i> as is explained in the writings of the Arizal, for in the Egyptian exile, ]their] <i>da'at</i> left them. Thus, the verse says about Moses (at the burning bush), “And G-d saw that he turned to see” (Exodus 3:4).<br>Thus, they were in exile under the rule of Pharaoh, who is the aspect of the neck, which is the place of forgetfulness.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The root letters of the word Pharaoh, פרעה, also constitute the letters of the word “neck,” <i>oref,</i> עורף. In Kabbalah, the face always corresponds to that which gives illumination. The Hebrew word for face, <i>panim</i>, is the same as the word for “interiority,” <i>penim</i>, for the face reveals the soul. The “back” always represents that which conceals, for little can be discerned by seeing someone’s back. Based upon the coordinates of the sefirot and the human body, Da'at corresponds to the throat, for the throat is the passageway that unites the mind and the heart – a function of da'at. Moses corresponds to da'at, the throat, illumination, whereas Pharaoh corresponds to the back of the neck, exile and concealment. (Thus, according to the Midrash, Pharaoh sought to cut off Moses’ head.)</i> Pharaoh said, “I do not know G-d,” which is the opposite of <i>da'at</i>. [The exile continued] until the aspect of Moses was revealed in the world, the aspect of <i>da'at</i>. Then, “the king of Egypt died” (ibid. 2:23), which is Pharaoh, the neck. Forgetfulness was lifted, and the aspect of <i>da'at</i> came into the world. Then they realized their shortcomings, and “The children of Israel cried out from their labor” (ibid.). They realized that they were lacking in the service of G-d. “And their cries rose to G-d from their labor.” All of this was because of Moses: “And Moses was a shepherd” (ibid.).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was the aspect of da'at, and when he came to redeem the Israelites, he invested them with da'at as well.</i><br>Therefore, since the essence of the Egyptian exile was the removal of <i>da'at</i>, which was a spiritual exile, the aspect of forgetfulness, and their inability to recognize their own shortcomings, it also became a physical exile. This is not true of one who recognizes his own shortcomings by means of <i>da'at</i>. For then, he can repent and fix what he lacks, and speed the final redemption.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Pekudei</i>

<b>And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</b> (6:70)<br>This commandment precedes all the other commandments; for the first commandment is to know G-d, in general, and in particular.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., to know that G-d exists and rules over all creation, and to know him personally, in one’s life.</i><br>Zohar 2:25a.

Though this concept is extremely deep, and impossible to explain, there is still a little we can say about it.

The neck, on the other hand, is behind the face and lacks all illumination. Furthermore, the neck is the narrow junction between the head and the heart; i.e. between the realization that G-d exists and the integrations of that knowledge into one’s life. Moses was the aspect of Da'at, for he sought to reveal Divinity in the world, to unite the “head” with the “heart.” Pharaoh opposed that revelation.

Kabbalah considers the masculine <i>Sefiros</i> to be the source of beneficence, whereas the feminine <i>Sefiros</i>, in as much as they create a vessel for containing spiritual downflow, are considered an expression of limitation and Judgment. Furthermore, the four letters of the Name can be arranged in twelve different patters. When the letters <i>yud</i> and <i>vav</i> come first, it symbolizes an abundance of Divine compassion; when the letters <i>hey</i> come first, it symbolizes an excess of <i>din</i> and concealment. The verse from Exodus, cited above, begins “<i>Vayehi beshalach...</i>” – וַיְהִי בְּשַׁלַּח . The letters of the first word contain the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, with the letters <i>vav</i> and <i>yud</i> coming first.</i> the forces of Loving-kindness prevail; if not, forgetfulness rules, which is called “Pharaoh.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word “Pharaoh” shares the same letters as the word “<i>oref</i>” (neck), and the two concepts correspond.

But now, he lets the people – the limbs – go out to freedom. “But G‑d did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines” – for there is a [spiritual] concept called “way.” This is the [holy] Names <i>S’ag</i> and <i>Ekiyeh Ka’sa</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Name <i>S’ag</i> refers to the Tetragrammaton spelled out as follows: יוד די ואו די which has the numerical value of 63 (ס”ג).

The Baal Shem Tov will explain below that were evil to receive a direct illumination from this world, it would become empowered more.</i> For this reason, repentance helps, for the damage of sin does not reach there.

But when he repents, his deeds have a positive effect, and he repairs everything, for he uplifts the [lower] levels to Binah, which is <i>Ekiyeh</i>.<br>Thus, the verse says: “G‑d did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines.” For from this “way,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the way of direct repentance.</i> the Land of the Philistine, the impure shells, also derive nourishment.

The words “to its strength” – <i>l’eitano</i>, is interpreted by the Sages as “<i>l’tanao</i>” – “to its stipulation.” That is, G‑d made a stipulation with the sea, when He created it, that it would split at that moment for the Children of Israel.</i> From the very beginning, G‑d built it into the sea to split before the Children of Israel at that time. This makes the miracle even greater! For from the beginning of creation, G‑d created the natural order for the sake of Israel, as it says: ‘In the beginning’ – for the sake of Israel, who is called ‘the beginning.’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi’s commentary on Genesis 1:1. Israel is called “the beginning,” as in the verse: “Israel is the L‑rd’s hallowed portion, the beginning of His produce” (Jeremiah 2:3).</i> This nature of the sea was created for Israel.

<b>The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them . . .</b> (ibid. 15:9)<br>The first five words of this verse begin with the letter <i>aleph</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Omar oyev, erdof, asig, achalek – </i>אָמַר אוֹיֵב אֶרְדּף אַשִּׂיג אֲחַלֵּק.</i> because the Master of the World (<i>Alupho shel Olam</i>) is hidden there, in the mystery of the name Sa’l.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">סא"ל– one of the 72 names of G‑d, that closely resembles the name of the angel Sam’el, סמא"ל (pronounced “the <i>samech mem</i>”), who is appointed over evil. The Talmud states that in the World to Come, G‑d will slaughter the evil inclination (Succah 52a). According to the Baal Shem Tov, this means that G‑d will make the evil inclination “kosher,” by removing the bad from it, symbolized here by the letter <i>mem</i>. Then, only the name סא"ל will remain, which has the combined numerical value of G‑d’s two names, Y-H-V-H and Ado-nai (91). This is the meaning of the verse: “On that day, G‑d (Y-H-V-H) and His name (Ado-nai) will be One” (Zechariah 14:9), for the result will be a revelation of G‑d’s Oneness.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Bereishis</i>, p.8c

There are five <i>alephs</i> in these words, because the Master of the World is hidden there, in order to bring [the Jewish people] close to Him, as the verse says: “And Pharaoh drew near” (ibid. 14:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The word uses the transitive form of the verb “to draw near,” <i>hikriv</i> (הקריב), which literally means, “he drew others near.” According to the Baal Shem Tov, G‑d clothes Himself even in the source of affliction, in order to draw us back to Him. When we recognize that G‑d is present even there, then the external enemy is annulled. See Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 42, on this verse.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Vayeshev</i>, p.34d

<b>Then G‑d said to Moses: ‘Behold, I will make bread rain down to you from heaven; and the people will go out and gather enough for each day…</b> (Ibid. 16:4)<br>A poor person has the privilege of speaking to the Holy One every day. A rich person, however, receives all his sustenance from G‑d at once, and doesn’t need to ask Him for his daily requirements – not unless he is very righteous, and realizes that everything he owns is worthless, without G‑d giving it life-force to sustain him. The proof is that a sick person has all the food he needs, but still cannot sustain himself.<br>A poor person, with nothing to eat, must beseech G‑d each day. Thus, he merits speaking to Him every day. Furthermore, G‑d must also remember the poor person daily, to arrange his livelihood.

Rather than combining together positively to serve, as do the supernal qualities, they “steal” from one another. (Only when the various attributes of the personality are used in the service of G‑d can opposite combine, as in the verse: “rejoice with trembling” (Psalms 2:11).)

<b>These are the ordinances that you shall set before them.</b> (Exodus 21:1)<br>On this verse, the Zohar says: “These are the cycles of reincarnation…”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 2:94a.</i> This is a surprising comment, seeing that the subsequent verses speak about monetary laws. However, I heard the following explanation: One person accuses another in court [that he owes him money]. Though the defendant knows he is innocent, the Torah nevertheless obligates him to pay. He shouldn’t be plagued by the question, “Isn’t it a Torah of truth, whose ‘paths are pleasant?’” because this <i>is</i> the truth of the Torah and its pleasantness. Undoubtedly, he owed this money to the other litigant in a previous life, and the Torah is now making him pay in order to free him from this debt. As for the person who took the money deceitfully, he will have to give his own accounting in the future. This is only one example of many possible cases.<br>This is what the holy Zohar alludes to in its reading of the verse: “These are the ordinances.” For while the law may at times seem unjust, really, “these are the cycles of reincarnation.” The Creator of the world and of all souls knows what occurred between individuals in previous lives, and directs His world according to the Torah, with love and compassion, with righteousness and true justice.

One Rosh Hashana, when the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov were praying together, one of them dropped a snuff-box, and bent down in the middle of his prayers to retrieve it.

The Baal Shem Tov, with his spiritual insight, realized that the rebuke of his holy disciple had brought a heavenly judgment upon his friend, to die within the coming year.

The student began to pace the study hall, contemplating on the greatness of G‑d, His Oneness, and other matters (in order to regain his concentration). Suddenly, a thought entered his mind. “Why is it that the tobacco plant has only recently been discovered, making it possible now for people to snuff or smoke it?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Tobacco was introduced into Eastern Europe in about 1600, one hundred years before the birth of the Baal Shem Tov.</i> Perhaps there are souls in our generations too sublime to be clothed in the physical world, and that the only way to rectify them is through something equally refined, like the sense of smell.” This led him to feelings of regret over the anger he had showed his friend; for who knows which souls he raised up by snuffing tobacco with the mystical intentions?
On the day of Hoshana Rabbah, it was the Baal Shem Tov’s custom to answer all questions about what had been decreed above and below, and about what would happen throughout the world (in the coming year), for with his divinely inspired knowledge, he could see from one end of the earth to the other. On that day, he was in especially good spirits. Each of his students prepared a different question, some in areas of Torah discourse, and some with questions on the Talmud, or other matters. The Baal Shem Tov would answer them all.<br>That disciple, who had berated his friend, chose to ask his question about the discovery of tobacco. When he presented his question, the Baal Shem Tov said to him, “Tell me what you think!” He gave his reason, and the Baal Shem Tov said, “But say more! Tell me all the thoughts that you had last night.” The student remembered what he had thought, and told the Baal Shem Tov how he had judged his friend favorably. At that moment, the heavenly decree was annulled. The Baal Shem Tov was then able to tell him the whole story, about what he had brought upon his friend. And he warned him always to judge G‑d-fearing people favorably, so as not to bring supernal judgments upon them, that it should always be good for them.<br><i>Otzar HaChaim, Kedoshim</i>, p. 171c

Comment 4

I heard a parable from my Master. A king had a son whom he wanted to teach the various subjects that were required for a prince to know. He hired several scholars, but the boy failed to grasp even a single area of knowledge, The king finally gave up on him, and only one sage remained. One day, the king’s son saw a beautiful, young woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to another version of this parable, the girl was a harlot.</i> and desired her. The sage complained about this to the king, but the king replied that since the boy shows some desire, even a physical one, it is possible for him to learn all the fields of knowledge. The king ordered that the young woman be brought to the palace, and told her that should she must not listen to the prince’s solicitations, unless he agrees to master one branch of knowledge. Afterwards, she should demand that he learn yet another branch. This continued until he mastered all the areas of study. But when he finally became a wise man, he rejected the young woman and married a princess, as was fitting for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The other version concludes: “For what connection should a prince have with a harlot?”</i><br>The meaning of the parable is obvious.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef, Vayechi</i>, p. 88a

Comment 5

<b>How fair and how pleasant are you, lover of delights.</b> (Song of Songs 7:7)<br>How fair and how pleasant it is that in all [mundane] delights there is the Supernal Love. Because when one’s innate desires are evoked, it becomes easier to love G-d. Otherwise, it is difficult to develop these emotions, and to start to love Him. Understand this!<br>Furthermore, whenever a person feels a spontaneous attraction toward a certain pleasure, which is a love that has “fallen” from its supernal source, he should realize that G-d is helping him, and making it easier to love Him. G-d knows that the person would otherwise never feel this emotion. But if the person fails to realize this, and is drawn after that pleasure itself, he casts down the [Supernal Love] even further.
At other times, a person may have a negative desire, G-d forbid, such as to commit a sin, yet some obstacle prevents him from doing it. G-d is helping him here, as well. For when G-d sees that the person lacks the consciousness to uplift the fallen love to its source – to the love of G-d – and chooses instead to follow evil, G-d then “contracts” Himself even more, to place before him an obstacle.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">G-d clothes Himself in physical desires in order to allow people the opportunity to transcend them and transform them into a desire for Him. However, if the person cannot find G-d there, and comes close to sinning, G-d lowers Himself even more, to clothe Himself in the very force which now prevents the person from carrying out the act.</i> At least then, the person will remain passive and avoid damaging himself further.<br><i>Me’or Einayim, Va’Eschanan</i>

We received from our Master, the Baal Shem Tov, that the <i>keresh</i> is the image of a human being, [which is made up of] the pupil of the eye,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Tikunei Zohar (p. 126b) teaches that the word “Shabbat” can be divided into two words: the letter <i>shin</i> and the word <i>bat</i> (ש’ בת). This is the secret of the human eye, which has three colors (white, red, and blue/brown), corresponding to the three lines of the <i>shin</i> and the pupil of the eye, called in Hebrew, the <i>bat ayin</i> (literally: “daughter of the eye”). These four aspects also correspond to the four worlds, Atzilus, Beriyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, all of which are reflected in the human form. The Baal Shem Tov is teaching that a human being is comprised of different forces, represented by the letter <i>shin</i>, which are all united in his essence, which corresponds to the pupil of the eye.</i> [which is] the inner point that configures the whole force of the human likeness, and binds together all his limbs by means of the two hands, which is the mystery of the letter <i>shin</i>.

It is possible that those approaches were originally mentioned with this lesson, since there are a number of other letters, such as the <i>gimel, zayin, ches, tes</i> and <i>samech</i> that could never be derived from the other letters, no matter how many times they are spelled out.

<b>Therefore the Children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath for all generations, as an eternal covenant.</b> (ibid. 31:16)<br>Depression and the “shell” of physicality obstruct the soul’s joy in performing the commandments. The solution is “the land shall keep a Sabbath to G‑d” (Leviticus 25:2). This means to bring rest and relaxation to the land, which is the body, and to rejoice over physical pleasures. Through this, the soul can rejoice spiritually. This is “a Sabbath to G‑d,” for you need both these aspects on the Shabbat.

<b>And now, if You will forgive their sin; and if not, erase me, please, from Your book which You have written.</b> (ibid. 32:32)<br>How is this an example of Moses’ humility, i.e., that his death should be an atonement for the great sin [of the Golden Calf]? Rather, we must understand the nature of Moses’ humility. It is easy to understand the humility of other people – which is the insignificance a person feels when compared to others. However, Moses knew the spiritual root and worth of each Jewish soul, as well as the greatness of his own soul, that included within it all the souls of Israel, as the Sages said: “One woman in Egypt gave birth to 600,000 at one time – this is Moses, our Teacher.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I:25a.</i> How, then, could he possibly be humble?
It is written: “All Israel are responsible for one another”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Shavuos 39a; Sanhedrin 27b. The Talmud means that each Jew is responsible for the sins of his fellow, when he is able to prevent them.</i> – meaning, they are commingled with one another,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The word for “responsible” – <i>arev</i> (literally “guarantor”) and the word “mixed together” – <i>me’orav </i>share the same root.</i> for they all share a single root. Therefore, whenever a positive spirit from the source of goodness and holiness<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “from the good inclination” – the <i>yetzer tov</i>. This does not refer to the individual’s good inclination, rather to the source of goodness that radiates into every soul.</i> enters the world, it affects each and every Jew, according to his or her level. A Tzaddik will be greatly inspired to serve G-d, with great holiness and longing. A person who is not such a Tzaddik will also be inspired, but to a lesser degree. Even a completely wicked person will be moved to thoughts of repentance, albeit only temporarily. Still, he is inspired a little, which may lead him to complete repentance.<br>The opposite is also true. When a spirit emanates from the side of evil, it also affects each person. The wicked will fall severely and commit a sin; whereas the Tzaddik will experience some [improper] thought, albeit momentarily.<br>Now, when we see that a wicked person has actually committed a sin, we have to ask, who is to blame? Perhaps the Tzaddik is to blame, because the improper thought also came to him, and had he immediately worked to nullify it at its root, the wicked person would not have sinned. On the other hand, perhaps the wicked person is to blame, because once he actually committed the sin, as soon as the thought entered his mind, the Tzaddik could no longer annul it.<br>This is the essence of Moses’ humility. Whenever he saw some bad trait in a Jew, he would blame himself, thinking that it was most likely his fault. This was his intention, when he said, “Erase me, please.” That is, “I am the guilty one, not them!” But G-d answered him, “Whoever has sinned against Me, him will I erase from My book.” Meaning to say, “I know who is to blame!”<br><i>Divrei Moshe, Shemini</i>

Comment 10

There are two aspects of sin. The first is when the leader of the generation has a sinful thought, which causes the general populace to sin, G-d forbid. The second is when the people sin, which can, at times, cause the leader of the generation to have sinful thoughts.<br>The difference between them is that in the first case, the leader cannot pray on behalf of the people, since the evil started with him. In the second case, the leader was compelled [by the people], and his prayers are still efficacious.<br>This is what Moses said: “And now, if You will forgive their sin” – that is, if You forgive them [on account of his prayers], then I will know that it is <i>their </i>sin, that they committed themselves. “And if not” – if You do not forgive them and my prayers are not accepted, then it is possible that my own thoughts are the cause. Therefore, “erase me, please.” Thus, the verse continues: “And the L-rd said to Moses: 'Whoever has sinned against Me, him will I erase from My book.”<br><i>Imrei Tzaddikim </i>in the name of the <i>Kedushas Levi</i>

<b>These are the accounts of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony. . .</b> (Exodus 38:21)<br>Why does the Torah, when listing all the details that went into [the construction of] the Tabernacle and the vessels, conclude each stage by stating that it was done “as G‑d commanded Moses.” Why mention this each time, rather than as a general conclusion at the end?<br>The Torah is teaching us a fundamental lesson in the service of G‑d and the fulfillment of the commandments, be it shofar, succah, Pesach, tefillin, etc. Each one consists of action, words and intention, i.e., thought. The underlying intentions of the commandments and prayers are great and awesome. Few people, even those on a high spiritual level, grasp more than a minute portion of the intentions that the Men of the Great Assembly had in [formulating] the prayers.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Men of the Great Assembly (c. 4th century B.C.E.), formalized the prayer service that has been in use until today.</i> The same holds true of the performance of the commandments.<br>And yet, every Jew must partake of these three aspects, because the physical act of the commandment creates a garment for the soul in the lower Gan Eden,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gan Eden literally means “the Garden of Eden,” but refers here to the spiritual dimension to which the soul ascends after death. According to Kabbalah, when the soul leaves the physical body, it enters a spiritual body, called the “Garment of the Rabbis,” that is formed of all the good deeds and mitzvos that the person performed during life. And just as a living person has a physical and a spiritual side, an outer and inner dimension, so the soul after death has an outer dimension, the “Garment of the Rabbis,” and an inner dimension, that was formed by the intention he or she put into the performance of the mitzvos in this world. Furthermore, as the soul continues to ascend after death, the inner dimensions become externalized to become outer garments, and new inner dimensions become revealed. See R. Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin, <i>Tzidkas HaTzaddik</i> 155.</i> and the intention put in the commandment creates a garment for the soul in the upper Gan Eden.<br>The answer, then, is to include oneself and ones intentions – be it in prayer or in the performance of commandments, in one’s weekday meals, and all the more so, in the three meals of Shabbat – with the “perfectly faithful of Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Tzaddikim.</i> who know the inner meaning of the prayers and the commandments, following those of the Men of the Great Assembly. This is the meaning of the Arizal’s statement that one should precede each prayer with the words: “I hereby accept upon myself the positive commandment to love your fellow as yourself.’” Then one includes one’s own prayers with those who know how to unite the supernal attributes.
Now, in building the Tabernacle [in the desert], their thoughts were focused on building the Supernal Tabernacle, as the verse says: “And the Tabernacle was erected” (Exodus 40:17) – that is, when the Tabernacle below was erected, so was the Tabernacle above.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Sisa</i> 18; Zohar 2:240a.</i> And while their thoughts and intentions were carried out in the physical world below, they had in mind the spiritual world, to build the Tabernacle above, which is the secret of the creation of heaven and earth and all the worlds. However, not every mind can grasp this. Therefore, after the construction of each vessel of the Tabernacle, the people clearly stated that they were doing it according to the inner intention that G‑d commanded Moses.<br>This is also as we say [before the performance of each mitzvah]: “May the pleasantness of the L-rd our G‑d be upon us, and establish the work of our hands, and establish the work of our hands” (Psalms 90:17).<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, Introduction, p.8-9

<b>And he shall split the bird apart by its wings without tearing it completely in half. And the priest shall then burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, a fire offering that is a pleasing fragrance to G‑d.</b> (Leviticus 1:17)<br>It says concerning a bird [offering] “a pleasant fragrance,” and by a beast [offering] “a pleasant fragrance” (ibid. 1:9). This teaches you that while one person does a lot and another a little, the main thing is for their hearts to be directed to G‑d.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachos</i> 110a, quoted also in Rashi on Leviticus 1:17.</i><br>I heard from my teacher an answer to the <i>Turei Zahav’s</i> question: “Why are they comparable in their intention?”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Commentary Turei Zahav </i>#3, on <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim</i> 1:4. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> states: “Better are fewer supplications with concentration, than many without concentration.” This is based upon the Talmud’s statement: “One person prays a lot, and one prays a little, etc.” on which the <i>Turei Zahav</i> asks: “If a person can pray with more concentration why is he equal to someone who can pray with less?"</i> He explained that a person must study and pray with expanded consciousness,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Mochin</i>,” literally, Mentalities.</i> whereas, on the other hand…<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The author does not finish his sentence.

<b>Do not make any meal offering that is sacrificed to G‑d out of leavened dough; for no leaven and no honey shall be burned as a fire offering to G‑d.</b> (ibid. 2:11)
The inner meaning of leaven and honey is pride, which rises up, like the arrogance that inflates a person’s heart. These are the Judgments of smallness-mindedness, for a child wants to be big, and a small person jumps to the lead.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megilah</i> 12b.</i> About this, the verse says, “for no leaven and no honey shall be burned as a fire offering to G‑d” – meaning, do not serve Him with arrogance; rather, with “your first offerings.” That is, only when you begin to draw close to G‑d can be done amidst haughtiness. Afterward, do not offer it as a sweet fragrance on the Supernal altar. For G‑d does not take pleasure in pride. “The proud in heart are all an abomination to G‑d” (Proverbs 16:5), on which our Rabbis commented: “even a little bit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. even a little bit of arrogance. <i>Sotah</i> 5a.</i><br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 18b

<b>If the anointed priest commits an [inadvertent] violation, bringing guilt to his people, the sacrifice for his violation shall be an unblemished young bull as a sin offering to G‑d.</b> (ibid. 4:3)<br>Once there was a king whose son was sent to a far away place, and his father was unable to bring him back. Finally, one of the ministers took off his royal raiment and dressed like a peasant in order to join the prince, who had himself become a peasant.
The meaning of the parable is obvious. The “raiment” is our good deeds, as the verse says: “At all times, may your garments be white” (Ecclesiastes 9:8). The “peasant’s garb” are like soiled garments, though they are not really. This is as is written: “If the anointed priest commits an [inadvertent] violation, bringing guilt to his people.” For the generation and its leaders share a single root, as was the case of Moses and his generation. Thus, the leaders are appropriate to the generation, and the generation appropriate to the leaders.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Archin</i> 17a.</i> In this case, too, the sins of the people caused the leader of the generation to sin. But then, when the leader descends to their level and puts on the lowly garment of the generation, he finds a point that unites them.<br>May the coming generations learn from this a great way to serve G‑d.<br>I received this teaching from my Master orally, and it is impossible to explain it in writing. Understand it!<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 137c

Comment 1

It is said that whoever studies the laws of the burnt offering is considered to have actually offered it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Menachos</i> 110a.</i> [This is because] when a person develops an original insight into the [words of] Torah, he imbues those words with consciousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov uses the Kabbalistic term <i>Mochin</i>, which literally means “brains,” but has the connotation of states of consciousness, such as <i>Mochin d’Gadlus –</i> expanded consciousness, and <i>Mochin d’Katnus –</i> constricted consciousness.</i> Whereas, at first, the consciousness was hidden and enclothed in the words, he now divests it of its garments, and it becomes revealed and expanded. These are the “Ornaments of the Bride.” Likewise, when a person speaks words of Torah with fear and love [of G-d], he imbues the words with consciousness.<br>[Therefore], whoever studies the laws of the burnt offering is considered to have offered it, for by cleaving to the words with fear and love, one gives them new life. Even though they have been damaged by sin, they are still the garments of the King.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The intention of this statement is not clear, and the words are not included in the version of this teaching found in <i>Keter Shem Tov</i>, par. 193. However, the Baal Shem Tov may mean that even though the Temple and sacrificial order has been destroyed due to the sins of the Jewish people, the words of Torah that correspond to these mitzvos remain. They are like a garment that covers the essential spiritual energy of the sacrifices, and allows us to add vitality to that energy when we recite the words properly. When the Temple actually stood, however, and the sacrifices were offered, vitality was drawn into the physical world itself, as the Baal Shem Tov explains further.</i> However, when the Holy Temple stood, and the [priests] would offer the burnt offering, they would enliven even the physical world.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “the world of action.”</i><br><i>Likutey Amorim</i> 32

<b>This is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one may offer to the L-rd. If he offers it for a thanksgiving. . .</b> (Leviticus 7:11-12)<br>At times, a person can draw down goodness by speaking words. For instance, a person in captivity should speak about the four who need to give thanks.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud (<i>Berachos</i> 54b) speaks about four instances in which a person must give thanks. This is based upon Psalm 107, and is expressed in Jewish Law in the blessing “<i>HaGomel</i>.” Among the four is the person who is freed from captivity: “Those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron . . . He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder” (Psalm 107:10,14).</i> And if he is sick, he should speak about the supernal sefirot that correspond to the organ that is ailing.<br><i>Keter Shem Tov</i> 2, p. 4a

Comment 3

<b>If he offers it for a thanksgiving. . .</b><br>This is what the verse says: “A fool explains his sin” (Proverbs 14:9). Rabbi Yuden said, “This fool has to explicate his sins with his mouth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9:2.</i><br>The Baal Shem Tov often taught that a person who sins by night will inevitably tell people what he did the next day. However, they may not understand what he is saying, and he himself will be unaware as to what his own words testify.<br>Once, the Baal Shem Tov was traveling with his disciples [by wagon]. “You should know,” he said, “that last night, this wagon driver slept with his wife who is in <i>nidah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ritual impurity. The Torah forbids marital relations during and slightly after a woman’s menstrual cycle. Furthermore, even after the conclusion of her period, she must immerse in a <i>mikvah</i> – a ritual pool or body of water – before she can be with her husband. The Baal Shem Tov knew this through his divine inspiration.</i> The disciples were surprised. “We didn’t hear even a suggestion of this the entire day,” they replied. Immediately, they started to pay closer attention to everything the wagon driver said for the rest of the day.<br>It was almost sundown, and they stopped at a roadside inn. The wagon driver jumped from the wagon and entered the house, and they followed him to hear what he would say and imply. “Sell me some vodka,” they heard him say to the innkeeper. The innkeeper poured him a cup, and gave it to him. He was about to drink it, when the innkeeper said, “Wait! I will give you another cup, because that one wasn’t immersed [in a mikvah].”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">All vessels that a Jew acquires from a Gentile must also be immersed in a <i>mikvah </i>before they may be used. See Numbers 31:23.</i> “So what if it wasn’t immersed?” the wagon-driver answered him. <br>When the disciples heard this, they rejoiced and praised G-d, for they saw that He shares His wisdom with His Tzaddikim and those who fear Him.

<b>And Moses said: This is the thing which the L‑rd commanded that you should do, so that the glory of the L‑rd may appear to you.</b> (Leviticus 9:6)<br>Moses said to Israel, “Remove that evil inclination from your hearts, so that you should all have one [feeling of] awe, and be of one mind in serving G‑d. Just as He is singular in the world, so you should be singular worship of Him.”<br><i>Midrash Sifra</i>, on this verse<br>The fundamental principle is that a person should always have only one thought in mind when it comes to serving G‑d, as it is written: “G‑d has made it so that men should fear before Him” (Ecclesiastes 3:14), yet “they sought out many complications.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From Ecclesiastes 7:29: “G‑d made man straight, but they sought out many complications.” The implication is that one does not require complexity in the service of G‑d, but rather direct, pure-hearted intention.</i> For too many thoughts will make one confused. [Rather], one should constantly imagine that everything in the world is filled with the Creator, as it is said: “Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the L‑rd” (Jeremiah 23:24). Even the outcome of our own plans and intentions are from G‑d. The most insignificant acts are under His direction.<br>You should think that everything, whether is it the World of the Firmaments, the World of Angels, or of the Throne<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Various supernal worlds, according to Kabbalah.</i> is as nothing compared to Him, for all of them exist within the space emptied of His light, from where He removed Himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the teaching of the Arizal, that at the beginning of creation, G‑d “withdrew” Himself, and left an empty space in the middle of His Infinite Being into which to emanate a creation. Whether the “empty space” is to be taken literally or not has been a subject of debate among Kabbalists for centuries. Chasidus teaches that the “empty space,” is only a concealment of G‑d’s ever-Presence. Thus, the Baal Shem Tov stresses that G‑d can be found everywhere, even in the most mundane activities.</i> and where He created everything with a single word. Why should you desire anything that is in those worlds? It is no more than one of His words! Better to cleave to the Creator, who is beyond the worlds, for He is the main thing, rather than to attach yourself to something [worldly, which is] secondary. This is what the Zohar means, when it says: “Fortunate are those righteous ones, who know how to direct their wishes to the Holy, Supernal King, and not to worldly things and transient desires.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 2:134b.</i> For in the end, the worlds will ultimately be destroyed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is based upon an opinion in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 97a) that the world will only exist for six millennia and revert to nothingness in the seventh.</i> Rather, you should constantly think about G‑d, and attach yourself to Him with absolute love, far beyond [the love of] things of this world, for everything good in the world is rooted in Him.
You should think, “I want to always give joy to Him, and serve Him constantly.” Your thoughts should always be attached to the supernal worlds, in Him, may He be blessed. This is alluded to in the verse: “And from the door of the Sanctuary, he should not go out” (Leviticus 8:33). And when you must speak about mundane things, imagine that you are going down from the supernal world, like a person who leaves his house with the intention to return. Even as he leaves, he is thinking “When will I return?” Likewise, your thoughts should always be in the Supernal world, for that is G‑d’s main house. Even when you discuss matters of this world, you should immediately reattach your thoughts to their original place. This is what David [meant, when he] said to his son Solomon: “I am going the way of all the earth” (I Kings 2:2) – he was like a person going on a trip, whose thoughts and desires urge him to return to his home as soon as he can.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i> p. 9b

Comment 2

This can be compared to a winter frost. If the ice on a river is thick at first, and then thins out, one can still cross the river, for the ice remains very strong. However, if we see that the ice is thin and weak, it is a sign that it was never [thick and] strong to begin with.<br>Likewise, if we see a person who serves G‑d only occasionally, it is certain that he has never yet served Him properly, for had he served G‑d properly even once, he would serve Him always.<br><i>Ibid. </i>p.14a

Comment 3

Sometimes, a person must look around in order to attach his thoughts to G-d, because his physicality is a block to the soul. 

Comment 4

First cleave to G‑d, and then attend to some household matter, or do or say something in that state of cleaving, even if you don’t need to. This will accustom you to maintain your attachment to G‑d even when you are involved in material pursuits. This is a fundamental principle.<br><i>Ibid.</i> p. 9a

<b>And Moses said: This is the thing which the L-rd commanded that you should do, so that the glory of the L-rd may appear to you.</b> (Leviticus 9:6)<br>Do not look into other people’s faces, even when you speak with them. For if their thoughts are not constantly attached to G‑d, you will blemish your soul. However, you should definitely look into the faces of righteous people whose thoughts are attached to G‑d, for this will bring holiness to your soul.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 6b<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See, also, <i>Hanhagos Ye</i><i>sharos</i>, p. 12a.</i>

Comment 6

<b>Send out Your light and Your truth, they will lead me.</b> (Psalms 43:3)<br>Constantly imagine that the Divine Presence, whose glory fills the world, is guiding your thoughts from below to above with great force. Break through the heavens with your thoughts, as though they are open before you, and enter into the world of Yetzirah, of Beriyah, and then of Atzilus. Descend and ascend in your thoughts many times, for the descent is in order to ascend, and by going down, you gather the strength to rise again to a lofty place. This is like throwing a stone; the further you lower your hand, the higher it will be thrown.
When you rise in your thoughts to the world of Asiyah or Yetzirah, imagine that you are speaking in that world, and that your words leave your mouth in that world. Imagine that the Tetragrammaton is across from you there, in the ten Sefiros, which are infinite in their greatness. And the more you ascend, imagine that you are drawing closer to G‑d in a high place, as the Zohar says: “The foot of the King can be compared to the head of the King.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar</i> 2:82a.</i><br>Indeed, the entire day, not just during prayer, you should be constantly ascending in your thoughts above. It requires a lot of effort to attach your thoughts above, and you should strengthen yourself with all of your might.<br>At first, though you are able to ascent to a lofty place, do not rise beyond the world of Asiyah to rectify things there. Afterward, [you can rise] to the world of Yetzirah, to Beriyah, and then to Atzilus. You should take this as a fundamental principle.<br><i>Hanhagos Yesharos</i>, p. 12b<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See, also, <i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, II:2c; <i>Likutey Tehilim</i>, at the end of <i>Ohr Torah</i>, p. 44d.</i>

Just because he was chosen doesn’t mean that he should not be ashamed. Rather, I heard from my grandfather [the Baal Shem Tov] this explanation: [Moses said,] “You were chosen <i>because </i>you feel fear and shame before G‑d,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is, when Moses said, “You were chosen for this,” he meant, “You where chosen <i>because</i> of this.”</i> for “The sacrifices of G‑d are a broken spirit” (Psalms 51:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., because Aharon was humble, he merited offering sacrifices to G-d.</i><br>This idea has also been mentioned in the writings of the Arizal.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Arizal writes (<i>Likutey Torah</i> on this verse): “Because you have the qualities of humility and shame, you were chosen over your fellows to be the Kohen.” R.

<b>And the L-rd spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a woman gives seed, and bears a male child . . .</b> (Leviticus 12:1-2)<br>The Sages said: “When a woman emits seed first, she will conceive a male child.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nidah</i> 31a. According to the Talmud, both men and women emit seed during coitus. If the woman emits seed first, the child will be a boy. If the man emits seed first, the child will be a girl.</i> That is, there are two levels of [spiritual] awakening. In one case, a person takes the initiative to repent or perform some good deed, and afterward, receives help from Above, as it is said: “When a person comes to purify himself, they help him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 38b.</i> In the second case, a person does not think of repenting or doing good unless they arouse him first from Above. Only then does he become motivated to repent.<br>The difference between these two forms of arousal is alluded to in the verse: “If a woman gives seed, and bears a male child” – which is Compassion, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is based upon the Kabbalistic principle that there are two basic spiritual forces at work in the universe: love-compassion versus severity-judgment. These forces are also defined in terms of lights and vessels, expansion and contraction, upper and lower worlds. Masculine energy is considered expansive, whereas feminine energy is contractive, in that it forms a vessel to hold the light. Both must work in conjunction to create a harmonious balance in the Sefirot and in the Worlds (thus forming a third principle of <i>Tiferet </i>– Harmony). When we engender a relationship with G-d through our proper actions, then the “woman” – i.e. this world – takes an active role, and engenders the “birth” of a corresponding flow of compassion from Above, a “male child.” However, when an influx of spiritual light reaches us spontaneously, without our participation, then we are merely receivers, which is the aspect of severity and judgment, and the light that reaches us reflects these qualities as well.<br>R. Yaakov Meir Shechter, a contemporary Jerusalem kabbalist, explains this differently. When a person initiates the relationship with G-d, he deserves any illumination that he receives. However, when the illumination reaches him spontaneously, then heaven judges him to see what he did, or what he will do, to deserve such a gift.</i> That is, if the lower arousal, which is “Feminine Waters,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Feminine Waters, <i>Mayin Nukvin</i>, means all those actions that we take the initiative to perform, and that rise up from this lower world to engender a corresponding outflow – Masculine Waters, <i>Mayin D’churin</i> – from the upper worlds.</i> comes first, then the “Masculine Waters” – Compassion – will descend from above. But if the opposite occurs, the result will be Strict Judgments.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, <i>Derush l’Shabbos Teshuva</i>, p. 230

Comment 2

I heard from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov), that a person must strengthen himself before prayer, so that he will have the clarity of mind to at least pray without extraneous thoughts, or [ideally] with <i>devekut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Spiritual cleaving to G-d.</i> This can be accomplished by first reciting psalms or studying Torah, which will give one clarity of consciousness.<br>There are some people, however, who will lose their consciousness by reciting too many psalms or studying too much Torah before prayers. This is what is written: “One may do a lot and another a little, as long as their intention is for the sake of Heaven”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Menachos</i> 110.</i> – that is, [as long as they intend] to attain the proper consciousness for prayer, they are equal . . .<br>When a person seeks ways to arouse himself in prayer, it is called “male” – masculine consciousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Because the worshiper initiates the relationship with the Divine, he consciousness and the corresponding down flow is considered masculine, as explained above</i> On the other hand, sometimes they arouse him from Above, such as when he spontaneously begins to cry [in his prayers]. This is called “woman” – feminine consciousness. Then, G-d forbid, “his prayer will be turned into sin” (Psalms 109:7).<br>The solution is to tremble at the realization that he did not arouse himself in the first place, but needed to be awoken from above; he should cry over the first crying. Then the “female waters” will be converted to “male waters,” and become masculine.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is, by adding more emotion and fervor to the prayers than one receives from Above, one again assumes the role of the initiator, which is masculine, and engenders an outflow of kindness.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, <i>Tazria</i>, p. 92a

A very tall man was standing in the sun, being scorched by its rays. A wise man saw from afar that the tall man was very hot, and did not know how to help himself – to cool himself down with “cold water on a weary soul.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 25:25.</i> What did he do? He sat in front of him and sipped water from a bottle, hoping that [the tall man] would see him and do likewise. The man with the bottle was very short, however, and that the tall man had to bend down his head and body in order to take a little water for himself. But because of his arrogance and his stature, he refused to lower himself – as if to show that he needed someone else!<br>The wise man understood this, and could find no way to get him to take a little water. Finally, he had to throw some water up into the [tall] man’s face. Perhaps then he would drink a little and quench his thirst. However, the tall man pressed his lips together, so that not even a drop of water should go in, for that wasn’t in keeping with his prestige. The water fell back into the mouth of the one who threw it, and as for the one who refused to drink, he died of thirst.<br>The allusion is to a great city, full of scholars and scribes, who refuse to hear wisdom and accept guidance on how to follow the way of G-d, until they pass on from [the city] and the generation, and leave the generation orphaned. Thus, it is written: “Hear and your souls shall live” (Isaiah 55:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This chapter from Isaiah begins: “Ho, every one that thirsts, come for water; and he that has no money, come, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

As for a person who refuses to hear admonition, it is said: “The foolish despise wisdom and reproof” (Proverbs 1:7).<br><i>Tzora’as </i>strikes a person because he lifts himself up like a cedar, and refuses to accept criticism.

This explains the Mishnah: “Who is wise? He who learns from all men”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 4:1.</i> – even from the wicked.

If he did not have it in him, he would never see it in another.</i> He must remove that little bit [of sin] from within himself, which will purify the other man as well. Thus, “This is the Law of ‘one who removes evil’ from his friend,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The author is making a play on words, by dividing the word <i>metzorah</i> into two words – <i>motzi ra</i>, removing evil.</i> on the day of his own cleansing.” It seems to me that I heard something similar from my Master.<br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p.26d

I heard a parable from my Master. A certain king sought a drug that would enable him to live forever. The “medicine” he was given was to distance himself from pride.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is not merely a metaphor, for the humbler a person is before G-d, the more he becomes attached to the Divine and partakes of G-d’s essence. He can attain an aspect of eternal life, which derives from G-d’s own eternal nature. See Likutey Moharan I:21 for an expansion of this idea.</i> However, the more humble he acted, the prouder he became – for he was such a great king, and so humble too! Finally, his teacher came and taught him how to act outwardly like royalty, but humbly within, for he showed him [that he needed to use] the toilet, like other men.
I also heard an explanation of the verse: “G-d is King, He is clothed in pride” (Psalms 93:1). But isn’t pride a despicable character trait? Rather, for the sake of running the kingdom, He needs a garment of pride.<br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 3c

Comment 3

My grandfather [the Baal Shem Tov] raised a question. The verse says: “G-d is King, he is clothed in pride,” yet it is written: “In every place you find the greatness of the Holy One, there you find His humility.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megilah</i> 31a.</i> Where is His humility alluded to here (in the verse from Psalms)?<br>The answer is that only the clothing is pride; in His inner essence, you find His humility.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">G-d’s essence is described as “humble” because it is beyond all perception and limitation, just as a truly humble person makes no statement about himself, and is, in a sense, invisible. However, G-d created a “garment” of pride; that is, the created world that allows for a manifestation of divinity. Thus, the Baal Shem Tov reverses the meaning of this Talmudic statement. According to the simple meaning, G-d’s greatness refers to His transcendence: “Thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place…” (Isaiah 57:15), whereas His humility refers to His lowering Himself to show concern for the creation: “[and I dwell] also with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (ibid.). However, to the Baal Shem Tov, G-d’s “greatness” is His manifestation in creation, whereas His “humility,” is His essence, which transcends creation entirely and cannot be perceived. See Likutey Moharan I:4 for a similar explanation.</i><br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, Purim

Comment 4

I heard a parable from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) concerning the trait of humility versus that of pride. There was once a king who had two sons. He sent one of them away to another country amidst great honor, whereas the other one he sent in shame. But this was to teach him humility. In the end, the second brother conquered more lands with his humility than the first brother did through the glory of war.<br>This is based upon a true story.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 109b

Comment 9

Do not imagine that you are more important than your fellow man, or that you serve G-d with deeper attachment. For you are like every other creature, that was created for the goal of serving G-d. G-d grants your friend intelligence just as He gives it to you. Are you any better than a worm, which serves the Creator with all its brains and capacity? A human being is also a worm, as it says: “I am a worm and not a man” (Psalms 25:7). If G-d did not grant you intelligence, you would not be able to serve Him any better than a worm. Therefore, Above, you are no more important that a worm, and all the more so, not more than other people. You should think that you, the worm, and the other small creatures are all like companions in the world, for you all are created beings, and not one has any ability beyond what G-d gives him.<br>This idea should be in your thoughts always.<br><i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 2b

Comment 10

I heard from my Master an all-encompassing moral principle: If you want to belittle any creature or person, belittle yourself, and if you want to praise any person, praise G-d more.
Though these words are self-explanatory, I would like to offer one reason. I already explained the verse: “I have set G-d opposite me<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kenegdi</i> – usually translated as “before me.”</i> always” (Psalms 16:8), as meaning that even when things go opposite your will, if you lose time from Torah study or prayer, or if you see something offensive in your friend, you should bear in mind that this is from G-d for your own benefit, in order that you amend your ways.<br>I heard this great principle from my Master, that no perturbance should ever upset you. For a person imagines that the whole world was created for him. And were he alone in the world, he would think that he was a tzaddik, upright, pious and devoted. But now that he sees something objectionable in his friend, he understands that he shares in this trait. Thus, if he wants to disparage another person, he should belittle himself. Thus, you fulfill the main tenet of the Torah: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<br>The opposite is true when it comes to giving praise. All praise goes to G-d, as it says: “Who preceded Me, and I will pay him?” (Job 41:3). This is the inner meaning of “L-rd, open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Your praise” (Psalms 51:17). For all praise due to human beings is really due to him.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 33a

<b>And G-d spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aharon…</b> (Leviticus 16:1)<br>The Zohar explains that the two sons of Aharon were “two halves of a body” – <i>Netzach </i>and <i>Hod</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 3:57b. The Sefirot of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> parallel one another on the Tree of the Sefirot (corresponding to the right and left thighs on a human being). Kabbalistic texts often speak of them as one aspect – two sides of the body – the must always operate in conjunction.</i> I received from my Master [the Baal Shem Tov] that they are the “Two Supporters of Truth,” the aspect of Faith and Devekut, as I wrote elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov explains that the process of mystical cleaving to G-d involves the uplifting of the lowest Sefirah – <i>Malkhut</i> – and its attachment to the Sefirah of Tiferet. This attachment is accomplished through the Sefirot of <i>Yesod</i> – represented by the Tzaddik – and the Sefirot of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod.</i> Each Sefirah embodies a different characteristic: <i>Malchut</i> corresponds to Faith, while <i>Tiferet</i> corresponds to Truth. <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> are called the “Supporters of Truth.” Both faith and mystical experience share the characteristic of being beyond the intellect. However, for faith to become mystical experience, it must first be purified through a revelation of the truth of G-d’s existence.

Comment 2

<b>With this shall Aharon enter the Sanctuary…</b> (ibid. 16:3)<br> That is, for the sake of a higher purpose, to raise the lower level to the higher one. This is the meaning of “With this shall Aharon enter the Sanctuary.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Zohar, the word “this” – <i>zot</i> – refers to the Shechina, the Divine Presence (corresponding to the Sefirah of <i>Malchus</i>). In this case, the Baal Shem Tov uses it as a reference to the common folk, who are also on the lowest level.</i> <br>However, in order to uplift it, one must first descend to that level, as in the parable of the king’s minister who exchanged his beautiful garments for those of the commoner in order to return the prince to his father. Because the “inner man,” are the “perfectly faithful of Israel,” whereas the “garments of man” are the masses, who are on the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov compares the entire congregation of Israel to a man and his garments. The body of this “man” are the Righteous, who believe in and serve G-d with complete faith. The common folk are compared to the garments.</i> This is the meaning of “a woman shall surround a man” (Jeremiah 31:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In Kabbalah, the concept of man and woman, or masculine and feminine, correspond to the concepts of lights and vessels, giver and receiver, or inner and outer. (Of course, these are only general categories that cannot be applied wholesale to individuals.) The Baal Shem Tov reads the verse from Jeremiah as referring to the quality of the female surrounding – i.e., containing within her – the masculine, for every vessels contains light within it.</i> A person must divest himself of the level and aspect of the “inner man,” and descend to the level of the garments, which are external. This is in order to be on their level, in order to uplift him. <br>Thus, we explained the Talmud’s statement: “One who is himself not obligated in a mitzvah cannot exempt the public from their obligation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rosh Hashana 29a. The Talmud’s discussion revolves around the mitzvah of blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashana. It concludes that only a person who is himself obligated to hear the shofar can blow it for others, as opposed to a slave or a non-Jew, who are exempt from the mitzvah. In this context, the Baal Shem Tov means that a Tzaddik can only elevate the masses if he has some connection to their level. <br></i> And as we explained the statement from the Jerusalem Talmud: “Samuel the Prophet wore the garment of Israel, when he said, ‘We have sinned…’” (I Samuel 7:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem Talmud, Ta’anis 2:7.</i> That is, he descended to the level of the garment, which are the masses, and said, “<i>We</i> have sinned.”<br> <i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Metzorah</i>, p. 33d

Comment 3

It is known that the main purpose of all of our service of G-d, be it Torah study, prayer, the mystical intentions of mitzvos or of eating, is in order to sort out and uplift the sparks of holiness from the depths of the impure shells. This is reflected on the human level when “men of substance” are uplifted to the level of “form.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov is applying the classic philosophical distinction between substance and form, or matter and spirit (<i>chomer</i> and <i>tzurah</i>), to human beings.

Comment 6

I heard that the Baal Shem Tov would draw even sinners close to him, as long as they were not arrogant, and would push away Torah scholars, who were not sinners, if they were arrogant. “When a person is a sinner and knows it,” he said, “and is therefore humbled, G-d is with him; for He ‘dwells with them amidst their impurity.’ However, this other one, though not a sinner, is arrogant, and G-d is not with him, for ‘He and I cannot dwell in the same world.’”<br><i>Pri Chaim, Avos</i> 4:4

Each prophet beheld his prophecy in [a different] limb of the King.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although G‑d, in His essence, transcends all form and likeness, Jewish texts from the Bible onward, nevertheless depict Him through various representations. Chasidic texts explain that these descriptions refer to manifestations of G‑d within the mind’s eye of His creation. For created beings can only perceive through the lens of their own particular nature. Furthermore, the human form is understood to be the archetype upon which G‑d based all the supernal worlds. Thus, to state that a prophet received his prophecy from “the head of the King,” does not mean from the Infinite G‑d Himself, but by way of that level of manifestation (in creation and in the consciousness) that corresponds to the “head” – i.e. the upper level of the supernal archetype. The Baal Shem Tov is making a further point that a direct connection exists between the human form and actions and the workings of the supernal worlds. Whatever we do below initiates a similar movement above. R. Moshe Cordovero, in <i>Tomer Devorah</i>, explained the nature of our deeds in a similar fashion.</i> Each one according to a known limb, and not more. Some in the head of the King, some in the hairs of the head, which are the stars and constellations beyond number, some in the eyes, some in the ears, some in the face, some in the nose, or in the mouth or neck, some in the hands in the body, in the thighs and in the phallus, some in the garments of the King, for they did not have permission to gaze beyond.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tikunei Zohar</i>, <i>Tikun</i> 18, p. 32a</i><br>That is, some commandments depend upon the hand and some upon the head, such as phylacteries and love and fear of G‑d. By fulfilling them, a person arouses the head of the King and the hand of the King Above. The same applies to all the commandments, for an “arousal from below” initiates an “arousal from above.”<br><i>Likutim Yikarim</i>, p. 3d

The first thing is to remove all trace of self-interest from your service of G‑d. But this requires profound insight, and you must keep it constantly in mind.

Comment 12

<b>You shall keep My decrees and laws, which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am the L‑rd.</b> (Leviticus 18:5) Why does a person not feel heavy after chatting idly [but does so after studying Torah]? Because idle speech adds no life to the body, for it lacks all vitality. But when a person studies Torah in fear and love, his body receives enormous vitality and becomes weightier than before. This makes him feel heavy, just like after a big meal, due to the vitality that his body received from the food. <br><i>Likutim Yikarim</i>, p. 5c

He only did it because his passions overcame him, and he has a coarse physical nature, or he doesn’t realize the seriousness of the crime. [You should think] these and similar thoughts. Then, you also save yourself from judgment; for seeing this low thing in your friend should make you realize that you share a similar trait, and that there are Judgments and Accusations upon you, as well. When your can judge your friend favorably, you will likewise be judged. By not arousing judgment upon a sinner, who is overcome by his desires, you fulfill the verse: “You shall not incline the judgment of your poor in his dispute” (Exodus 23:6). When trials and conflicts overwhelm him,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when he struggles against his own evil inclination.</i> from the “waters of dispute”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From Numbers 20:13.</i> – evil, malicious waters – you should arouse favorable judgments upon him.
Really, this is all a great test. For a person is never sentenced for his crimes until he first passes judgment upon himself.

Alternatively, the Midrash that cites this verse (Vayikra Rabbah 26:4), speaks of the day and night as “borrowing” from each other throughout the year. The long summer days borrow hours from the night, and the long summer nights borrow hours from the day. Only on the spring and autumn equinoxes are day and night equal. This is in order to prove to people that there is always time to study Torah.</i><br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 127c

<b>“Day to day utters speech…”</b><br>That is, each day boasts to its friend about the deeds that the Tzaddik did on it.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“The days speak and boast. One says, ‘The Tzaddik did this thing on me!” and the other one says, ‘The Tzaddik did this thing on me!’” (<i>Divrei Shalom, Derash l’Purim</i>). The Maggid of Mezritch explains that the entire creation exists only for the sake of human beings, to become uplifted through their service of G-d. When a Tzaddik – a fully realized human being – serves G-d, he justifies the creation of that day, which then “boasts” of the goodness that was performed on it. The Maggid tells the parable of a king who sends his generals to battle, with their lieutenants and troops. After the battle is won, each general praises his lieutenant’s wisdom. (<i>Rimzei Torah </i>207).

<b>And the L-rd said to Moses: Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people.</b> (Leviticus ibid.)<br>“‘Speak . . . and say’ – to warn the adults on account of the children”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, the “big ones on account of the small ones” – <i>gedolim al haketanim.</i> The double use of the verb “to say” in this verse implies that two groups of individuals are being addressed. Thus Rashi, based upon <i>Yevamos</i> 114a, writes that even the children of the priests, too young to be obligated in other commandments, are still forbidden to become ritually impure, with the obligation to keep them pure resting on their parents.</i> (Rashi).<br>This is the secret of the “Great Light” and the “Small Light.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“And G-d made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars” (Genesis 1:16). According to Kabbalah, these represent the Sefirot of Tiferet and Malchut, respectively. Malchut, which corresponds to this world, was originally created as a “great light,” as the beginning of this verse implies. However, due to a necessary flaw in the process of creation, its connection with Tiferet was severed, and its light was reduced. When Malchut ascends and reunites with Tiferet, as it will in the World to Come, then it will again become a “great light,” and the world will reach perfection. These two Sefirot are also represented by the Divine Names “Y-H-V-H” (the Tetragrammaton) and “Ado-nai,” which literally means “L-rd,” and reflecting the nature of Malchut as the setting for the revelation of G-d’s Kingdom.</i> The “small ones” are the mystery of “hearing” and “receiving,” because they listen to the “big ones.” If they form a union between [G-d’s Names] Ado-nai and Y-H-V-H, which is the “bestower,” then they become two great lights, when they are bound as one. This is the meaning of “I will give peace in the land” (Leviticus 26:6), for through this union, there is peace in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">“Land” corresponds to the Sefirah of Malchut. When Malchut is united with Tiferet, it transcends the apparent duality of this world, and reveals G-d’s Oneness.

This is accomplished by the Tzaddik, who is himself called “Peace,” as in: “Behold, I give him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:12). The Tzaddik corresponds to the Sefirah of Yesod that stands in the middle column on the chart of the sefirot, uniting Tiferet and Malchut.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Vayikra</i>

<b>If you follow My statutes . . . I will give your rain in its season” (Leviticus 26:3-4)</b><br>According to its simple meaning, this verse can be explained as follows. The Talmud states: “Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa was traveling on the road. It began to rain. ‘Master of the World! The entire world is comfortable, and Chanina is suffering!’ he said. The rain stopped.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta’anis</i> 24b. The Talmud continues: “When he arrived home, he said, ‘Should the entire world suffer (for loss of rain) and Chanina be at ease?’ It started to rain.”</i> It turns out that the rain stopped for the sake of this Tzaddik. However, “If you follow My statutes” you will all be Tzaddikim. Then the prayers of an individual Tzaddik will be ineffective compared to those of the majority. Then your rain will come in its season.
I heard another question about [R. Chanina’s] statement: “The entire world is comfortable….” Why did he have to say this? He could have put it much more concisely: “Chanina is suffering!” Furthermore, G-d forbid that we should say that he was upset because the whole world was comfortable.
I think that this can be explained with a statement of our Sages: “Every day, a Heavenly Voice issues forth and says, ‘The entire world is sustained on account of (<i>bishvil</i>) My son Chanina, while My son Chanina subsists on a <i>kav</i> of carobs from Friday to Friday.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. A <i>kav</i> is about 2.5 pints.</i> It turns out that Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa was the conduit that channeled blessing to the entire world. This is the meaning of “on account of My son Chanina,” for [<i>shvil</i>] has the meaning of path and conduit.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>bishvil</i>, which means “on account of” can also be read <i>b’shvil</i>, “in the path of.”</i> Just like a pathway through which everything passes, so he transmitted blessing to the world.<br>Thus he said, “The entire world is comfortable,” meaning, “Since their comfort reaches them through my influence, how can there be blessing if I am suffering? It will not be a complete comfort. Perhaps, G-d forbid, the rain will not carry blessing and benevolence due to my pain. And even though he sufficed with a little, as is the way of Tzaddikim, and did not suffer over this at all, in this case, he really was suffering and was unable to bestow complete blessing. He was upset that the world would be ruined. The essence of his prayer was that the rain should stop now, but that when he arrives home, he will be at ease and able to pray that the rain start again (to convey blessing).<br><i>Likutim Yikarim</i>, p. 6d

<b>If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments, I will give you rain in its time, so that the land will yield her produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit.</b> (Leviticus 26:3-4)<br>The stringency (“<i>chomer</i>”) of <i>kodesh</i> over <i>terumah</i> is that we immerse vessels within vessels for <i>terumah</i>, but not for <i>kodesh.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chagigah</i> 20b.</i><br>The main service of G‑d is through <i>devekus</i>, fervent worship, and Torah study done with love and reverence. Through this, a person becomes attached to G‑d, as it were. For the breath of his speech clings to the Supernal Breath, his voice to the Supernal Voice, his words to the Supernal Words, and so too his thoughts. This is as our Rabbis stated, that the Shechinah spoke out of Moses’ throat.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Zo</i><i>har</i> 3:219a.</i> For in his great holiness and attachment to G‑d, he clove to his root and it was as though G‑d Himself spoke his words. His body was purified and he became a “G‑dly man” (Deuteronomy 33:1), as it says: “Remove your shoes” (Exodus 3:5), refering to his physicality.<br>This may be alluded to in the Mishnah: “<i>chomer b’kodesh m’b’terumah</i>.” That is, if you want to purify your physicality (<i>chomereicha</i>)<i> </i>to attain supernal holiness (<i>kodesh</i>), which is the Supernal Thought, you must constantly raise (<i>tarum</i>) your eyes and heart, and purify your thoughts in the thoughts of G‑d with complete devekus and fiery worship. For wherever a person focuses his thoughts, that is where he is. If you practice this constantly, you will ascend to the place of Supernal Thought – to your root, and even your body will be purified in the Supernal Holiness.
Now, it is known that the letters [of speech] are called “vessels,” whereas the vowel marks are the life and soul of the vessels. And whatever a person thinks, he thinks in letters. You also know that if an extraneous thought comes to mind during Torah study or prayer it is not accidental. For everything has its appointed time, as it is written: “Now when the turn of every maiden came to go in to king” (Esther 2:12). This is the spark [of holiness] that is exists in the depths of the impure shells. It is called <i>na’arah</i> (“maiden”), because it is devoid<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Meno’ar</i>, מנוערת, from the same root as <i>na’arah</i>, נערה. Literally meaning, “to be shaken out” – in this case, of all good.</i> of all good, and longs to cling to its root. But you must be fully alert when the moment comes for it to ascend, for the thought comes to you for a reason, in order to be elevated, and if you fail to do so now, then when?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">“If not now, when?” - <i>Pirkei Avos</i> 1:14.</i> This maiden may never have another turn; for, in most cases, the thought relates to the subject of your prayers or your blessings, or the topic that your are studying.
By way of example, when a son tells his father a <i>halacha</i>, the father raises all sorts of objections to divert his son from the correct understanding. This is not to disprove his son, that he err and become confused, G‑d forbid, but rather to sharpen his mind, until he answers all the challenges, and follows the straight and truthful path in deciding the Law. This was the father’s intention and his delight, as it is says: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad” (Proverbs 27:11).<br>The parable stands [for the Tempter – the evil inclination – who sends a person foreign thoughts, but whose real intention is that the person elevate them]. When the foreign thoughts enters the mind, one must be very quick to sanctify them, which is by means of the holy thoughts one thinks about joins with the words one is saying.
This is the meaning of: “We immerse vessels in vessels.” That is, the vessels are the letters of the extraneous thought that are immersed and purified in the vessels of the holy letters. Then, everything will be refined to the level of Supernal Holiness.
And this is the meaning of: “If you walk in My statutes,” which refers to Torah study.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toras Kohanim, Bechukosai</i></i> The verse uses the language of “walk,” as if to say that you should keep walking, not to stand in one place, on one level; rather, ascend from level to level in devekus and fiery passion until you reach the ultimate level and join your thoughts to all the worlds above, like someone who rises from world to world. This is the meaning of the four who entered the Garden,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chagigah</i> 14b. The “Garden” refers to the upper worlds. The four sages were Rabbi Akiva, Ben Zoma, Ben Azai, and Elisha ben Abuya.</i> by means of their great devekus and the pure thoughts. Then, “I will give you rain in its time.” That is, even your physical nature will become pure, and the spark will rise “in its time” – in the time when it can ascend. You will have a extraneous thought so that you merit to elevate its spark. Not like others who have foreign thoughts because their minds are not purified from physicality. But you who walk in my statutes, if a foreign thought comes, you will be able to uplift it.<br<<i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, p.19d

<b>If you do not listen…<i> </i></b>(ibid. 26:14)<br>Every day, a Heavenly Voice issues from Mount Horeb saying, “Woe to the creatures for the disgrace of the Torah.”<br><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 4:2<br>If no one hears this voice, why does it issue forth? Whereas to say that someone hears it goes against our senses, for who can claim to hear the Voice from Above? And even if you find one person who claims to hear it, who would be foolish enough to believe him? What, then, is the purpose of the proclamation if it does not have any effect?<br>The Baal Shem Tov answered as follows (though not with these precise words). The Talmud says: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chanania was once standing before the Caesar. A certain apostate signaled to him with his hand, “You are a nation whose Master has turned His face away from them.” Rabbi Yehoshua signaled back, “His hand is still spread over us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chagiga</i> 5b. The story concludes with the king asking each of them the meaning of their gestures. Rabbi Yehoshua understood the gesture of the apostate, but the apostate did not understand Rabbi Yehoshua. The king said, “A person who does not understand what is being signaled to him should not be making signs before the king,” and he sentenced the apostate to death.</i><br>We need to understand this. Why did they speak in signs and not explicitly. And why does the Talmud tell us this story? Perhaps the message to be gleaned is that the proclamation from Above is not [in the form of] speech, which is physical, for Above, “There is no speech, there are no words.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:4.</i> A proof for this is that kingship on earth reflects the Kingship of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 58a. The Talmud states that from the conduct of earthly monarchies we can discern the workings of the Supernal Kingdom.</i> It is inappropriate for a king to speak at length with his ministers and advisors, only through allusions, as is the custom of the Arab empires today.<br>This is what the Talmud is telling us. The proclamations that issue forth from the King of the World are also in veiled allusions, and a person has to know how to read the signs. They manifest themselves in the thoughts of repentance that come to a person each day, among other things. This is clear to a person with insight, who is not like those of whom it is said: “Be not like a horse or a mule, who has no understanding…”(Psalms 32:9). For whenever a certain fear or panic spreads through the world, it is a sign from above that people should attach themselves to the source of the fear. And when there is a joy in the world, a person should attach himself with joy to the service of G-d, and similar cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Supernal Voice can proclaim many messages. These manifest themselves in the general emotions and concerns of the world. When the message is discerned, one must attach oneself to its supernal source: mortal fears should lead to fear of G-d, material abundance should be exchanged for spiritual bounty.</i><br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Re’eh</i>

Comment 8

If the Heavenly proclamation is discernible, why doesn’t anyone hear it? And if it impossible to hear, why is it proclaimed?<br>Rather, Above is the World of Thought, where “there is no speech, there are no words.” The proclamation occurs in a person’s good thoughts and reflections. There is not a wicked person who does not have good thoughts each day due to this announcement. However, when these good thoughts reach him, he pushes them out of his mind and turns his attention to vacuity. He certainly incriminates himself, for a good treasure was given to him, but he fled from the King.<br>This is like a parable I heard in the name of my Master [ the Baal Shem Tov]. A king had four ministers appointed over his treasury. They stole his money and fled. One of them regretted his action and returned of his own accord. The second one asked a wise man for advice, who convinced him to return. The third arrived at a place where they were judging people for a similar crime, and returned out of fear. And the fourth did not return at all. To the first one who returned by himself, the king gave even greater prestige, since he acted out of his own good judgment. Not so the second one, for had he not met the wise man who advised him, he would never have returned. As for the third, who returned after he saw how people were being judged, the king appointed him [as supervisor] in that place [of judgment], so that he could witness the suffering.<br>My Master said this [third category] applied to him. Understand this!<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Tzav</i> p. 83c

The Heavenly proclamation is [heard] in thought. Thus the word “proclamation” – <i>keruz</i> (כרוז) has the numerical value of 72 + 161, which is the mystery of Father and Mother, [which is] thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to Kabbalah, the upper <i>Sefiros</i> are known as the “Intellects,” because they parallel the intellectual faculties in human beings. They are called <i>Abba </i>and <i>Ima, </i>Father and Mother, because they give birth to the lower worlds (just as thought gives birth to feelings). The numbers 72 and 161 are derived from the way in which the names of G-d corresponding to these Sefiros are spelled out in full. The Y-H-V-H, when spelled out with all <i>yuds</i>, has a total numerical value is 72 – …. This corresponds to the realm of Father, <i>Chochmah</i>, or Wisdom. The Name A-H-Y-H, spelled out with <i>yuds</i>, has a resulting numerical value is 161. This corresponds to the realm of Mother, <i>Binah</i>, or Understanding. The sum of both names is 233, which is the same as the word <i>keruz</i>, proclamation.</i> There is not a wicked person who does not have thoughts of repentance when he hears the proclamation in his mind, because Above, “There is no speech, there are no words,” only in thought.

There are two types of laughter: When a person is on the level that the entire world laughs at him, for “he who departs from evil makes himself ridiculous” (Isaiah 59:15).

<b>Speak unto the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the L-rd, and that soul is guilty. Then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full. . . .</b> (Numbers 5:6) Bereishis 40<br>I heard from my Master that the pleasure of sin comes from the sparks of the Primordial Kings that fell in the Shattering [of the Vessels] into the Bright Shell (<i>Kelipas Nogah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Zohar and Lurianic writings speak of a cataclysmic even at the early stages of the creation called the “Breaking of the Vessels,” or the “Death of the Eight Kings,” based upon the verse from Genesis 36:31: “These are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.” According to this teaching, the light that emanated from the G-dhead to fill the vessels of creation was too strong, and the eight lower Sefiros, from Da’at to Malchus, shattered and fell into the <i>Kelipas Nogah</i>, a realm of creation that stands between the pure and the impure. (See Sefer HaTanya for a full discussion of this level of creation and our relationship to it.) These are the sparks of holiness that are enclothed in and enliven all elements of creation. They are the spiritual root of all physical pleasure, including the pleasure derived from sin. It is the role of human beings to uplift these sparks to their supernal root. This is done through the path of Torah and mitzvos, and in the case of sin, through the act of repentance, as this teaching of the Baal Shem Tov explains.</i>

It is this very spark that causes a person to repent. For when he regrets his sins, he uplifts this spark to the Supernal World, as it is written: “who bears iniquity…” (Exodus 34:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a person who repents literally bears, or lifts up, the sin that he committed and returns the spark of holiness to its source.</i><br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, <i>Terumah </i>3, p. 90b<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The second paragraph in this translation is from <i>Tzava’as HaRivash</i>, p. 19b.</i>

<b>And G‑d spoke to Moses, saying . . . this is the work of the Menorah, beaten work of gold; until its base, and until its flowers, it was beaten work; according to the pattern which G‑d had shown Moses, so he made the Menorah.</b> (Numbers 8:1,4)<br>The Holy One showed him [the Menorah] with His finger, because Moses had difficulty understanding [its construction]. Thus, it is written “<i>This</i> is the work of the Menorah...”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Throughout his commentary on the Torah, Rashi consistently explains the word “this” – <i>zeh</i> – as referring to something visible, that one could point to. See Rashi on Exodus 12:2, ibid. 15:2, I Samuel 14:1.</i><br>Why did Moses have a harder time understanding the construction of the Menorah than of the other vessels of the Tabernacle? Furthermore, G‑d knows what is in a person’s heart. Since he knew that Moses would not be able to understand with words, but only by seeing, why did He tell him in the first place? Why didn’t He just show him the completed Menorah at the outset? Rather, the matter is as follows.<br>The construction of the Tabernacle paralleled the creation of the world, as the Sages said: “Betzalel knew how to combine the letters through which heaven and earth were made.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 55a.

Shneur Zalman of Liadi (printed in <i>Sefer HaTanya</i>).</i> This implies by this is that they needed to know the letter combinations of the creation in order to construct the Tabernacle.<br>Now, there are Ten Utterances in the work of creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to tradition, G‑d said, “Let there be...” ten times in the story of creation.

For to G‑d, each Utterance is an outflow from Him that is revealed to the creation – similar to a person whose words reveal his innermost thoughts to others. However, the work of the Menorah corresponded to the first Utterance of creation, in which [the words] “And He said” were unstated, for it is not revealed to creation. Therefore, Moses had difficulty understanding a verbal description of the Menorah’s construction. Because, the Creator wanted Moses to realize the correspondence between the Menorah and the first Utterance, in which the words “And He said” were not explicitly stated, being unrevealed to creation. Therefore, G-d explained it to him in words, which he did not understand. Then Moses realized that it corresponded to the first the Utterance of creation.<br><i>Bnei Yissaschar, </i>in the name of the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov<i>, Chodesh Kislev-Teves </i>4:49

All the [evil traits] that Balaam had, Moses was suspected of having as well. For as long as the ascension of the Shechinah is not complete, as it will be in the Messianic Era, when the impure shells will be annulled and G-d will swallow up death forever (Isaiah 25:8), all the elevations can only occur in the mind of an upright individual. And an upright individual can only reach and ascend to his root by means of his opposite. That is, when [evil] comes to his mind, and he becomes motivated to [serve] G-d.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Every human being contains the entire world, whose myriad creatures are reflected in the endless thoughts that pass through his mind each day. Good thoughts parallel good creatures and evil thoughts are related to harmful ones. By subduing the evil in one’s own thoughts, the evil in the world is also overcome. The non-Jewish prophet and sorcerer Balaam was the very opposite of Moses, and embodied every possible evil trait; yet he too existed within Moses’ thoughts, and through his presence there, Moses was inspired to overcome his own evil and attain the level of a Tzaddik. This is the process of uplifting the sparks of holiness from among the impure shells that will continue until the coming of the Messiah.</i><br><i>Pri Ha’Aretz</i>, <i>Matos</i>

Whatever the wicked Balaam actually did, Moses was suspected and accused of doing. This is because Balaam was a spark of Moses.

Rabbi Reuven ben Atzrobili said: A person is never suspected of doing something unless he actually did it. And if he did not do all of it, he did some of it. And if he did not do some of it, he thought about doing it. And if he did not think about doing it, he saw others do it and was pleased.<br><i>Mo’ed Katan </i>18b<br>This applies only when the accusations are not from one’s enemies; whereas the slander of one’s enemies slander has no substance. Wicked people can accuse a Tzaddik of doing things that he never imagined in all of his lifetimes, just as they accused the Holy Baal Shem Tov and his disciple Rav Dov Baer (of Mezritch). 
Whatever Balaam and the mixed multitude did, they accused Moses of doing, such as adultery, although it was due to their own wickedness. Still, theirs was not a complete lie, for Balaam and the mixed multitude were sparks of Moses’ soul, and so whatever they did, he was accused of doing.<br>Yet there is nothing else in creation other than G‑d: “the humiliation of those whom You scorn has fallen upon me” (Psalms 79:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning to say, the Tzaddik understands that if he is being accused of a sin, it is G-d who is accusing him through the sinner.

<b>This is the statute of the Torah, which the L‑rd has commanded, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer, faultless, with no blemish…</b> (Numbers 19:2)<br>All the commandments are eternal in the mind. Although, in practice they require a certain time and action, in thought, they exist forever. For the Torah partakes of G‑d’s divinity, and His divinity is eternal. As the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov said, the entire Torah must always be found applicable in the mind and intellect, and one can learn from every mitzvah its [spiritual] allusion. They asked the Baal Shem Tov how this applies to the mitzvah of the Red Heifer, which was rarely performed even in the day of the Holy Temple. Furthermore, what is the significance of its ability to purify the impure and make impure the pure?
The Baal Shem Tov answered that this pertains to the ego. Because if a person acts wrongly and is far from G‑d, the beginning of his reform depends upon the ego, and [actions that are] not for the sake of heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. not with selfless intent.</i> For instance, in order to show off, or to merit the World to Come. For this too is a hidden type of egotism, in that he thinks it fitting for G‑d to reward him for his deeds. He imagines that he has done something for G‑d, when really, without G‑d’s influence in our lives, what are we? How can we possibly receive reward?<br>However, it is impossible to realize this at first, and the person would remain in the “externalities,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>chitzoniyut</i> – i.e. trapped in a superficial relationship with life, and far from G‑d.</i> G‑d forbid. Therefore, it is permitted for him to use pride, ostentation and self-centered actions, for “amidst selfish reasons, one comes to selflessness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 50b. The Talmud speaks about a person who studies Torah in order to be honored with the title “Rabbi.” Even though his motivation is self-serving, the very act of studying Torah will purify him and bring him to a level of selflessness in his studies.</i><br>On the other hand, selfless worship must be pure and clean from all traces of ego, which will ruin the action. Ego, then, purifies the impure that are distant from G‑d, and defiles the pure that are already close to Him, for if become prideful, they are despised by G‑d.
This applies even to Tzaddikim, who are already pure. They, too, must always follow this path, that requires both pride and humility to draw close to G‑d. Because before a person wants to come close to G‑d through the performance of an important mitzvah, or Torah study, or prayer, he is still far-off. Compared to the degree of closeness he will attain through this deed, he is, in a sense, still impure. It is impossible for him to come close to G‑d without his ego.<br>For just as there is Smallness and Largeness in holiness, so do they exist on the side of evil,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Sitra Achra</i> – the “Other Side,” referring to the forces in creation that appear opposite the Divine will.</i> G‑d forbid. Smallness in the <i>Sitra Achra</i> occurs when the evil inclination tells us, “You are not fit to perform such an important mitzvah or act of worship as this.” Then, one must become proud in the way of G‑d.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon II Chronicles 17:6: “And [Jehoshaphat’s] heart was lifted up in the ways of the L‑rd; and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.”</i> This is as our Sages said: “Why was Adam created alone, so that a [each] person should say, ‘The world depends upon me.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 37a.</i> Lacking this attitude, his evil inclination will tell him that he is unfit to approach G‑d through his action. Thus, he must use his very ego to come close to G‑d, for this is really humility, as we explained. It only seems like pride compared to the evil inclination, who seeks to deceive him into thinking that it is a mitzvah to be lowly.<br>Thus, he pride purifies him and allow him to draw close to G‑d through Torah study, prayer, or the commandments. However, afterward, when he is actually involved in the act, he must be on guard to all forms of pride. He must humble himself before G‑d and others. This is holy Smallness – not thinking that he is better than anyone else because they do not do this deed. It turns out that feeling egotistical during the actual performance of the mitzvah, when a person is called pure, actually makes him impure, G‑d forbid.
Now, pride is called a Heifer, for it increases and enlarges a person’s mind.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word for “Heifer,” <i>Parah</i>, is related to the word <i>Pore’ah</i>, “to be fruitful” – translated here as “to increase.”</i> It is also red, from the side of the “shells.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The color red is usually associates with forces of negativity, such as blood, or the Sefirah of Gevurah.

There are two types of rebuke, one for Torah scholars and the other for the masses.

<b>And he took up his parable, and said: This is the word of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man with the blinded eye.</b> (ibid. 24:3)<br>…this is the saying of the man who sees well.

The Midrash asks why G‑d chose to rest His Presence on such a wicked Gentile as [Balaam]? And it answers, so that the Gentile nations will not have any allegation [against G‑d], saying “Had you given us prophets, we too would have improved our ways.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> <i>Balak</i>. Cited in Rashi, Numbers 22:5</i><br>It is known, though, that the attainment of prophecy required very great holiness. Now, a person has five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. These correspond to five spiritual senses, as it is written: “My heart has seen much wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 1:17), “You have given to Your servant a listening heart” (I Kings 3:9), “And he shall smell with the fear of G‑d” (Isaiah 11:3), and likewise with the other senses.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Midrash Rabbah, Koheles</i> 1:36.</i> When a person purifies and sanctifies his external [physical] sense, holiness rests upon his spiritual ones, and the spirit of prophecy descends upon him.

He defiled all of his physical senses, as our Rabbis said, that he practiced bestiality with his donkey.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 105a.</i> In addition, he was a necromancer, a diviner, a sorcerer, and a soothsayer. How was it possible for prophecy to have rested upon him? It was not possible! And yet, it was extremely necessary for him to become a prophet, so that the nations of the world could not have a claim [against G‑d], “You rejected us!” But the matter was still very difficult, for there was no idea what could be done with him. What did G‑d do? He blinded him in one of his eyes, and because he could not sin with that eye, holiness and prophecy rested upon it.<br>The Targum reveals this to us by translating “blinded eye” as “who sees well.” That is, because he was blind in one of his eyes, he was able to see well with prophetic vision. But had he not been blind in that eye, there would not have been any way for prophecy to rest upon him.<br><i>Koheles Yitzchok</i>, <i>Balak</i>

<b>How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel!</b> (ibid. 24:5)

<b>How goodly are your tents, Jacob, your dwellings, Israel!</b> (Numbers 24:5) From the blessings of that wicked man, you can learn what he wanted to curse. <i>Sanhedrin </i>98b That is, from the blessing: “How goodly are your tents, Jacob, your dwellings, Israel.” For the Gemara says: “Not like Abraham, who called [the place of the Temple] a mountain, nor like Isaac, who called it a field, but like Jacob, who called it a house.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim</i> 88a: “Not like Abraham, of whom it is written ‘mountain,’ as it says: ‘As it is said today, in the mount where G‑d is seen’ (Genesis 22:14).

But like Jacob, who called it ‘house,’ as it says: ‘And he called that place “the house of G‑d” (<i>Beit E-l</i>).’” However, the Baal Shem Tov will assign two alternative verses from Scripture to Abraham and Isaac, both of which speak of the Temple’s destruction. Only the Third Temple, built in the merit of Jacob, will last forever. As the verse says: “For My house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples” (Isaiah 56:7).</i> That is, not like Abraham who called it a mountain, as it says: “the mountain of Zion, which is desolate” (Lamentations 5:18), nor like Isaac, who called it a field: “Zion is a plowed field” (Micah 3:12), for in the future, the Temple will be rebuild in the merit of Jacob, who called it a house.

<b>And when Pinchas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear (<i>romach</i>)<i> </i>in his hand.</b> (ibid. 25:7) Pinchas saw the letter <i>mem</i> floating in the air… and he attached to it <i>reish-ches</i> and also <i>vav</i>, so that it made <i>romach</i>.(<i>Zohar</i> 3:237a).

The floating <i>mem</i> lets the prophet know the level of his clarity.</i> To explain this a little further. Pinchas realized this from his own thoughts of fallen love (<i>Chesed</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Every human emotion and characteristic, in its purest form, is directed toward G‑d. However, these emotions can fall to lower manifestations. Thus, the love of G‑d can become love of the flesh. According to the Baal Shem Tov, it was not the illicit act of Kosbi and Zimri that Pinchas saw, but his own inner fall – an extraneous thought of carnal love that entered his mind. This signified that the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Malchus</i> (where all thoughts are manifest) had fallen from its attachment to G‑d. This is the meaning of the floating <i>mem</i>; i.e. <i>Malchus</i> disconnected from its higher source. By overcoming the thought, through the trait of Isaac, he reconnected it to its source. This is the meaning of the <i>romach</i>.</i> However, he strengthened himself, as it says: “Who is strong?

When it is spelled with the <i>vav</i>, as it is in the verse, it equals 248; the same as Abraham – אברהם.</i> This is true of every harsh Judgment, which occurs because <i>Malchus</i> lacks unification. But when you find the aspect of love in the Judgment, the Judgment is rectified in its root and transformed into the aspect of Abraham. The good ascends and the evil falls away.

And this is what Elijah said in the story, that it was the dirt was that of Abraham; meaning, from the aspect of Abraham, which is love. Then it rose up, and they fell and were broken. There is much more that could be said here, but this should be sufficient to the wise.

The Zohar says: “He saw the letter <i>mem</i>, etc.” For <i>Malchus</i> without unification becomes Judgment – a consuming fire. But by means of the unification, it becomes compassion. Pinchas felt this, and immediately made the unification of “<i>romach</i>” in his mind, joining the two attributes: “I am G‑d,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“I” – <i>Ani</i> – is a name for <i>Malchus</i>. “G‑d” – Y-H-V-H – is the Name related to <i>Tiferes</i>.

For the letters <i>reish ches</i> have the numerical value of the name “Isaac.” People should realize that extraneous thoughts come from <i>Malchus</i>, which is the letter <i>mem</i>, not being in union.

I received from our Master, the Baal Shem Tov, that as long as <i>Malchus, </i>the open letter <i>mem</i> – מ – it is not united with its Beloved, extraneous thoughts will be drawn to her and attack her, G‑d forbid. One must uplift it and bind her to its source. Then the unification of the Holy One and the Shechinah is made, in the mystery of the <i>mem</i> that is open to her husband, with holy thoughts. See the <i>Zohar Chadash</i>: “The open <i>mem</i> is the mystery of the perfect feminine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar Chadash</i>, <i>Midrash HaNe’elam</i>, <i>Shir HaShirim.</i></i><br><i>Otzar HaChayim</i>, <i>Vayikra</i>, p. 8c


Comment 16

My Master once told someone: “If you accept all that happens to you in this world in love, you will have this world and the next.” The man answered, “May G‑d give me strength to accept everything in love,” to which the Baal Shem Tov responded: “You have spoken truthfully!”<br> <i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 82b

Pinchas



Comment 1

<b>Pinchas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My anger away from the children of Israel, in that he was zealous for My sake among them, so that I did not destroy them in My jealousy. Therefore, tell him that I have given him My covenant of peace.</b> (Numbers 25:12-13)<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Pinchas is Elijah [the prophet]. The Holy One said to him, “Just as you made peace between Me and the Children of Israel in this world, so you will make peace between Me and the Children of Israel in the world-to-come, as it says: ‘Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and awesome day of the L-rd. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers…’ (Malachi 3:23-24). Rabbi Eliezer said: the Holy One called the name of Pinchas after the name of Elijah, a resident (<i>toshav</i>) of Gilad, who brought Israel to repentance (<i>teshuva</i>) on Mount Gilad, as it says “Behold, I give him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 13:12), “My covenant was with him, of life and of peace” (Malachi 2:5). The Holy One gave him life in this world, and life in the world-to-come, and He gave him a good reward: “It will be a covenant of eternal priesthood, to him and his descendants after him” (Numbers 13:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Yalkut Shimoni</i>, <i>Pinchas</i> #771. See <i>Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer</i>, chapter 46.</i>
The Baal Shem Tov explained the statement of the gemara, to “cling in His attributes.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sotah</i> 14a. “Rabbi Chama bar Chanina said: What does it mean, ‘You shall follow after the L-rd your G‑d’ (Deuteronomy 13:5)? Is it possible for a human being to follow after the <i>Shechinah</i>? Hasn’t it been said, ‘For the L-rd your G‑d is a consuming fire’? Rather, go after the attributes of the Holy One. Just as He clothes the bare, so you should cloth the bare. Just as the Holy One visits the sick, so you should visit the sick. Just as the Holy One buries the dead, so you should bury the dead.” (slightly abridged.) The Talmud does not actually use the phrase cited by the Baal Shem Tov, “cling in His attributes.” However, the Baal Shem Tov may have had in mind several earlier authors who used the phrase when discussing this gemara, such as <i>Shnei Luchos HaBris</i>, <i>Toldos Adam: Beis Dovid</i>, 7, and <i>Sefer HaBris</i>, <i>ma’amar</i> 14, chapter 1. Furthermore, Rashi on Deuteronomy 11:22, says, “cling in His students and scholars.”</i> It does not state, “to cling <i>to</i> His attributes.” For the main principle in serving G‑d is to attach oneself to the inner essence and vitality of the attributes, not their outer expression. For if you attach yourself to the outer manifestation of Chesed (“love” or “kindness”), you cannot attach yourself to the trait of Gevurah (“might” or “severity”), for outwardly, they are separate – a loving person does not show severity. Inwardly, however, the attributes are all united, as it is written: “I am G‑d, I do not change” (Malachi 3:6). Thus, if you want to serve G‑d, you must cling to the inner nature and vitality of the attributes, where they are one, for this is the Infinite One Himself. Then, kindness embraces severity and severity contains kindness.
The Baal Shem Tov gave an example of the principle of integration. The trait of <i>Chesed</i> is expansive, and gives to everyone. It is the essence of love, as it is written: “I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you with <i>chesed</i>” (Jeremiah 31:2). However, a person attached to the externality of <i>Chesed</i> may not be able to distinguish between one type of love and another, and may love everyone – the good and the evil, G‑d forbid. For instance, love is a type of outflow. It can be expressed in physical relationships, or in terms of money. If a person fails to make a distinction, all types of outflow will be equal to him, whether good or bad. He can be completely wicked, G‑d forbid, and yet still have some good traits. Thus, there are very generous people who are also licentious.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “who stray after their eyes.” From Deuteronomy 15:39.</i> This is because they connect to only the external part of <i>Chesed</i>. The main thing, however, is to be attached to <i>Chesed’s</i> inner nature. For then, strictness is part of <i>Chesed</i>. Because the right column of <i>Gevurah</i> restrains the left column of <i>Chesed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When there is inclusiveness among the Sefiros (the Divine attributes), then each one contains all the others. <i>Chesed</i>, on the right side of the <i>Sefirotic</i> tree has an element of <i>Gevurah</i> on its left, and <i>Gevurah</i>, on the left side of the tree, has an element of <i>Chesed</i> on its right. Each side tempers the <i>Sefirah</i> opposite it. <i>Gevurah</i> restrains overabundant <i>Chesed</i>, and <i>Chesed</i> uses <i>Gevurah</i> for compassionate purposes.</i> which is the evil <i>Chesed</i>, and prevents it from spreading out. It therefore stands in the place of the good <i>Chesed</i>. This is the inclusion of the <i>Gevurah</i> in <i>Chesed</i>.
This likewise applies to <i>Chesed’s</i> inclusion in <i>Gevurah</i>. For instance, if you want to do some act of severity; for instance, when the court judged a capital offence, they sought to sweeten the judgments that were caused by the sinner, who strengthened the <i>Gevurot</i> to empower the externalities. The court sweetens those <i>Gevurot</i> with their own act of <i>Gevurah</i> when they convicted him. Then, by themself, the sinner’s <i>Gevurot</i> are subdued and ameliorated, so that he receives the world-to-come. This is the aspect of <i>Chesed</i> within <i>Gevurah</i>. You must always draw to yourself the right side, and reject the left, whether in <i>Chesed</i> or in <i>Gevurah</i>. Thus it says: “the evil inclination… your left hand should push away and your right hand draw near.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 47a.</i> It does not say: “you should push it away with your left hand’ – rather, it implies that you should push away the left in all situations, and draw near the right.
The main thing is to uplift <i>Malchus</i> once it has been damaged by sin. To do this, you must sweeten and elevate the <i>Dinim</i> by joining the lower <i>hey</i> to the upper <i>hey</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The first letter <i>hey</i> of the Tetragrammaton, representing the world of <i>Binah</i>, and the last letter <i>hey</i>, corresponding to <i>Malchus.</i> This rectifies the <i>Dinim</i> (“stringencies”) that exist when <i>Malchus</i> is not united with <i>Tiferes.</i></i> For when <i>Malchus</i> is incomplete, it is called <i>dalet</i> – “that it has nothing (<i>d’leit</i> <i>lei</i>) of its own” – and <i>Tiferes</i> is called <i>gimel</i>. This is the meaning of “<i>gimel dalet</i>” – “giving to the poor”.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Gomel dalim</i>,” in Hebrew. See <i>Shabbat</i> 4a.</i> For when <i>Malchus </i>is called <i>dalet</i>, lacking the middle point, <i>Tiferes </i>is known as <i>gimel</i>, because the drop [of seed] that is still bound to the <i>vav</i>. But when it bestows that drop, it is called <i>vav</i>, and <i>Malchus </i>is called <i>hey</i>, due to the outflow that has entered her. And thus, following <i>gimel-dalet</i> is <i>hey-vav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of this paragraph is as follows: The <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Malchus</i> corresponds to the second letter <i>hey</i> in the Tetragrammaton – ה. However, when <i>Malchus</i> is disconnected with <i>Tiferet</i>, the <i>hey</i> lacks the lower point, and becomes the letter <i>dalet</i> – ד – which signifies lack and poverty (<i>dal</i> also means an indigent). Then <i>Tiferet</i>, corresponding to the letter <i>vav</i> – ו – takes the form of a <i>gimel</i> – ג – which looks like a <i>vav</i> with a point at the bottom – the very point missing from the <i>hey</i>. When <i>Malchus</i> is reconnected with <i>Tiferet</i>, is goes from <i>gimel dalet-gomel dalim</i>, giving to the poor, to <i>hey-vav</i>, for the point in the <i>gimel</i> has been transferred.</i>
Now, when the <i>yud</i> enters <i>Malchus</i>, the latter is also called <i>aleph</i>. This is the “Lower Wisdom” (“<i>Chochmah tata’ah</i>”), just as the Supernal Wisdom is called <i>aleph</i>, as the gemara states: “<i>elaph binah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “learn understanding.” Shabbat, ibid. </i> That is, before the <i>aleph </i>(<i>Chochmah</i>) reaches <i>Binah</i>, it is called <i>peleh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aleph</i> and <i>peleh</i> have the same letters – אלף, פלא.</i> which means “mysterious” and “hidden,” for we know nothing about it. But when it unites with <i>Binah</i>, it is called <i>aleph</i>, from the word “to teach” (<i>ileph</i>). Then we can understand one thing from another.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is the trait of <i>Binah</i>, which means “understanding.”</i> Therefore, when the <i>yud </i>reaches the final attribute (<i>Malchus</i>), it is also called <i>aleph</i>. Thus it is said about the verse: “G‑d founded the earth with wisdom” (Proverbs 3:19), that “the father founded the daughter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar</i> 3:258a.</i> For the supernal outflow is vitality, <i>Chochmah</i>, as it says: “Wisdom enlivens one who has it” (Ecclesiastes 7:12). Then, once it is called <i>aleph</i>, it becomes attached to the Forefathers, who are themselves the <i>merkavah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine Chariot. <i>Genesis Rabbah</i> 47:10.</i> Then it is called E-l, because the <i>aleph</i> unites with the three lines of the <i>lamed</i> – ל – which represent the Forefathers. Then there is an outpouring of compassion to <i>Malchus</i>.<br>Furthermore, when it unites with the last three, (?) which is the mystery of Oneness, which is gimel, there is also an outpouring of compassion. Thus, these two outflows together are called <i>gal </i>(ג"ל).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a “wave” or a “pile.”</i> This is the meaning of what the Arizal wrote in the mystical intentions of Pesach, that the name אמגל is compassion, because the middle letters of the name Elo-him are “LHI” (א-להי-ם), which can be transposed with the preceding letters, כדט, which signify compassion, wince the Din is concealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Up until here is the Arizal’s teaching.</i> And this is what he meant, that this attribute called Elo-him becomes united with the <i>gimel</i>, which are the three last ones (?). Then, with the <i>lamed</i>, which are the three middle ones. Therefore, one is blessed with compassion (there is an outpouring of compassion). And this is the meaning of “<i>Gileid</i>” (גלעד). The letter <i>dalet</i> is influence (receives from) the the seven sefirot, with each one consisting of ten, to make altogether “<i>eid</i>” (עד). And when will this be? When the גל is transposed (?) for the להי, and the גל unites with the letters אם, from the Name Elo-him, that cannot be transposed. This makes the gematria “<i>eid</i>” – עד.
This is the mystery of Elijah. Meaning, when this attribute becomes influenced and transformed and called <i>aleph</i>. For with the <i>yud</i>, it receives the shape of the <i>aleph</i>. Then, it unites with the <i>lamed</i>, which are the letters יהו, which are <i>Chesed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>, and <i>Tiferet.</i> Understand this! And all this is by elevating this attributes, which is the final <i>hey</i> to the Supernal <i>hey</i>, which is repentance. And from there, to <i>Chochmah,</i> which are two companions that never part; then the <i>Gevuros</i> are rectified. <br><i>Devorim Nechmadim</i>, in <i>Ginzei Yosef</i>

<b>Therefore say: Behold, I give him My covenant of peace. (Number 25:12)<br></b>
According to the Zohar and <i>Likutey Torah</i>, Nadav and Avihu were “two halves of a body.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar 3:57b; <i>Likutey Torah, parashas Vayikra</i>, by the Arizal. Nadav and Avihu never married, thus the Zohar considers each as only half a person. When Pinchas smote Zimri and Kosbi during their illicit act, the souls of Nadav and Avihu united with his own.</i> Therefore, Pinchas took both their souls, so that they are considered as one. Thus, it is written: “Behold, I give him My covenant of peace,” for when two things are united, it is called peace. Thus, <i>Yesod</i> is called Peace, etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yesod</i> is the ninth Sefirah, from Keter down, and serves to unite the upper Sefiros with the tenth Sefirah of Malchus. Thus, it is called “Peace.”</i> and “From my flesh, I will behold G‑d.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 19:26. Chasidic writings cite this verse often, to support the idea that the physical, emotional and mental constituents of a human being parallel and reflect the workings of the supernal Sefiros, through which G‑d directs the world. The Sefirah of <i>Yesod</i> corresponds to the male member, which is the organ of union. <i>Yesod</i> also corresponds to the Tzaddik, whose consciousness unites heaven and earth.</i><br>Likewise, when there is division among people, the one who can unite them is called “a pursuer of peace.” The reason Nadav and Avihu sinned was because they did not ask each other’s advice [before entering the Holy of Holies], as it says: “And Nadav and Avihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer. . .” (Leviticus 10:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. each one took it alone, without consulting the other.</i> There was no peace between them. But Pinchas rectified this when he was given the covenant of peace, in order to unite the souls of Nadav and Avihu in one body.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Acharei</i>, p. 96d

<b>May the L‑rd, the G‑d of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, who can go out before them and come in before them, who will bring them out, and bring them in, so that the congregation of G‑d be not as sheep without a shepherd.</b> (Ibid. 27:16-17)<br>The leader of the generation is able to uplift all of the speech and conversation of the people of his generation – to join the physical to the spiritual.

Comment 4

<i>Yesod </i>is called “All” (<i>kol</i>) because all of the supernal attributes are included in it. It unites them all and shines [them] into Malchus, which is called “the Bride” (<i>kallah</i>) for the same reason, that all the attributes are also included in her.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The words “All” – Kol, כל, and the word “Bride” – Kallah, כלה, share the same root - kaf lamed. However, the word Kallah has an additional letter <i>hey</i>, which corresponds both to the Sefirah of Malchus and to the last letter <i>hey </i>of the Tetragrammaton. Malchus, like Yesod, is also a microcosm of the entire Sefirotic realm. However, Malchus is feminine and receptive, whereas Yesod is masculine and imbuing.</i> Likewise, the Tzaddik unites all the attributes, as I wrote on the verse: “....who can go out before them, and come in before them,” in the name of my Master.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Lech Lecha, </i>p. 19b

Comment 5

For the individual, “[Torah study] not for the sake of the G-d<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “for the sake of the Name,” a term for selfless study.</i> leads to study for the sake of the G-d.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pesachim </i>50b.</i> That is, he uplifts his own self-centeredness by means of his selfless study. But if this aspect is not found in any individuals, it is found in the leaders of the generation. Thus the verse says: “…who will bring them in.” That is, who will bring them into his perspective [of selfless worship].<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef, Emor, </i>p. 10c

Comment 6

Among people, there are four types of union.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Kabbalah speaks about four kinds of relationships between the Sefiros. A face-to-face union means that the Sefiros radiate light to each other in a direct way, while a back-to-back union means that their connection is indirect. The other two are intermediary stages. The Baal Shem Tov applies these concepts to the human consciousness.</i> One is the face-to-face union – when a person studies [Torah] and prays with absolute perfection. The second is back-to-face union – when a person is so involved in his projects that he has no time to study, yet constantly yearns to find the free time to do so. The third is face-to-back union – that is, even though he studies and prays, extraneous thoughts about all of his projects distracted him. The fourth is the aspect of back-to-back union, which is worse than the other three. [They can be rectified] but the fourth cannot be rectified, except by means of “who will bring them out, and who will bring them in,” as I heard from my Master.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, this refers to the Tzaddik, who can uplift even the lowest people and return them to G‑d.</i><br><i>Tzafnah Paneach</i>, p. 86c

<b>And Moses spoke to the tribal heads of the Israelites, saying: This is the thing that G-d has commanded. If a man makes a vow to God, or makes an oath to obligate himself, he must not break his word. He must do all that he expressed verbally.</b> (Numbers 30:2-3)<br>This is what is written: “Better not to make a vow, than to make a vow and not complete it” (Ecclesiastes 5:4). The Holy One says, Be careful making vows, and do not break them, for all who breaks vows will eventually transgress oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Taking an oath involves swearing on G-d’s Name. Thus, transgressing it is a more serious offense than breaking a vow.</i> And one who transgresses oaths is considered to have denied G-d. There is no forgiveness for him, as it says: “You shall not take the name of the L-rd your God in vain; for G-d will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:6). And it is written: “If you will return to me, O Israel . . . and will swear, ‘As the L-rd lives’…” (Jeremiah 4:1-3). The Holy One said to Israel, “Do not think that it is permissible for you to swear, even in truth. You are not permitted to swear by My Name . . . .”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni, Matos</i> #284.</i>
Our Sages enjoined us to say before each mitzvah: “For the sake of the union of the Holy One and His Shechinah. . . .” This is alluded to in the verse: “This is the thing that G-d has commanded.” The matter is as follows.<br>King Solomon said: “Better not to make a vow.” But what type of individual is he addressing? If it is a person who does not plan on fulfilling his vow, obviously he is forbidden to make it, for he transgresses a negative commandment and a positive one, as the Talmud says.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedarim </i>3b.</i> And if it is a person who wants to fulfill his vow, why is it better for him not to make it. The Sages said: “How do we know that a person can vow to fulfill a mitzvah? From the verse: ‘I have sworn and I have fulfilled it, to observe Your righteous ordinances” (Psalms 119:106). King David also said: “My vows to G-d I will fulfill” (ibid. 116:14). And would David transgress this, G-d forbid?
Rather, with every mitzvah that a person performs, he fixes all the aspects of <i>nefesh, ruach,</i> and <i>neshama</i>, up until the highest point – the tip of the <i>yud</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Baal Shem Tov explicitly names the three lowest levels of the soul – <i>nefesh, ruach,</i> and <i>neshama</i> – he alludes here to still higher levels – the <i>chaya</i> and <i>yechida</i>. These five levels are alluded to in the four letters of the Tetragrammaton. The <i>nefesh</i> corresponds to the final <i>hey</i>, the <i>ruach</i> to the <i>vav</i>, the <i>neshama</i> to the first <i>hey</i>, the <i>chaya</i> to the <i>yud</i>, and the <i>yechida</i> to the small point at the top left of the <i>yud</i> – י</i> which is hidden and concealed. If the commandment requires action, making that the lowest level of the commandment, a person must still fix speech and thought. If it involves speech, then that is the lowest aspect of the mitzvah, and he still must fix voice and thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov divides each mitzvah into three components. When the mitzvah is performed with speech, such as prayer or Torah study, then that is the lowest level. The two higher levels would then be voice (<i>kol</i> – undifferentiated sound) and thought.</i><br>Now, when a person thinks about performing a mitzvah, he still has no fear of the accusation of the “shells,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kelipot</i> – forces of impurity and evil that oppose the performance of a mitzvah, by claiming that a person is not worthy to do it.</i> for they have no attachment to thought. However, when he verbalizes [his intention] to do a mitzvah, then there are Accusing Forces to hinder the mitzvah, for the “shells” draw sustenance from the place of speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Likutey Moharan I:38,2, on the verse: “Sin couches at the door” (Genesis 4:7), alluding to the “door” of the mouth.</i>
Therefore, when a person wants to perform a mitzvah and must speak about doing it, making him concerned about the Accusers, our Sages enjoined him to say: “For the sake of the union of the Holy One and His Shechinah, in fear and in love, in love and in fear, to unite the Name Y-H and V-H by means of He who is hidden and concealed in the name of all Israel,” Then, he has created the Unification of the mitzvah on [the level of] speech, voice and thought, up until above, to He who is hidden and concealed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, by reciting this prayer, one unifies even a physical mitzvah on three upper levels. The actual performance of the mitzvah that follows is almost secondary, and can proceed with obstruction.</i> Then he will not be afraid of the Accusers or obstacles to the mitzvah, nor from any selfish motivations [on his part], since he has uplifted all the vitality of the mitzvah, and lacks only the mitzvah’s performance, which is the last level. Consequently, the Accusers will lack all ability to stop him.
This is what the verse says: “When shall make a vow to the L-rd your G-d, you shall not be late in fulfilling it…” (Deuteronomy 23:22). This verse guarantees that when a person makes a Unification before performing a mitzvah – that is “to the L-rd your G-d”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The conjunction of the Divine Names “L-rd your G-d” – Y-H-V-H Elo-hecha – corresponds to the union of G-d and the Shechinah, described above.</i> – he can be absolutely sure that he will not delay in fulfilling it – that is, to also fulfill it in actuality – since he did the Unification completely. This is why the verse says: “This is the thing…” alluding to the Unification. For “this” is Yesod and “the thing” (<i>hadavar</i>) is Malchus. “That G-d has commanded” – that is, that G-d commands each person to do before performing a mitzvah, to say the Unification completely. So that, “If a man makes a vow to God,” to do a mitzvah, he shouldn’t just say that he will do it, he should make the complete unification.
This is what the Midrash said: “Better not to make a vow, than to make a vow and not complete it” – that is, not to complete the Unification, but merely to state that one will do the mitzvah. Because then concern exists about the Accuser, and it would be better not to have vowed, not to say anything, only to think about doing the mitzvah, so that there is no worry about the Accusers. However, if a person can complete the Unification perfectly, it is certainly better. He will not have any fear of Accusers, and in fact, will receive help and support to complete the mitzvah.
This is what David said: “My vows to G-d I will fulfill.” Meaning, the vow will be with a complete Unification. For when the Unification is incomplete, it is called “breaking the vow,” which will lead him to transgress an oath, which is the impediment to the mitzvah, which is a rectification of the seven attributes called “oaths.” Therefore, one must be careful to complete the Unification.<br><i>Devorim Nechmadim, Ginzei Yosef</i>

<b>These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who had left Egypt by their hosts, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.</b> (Numbers 33:1)<br>There were forty-two journeys in all. My grandfather (the Baal Shem Tov) explained that they exist in every the life of human being, from the moment of birth until the day of death.<br>This can be understood as follows. When a person is born and leaves the womb, that corresponds to the exodus from Egypt. Afterward, he journeys from one place to another, until he reaches the Supernal Land of Life.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the World to Come, corresponding to the Land of Israel.</i> Thus it is written: “At the word of G‑d they encamped and at the word of G‑d the traveled” (Numbers 9:23), which correspond to constricted consciousness and expanded consciousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, <i>katn</i><i>us</i> and <i>gadlus</i> – smallness and greatness.</i>
I also heard from a certain individual that the forty-two journeys correspond to the forty-two letter name of G‑d, which is counted from the first night of Passover until the festival of Shavuos, and is completed with the receiving of the Torah. And although there are forty-nine days in all, each week is a complete unit, with the root of them all being forty-two.
These journeys are recorded in the Torah in order to teach us the right path to follow in our lives, and that all of our journeys are holy and pure. Thus, I heard from my grandfather in the name of the <i>Bris Menucha</i>, that <i>Kivros HaTa’avah</i> (Numbers 11:34) corresponds to the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>, for they buried there the people who lusted. Meaning to say, when a person attains the level of <i>Chochmah</i>, he loses all his [material] desires in his great attachment to G‑d.<br>Now we can understand how all the journeys were holy or contained aspects of holiness and exalted levels. <i>Tav’erah</i> was surely a lofty aspect (Numbers 11:3). However, the Israelites distorted the nature of these places through their deeds, as it says about <i>Kivros HaTa’avah</i>: “And [Moses] named the place <i>Kivros HaTa’avah</i>, for they buried there the people that craved (Numbers 11:34). This applies as well to the other encampments, such as <i>Tav’erah</i>: “And [Moses] named the place ‘Burning,’ for God’s fire had burned them.” Yet, had they not distorted these places, each one would have revealed its hidden light.
This is the meaning of: “These are the journeys of the children of Israel… And Moses recorded their goings forth, stage by stage, at G‑d’s command; these are their journeys according to their decampments.” Meaning, Moses wrote down the supernal significance of each journey, from the mother’s womb until the Land of Life, so that each person should know the path to follow according to G‑d’s word. However, “these are their journeys according to their decampments.” That is, this is how they themselves distorted those encampments with their actions, for the end of the verse does not say: “at G‑d’s command.”<br>Understand this! And may G‑d teach us His straight and true path. Amen!<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, <i>Masai</i>

<b>Behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</b> (Deuteronomy 1:10)<br>Were they like the stars on that day? Why, they only numbered six-hundred thousand! Rather, what is the meaning of “Behold, you are this day”? Behold, you are likened to the day, that is, you will always exist, like the sun and the moon and the stars. (Rashi, ibid.)<br>It is written: “The path of the righteous is as the gleam of sunlight, that shines ever brighter until the height of the day” (Proverbs 4:18). That is, the sun in itself shines in its place equally, both at the onset of the day and in the middle. The only thing that obstructs it is the earth, which stands between us and the sun. therefore, its light does not shine so brightly at dawn – only a little bit – until it spreads across the earth.<br>The same holds true of the Tzaddik. In himself, he is always shining: the blockage is only on the part of the receivers. This too is due to the obstruction of the earth – that is, this world. For people are sunk in this world, and are unable to receive the light of the Tzaddik. This is as the Talmud said on the verse: “I lifted my eyes, and beheld a folded scroll” (Zechariah 5:1): “When you unfold it….When you peel it…”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eiruvin</i> 21a. The Talmud juxtaposes two verses from the Books of the Prophets. In Zechariah 5, the prophet sees a rolled up scroll of phenomenal size: “Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold: a rolled up scroll. And he (an angel) said to me: 'What do you see?' And I answered: 'I see a rolled up scroll; the length of it is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits.” According to the Talmud, these measurements are not based upon human dimensions, but Divine ones: Ten of G‑d’s cubits (as it were). The second verse is from Ezekiel (2:9-10): “And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and lo, a scroll of a book was in it. And He spread it before me, and it was written on the back and the front.” The Talmud considers these two scrolls as one, and tries to determine its full size. First, the scroll must be unrolled and then peeled, so that both sides face front and can be measured together. The conclusion is that the scroll is 20 x 40 of G‑d’s cubits. The Talmud then cites Isaiah 40:12 to determine the size of the universe: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with a span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?” According to Biblical measurements, a “span” (<i>zeres</i>) is half the length of a cubit (<i>amah</i>), and one square span is a quarter of a square cubit. It comes out that 800 square cubits contain 3,200 square spans. Thus, the scroll of the Torah is 3,200 times the size of the universe.</i> It comes out that the entire world is 1/3,200 the size of the Torah, which is exceedingly great and “broader than the ocean.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon Job 11:9.</i> It is difficult to understand how such a small thing as the world can block such a great thing as the Torah, which is thousands of times the size, for the entire world is minute in comparison.
However, this is like the oft-quoted analogy, that a small coin held up to your eyes will block out a great mountain, even though the latter is thousands of times larger. However, since the coin is in front of your eyes, it obstructs your vision, until you cannot see something much larger. Likewise, when a person comes into this world, and becomes lost in its frivolities, so that it seems to him that there is nothing better, then this tiny little world keeps him from seeing the great and exalted light of the Torah, which is thousands of times the size. And this is the example of the sun, that the earth prevents us from seeing its great light, though the sun is many times larger.
And this is the meaning of: “The path of the righteous is as the gleam of sunlight." It is exactly like the gleam of sunlight! For just as the sun shines constantly, with only the earth creating a barrier, though it is much smaller; so too, Tzaddikim constantly shine. It is only the earth – that is, [the attractions of] this world – that prevents us from seeing their great light. Even though this world is so very small and insignificant in comparison, it still obstructs and prevents us from seeing them, like the example of the coin.
All this is because the world stands before a person’s eyes and obstructs them, until he cannot see the light of the Torah and the Tzaddikim, which is thousands of times greater. However, if he removes that small obstruction from his eyes: that is, he turns his eyes away from this world and does not look at it, but only lifts his head and raises his eyes to gaze above this occluding world, then he will merit to see the great and exalted light of the Torah and the Tzaddikim. Because, really, their light is infinitely greater than this entire world and its attractions. It is only that this world blocks his eyes and does not let him turn them away at all, to gaze above on the light of the Torah and the Tzaddikim.<br>This is exactly like the example of the small coin that stands before the eyes and obstructs them from seeing the great mountain. However, it is very easy to remove the coin from before one’s eyes. Then, one will immediately see the great mountain. So it is with the world and the Torah. For with a small swipe, one can remove the world from before one’s eyes. Then, one merits seeing the great light of the Torah and the Tzaddikim, which shines in all the worlds with a very great light.
I also heard that the Baal Shem Tov said, “Woe, woe! The whole world is filled with awesome and wondrous lights and mysteries, yet a small hand is placed before the eyes that prevents us from seeing the great light.”<br><i>Likutey Moharan</i> I:133

<b>…and the matter that is difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will make you hear it.</b> (Deuteronomy 1:17)<br>There is a problem here. The verse should have said: “The matter that is difficult, bring it to me.” Why does it say: “for you”? Furthermore, it should have said: “and I will inform you.” Why does it say: “and I will make you hear it”?<br>I think this is coming to tell us something about the nature of the question [they were asking], which is, can one actually hear the Supernal Voice that calls out each day to arouse Jewish hearts in repentance, as our Sages have said throughout the Talmud and Zohar? Moses therefore answered them, concerning “the matter that is difficult” – that is, the heavenly proclamation, called “the matter,” that you find hard to believe in – know that the problem is “from you.” Your own coarseness and impure physicality creates a barrier that keeps you from hearing it, as the Zohar states on the verse: “Hear, O you deaf” (Isaiah 42:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar</i> 1:224a: “‘Hear, O you deaf.’ These are people who do not listen to the words of Torah, and who do not open their ears to hear the commandments of the Torah.”</i> This is the meaning of “bring it to me,” as it is written: “and Pharaoh drew near” (Exodus 14:10). That is, draw near to the aspect of Moses, of whom it says: “Remove your shoes” (ibid. 3:5). Remove your physicality, and purify it. Then, “I will make you hear it.” That is, through the intermediary of Moses you will be able to hear it.<br><i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 9c

This is a very great thing. For then, a person knows that he did [a mitzvah] on that day, and created one angel – “And if there is for him an angel, an intercessor, one among a thousand<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A thousand accusers.</i> to vouch for a man’s uprightness, then He will be gracious to him, and say, ‘Deliver him from descending to the pit, I have found a ransom’” (Job 33:23).<br>This is alluded to in [the verse]: “He who keeps (<i>shomer</i>) the commandment will not know an evil thing…” (Ecclesiastes 8:5). That is, when a person commits himself to being constantly attentive – from morning till eve – for a mitzvah to present itself to him. This is the meaning of <i>shomer</i>, as in “And his father watched out for the matter (<i>shomar et hadavar</i>)” (Genesis 37:11). Then, the result will be that he “will not know an evil thing.” That is, he will not have an improper seminal emission, which is called “evil,” G-d forbid.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah considers the act of spilling seed as one of the most grievous sins possible, so much so that it is given the unique title of “evil” – <i>ra</i>. (As in the verse: “And Er, Judah’s first-born, was evil in the sight of G-d…” (Genesis 38:7), on which Rashi comments that he intentionally spilled his seed on the ground.) According to Kabbalah, this act was part of the sin of Adam, and causes damage even when it happens unintentionally, such as during sleep. Much of Chasidic thought deals with rectifying this sin on the personal and cosmic level. In addition to the mystical power of mitzvah observance to engender purity, the Baal Shem Tov may have meant that constant attentiveness to fulfilling the will of G-d protects a man from impure thoughts during the day, so that his dreams will be pure at night. This is as the Talmud states: “A person shouldn’t think about illicit things during the day that will bring him to impurity in the night” (<i>Kesuvos</i> 46a).</i><br>This is alluded to in the verse: “The kindness of G-d is all the day” (Psalms 52:3).

<b>Then G‑d will scatter you among the nations, and only a small number will remain among the nations to which God will lead you.</b> (Deuteronomy 4:27)<br>I heard a parable from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov). Once there was a merchant traveling by sea. A fierce storm arose and threatened to sink the ship. The merchant prayed to G‑d to save him in the merit of his holy and modest wife. A certain non-Jewish idolater overheard him, and was amazed that he should pray in the merit of his wife, but the merchant replied that she was truly worthy of praise. The non-Jew said, “I can seduce her. What sign should I take from her to show you that I have succeeded?” The merchant told him that his wife wore a valuable ring. If the non-Jew can bring the ring, then he will know that the he succeeded. The two men made a bet, with the loser having to give all of his merchandise to the winner.<br>The non-Jew made several attempts to seduce the merchant’s wife, but could not even approach her. He even told her that he has a message from her husband, but she wouldn’t listen to him at all. Finally, he bribed her maid to try and steal the ring, and after much plotting and scheming, she succeeded. The non-Jew gave the ring to the woman’s husband and took all of his merchandise. The merchant returned home with nothing.<br>When his wife heard that her husband was on his way home, she dressed herself in finery and went out to greet him. She welcomed with loving words, as they always shared between them, but her husband did not react. She was surprised, and could not fathom why his love and affection for her had changed. He came home with her, but his heart was wasn’t there. Things continued this way until he sent her away on a ship without a captain [or crew] – only her husband himself, who changed his appearance and speech to appear like the lone sailor on the ship. The ship went for several days without food or water, and the wife begged the sailor to give her something to keep alive. He replied that he would do so only if she kissed him, and she was forced to do so. Eventually, he even demanded that she have sex with him.<br>One day, the ship came to land and the wife jumped off and went looking for food. She found two trees. If a person ate from one of them, he would become leprous. If he ate from the other, he would be healed. She put fruit from both trees in her satchel, and continued on until she came to the king’s palace. She was dressed as a man. In the palace, they needed this very medicine. She healed them, and they gave her great wealth. She returned home to her husband, and complained at how he sent her away on the ship with the repulsive sailor, and how she had had to kiss him and do other things because she was starving. However, her husband was secretly pleased over her protests and her modesty. The husband investigated the matter, and discovered that the non-Jew had lied, and that he had stolen the ring. The matter became clear, and the non-Jew was convicted.
This parable alludes to all that has and will happen, from the destruction of the Temple until the coming of the Moshiach. My Master made a soul-ascent and saw the archangel Michael, the great guardian of Israel, speaking favorably about the Jews, and claiming that all of their debts are really merits, for all the money they borrow is only to for the sake of marrying their children into the families of Torah scholars, or in order to give charity, etc. And that all of it is absolutely necessary, etc. The modest woman is the Shechinah, which is the mystery of “A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband” (Proverbs 12:4). The Accuser<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the forces of evil.</i> became jealous and said [to G‑d]: “Right now, they have the Holy Temple and the sacrifices. If You want to test them, destroy the Temple and I will seduce them.” The maid-servant who stole the ring is the great mystery of the two goats, one for G‑d and the other for Azazel. And due to their sin, it came up in the left hand, and the Temple was destroyed, as the Ramban wrote. They were exiled in a ship, and it is as though G‑d changes Himself in the holy Name Sa’el. And this is the mystery of confession,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vidui</i>.</i> and the complaint of the Divine Presence to G‑d over being forced, etc., until it finally becomes clear that the accusation against her was false. Then: “there is a sacrifice to G‑d in Botzrah” (Isaiah 34:6), etc., for this parable is extremely profound.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 190-191<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See, also, <i>Ketones Passim</i>, p. 40c.</i>

<b>And you shall love the L-rd your G‑d (<i>Hashem Elo-hecha</i>) with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might.</b> (ibid. 6:4)<br>My Master, Baal Shem Tov asked a question: What benefit does G‑d have from our loving Him. If tiny gnats like us love the great and awesome King, does it mean anything? And I heard from him the following, amazing answer.<br>The world was created through <i>Din</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “Judgment,” and referring to forces of limitation and restriction (i.e. G‑d’s self-limitation to allow room for creation)</i> which is the mystery of the <i>zimzum</i>, as is known. Therefore, all the suffering and affliction that a person experiences are like the body in relationship to the soul and the spiritual life-force. When a person accepts affliction with love and joy, which are the aspect of vitality and spirituality, he binds the body to the soul, which annuls the <i>Din</i>. The opposite also applies, G‑d forbid, if a person pushes his body away from the life-force. Therefore, the Baal Shem Tov made the following suggestion: “You shall love the L-rd your G‑d (<i>Havaye Elo-hecha</i>)” – [Elo-hecha] is the aspect of <i>Din</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine Name <i>Elo-him</i> alludes to the attribute of <i>Din</i>.</i> Accept it cheerfully, and bind it to <i>Havaye</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Name <i>Havaye </i>(a reference for the Tetragrammaton) corresponds to the soul, which is part of G‑d’s essence.</i> which is the soul, through your love.<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, p. 180c

<b>All the commandments which I command you this day shall you observe to do….</b> (Deuteronomy 8:1)<br>There is one great principle – that a person must attach himself to the inner dimension of the Torah and the commandments.

If not, one cuts and separates the “shoots.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A Talmudic term implying that one posits a division between G-d and creation.

<b>And He humbled you, and caused you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you knew not . . . that He make known to you that not by bread alone does the man live, but by every word that leaves the mouth of G-d the man lives.”</b> (Ibid. 8:3)<br>There is a problem [with this verse.] The words “the,” which appear twice in the words “<i>the</i> man,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew, the prefix <i>hey</i> – <i>ha-adam.</i></i> are unnecessary. It should have said: “<i>a</i> man does not live by bread alone.”<br>This can be explained with a statement in <i>Likutey Torah</i> by the Arizal, that scientists once questioned the source of the soul’s vitality. To say that the soul’s life force comes from bread and physical food makes no sense. On the other hand, the soul cannot be said to live without food, like an angel. If so, why does a person die from hunger if he does not eat for several days? Death is the separation of the soul from the body. Still, why does the soul depart for lack of food, since it does not derive benefit from it? They became very confused over this issue.<br>The Arizal explained that they were fools, and did not understand the root of creation. Our Sages have said: “G-d created the world with ten utterances”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei </i><i>Avos</i> 5.</i> – meaning, everything came into existence by means of the utterances themselves, for the utterance of G-d is lofty and holy. As soon as G-d said, “Let there be a firmament,” the firmament came into existence, as it is says: “With the word of G-d the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6). That utterance entered into the inner vitality of the firmament to enliven it, so that it should remain for as long as the world exists, as it says: “Forever, O G-d, Your word stands in the heavens” (Psalms 119:99).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains that the letters of G-d’s speech descend from the spiritual realm, undergoing countless permutations, until they become concretized in the objects of the physical world. See <i>Sha’ar HaYichud v’HaEmunah</i>, chapter 1, printed together with <i>Sefer HaTanya.</i></i> Likewise, when He said, “Let the earth put forth grass and fruit trees,” or “Let the earth put forth living creatures” (Genesis 1:11, 24). Those utterances brought them all into existence, and the utterance itself is their inner vitality.
Now, when a person takes a fruit or other piece of food and makes a blessing over it with concentration, saying: “Blessed are you, G-d…” and mentioning the name [of the food], he arouses the vitality that went into the creation of that fruit, because everything was created through its name. Then, like attracts like and arouses it. This vitality is the nourishment of the soul. All of this applies to foods that are permitted and kosher, which the Holy One commanded us to uplift from the physical to the spiritual.
This is what is written: “<b>And He humbled you, and caused you to hunger</b>.” For the manna was extremely spiritual, and the base people were not satisfied with it and said: “Our souls loathe this miserable bread” (Numbers 21:5). Thus it says, “<b>and fed you with manna</b>,” that was extremely spiritual, the bread of mighty, that the ministering angels eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Based upon Psalms 78:25: “Man ate the bread of angels: He sent them provision to the full.”</i> However, it became concretized somewhat, so that they could grasp it, in order “<b>that</b> <b>He make known to you.</b>” Even when you enter the Land of Israel and eat physical bread, you should place the honor of your souls before the honor of your bodies, and uplift everything from physical to spiritual. For “<b>not by bread alone</b>” – that is, when it is merely physical, without awakening its spiritual component. “<b>Does the man live</b>” – that is, the soul which is called “<i>the</i> man” (whereas the body is called “the flesh of man” – <i>basar adam</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar</i>, <i>Bereishis</i> 20b.</i> “<b>But by every word that leaves the mouth of G-d</b>” – for when you pronounce the name with concentration, in the blessing that you make over [the food], you arouse its spirit. From <i>this</i> <b>lives the man</b>, i.e. the soul, which is sustained by the spiritual component in the food. G-d arranged this precise intention, for by creating worlds and destroying them, sparks of holiness fell into the four parts of creation: mineral, vegetable, animal and human,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Medaber, </i>literally, “Speaker.”</i> and it is fitting for a person to uplift them.
This is like a parable of a king who lost a precious stone from his ring. Even though myriad of servants, officers, sages, governors and military lieutenants stood before him at the time, he did not command any of them to search for the gemstone, but told only his beloved and only son to search, find, and return it to him. And even though the king fully trusted that his attendants and servants would all return the stone if they found it, nevertheless, he does not want them to look for it, for he wanted his beloved son to take the credit, and so that the found item be called by his name. Not only that, he even gives his son several hints as to its location, for the king knew where it was the whole time. He did everything only in order to reward his beloved son, and to take great pride and delight in him, saying, “See! No one in the world could have found the stone except my son!”
The meaning of this parable is clear. The creation of the worlds was in order for the Israelite nation to sort out the sparks of holiness from permitted and kosher foods, as the Sages said: “For the sake of Israel, that is called ‘the beginning.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 36:.</i>
Thus the Baal Shem Tov commented on the verse: “Hungry and also thirsty, their souls faint (<i>tisatef</i>) in them” (Psalms 107:5). He explained here a great secret. Why did G-d create various types of food and drink that human beings desire? Because they contain sparks of Adam, the first man that became enclothed in the mineral, vegetable, animal and human levels, and that long to become attached to holiness.

Comment 6

You must be constantly attached to spiritual delight. Even when you enjoy transient pleasures, such as on Shabbos and festivals, you should be attached to the spiritual pleasure in that thing – which is its vitality – and not to the object’s physicality. For when you are bound to spiritual pleasure, G‑d will remember you; for G‑d is also bound to a spiritual pleasure that is beyond our comprehension.

The Talmud states that the wicked are always filled with regret over their sins. Why, then, are they called wicked?

I heard from my grandfathers [the Baal Shem Tov] that all the ascents of a person – whether of his character traits, or his speech – only occur through the leaders and Tzaddikim of generation. The Tzaddik is able to uplift everything. Now, there are two aspects to this. There are those people whom the Tzaddik uplifts through his Torah study and prayer. And there are those people whom the Tzaddik is only able to uplift through his mundane speech, as our Sages have said on the verse: “And their leaves will not wither (Psalms 1:…) – “Even the common talk of a Torah scholar is necessary.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sukkos 21b.</i> Even though it seems to be empty words (devorim betalim).

<b>If there is a poor man among you . . . you shall open your hand wide to him…</b> (Ibid. 15:7-8)<br>I heard from the Baal Shem Tov a commentary on the verse: “As for me, I will behold Your Face in righteousness; when awakened, I will be satisfied with Your likeness” (Psalms 17:15). When a person gives a coin to a pauper, he creates a Unification. The coin is the letter <i>yud</i> and the five fingers of the giver are the letter <i>hey</i>. The outstretched hand of the giver is the letter <i>vav</i> and the five fingers of the poor person are the last letter <i>hey</i>. Through this, he causes a outflow of compassion, because [the Name] in proper order is absolute compassion.<br>This applies when the giver initiates the act of charity, before the poor man stretches out his hand. Then the [the letters of the] Name are in order, which draws compassion into the world. But when the beggar first puts out his hand; then the Name is not in order. This is the meaning of: “As for me, I will behold Your Face in righteousness.” When I initiate the act of charity, then I will behold Your face. I.e., when I cause a Unification of the four letters [of the Name] in sequence, which is Your face – compassion. But “when awakened,” meaning to say, when the pauper awakens me by stretching out his hand for charity, then “I will be satisfied with Your likeness.” Then it is only the likeness of the four letters, but not the face. And this is: “You shall surely open your hand for him.” That is, <i>you</i> should be the one to open, then the Name will be in correct order.<br><i>Mevaser Tzedek, Re’eh</i>

It is better for a person not to do a mitzvah, than to do it out of self-interest. However, with regards to the mitzvah of charity, even if it is not done the best way, for the sake of G-d, the person should do it anyway, for he sustains the life of the poor.<br><i>Tori Zahav</i>, <i>Re’eh</i>

<b>If there is a poor man among you . . . you shall surely open your hand wide to him…</b> (Ibid. 15:7-8)<br>One who wants to derive benefit from others, may do so like the prophet Elisha… and one who does not want to benefit from others, should not do so, like the prophet Samuel.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 10b. The prophet Elisha, for instance, regularly accepted food and board from the Shunamit woman (2 Kings 4). On the other hand, Samuel would take his tent and all his supplies with him as he traveled throughout Israel to judge the people, so as not to derive benefit from others.</i><br>There is a problem here. Since taking from others is optional – one can do so if one pleases or not – why did the redactor of the Talmud have to mention it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since both options are acceptable, the matter could have been left unstated.</i> Furthermore, we can deduce one part of the statement from the other. Since it states that one who wants to derive benefit from others may do so like Elisha, we can deduce the opposite, and likewise from the beginning to the end. [So why mention both?]
The Baal Shem Tov explained this as follows. A rich man who gives charity fulfills the mitzvah “you shall surely open your hand wide to him.” The poor man who receives it, however, does not seem to be fulfilling a mitzvah. Still, if the man can not make a living, and accepts charity because he must – as it states: “If a person needs to take and doesn’t, it is as though he spilled blood,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Peah</i> 37a.</i> and, “If a person has two hundred [<i>dinarim</i>] minus one,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And is therefore in the category of a pauper, and can receive charity.</i> even if a thousand people give him one [<i>dinar</i>] each, he can take”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">From the leftovers of the harvest and from corners of the field.</i> – and if he accepts it with the intention to give the rich person merit for showing him charity, then “greater is one who causes others to do [mitzvos] than one who does it himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bava Basra</i> 9a.</i> For a pauper can receive donations from more people in one day than a rich person can give to. Our Sages stated this in their commentary on the verse from Ruth: “‘The man’s name whom I did for today is Boaz’ (Ruth 2:19). It does not state: ‘who did for me,’ but ‘whom I did for.’ For more than the almsgiver does for the pauper, the pauper does for the almsgiver.”<br>Now, since the poor man is taking charity selflessly, it is only right that he take it from righteous individuals who will gain merit on account of him, and not take it from the wicked. This was the case of Elisha, who did not want to take [a gift] from Na’aman,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">2 Kings 5.</i> even though the latter converted, so as not to give him the merit of having given him.<br>And this is the meaning of the Talmud’s statement: “One who wants to derive benefit from others, should do so like the prophet Elisha.” That is, he should take charity in order to bring merit to the giver. Thus, he should take it only from righteous Jews. On the other hand, even though it is a mitzvah to take charity in this way, he needn’t run after such a person. If he does not want to benefit from others, he need not do so, like Samuel, who did not take from anyone.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 23a

What is this like? Like a soldier full of wrath, who is sent by the king to summon a man, and strikes fear and dread in him. Yet, there is no reason to fear this messenger, only to immediately go to the king to placate him. Similarly, external loves are meant to awaken a person to love of G-d. What is this like? Like a messenger of the king who shows gestures of love. A foolish person will delight in and spend time with the messenger, but a wise person will say, “Why should I spend time with the messenger, let me go the root of the king’s love.”<br>Thus it is written “You shall be whole-hearted with the L-rd your G-d,” with an oversized letter <i>tav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, the Baal Shem Tov had a tradition that the letter <i>tav</i>, in the word <i>tamim</i>, was written large, as follows תמים תהיה עם ה' אל-היך.

<b>You shall be pure-hearted with the L-rd your G‑d.</b><br>That is, even when you study Torah, of which it is said: “The Torah of G‑d is perfect”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Temimah</i>, related to the word <i>Tamim</i>, “pure hearted.”</i> (Psalms 19:8), you must still be “pure-hearted with G‑d.” Do not assume that this happens of itself, since the Torah is called “the Torah of G‑d,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 13:9.</i> for you must be quite careful with this. This is as the Sages said in the Mishnah: “One who walks on the road and studies, and is interrupted from his studies,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Usually translated as “and interrupts his studies.” The current translation is in keeping with the Baal Shem Tov’s reading, as will become apparent below.</i> and says, ‘How lovely is this tree, and how lovely is this field,’ is considered by the verse as if he were guilty of a mortal sin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 3:7.</i> It <i>should </i>have stated: “One who walks on the road and is interrupted from his studies,” and we would have known that he was studying. Furthermore, it says “the verse considers it…,” without stating which verse.<br>But perhaps this is speaking of a person who follows the straight way, and is nevertheless alone, in that he is not attached to G‑d. He studies, and is interrupted from his studies – that is, his attachment to G‑d is interrupted from his studies themselves. He becomes proud and haughty due to his studies, and thinks that his knowledge is his own. “How lovely is this tree,” he says, referring to himself, as it is written: “For a man is a tree of the field” (Deuteronomy 20:19). He thinks that he is “a tree that grows and becomes mighty.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Paraphrasing Daniel 4:8.</i> “How lovely is this field,” as it is written: “…break up for yourself a fallow ground…” (Jeremiah 4:3). Meaning, he claims to be preparing himself a portion in the world-to-come through his studies. Thus “the verse considers it” – that is, the verse: “You shall be whole-hearted with the L-rd your G‑d” – considers it as if he were guilty of a mortal sin. For this verse includes the entire Torah.<br><i>Kesser Shem Tov</i>, part 2, p. 22b

<b>When you go out to war against your enemies, and the L-rd your G‑d gives them into your hand, so that you will take captives.</b> (Deuteronomy 21:10)<br>Through the very devices of the evil inclination, the evil inclination itself can be defeated. If it is quick in its work to entice a person to sin, in order to fulfill G‑d’s commandment (as the Zohar relates with the parable of the prostitute<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Zohar (2:163a) defines the nature of the evil inclination with a parable: “This is like a king who had an only son, whom he loved very much. He ordered him not to not to associate with any evil woman, for whoever drew near to an evil woman is not fit to enter the king’s chamber. The son promised that he would fulfill his father’s will in love. Outside the king’s palace was a prostitute, of beautiful appearance and form. Days past, and the king said, ‘I want to see my son’s commitment to me.’ He called that prostitute and told her to seduce his son. She followed the king’s son and began to hug him and kiss him, and to seduce him in many different ways. If that son is upright, and upholds his father’s orders, he will berate her and not listen to her, and push her away. Then the father will be happy with his son, and bring him into his chamber, and give him gifts and great honor. Who caused the son to receive such honor? That prostitute.”</i>), then a person should also learn to be quick in his efforts not to listen to the evil inclination, which is the will of G‑d [for him].<br><i>Toldos Yaakov Yosef</i>, <i>Bechukosai</i>, p. 126d

<b>And you will see among the prisoners a beautiful woman…</b> (ibid. 21:11)
The word “woman” – <i>eshes</i> – is an acronym for the words “L-rd, open my lips….” “Beautiful” – <i>yefas</i> – is an acronym for “…my mouth will relate Your praise” (Psalms 51:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">אשת – <b>א</b>דנ"י <b>ש</b>פתי <b>ת</b>פתח. יפת – <b>פ</b>י <b>י</b>גיד <b>ת</b>הלתך.</i><br><i>Otzar HaChayim, Ki Setze</i>

<b>And you will see among the prisoners a beautiful woman and you desire her, and you take her as a wife.</b> (ibid. 21:11)<br>This is also a promise. When G‑d gives the evil inclination into your hands, then “you will see” how the Divine Presence, which is “a beautiful woman,” is in captivity (so to speak). “And you desire her,” to redeem her from captivity, “and you take her as a wife.”<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Ki Setze</i>

Comment 5

<b>She must take off her captive's garb.</b> (Ibid. 21:13)<br>I already explained in the name of my grandfather [the Baal Shem Tov] that extraneous thoughts come to a person because the holy spark within the letters of these thoughts desires to be fixed, raised to its source and rectified. In the upper worlds, the letters of all foreign thoughts are purified lights. However, they descend to the depths and are enclothed in filthy garments, as my grandfather explained: “She must take off her captive's garb.” You must not take them in their filthy garments. Rather, you should remove from them their filthy garments; then their light will shine like the dawn.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim, Vayechi</i>

<b>If a man commits a sin</b> (<i>chet</i>, חֵטְא) <b>worthy of death…</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22)<br>Reish Lakish said, “Great is the power of <i>teshuva</i>, for a person’s intentional sins become like unintentional sins...” Really? But Reish Lakish also said: “Great is the power of <i>teshuva</i>, for a person’s intentional sins become like merits...” There is no contradiction. The first case speaks about <i>teshuva</i> out of fear [of punishment], the second speaks about <i>teshuva</i> out of love [of G‑d].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 86b.</i><br>G‑d’s glory fills the entire world. Even the existence of sin and the pleasure of the sinner come from the Supernal Pleasure. For there is an attribute called “delight” (<i>chemdah</i>), from which G‑d draws upon the entire creation: man, beasts, animals, insects, etc., as we clearly see.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Every creature in the world takes pleasure in something. That pleasure is derived from the Supernal pleasure whose source is G‑d. This is true even of the pleasure a person derives from sin.</i> And within every delight are [the Names] Y-H-V-H and Adnut. Before the delight is experienced, it is Y-H-V-H, and after it is experienced, Adnut is created. Now, the letter <i>ches</i> from the word <i>chet </i>refers to the eight letters of these two Names together, and the letter <i>tes</i> in the word refers to the goodness hidden within it. Whereas the letter <i>aleph</i> is silent.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The letter <i>aleph</i> is not pronounced in the word. It refers to G‑d who is hidden in the sin. See the following pieces.</i> This is <i>chet</i>.<br><i>Ketones Passim</i>, p. 35b
There are thirteen principles of Torah interpretation. One of them is <i>kal v’chomer</i> (“from lesser to greater”).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. one deduces the law of a greater or more stringent case from that which applies to a lesser one. The Baal Shem Tov relates to this as a universal spiritual principle: when physical delight is enjoyed below (“lesser”), it should awaken spiritual delight Above (“greater”).</i> By evoking pleasure below the same trait should be aroused Above – <i>kal v’chomer</i>. However, the “shell” of sin prevents the arousal of this goodness Above. But when a person does <i>teshuva</i>, the element of evil and the shell are removed, and the hidden goodness left behind. Then goodness is also evoked Above, and sins are transformed into merits. However, this is only for a person who succumbed to temptation, not for one who intentionally sought to anger G‑d.<br><i>Ibid</i>.

Comment 8

The letter <i>aleph</i> is silent (in the word <i>chet</i>) to teach us that the Master of the World – the <i>Alupho shel Olam</i> – is concealed there; for without Him, “no man can lift his hand,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 41:44</i> whether small or great.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, <i>Ekev</i>

Comment 9

The reason why the letter <i>aleph</i> is not pronounced is because the sinner, at the moment he wants to sin, forgets the <i>Alupho shel Olam</i>.<br><i>Ibid</i>., <i>Likutim</i> to <i>parashas Devorim</i>

Comment 10

I heard from my Master that the <i>Alupho shel Olam</i> is hidden within sin. That is, the letter <i>aleph</i> can not be heard when pronouncing the word, and it is written last. So too in the word “impure” (<i>tuma</i>, טמא), the <i>aleph</i> is also silent and last.<br>Understand this! For when a person sins, his awareness of G‑d<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“Da’at”</i> leaves him, as the Sages said: “A person does not sin unless a spirit of folly enters him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sotah</i> 3a.</i> He imagines then that G‑d has abandoned the world and is unaware of him. For if he knew and believed that G‑d is aware of everything that he does, and watches over him constantly, he would never sin.<br>But this is a total falsehood, for G‑d’s providence is there too, for if you could imagine that He were to remove His influence for even an instant, G‑d forbid, the person would immediately die. He would not have the power to do anything. The Holy One is certainly there, though greatly concealed. This is alluded to by the silent <i>aleph</i>, which refers to the <i>Alupho shel Olam</i>.<br><i>Ibid. parashas Emor</i>

<b>If a man has committed a sin (<i>chet</i>) worthy of death, and is executed, and you hang him on a tree, you must not allow his body to remain on the tree overnight, but you must bury it on the same day.</b> (ibid. 21:22)<br>There is a problem with this verse. A <i>chet</i> is an unintentional sin. Why should he receive the death penalty, which applies only to intentional sins?<br>The answer is that the sin of spilling seed is a capital offense, even when it happens unintentionally.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Such as in a nocturnal emission.</i> Because the first time it happens, the <i>Sitra Achara</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The “Side of Evil.”</i> removes the person’s <i>nefesh</i>, the second time, his <i>ruach</i>, and the third time, his <i>neshama</i>. It leads him into the <i>kelipot</i> so that he rejects all rebuke, and the result is death, G‑d forbid.<br>This is the meaning of: “If a man has committed a <i>chet</i>.” That is, the type of unintentional sin that nonetheless carries the death penalty; i.e. spilling seed. “And you hang him on a tree” – that is, even if you hang him on the Tree of Life and admonish him, he won’t accept it. Therefore, “you must not allow his body to remain on the tree overnight, but you must bury it on the same day.” That is, the moment he enters the aspect of “day” – “his day is pure”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berachos</i> 2a.</i> – in order to purify his soul, then “you must bury it” – i.e. separate the dross from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, sin causes a person to become insensitive to spiritual admonition. However, there is a moment when a sinner enters the aspect of “day,” and has an arousal of spiritual purity.

<b>You must not allow his body to remain on the tree overnight, but you must bury it on the same day.</b><br>If you need to add onto a cemetery (G‑d forbid!), you must do so as follows. First, ten men, and no less, must circle the place that they want to add on seven times. With each time around, at each of the four corners of the area, they should recite Psalms 102, 103, 104, and Isaiah, chapter 42, from the verse: “Sing to G‑d a new song” (verses 10-25). They should begin from the south-east corner, and while still there, recite Psalm 102. They should begin to encircle the area and recite: “May the pleasant of the L‑rd be upon us, etc” (Psalm 90:17) as they go, until they reach the north-east corner, where they should say Psalm 103. They should continue on from there, saying “May the pleasantness, etc.” until they reach the north-west corner, where they should recite Psalm 104. They should continue going around, saying “May the pleasantness…” until they reach the south-west corner, where they should recite Isaiah, chapter 42: “Sing to G‑d a new song.” When they finish the first cycle, they should recite “<i>Ana bakoach</i>…,”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The 42 word prayer written by Rabbi Nechunia ben HaKaneh, found in most prayerbooks in the <i>Korbonot</i> section, or in the prayers following the recitation of <i>Sefiras ha’Omer.</i></i> concentrating on the first name derived from the first verse.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The first letters of the 42 word prayer together constitute the 42 letter name of G‑d.

For instance, the “<i>ana bakoach</i>” verse reads as follows: אָנָּא בְּכֹחַ גְּדֻלַּת יְמִינְךָ תַּתִּיר צְרוּרָה, the first letters of which form the Divine Name: אבגית”צ.</i> They should follow this procedure after each round, reciting “<i>Ana bakoach</i>” each time, and concentrating on one of the seven names, until they finish all seven names in the seven rounds. And when they start to build the walls of the new area, they should not begin from the north side, nor should they begin to bury people from the north side, nor should they bury a Cohen first.<br>May it be His will that death be swallowed up forever, speedily in our day.

Everything is created for His honor, to retrieve the sparks of purity that were scattered in all things. The Congregation of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A synonym for the Shechinah.</i> then ascends with these sparks to make “a new offering to G‑d,” as in the case of “a new measure and an old measure,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnayos <i>Challah</i> 4:4</i> as is known to the wise.

<b>And your life will hang in doubt before you; and you will fear night and day, and not believe in your life.</b> (Deuteronomy 28:66)<br>You should always be able find something wrong with your service of G‑d, or some ulterior motive, even an extremely slight one, or that you are not serving G‑d with love and fear, as should be. For then, when you serve G‑d again with that commandment, you will be careful to do so with greater fear and love than before, and without the slightest ulterior motive. Afterward, you should probe even deeper to find yet another shortcoming, even in the same ac, for now you recognize G‑d’s greatness even more, and understand that according to your current level of love and fear, you have not fulfilled your obligation, and that you need even more fear. This, in turn, leads to an even greater awareness of G‑d, and the realization that even <i>that</i> level of fear and love are inadequate, so that you will discover even subtler ulterior motives that you did not recognize at first, for now you know more. Then you will be even more exacting with yourself, in order to be cleansed of all dross.<br>It comes out that you will continually ascend your entire life. For by finding more and more shortcomings in your service, you will be ever more careful with each mitzvah. However, a person who imagines that he has fulfilled his obligation with his worship and finds nothing wrong in it may not be serving G‑d at all. He is full of ulterior motives and foolishness, though he thinks that he is doing a pure form of service. For this is the way of the evil inclination. It blinds a person and makes him think that he is serving G‑d properly, whereas he never once did a mitzvah for the sake of G‑d’s Name in truth – everything was a lie. Even when a person serves G‑d without ulterior motives, so long as he does not find something lacking in his service, he will not know how to go higher level of worship.
The fundamental principle is that it is impossible to remain on one level, for “the living creatures ran and returned” (Ezekiel 1:14). If a person can not attain a higher level, then perforce, he must fall from the one he is on. It is impossible to remain on one level; either he goes up, or he goes down.<br>This is the meaning of: “Your life will hang in doubt before you.” Your life – that is, your vitality, which is your fear and love of G‑d – will hang before you as if you have not yet deserved it, as if you do not have it. “And you will fear night and day, and not believe in your life” – that is, you will not believe that you have this life; for you should always think that you have not yet attained it.

<b>You shall sell yourselves there to your enemies as slaves and maids, but no one shall buy you.</b> (ibid. 28:68)<br>Before our holy teacher, the Baal Shem Tov passed away, he said: “Let not the foot of pride overcome me…” (Psalms 36:12). And he said: “You shall sell yourselves there – in your heart – to your enemy. For you should constantly feel broken-hearted and concerned that you have been sold “to your enemy – the evil inclination – as slaves and maids.” For everything you do is in order to receive some kind of reward, like a slave or a maid. You should feel all this in your heart, for it is not written: “you were sold,” but “you have sold yourself.” Then, “no one will buy you.” That is, there is no one who can rule over you.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> 60a.</i>
These are his exact words:<br>“No one will buy you.” When your hearts will be broken and humbled, and you feel like you are full of evil, and sold and delivered into the hands of evil, that all of your mitzvos are merely in order to gain some reward, and that you are becoming slaves and maids and have never in your life performed the will and delight of your Creator, then, “no one will buy you.” <i>Vet nisht kain macht in kain shlita haben oif dir kain shum ra</i>, <i>kain mastin u’mikatreg.

He should constantly repent in joy and with a good heart to serve his Creator. Every morning, he should declare that if, G‑d forbid, the Accuser tempts him with a thought opposite G‑d’s will, it will be completely invalidated, for it is completely empty and without substance, like the thoughts and foolishness that the evil inclination puts in the heads of unintelligent people.

<b>And it shall come to pass, when he hears the words of this dread curse, that he bless himself in his heart and say: “I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart” . . .

However, other people spoke evil of them, and claimed that they did not truly love the king. And so, the king commanded each one of them to feed his dog from the king’s treasury. One of the men was very wise and said: “Why should I feed my dog and waste the king’s money? It is better if I use the money to make a crown for the king.” The second man fed his dog, but only enough to keep it alive. The third wasted the king’s money and fed his dog well.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Komarno Rebbe explains this parable as follows: “There are righteous people, intermediate, and wicked people. There are accusations against them in heaven, and the matter is clarified through the King commanding them to feed a dog – that is, the evil inclination and the impure body – from the King’s treasury. For “The earth is the L‑rd‘s and its fullness” (Psalms 24:1). The wise and righteous one makes holy Unifications from all the things in this world, and a crown for the King, until, from the abundance of spiritual light, joy, life and <i>devekus</i>, all the pleasures and desires of this world are completely annulled…. And when he eats and drinks and has marital relations, it was all done with holy Unifications, and in the brilliant light of the Shechinah, of which there is no pleasure in the world that can compare. In comparison to this delight, all material pleasures are completely nothing, and do not even make a mark. Until, from the great light of holiness, the dog is not fed at all, and it is transformed into a holy angel (i.e., the evil inclination is turned into an angel for good)… Others are not on this level, and they fast and afflict themselves and eat only enough to sustain their lives, so as not to waste the king’s money on a dog. This is also good. But the third level follows the desires of his evil heart and feeds the dog well. And so, the King sicks the evil inclination upon him. He does every sin, until he repents and finds favor.”</i> And so, the king sicked the dog on him.

Comment 5

<b>I will utterly hide My face…</b><br>This is an astonishing thing. How can G-d hide His face from Israel? How will they find life and strength, for this is their whole vitality?<br>This can be compared to a king who hid himself in his palace, surrounded by walls, fire and rivers, to keep people from approaching him. Yet he created all of it with the power of illusion. Thus, he hid himself from his children. However, one of the wiser ones began to consider the situation. Could it be that his compassionate father did not want to show his face to his beloved son? It must be a trick! His father was testing him to see if he would make the effort to come to him. Really, there was nothing concealing him. Indeed, as soon as the son threw himself into the river, it vanished like an illusion, and he passed through. So too, with the walls and the fire, until he came to the king’s chambers. Another person, a foolish one, managed to pass through the walls, and through the water, but turned back because of the fire. The parable is easily understood. 
Only when a person can sacrifice himself and push himself past the walls and come to the king will attain a higher level than before. This is the meaning of: “I will descend with you” (Genesis 46:4). That is, when you realize that “I” (i.e. G-d) is even in the descent, and that the very concealment with which He hid Himself from you is also for your benefit, then, “and I will raise you up, and you will ascend” (ibid.). That is, you will merit a higher level, which is the meaning of [the extra words] “and you will ascend.”
And this is the meaning of: “G-d who goes before you constantly”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A paraphrase of Deuteronomy 31:8, as is apparent from the second half of the verse quoted.</i> both in low times and high ones. Then, “He will not fail you, nor forsake you” (Deuteronomy 31:8), which the Targum explains translates as “He will not cast you off, nor will He distance you.” For even when He is at times concealed, He does not intend to be far from you, as we explained. This is what is alluded to in the words: “And I will hide” – that is, you should realize that “I” am in the concealment.<br><i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>, <i>Vayelech</i>

The Baal Shem Tov offered a parable for the shofar-blowers and prayer-leaders [of the high holidays]. Once, all the animals rebelled against the lion, their king. The king was furious, and his anger burned within him. And so, the animals sought a way to pacify him. The clever fox spoke up and said to them, “Follow me to the king. I know three hundred parables that draw the heart. Perhaps I will be able to assuage him.” And so they went with him. As they were going, while still far from the king’s court, the fox said to them, “My brothers, please do not be upset with me, since I was the one who suggested that we appease the king with the beautiful parables. However, I’ve forgotten some of them.” But they said to him, “Perhaps the king will be appeased with the parables that you still remember.”<br>When they arrived at the court of the king, the fox spoke up again. “Please do not be angry with me, but I have forgotten everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The parable is quoted in <i>Ben Poras Yosef</i>, p. 44b in the name of the Midrash Rabbah (<i>Vayishlach</i> 78:7), which has a different end to the parable: “The fox said to them, “I forgot everything; therefore, let each one appease the king as best as he can.” On this, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef writes: “We have to understand the intention of the fox. What did he think at first, and what did he think in the end? It seems to me that the clever fox meant for them all to humble themselves before the king, and to appease him. But had he not told them that he had the means to do so, they would never have gone to the king. Afterward, however, when he saw that they had become too self-assured, by overly trusting in him and his parables, he told them that he had forgotten them all. Then they would be humbled, and each one would make his own effort to appease the king.”</i> Nevertheless, follow me. Perhaps G‑d will grant us mercy and grace before the king, and he will be willing to hear the voice of our cries. For we have no recourse left but to cry out to the king.”<br>When the animals heard these words, they heeded the fox and went with him to the king, where they fell to the earth upon their faces. “Our lord, the king” the fox said, “may our words be pleasing to you. At first, we were ashamed and embarrassed to raise our faces to you. But since I was an expert in parables and verses that appeal to the heart, I convinced them, and they said, ‘We will follow you, perhaps you will be able to appease the king with your words and your pleasant parables.’ But what should I do now that I have forgotten them? Behold, we are like clay in the hands of the potter. In your hand is life and death. We seek your face amidst tears and cries. May your compassion be aroused upon us. Do not destroy us. Show us your gratuitous love, for that is your way.”<br>When the king heard they cries and their broken heartedness, he showed them favor and forgave them. The parable is easily understood.<br><i>Ahavas Shalom, Nitzavim</i>

There is a wonderful parable for the shofar-blower. A great and awesome king sent his sons hunting. But they became lost and cried out – perhaps their mother would hear them. But there was no answer. Then, they said to themselves, “Perhaps we have forgotten our father’s language. That is why he doesn’t hear our cries. Therefore, we should cry out in a voice without words.” They all decided to send one of them to cry out, but they warned him, “Make sure that you understand that we all depend upon you.”<br>This is the parable’s meaning. The Holy One sent us [into this world] to uplift the sparks of holiness. But we strayed from our Father; perhaps, because we have forgotten His language and are unable to pray in words. Let us send the shofar-blower to arouse compassion on us, in a voice without words. “But realize and be careful that all of us – men, woman and children – are depending upon you.”
Nevertheless, the shofar-blower should think of himself as nothing. He is only like a bagpipe that is full of holes, through which the music emerges. Should the skin become proud because the sound comes out of it? The same applies to a person. His thoughts, speech and character traits sit in him like in a vessel. Why should he be proud?

Succot



Comment 1

When the Baal Shem Tov first took up residence here in Mezhibuz, there were great rabbis among us who opposed his way. They visited him during the holiday of Succos and told him that his succah was unfit according to Torah law. The Baal Shem Tov argued that his succah was fit. Then, he rested his head in his hands for a few moments, and when he opened them, they held a piece of parchment on which it was written: “The succah of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov <i>is</i> fit. Thus says Metat, the Prince of the Countenance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Metat (short for “Metatron”) is the highest angel among the entire heavenly assembly.</i>
That parchment was inherited by the Baal Shem Tov’s grandson, the holy rabbi of Sidilkov (author of <i>Degel Machane Ephraim</i>). Whenever someone would get sick, he would tell [the family] to place the parchment under the sick person’s head, who would immediately recover. This continued for two years. They would put the parchment under the pillow of the head of every sick person, who would immediately get better. During that entire two year period, not one person in the city died. Once, however, they put it under the head of a sick person, and it disappeared. The rabbi explained that it had been revealed to him that heaven was not pleased with what he was doing, for all those born must eventually die.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pirkei Avos</i> 4:22.</i> Therefore, he had prayed that they take the parchment back.<br>I heard from honest people who heard from the Tzaddik, Rabbi Yoskie, the grandson of the “Degel” that he himself saw the parchment in his grandfather’s possession.<br>From a Letter of the Rabbi of Mezhibuz

Comment 4

<b>So Moses the servant of the L‑rd died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the L‑rd.</b> (Ibid. 34:5)<br>Could Moses have already died when he wrote, “And Moses died”? Rather, Moses wrote up until this point, and from there onward, Joshua wrote. Rabbi Meir said, “Is it possible that the Sefer Torah [that Moses wrote] was lacking something? He said, “Take this Sefer Torah”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. in its completed form, with all the words and letters.</i> (ibid. 31:26). Rather, the Holy One dictated it and Moses wrote it in tears (<i>b’dimah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on this verse, based upon <i>Bava Basra</i> 15a.</i>These holy words do not seem to have any meaning. Rashi asks simply, “Could Moses have already died?” for it is impossible to say that he was alive when he wrote “And Moses died.” One must say that he was dead, which makes Rashi’s question a good one. But how did Rashi answer it, by saying that Moses wrote in tears? Does the fact that he wrote it in tears help? The original question still applies: How did he write “And Moses died” while he was still alive?
This is indeed how it was. For it is an amazing thing to everyone how the Torah preceded the creation of the world by two thousand years.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> 8:2.</i> For how were all the holy stories of the Torah written then – about the creation of the world, Adam and Eve, Noah, the holy Forefathers, and all the other things from “In the beginning” until “in the eyes of all Israel”?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The last words of the Torah (Deuteronomy 34:12).</i> Those events had not yet occurred. Even more problematic is the fact that death only entered the world with the sin of Adam. Had he not sinned, there would be no death, for he had free will. How was the topic of death written in the Torah so far in advance: for instance, “And so-and-so died,” or “When a man dies in a tent” (Numbers 19:14). Adam had not yet sinned, and even though everything is foreseen [by G‑d], permission is granted.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., permission is granted for individuals to act as they choose. See Maimonides and Tosephos Yom Tov on <i>Pirkei Avos</i> 3:15.</i>
The truth is that the holy Torah was originally created only as a mass of letters. All the letters from “In the beginning” until “in the eyes of all Israel” were not arranged into the words that we see today, such as “In the beginning G‑d created” or “Go from your land,” etc: rather, all these words were mixed together. Then, whenever something happened in the world, these letters arranged themselves into patterns of words, and a story was created from the event. For instance, with the creation of the world and the story of Adam and Eve, those letters drew close to one another and formed those words that relate this event. Likewise, when someone died, the words were formed, “and so-and-so died.” So too, when other events occurred, words of Torah were immediately formed from those letters according to the act. Had a different event occurred, the letter combinations would have been different, for the holy Torah is the wisdom of G‑d and has no end.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. there is no end to the possible combinations of letters.</i>
It turns out that when the time came for Moses to die, the entire Torah up until, “So Moses died” had already been arranged into words. For all these events had already transpired. Only the letters of the words “So Moses died” until “in the eyes of all Israel” had not yet been arranged into words, because Moses was still alive. However, it was necessary for Moses to write all the words [of the Torah], as it says: “Take this Sefer Torah,” which means that it needed to be complete, and furthermore, it is called by his name, as in: “Remember the Torah of Moses, My servant” (Malachi 3:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>sefer Machazeh Avraham</i> adds another reason, in that the Sefer Torah that Moses wrote was not able to be missing one letter.</i><br>What then did G‑d do? He told Moses the letters that remained as they were still intermingled, without being combined into words. This is how Moses wrote them. Later, when he died, these letters immediately formed the words from the verse “And Moses… died” until “in the eyes of all Israel.” Thus, Moses <i>did</i> write the entire Torah, and it is correct to say: “Take this Sefer Torah,” and to be called by his name, for he really did write the entire thing from beginning to end.
This is what Rashi wrote, that G‑d dictated it to Moses, and Moses wrote it. However, so as to avoid the problem as to how Moses wrote “And he died” while still being alive, Rashi explains that Moses wrote it in tears. The word “tears” – <i>dimah</i> – also has the meaning of “admixture,” as in “<i>hamidameh</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gitten</i> 52b.</i> or <i>terumah midamas</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When <i>terumah</i> – the priestly tithes – becomes accidentally mixed with <i>chulin</i> – unsanctified food, the result is called <i>demai</i>, which means an “admixture.”</i> which are mixed together. So too, Moses wrote it a letter at a time, mixed together. After he died, the words were formed from “So Moses died” until “in the eyes of all Israel.”<br>Understand this!<br><i>Pitgamei Kedushin, Ge’ulas Yisroel</i>

<b>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded . . . to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal</b> . . . <b>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains.</b> (Esther 1:10-12)<br>The Talmud states that she was ordered to appear naked.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Megilah</i> 12b. That is, <i>only</i> in her crown, and nothing else.</i> This is because the “impure shells,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Impure shells – <i>k</i><i>elipot –</i>are the forces of evil caused by the “breaking of the vessels,” the initial act of creation in which too much Divine light entered the sefirot, causing them to shatter and fall to the lower worlds. The <i>kelipot</i> are those aspects of creation that conceal G-d, yet depend upon this hidden spark of Divinity for their existence. When this spark is removed (as through the act of prayer or the performance of mitzvot), the “shells” disappear. The purification of the shells and the removal of their Divine content is one of the main focuses of Jewish mystical practice. See Jacob Immanuel Schochet, “Mystical Concepts in Hassidism,” printed in the back of English editions of the Tanya (Brooklyn: Kehot, 1981), chapters 10 and 11 for more on this theme. <br>The Baal Shem Tov formulated a psychological understanding of the <i>kelipot</i>, and often speaks of them as the power of the imagination or lower fears and desires that overwhelm a person (especially during prayer, etc.). However, were it not for their attachment to holiness, a “face” that they wear that makes these illusions seem valid, it would be impossible to be seduced by them. To see the <i>kelipot </i>“naked,” is to recognize them as mere illusion, without substance of their own. This causes their demise. The “king,” in the verse above, alludes to G-d. G-d destroys the <i>kelipot</i> by revealing that they have no objective substance of their own.</i> to not have any real existence in the world, only when they are enclothed in some aspect.

It is known that the [evil] inclination clothes itself in mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">That is, sometimes the evil inclination tricks a person into sinning by convincing him that the act is actually a mitzvah, and that something positive will come out of it.</i> It knows that were it to overtly tell someone to sin, the person would never listen.

<b>Now when the turn of every maiden came to go in to king Achashverus. . .</b> (ibid. 2:12)<br>This refers to the spark of holiness that exists in the depths of the impure shells. Because in that place, all the goodness has been shaken out of them, they are called “maidens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The word maiden, <i>na’arah</i>, is related to the word “to shake out,” <i>mino’ar</i>, because the holiness found in these sparks has been “shaken out” of them, until almost nothing remains.</i> However, we must be strong to free them from this enslavement, and to attach them to their source. This is “to go into the King.”

Comment 5

Nothing that a person sees or hears is accidental. In every place, there are holy sparks and holy letters that constantly long for and desire their root. Each one wants to attach itself to that which resembles it – love to love, beauty to beauty, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, fallen traits, such as materialistic loves, desire for physical beauty, are in their root desire and longing for G-d, and constantly long to ascend to their true source.</i> If a person uplifts them, his reward will be very great. For each thing has its time, as it is written: “When the turn of every maiden came to go in to king.”<br>This [fallen] thought is called “the feminine,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nukba</i>. Every lower level, that longs to ascend, is considered feminine in relationship to the level above it.</i> and wants to receive holiness. For example, one person witnesses a war [among non-Jews] and relates it to a Tzaddik. The Tzaddik lifts this up in his thoughts to G-d. It turns out that this thought was originally among the “shells,” that is, the war that the person saw between the nations. When he related it to his friend [the Tzaddik], the act became speech. And afterward, it entered into thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Baal Shem Tov is giving an example of how sparks are uplifted from among the shells. Just as there is a downward movement from thought, to speech, to action, so does the process work in reverse. A mundane sight becomes speech, when it is related, and then enters thought. In the present example, after hearing about the war, the Tzaddik might become inspired to think of G-d’s might, or His Providence, or His justice, or he might transform a lower fear of an impending battle to the higher fear of G-d.</i><br><i>Likutey Amorim</i> p. 32a.

Comment 1

<b>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go you after them.</b> (Ruth 2:9)
It is written: “A good eye will bless” (Proverbs 22:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The literal reading of this verse should be: “A good eye will be blessed.” However, without the vowel points, the verse can also be read as above, according to the interpretation of the Baal Shem Tov.</i> The eye is called Wisdom, for truly, vision is the lowest level of wisdom. And a person with a good eye, that is, with good wisdom, brings blessing wherever he gazes. When he looks at a thing, he realizes that it is nothing compared to the Blessed One. That is, it truly has no existence other than the Divinity within it, [for the] the essence of a creator is in his creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Whenever a person creates something, an essential part of his soul is captured in the creation. This is even truer of the universe, which is continually being created and sustained by G-d.</i> Without this it is nothing, as it is written: “And what are we” (Exodus 16:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When the Children of Israel complained to Moses and Aharon in the desert, after the food they took out from Egypt was exhausted, they responded: “…for He has heard your murmurings against the L-rd; and what are we, that you murmur against us?” They realized that they were nothing without the presence of G-d within them.<br>On a deeper level, the Hebrew word “what” – <i>mah</i> (מה) – corresponds to the sefirotic structure of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>. It also has the same numerical value as the word “Man” – <i>Adam</i> (אדם), because the essence of a human being is neither the body, nor the thoughts and emotions. Rather, it is the Divine soul, which derives from this supernal level.</i> Through this type of looking, one draws from His Divinity increased vitality to the thing. Thus, “A good eye will bless” that thing.<br>The opposite also applies. When a person with a bad eye looks at something and is impressed with it; for instance, [he says] “How beautiful is this thing,” then he separates it from its root and vitality, that is, from the divinity. For it is known that all vision creates a vessel, and because of this comes the evil eye, G-d save us.<br><i>Likutey Amorim</i>, p.11c
