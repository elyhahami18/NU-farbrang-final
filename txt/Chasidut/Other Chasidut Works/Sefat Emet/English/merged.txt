Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing
Rashi (2:2) explains that after creation, the world was lacking rest, and with Shabbos, the work was complete. The world was created to allow Hashem to shower His goodness upon it, but this required a space where His glory was hidden, hence the term "olam" (world), related to "he'elem" (hiddenness). The Chidushei Harim explains that for Hashem's name to be exalted, everything must be nullified to His purpose, making His name greater in the world. As it says, "Hashem saw everything He made, and it was very good," meaning everything was created for His honor.<br>Before Shabbos, the world lacked rest because Shabbos unifies all days of the week, bringing everything together in the secret of Oneness. On Shabbos, all creation is elevated, becoming one and a vessel for Hashem's will. The Midrash explains that "ויכלו" (vayechulu) means creation became a vessel, reflecting the idea of everything becoming unified. This unification is also connected to the word "כלתה" (longing), signifying nullification to Hashem's life force within everything. This rest is the root of all, as "Hashem is the place of the world," and on Shabbos, everything returns to its place, completing creation.<br>Chazal teach that the vessel for blessing is peace (shalom), and the Zohar explains that Shabbos is Hashem's name, which is peace. Before creation, Hashem's name was One, and on Shabbos, this oneness is restored, revealing His honor in creation. The purpose of creation is for Hashem's name to be one, showing His completeness. When the world becomes nullified to the Klal, which is Kneset Yisrael, His name becomes one, serving as a vessel for His essence.
Rashi quotes "Rabbi Yitzhak said: The Torah should have started at "From this very month..."...the first mitzvah...[because of] 'the strength of His deeds...". One must understand the solution given regarding all of the Torah portions from Bereshit until "...this very month". The interpretation of the matter is that the essence of the Torah is the mitzvot--this is the written Torah--but the Holy Blessed One wanted to clarify that this world and the entire Creation [exists] because of the 'power of Torah', as it says "B-reishit": He looked within the Torah and created the world [according to it]." And this matter [is in contrast] with Oral Torah, which is dependent on human activity. Thus, all the Torah portions concerned with the stories of forefathers [are there] to show how Torah was created by their deeds. This is what is meant by "the strength of His deeds"--the power that the Holy Blessed One suffused within Creation. This is why it is called "the work/deed of Creation" to declare that the world was created with ten utterances, and the life-force of the world by means of the Torah. The task of humanity, then, is to understand that every deed is a result of the Holy Blessed One's life-force. When a person performs any action, it is [only] because of the power of Torah to fulfill the will of the Creator, thus renewing the light hidden within Creation. This is hinted at in the verse "I have put my words in your mouth...who laid the foundations of the earth and say to Zion 'You are my people'." The sages interpret the verse: Don't read ami/my people--rather immi/with me, as a partner in the work of Creation. The Zohar interprets 'Zion' as the inner point within all things as a imprint and sign to remember that the Holy One is [the source] of all things. This is the life-force which animates all things. The person who clings to this inner point and all of His life-force which flows from this point becomes a partner in the work of Creation. As a result of this ..."in order that He might give them the inheritance of the nations”--an inheritance without restraints. When a person joins the natural world to its active potential, nature cannot obscure the power of holiness. 

Section 2

With G-d's Blessing Bereshit
The Zohar (Tikunei Zohar 5b) explains that the word בראשית can spell ירא שבת (fear Shabbos). This connection is understood through the explanation that בראשית ברא (Bereishis bara) means every creation (בריאה) is connected to the beginning, the source energy, the point of Hashem that gives life and existence to all creation. This is the aspect of Shabbos, as on Shabbos, every part of creation reconnects to its source, the will of Hashem.<br>The phrase "אשר ברא לעשות" (which He created to do) means Hashem gave each element in creation the energy to act in specific ways—a fire to burn, a tree to grow, and living beings to choose their actions. However, the intention is that they recognize Hashem as the source of their power, like an axe in the hand of a chopper. The entire purpose of creation is for Shabbos, when everything elevates to its source, and Hashem’s dominion becomes apparent. Rashi explains that the world was lacking rest, which is fulfilled on Shabbos when everything returns to its source. This is the main will of Hashem, completed on Shabbos.<br>The phrase ירא שבת (fear Shabbos) means having the proper fear and recognition of Hashem's dominion. This comes from the inner point called Shabbos, the main source of life. Shabbos is also a reminder of creation (זכר למעשה בראשית), emphasizing that all actions should be connected and nullified to the original intention of Hashem, the ראשית (beginning). This understanding ties Shabbos to the concept of בראשית, highlighting that Shabbos brings everything back to its divine source and purpose.

Section 3


The Midrash "I will be an Amon" (Bereishis Rabbah 1:1) states: "Just as a builder first has plans, so too HaShem looked at the Torah and created the world." It is clear that HaShem could have created the world without the Torah, but the entire creation is for the benefit of the created beings. Therefore, the creation was done in such a way that man can learn the service of HaShem from everything. This is the meaning of "He looked in the Torah and created the world" – that in everything in creation, there is an aspect of the Torah from which we can learn behavior or a secret. The Torah boasts so that man will know that the main purpose of everything is the Torah, for the entire creation was made according to the Torah, proving that it is the primary good for mankind.
Rashi (Bereishis 2:2) explains that the world was lacking rest, and when Shabbos came, there was rest. However, the concept of effort is not applicable to Hashem. During the six days of creation, the existence of the world was sustained by Hashem's energy through His expressions of creation. On Shabbos, the creation was made to exist without the constant revelation of Hashem, as the world cannot handle continuous divine revelation. Shabbos connects nature to what is above nature, making it the completion and perfection of creation, called שלום (peace).<br>Even though the days before Shabbos may seem more significant, Shabbos completes and sustains them. The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 10:9) compares Shabbos to a signet on a ring, signifying that "the world and all that is in it is Hashem’s." Bnei Yisrael testify on Shabbos that Hashem created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, showing that Hashem is the purpose of creation. Shabbos unifies everything in creation, revealing Hashem’s glory, and it is this oneness that sustains the world.<br>The phrase ויכלו, related to כלל (inclusion), means that on Shabbos, everything is included in the כלל (the whole), and Hashem’s observation of creation as "very good" applies to this unified state. This inclusion in the כלל of Shabbos gives creation its existence. Therefore, every Jew must integrate into כלל ישראל on Shabbos. The Zohar (1:47:2) explains that Hashem completed His work through Shabbos, making it the culmination and perfection of creation.
The praise in the creation of the heavens and the earth, as it says, "See who created these," is the wonder of how HaShem's energy can spread into physical things. This is the meaning of the word "creation" (בריאה): to reveal and spread from something internal to the external part of the world.

Section 4

5635
The Midrash on "Vayechulu" quotes Mishlei, "Remove the dross from silver." The Ohr HaChayim explains that "vayechulu" is connected to "כלתה" (kaltah), meaning "my soul longs." The name "eretz" (earth) signifies its desire to fulfill the Creator's will, highlighting the unique challenge of this world filled with conflicting desires. This is in contrast to higher, more perfect worlds. The confusion ("תוהו") of this world is refined through the Torah, as "יהי אור" (Let there be light) symbolizes the Torah's illumination. On Shabbos, true desire for Hashem is revealed, elevating everything to its source. "Remove the dross from silver" (כסף, kesef) connects to "longing" (כסופין, kisufin).<br>Initially, Hashem's creation was general, followed by specifics, and then a return to the general, illustrating "כלל ופרט וכלל" (general, specific, general) and "כלל צריך לפרט" (the general needs the specific). The second "klal" is more significant. Weekdays represent the "prat" (details), expanding the "klal" and integrating details. The Midrash says the world expanded until Hashem said, "די" (enough). Every action, even by the simplest person, has an effect, especially when done for Heaven's sake. On Shabbos, all creation returns to its original "klal" and source, testifying to Hashem.<br>"Vayechulu" means everything becomes one vessel for Hashem's glory. The world lacked "menucha" (rest) until Shabbos, which represents the culmination and nullification of all actions to their source, achieving true rest. Shabbos is the "signet on the stamp," sealing this concept. Bnei Yisrael were given the power to sanctify time, such as determining Rosh Chodesh and Sabbatical and Jubilee years, when they accepted the Torah. This is hinted at in "the hand of the tongue," referring to the holy language, lashon hakodesh, given to Bnei Yisrael. Before the Tower of Babel, everyone spoke one language, but after the languages were mixed, lashon hakodesh was given specifically to Bnei Yisrael at the giving of the Torah.
In the Sefer Kol Simcha, it is explained that Hevel's offering was better than Kain's because Kain's offering was brought "Miketz hayamim" (at the end of days), implying that he was motivated by the remembrance of death. In contrast, Hevel brought his offering "Gam hu" (also himself), while still alive, with a genuine desire to connect to Hashem.<br>The essence of a korban (sacrifice) is for a person to use it as a means to connect to Hashem. The primary intention behind all mitzvot is not the act itself but the connection it facilitates with Hashem. As the Zohar explains, mitzvot are various ways to connect to Hashem. This is reflected in the phrase "Hevel hevi gam hu," indicating that Hevel brought himself along with the offering, thereby aligning his actions with the true purpose of the mitzvah.

Section 5

5636
With G-d's Blessing From Shabbat Bereshit
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 10:2) on "Remove the dross from silver, and a vessel emerged for the smith" (Mishlei 25:4) likens creation to two beautiful vessels in a bath: their craftsmanship is revealed only when the water is drained. Similarly, as long as there was chaos, creation couldn't be seen. The verse “And He completed His work on the seventh day” seems contradictory since Hashem rested on the seventh day. Rashi (Bereishis 2:2) explains that while creation was complete, it lacked rest, which Shabbos provided.<br>The deeper meaning is that Shabbos involved no creation, only cessation of work, which sustains all creation. This is like the concept in Yechezkel 1:15, “The creatures were dashing to and fro,” indicating that every receiver must nullify itself to its giver. The closer it connects to its source, the more lasting its reception. On Shabbos, all creations elevate to their source, and by resting, they testify to their Master, completing creation. The Midrash further explains that everything has waste, but as creations draw closer to their creator, the waste falls away like wax melting before a fire.<br>Each weekday is described as having night and day, symbolizing confusion followed by clarity. On Shabbos, creation is elevated, separating the dross from the silver through the desire to connect to the life force. This cessation of labor sustains creation. The Zohar (Tikunim 5b) explains that בראשית (Bereishit) spells ירא שבת (fear Shabbos), indicating that fear must accompany every action, as its end is to return to its source. Shabbos represents the completion of all deeds, returning everything to its Master, making it the purpose of creation. The signet signifies that everything is defined by its end, its true purpose, and final place.
Rashi explains that the Torah begins with Bereishis to give Bnei Yisrael the heritage of the nations. The Ramban queries this, suggesting that the Torah starts with Bereishis to teach an important lesson in emuna—that Hashem created everything and is the purpose of everything. To explain, the Torah has multiple levels, being composed of Hashem's names. In the higher realms, the Torah is understood through these names, while for us, it is known through mitzvot and laws. Everything in the world, including its creation, comes from the Torah, as it says, “He looked in the Torah and created the world.” Hashem could have created the world without the Torah, but He used it to ensure that creation would follow Bnei Yisrael.<br>The Torah was offered to other nations before Bnei Yisrael, indicating its application to the entire world. The Torah is infinite, with deep levels applicable even to the nations. This is referenced in Devarim 33:2, “Hashem came from Sinai, and shone from Seir, He appeared from Paran among a chariot of myriads, from His right hand a fiery law for them.” The Torah was given to Bnei Yisrael on all levels. For Bnei Yisrael, these levels were not necessary; the Torah did not need to be clothed in all these actions but was done so to “give them the inheritance of nations.” The Zohar (Emor 3:97a) likens the Torah to a tree of life with fruits, leaves, shells, roots, and the trunk. Everything has a connection to the Torah, with Bnei Yisrael attached to the trunk.<br>Even though simple Jews may only connect to the external layers of the Torah, they are still attached to the trunk. This external connection helps draw all of creation to Hashem through the Torah. This level down for Bnei Yisrael is necessary for reaching new heights, as the highest levels depend on the lowest. Just as the Torah spans from the beginning to the end, Bnei Yisrael must descend to the depths to ascend to the greatest heights. This answers the Ramban's query: while we now need emuna, the essence of Bnei Yisrael, connected to the trunk of the Torah, inherently embodies truth. The need for emuna is to reach this truth, fulfilling the purpose of giving Bnei Yisrael the inheritance of the nations.

Section 6

5637
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabba 10:1) explains the pasuk “and the heavens and earth were completed” to mean that everything has a border and an end, except the Torah, which is infinite. This is because Hashem is infinite, yet everything He created can only receive from His holiness in a measured amount. This concept is embodied in Shabbos, where the energy for the six days of the week comes from Shabbos.<br>The word “ויכל” (completed) in “and He completed His work on the seventh day” is related to the word “וכל” (measure), indicating that Hashem measured out the life force for all creation through Shabbos. Similarly, a person receiving from Hashem must have the ability to contain this energy, which involves perfecting one's traits so that the received light does not go astray. Therefore, the more one perfects their traits, the more they can receive Hashem's blessings, as Hashem measures measure for measure.
Rashi (Bereishis 1:1) explains that Hashem originally intended to create the world with the attribute of judgement, but seeing that the world could not endure, He combined it with mercy. This does not imply a retraction, as Hashem's decisions are perfect. Instead, it teaches us that our intention should always be to act with strict adherence to justice, striving to fulfill Hashem's will perfectly. However, since we cannot achieve this on our own, Hashem combines mercy to allow us to complete our actions properly.<br>Our intention must always aim for perfection. It is known that our thoughts connect to the highest source of thoughts, and our actions to the source of all actions. Hashem's original intention to create the world with judgement means our desire should align with this standard. In reality, our actions can only be completed with Hashem's help, as expressed in “The G-d who completes for me.” This completion is through mercy, as strict judgement requires us to do everything ourselves, which is impossible. When our intentions are correct, Hashem assists us, combining judgement with mercy.

Section 7

5638
With G-d's Blessing Briefly on Shabbat Bereshit
Rashi (Bereishis 2:3) explains, “And He completed His work on the Seventh day,” meaning that when Shabbos came, there was rest, and the work was finished and completed. The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 11:9) states that the work meant for Shabbos was done on the sixth day, implying that man, created on the sixth day along with animals, ideally should have been created on Shabbos.<br>The explanation is that man, being a combination of physicality and spirituality, connects the six days of the week to Shabbos. Our sages taught that man was created last to immediately enter Shabbos, signifying that man connects all creation to the upper worlds. The phrase “On it He rested from all the work that He created to do” means that physical creation ceased on Shabbos, but Shabbos itself gives the world its true existence. Shabbos's holiness lies in its spirituality, which forms the essence of everything created.<br>The sages hinted at this in the Midrash, comparing creation to a ring without a signet. The six days of creation without Shabbos lack recognition of Hashem. Everything Hashem made was for His sake, and this realization—that all creation acknowledges and nullifies itself to Hashem—gives the world its existence. This realization occurs on Shabbos when the entire creation testifies to Hashem’s greatness.
Rashi (Bereishis 1:1) explains that Hashem originally intended to create the world with the attribute of judgement, but seeing that the world could not endure, He combined it with mercy. This raises the question: how can it say "created" if it was only His intention? Moreover, can there be a change in Hashem's thoughts? <br>The answer is that Hashem’s intention was to create the world in such a way that our desire should be to fulfill the Torah perfectly, as originally intended. Even though we can't achieve this perfection in action due to the world's imperfections, our desire should be aligned with judgement. Since we can't complete everything perfectly, Hashem combined judgement with mercy, allowing us to fulfill His will.<br>The Zohar (1:5a) explains that just as Hashem created the world through the Torah, the tzadikim sustain the world through their effort in Torah. Hashem created the world dependent on the Torah, as indicated by "the sixth day," implying that creation was conditional on Bnei Yisrael accepting the Torah. This ensures that tzadikim control creation through Torah. This is why the Torah begins with Bereishis, to show that the world’s existence depends on Bnei Yisrael. Hashem combined judgement with mercy so that through the thoughts and efforts of the tzadikim, they awaken Hashem’s mercy, allowing them to sustain the world. During the weekdays, there is always a lack unless one yearns for Shabbos. Despite being busy with various tasks, one should aim to stay focused on serving Hashem, which leads to the special assistance of Shabbos, the extra soul, and the combination with mercy.

Section 8

5639
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 10:2) on the verse "The dross having been separated from the silver, a vessel emerged for the smith" (Mishlei 25:4) compares creation to hidden craftsmanship revealed when a bath is emptied. Hashem created the world for His honor, with His glory hidden, obscured by darkness. On Shabbos, Bnei Yisrael testify to Hashem's creation, revealing this hidden truth.<br>Shabbos is described as a seal, indicating that it reveals Hashem's creation to all. The term "vayechulu" signifies completion, and "צורף" (smith) means to connect. Through Shabbos, the world becomes unified, and impurities are nullified, revealing the ultimate truth.

Section 9

5640
The letter "heh" in יום הששי is extra. The Sfas Emes explains there are two types of "heh." One is the significant "heh" in בי' ה' צור עולמים, symbolizing creation. The other is the small "heh" in בהבראם, representing nature. Shabbos brings an additional light, a taste of the world to come, which comes from an upper world. This addition was completed with the giving of the Torah, the purpose of creation, along with Bnei Yisrael, both originating from the source before nature spread out.<br>The Midrash on Mishlei (8:30) explains, "I will be to Him an Amon" (אמון, confidant, linked to אומן, craftsman). Hashem looked into the Torah (the blueprint) to create the world. The future tense "I will be" indicates Hashem's ongoing protection, which sustains the world through the Torah, called "Reishis." As it states, "The eyes of Hashem are on the land from the beginning (Reishis) of the year." Hashem's protection at the source renews creation constantly.<br>In summary, the extra "heh" in יום הששי signifies the enhanced state brought by Shabbos, reflecting the light of the world to come. This was realized with the giving of the Torah, aligning with the creation's purpose and Bnei Yisrael's role. Hashem’s continuous renewal and protection of creation through the Torah highlight these interconnected concepts.
The Midrash explains that Avraham did not observe Shabbos, so he inherited the world in a limited way, whereas Yaakov, who observed Shabbos, inherited it without limits. The Sfas Emes elaborates that everything sustaining us is connected to a higher, unlimited source but becomes limited when manifested in this world.<br>This concept applies to a person's soul, which is unlimited but becomes limited by the body it inhabits. As a person grows, the soul spreads throughout the body. Similarly, Shabbos, the source of all blessings, transcends nature, time, and space but provides a "measured" amount based on the world's spiritual level. This duality of Shabbos being both a measure and infinite is reflected in the concept of Eretz Yisrael, which expands like a deer's skin.<br>Avraham contributed to the world's existence, but his connection to Yishmael and Eisav limited him to nature's constraints. In contrast, Yaakov revealed the inner spirituality of Shabbos, inheriting the world without limits. Shabbos, as the source of all blessings, imparts blessings to the other days. The verse "Hashem blessed the seventh day" indicates that all other days receive their blessings through Shabbos. As Yechezkel 1:14 states, "The creatures were dashing to and fro," illustrating the dynamic of returning to the source on Shabbos, receiving new life force for the week ahead, as explained by the Ohe HaChaim.
To understand the pasuk "and the world was unformed and void...and there was light," we learn that in serving Hashem, one should not be disheartened by initial confusion and complexity. This state of "unformed and void" is natural at the beginning. When the true light is revealed, one must separate it from all mixtures of evil, as it is written, "And Hashem separated between the light and darkness."

Section 10

5641
The Midrash explains that when the world was completed, it became a vessel. On Shabbos, Hashem spreads a "sukkah of Shalom" over us, connecting everything to its spiritual source in Heaven. Each element in creation has a corresponding spiritual force, as illustrated by the Midrash's teaching that every blade of grass has an angel urging it to grow. This concept is reflected in the division of the waters above and below, with the upper waters being the spiritual source for the lower waters.<br>On Shabbos, the spiritual elements descend and connect with the physical, symbolizing the "sukkah of Shalom." This connection is why we greet the angels with "Shalom Aleichem" on Friday night. The infinite nature of this spiritual connection explains why the Midrash says that Yaakov, who observed Shabbos, inherited the world without borders. Shabbos creates a vessel that holds all blessings, linking us to the infinite and limitless energy of the spiritual source.
Rashi explains that Hashem initially intended to create the world with the attribute of judgment but saw it could not endure on judgment alone. Therefore, He combined it with mercy. The concept of "preceding" refers to teshuva, which retroactively corrects actions. <br>Hashem did not change His mind; the world was created with judgment, but mercy was incorporated, allowing humans to invoke mercy through Torah and mitzvot. This is evident in history: before Avraham, the world lacked stability and was destroyed by the flood. With Avraham, whose name hints at creation (בהבראם), the world entered 2000 years of Torah, gaining its enduring existence through the integration of mercy.

Section 11

5642
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabba 10:2) explains that the word ויכלו (vayechulu) is related to כלי (vessels), indicating creation as a vessel for Hashem. The concept involves klal-prat-klal, where creation could have been done with one utterance (Bereishis), the source of everything. The division into ten utterances allows for the punishment of evildoers and the reward of the righteous, who unify the parts back into a whole.<br>On an individual level, many things need repair (prat), and tzadikim unify these parts with the klal. This correction, more precious to Hashem, is the true essence of creation. This is reflected in the Mishnah in Avot (4:17), emphasizing the value of teshuva and good deeds in this world. The phrase "Hashem saw everything He created and it was very good" (ויכלו) signifies this completion, awakening the source and leading to Shabbos. Shabbos, blessed and sanctified, is the soul of creation, bringing unity and an extra level of spiritual completion.<br>In the future, this will culminate in a day that is entirely Shabbos. Currently, evildoers disrupt this unity, but Bnei Yisrael, who achieve unification, experience a taste of the world to come through the "Sukkah of Shalom" on Shabbos. True perfection will only be achieved when the name of Amalek is erased, and all parts are unified in serving Hashem.
The Midrash explains that "I will be to Him a Amon - confidant" (אמון) connects to אומן (craftsman), meaning Hashem used the Torah as a blueprint for creation. The phrase "I will be" (future tense) signifies that the world continues to exist through those who engage in Torah. The verse "And He saw everything that He created and it was very good" refers to Hashem seeing the righteous deeds of tzadikim, whose engagement with Torah sustains the world. This justifies the creation in ten utterances, rewarding tzadikim who maintain it.<br>This concept will be fully realized in the future when everything is perfected through the power of Torah and the righteous. The term "I will be" indicates that the Torah's wisdom will ultimately be proven as the best plan, fulfilling its purpose perfectly.

Noach



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Help Parshat Noach I do not properly remember.
The Zohar states that "Noach" symbolizes Shabbos, as it says, "He rested on the Seventh day." The concept of rest (menucha) is about being connected to one's source, where there is no effort. When a person is aligned with their source, they experience constant rest, as everything becomes unified, and they are always drawn towards fear of Heaven. This is reflected in the saying, "whoever accepts the yoke of Heaven, the yoke of kingship and worldly concerns is removed from them."<br>Noach was called a tzadik (righteous) because righteousness implies opposition, similar to a legal judgment where one is right and another wrong. A chasid, on the other hand, has no dealings with the yetzer hara (evil inclination) at all. The distinction between Avraham and Yaakov illustrates this: Avraham, who did not explicitly observe Shabbos, inherited the land in measure, while Yaakov, who established Shabbos boundaries, received an inheritance without limits. This is because Shabbos pertains to the days of work, spreading its light into the week. Noach's perfection in his generation indicates an internal life force within the natural world.<br>Yaakov, who engaged in the hiddenness of the six days, revealed the internal workings in a measured way, leading to an unlimited Shabbos experience. Avraham, operating above nature, was constantly attached to the source, making Shabbos unnecessary for him. This explains why Noach needed Hashem's help, as he was within the concealment and required divine protection. The Medrash's parable of the king helping someone stuck in the mud illustrates Noach's need for extra guidance, highlighting the unique roles of Noach, Avraham, and Yaakov in their spiritual journeys.
Rashi explains that the primary "descendants" of a righteous person are their mitzvot and good deeds. The Sfas Emes elaborates that Rashi does not say the primary descendants are the mitzvot themselves, but rather emphasizes the person, specifically the tzadik, who performs the mitzvot with all their energy. It is the person’s full engagement in the mitzvot that causes a lasting effect.<br>This is analogous to human reproduction, where the involvement of one's entire life force results in creation. Similarly, when a person performs a mitzvah with full energy, it creates a lasting impact. While every mitzvah inherently causes an effect, for it to be considered truly one's own, it depends on the individual's desire and will in performing the mitzvah.<br>Understanding the pasuk on a simple level: Since Noach was a tzadik, his descendants were naturally good. Noach's primary intent, even in procreation, was for the sake of the mitzvah, ensuring his descendants followed his righteous example.
The Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 31:1) explains that through "Chamas" (robbery), Hashem and all of creation had no benefit from mankind. The Sfas Emes elaborates that "Chamas" signifies a lack of recognition that all power comes from Hashem, resulting in everything becoming "robbery." The Chidushei Harim further explains that all sins are a form of thievery. This idea is illustrated in the Gemara (Berakhot 35a), which states that benefiting from this world without a blessing is akin to stealing from Hashem and Kneset Yisrael. When a person fails to acknowledge that all life force is from Hashem, it is as if they are stealing.<br>The notion of "the world was filled with Chamas" contrasts with "the world is filled with the glory of Hashem." When mankind wills to banish Hashem's glory, it results in their disconnection from the source of life, leading to their demise. This idea is discussed in the Zohar regarding "the teiva lifted up." The Midrash's statement that "there was no 'rest' (נח) among them" alludes to Shabbat, symbolizing rest and connection with Hashem. The pasuk "And even Noach remained" implies that while Noach was a tzadik, he could not showcase the good deeds of his generation, thus he was somewhat included in their judgment.<br>The generation of the Tower of Babel ("Haflaga") knew their master but intentionally went against Him, wanting Hashem to act according to their will through separate powers. Their punishment was the loss of unity. The Chidushei Harim explains that this unity pertains to Bnei Yisrael. True unity is applicable only to Bnei Yisrael. Our sages explain that one who keeps Shabbat, even if he sins with idol worship, will be forgiven because Shabbat represents unity. This unity is absent in idol worshippers, but keeping Shabbat indicates a connection to Hashem, demonstrating that they did not fully embrace idol worship. The punishment of the generation of Haflaga, as stated in the pasuk "They are not restrained," reflects their disconnection from Hashem, as their intent to remain unified with negative intent was thwarted.

Section 2

5632
With G-d's Help Parshat Noach
The Midrash, quoted by Rashi, states that the primary descendants (Toldos) of the righteous are their mitzvos and good deeds. The Sfas Emes explains that the tzadik's actions are nullified to the source—Hashem—and these are the true Toldos of the tzadik. The "good deeds" of the tzadikim involve connecting everything back to Hashem. The pasuk states that Hashem renews creation through His goodness (בטובו). This goodness refers to the Torah, which is called לקח טוב. The life force of the world comes from the Torah, contained in the ten utterances with which Hashem created the world. Although hidden in nature, the tzadik reveals that everything exists because of these ten utterances. Tzadikim maintain the world's existence by connecting everything to its source of life, thereby revealing Hashem’s wonders.<br>The ten generations from Adam to Noach corresponded to these ten utterances. Through their wickedness, each generation further detracted from the revelation of Hashem and disconnected from the source, until there was no life force left. The wicked destroy the world by disconnecting it from its life force. However, the tzadik Noach restored this life force, renewing the world. This is why Noach's descendants are specifically noted. <br>This concept parallels the idea expressed in the Ohr HaChaim, which explains that saying "vayechulu" on Friday night makes one a partner with Hashem in creation. The world's existence is sustained through Shabbos, as Shabbos infuses the world with additional life force. By declaring Hashem's oneness in creation through "vayechulu," man helps sustain the world, partnering with Hashem in its creation. This aligns with the idea that the inner point of everything gives it life force through Shabbos. Similarly, the tzadik embodies the concept of Shabbos, and Noach, whose name means rest, is referred to as Shabbos in the Zohar.
The Chidushei Harim, citing his teachers, explained that Noach's Ark (תיבת נח) symbolizes the words of Torah and Tefila (תיבה also means "word"). The Gemara (Makos 10a) mentions that the words of Torah protect a person, similar to how the cities of refuge protect someone who has unintentionally killed.<br>Every entity contains a life force from the Torah, which grants it existence. Although this life force is often hidden, true nullification to the Torah reveals it and renews its existence. The Zohar explains this concept through the pasuk (Tehilim 139:16) "Your eyes saw my unformed substance," indicating that when a person returns to their original state, as in the womb, they can reveal Hashem's life force.<br>The letters of the Torah are divine lights beyond our comprehension, but when they form words, they gain a simple structure that we can understand. Thus, words serve as vessels for the inner light. Everything in existence acts as a vessel for these letters, which are hidden within. When Hashem commanded Noach to "Come to the teiva," it implied entering into the hidden letters within the words, revealing their inner essence.

The Zohar explains that Noach represents Shabbat, the day when everything returns to its source, allowing for true creation. Shabbat provides the life force necessary for continued existence and procreation, which is why it is associated with the term לעשות (to create). This concept is explained in the Ohr HaChaim (Bereishis 2:3) and likens Shabbat to Noach's Ark, where one can escape worldly matters and renew their life force under the Shechina’s protection.<br>The Targum translates tzadik, describing Noach, as ‘ish zakai’ (a purified man), highlighting the mission of a tzadik to purify the world. The tzadik, disconnected from physicality, reveals the divine spark sustaining the world, justifying its existence. This role is also reflected in the “shomer habris” (guardian of the covenant), who sustains the world through purity. Each person of Yisrael must remember their Godly soul, directing all desires towards Hashem, as our life force comes from His will.<br>Properly serving Hashem is beyond human capability, but complete desire for Him opens new understanding and connections. Every action should aim for complete nullification to Hashem’s will, connecting to its source. This is the essence of “A tzadik lives through his emuna,” focusing on nullifying to Hashem’s will, beyond comprehension. The Zohar (Tehilim 89:10) states that a true desire to cling to Hashem, despite challenges, is highly valued, as Hashem created us to constantly seek Him and transcend physicality.
"You created the world originally." This teaches us that the original form of creation is spiritual, with physicality serving as an external garment for the true inner essence. On Shabbat, the true desire of Hashem in creating the world is revealed, unveiling the inner life force. This concept is depicted in the Beis Hamikdash, where the inner gate of the courtyard, usually closed, is opened on Shabbat, symbolizing the revelation of the inner part.<br>A person's desire should always aim to nullify oneself to this inner essence, "the gate that faces forth." By connecting with Klal Yisrael, one can access this inner gate. The Zohar explains that the Dor Haflaga wanted to distance themselves from Hashem and focus solely on physicality. Despite their unity, they were ultimately punished. Bnei Yisrael, who strive for closeness to Hashem and inner spirituality through Torah and Mitzvot, should strengthen their trust in Hashem, who will surely support them.<br>The Dor Haflaga lost their unity because they refused to connect to the source of unity—Hashem, hence their name, the generation of division. In contrast, Bnei Yisrael remained united, as stated, "Remember the days of yore… when man was separated, You set borders for the nations of the world, corresponding to the number of Bnei Yisrael, for they are Hashem's portion." This unity is epitomized by the giving of the Torah to Bnei Yisrael in Lashon Hakodesh, the language of unity.

The Midrash and Rashi explain that the primary descendants (תולדות) of the righteous are their mitzvot and good deeds. While the simple understanding of the pasuk might be that all creation owes its existence to Noach, Rashi teaches us a deeper concept. The Zohar states that one who guards the bris (covenant) is called a tzadik. The bris represents the inner divine point within everything. The pasuk (Yirmiyah 33:25) says, "If not for my covenant day and night, the statutes (chukos) of Heaven and earth would not exist," implying that the world appears as a chok (statute) because the creations do not fulfill Hashem's will, yet He sustains them due to the inner divine point called the bris.<br>A tzadik, by guarding the bris, justifies (matzdik) the existence of the world, explaining why it continues to exist despite apparent contradictions. This is why a tzadik is called "the foundation of the world." The concept of Shabbat aligns with this, as it is a time when everyone in Yisrael stops their work and acknowledges that Hashem created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. Shabbat is described as a covenant (bris) for the world, emphasizing its role in connecting everything back to its divine source.<br>Noach is described as "Tamim (pure) in his generation," indicating that he was the primary life force of creation. The entire life force of creation was with him, making him the completion and wholeness of everything. Similarly, Shabbat, called "Shalom," represents the completion of creation, where everything reconnects to its source and derives its existence.
The Chidushei Harim, citing his teachers, explained that Noach's "Teiva" (ark) symbolizes the "tetivot" (words) of Torah and prayer. This means that through engaging with the words of Torah and Tefila, a person can be saved from any spiritual hiddenness or difficulties.<br>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 108b) mentions that only animals that had not sinned were allowed into the Teiva. Similarly, a person must be worthy to be fully accepted into the words of Torah and Tefila. However, by humbling oneself and connecting with Klal Yisrael, anyone can attach themselves completely to the Torah and its teachings.
Rashi explains that Noach needed divine support, while Avraham strengthened himself in his righteousness independently. However, everyone requires HaShem's assistance, as it is stated, "If not for HaShem's help..." This applies even to Avraham. Avraham himself acknowledged this, saying, "I walked before HaShem," and it was considered righteousness because he believed all his strength came from HaShem. Therefore, how can it be said that Avraham did not need support?<br>The explanation is that, indeed, everything comes from HaShem. Sometimes, HaShem provides help in a way that makes one dependent on support, while for those who are worthy, He provides help in a way that makes them appear self-sufficient. However, a person must always recognize that everything is from HaShem. For those who do not fully understand this, HaShem may not grant them this level of independence.
Rashi explains that "Remember the days of old" refers to reflecting on the generations of the Flood and the Tower of Babel, where it is noted that "they were one people with one language." It seems they lost their free will. Why did this happen? It was for the sake of Israel. HaShem, in His compassion for Bnei Yisrael, saw that they were mixed among these nations. Therefore, He said, "They are one people." My grandfather, the Chidushei Harim, explained that "one people with one language" actually refers to Bnei Yisrael. Because of this, the other nations lost their free will.<br>The verse "He set boundaries for the peoples according to the number of Bnei Yisrael" means that the concealments faced by the seventy nations are proportionate to the strength of Bnei Yisrael, who can rectify and clarify these concealments. This division is "according to the number of Bnei Yisrael." The distinction is that the free will of the nations can lead to complete destruction, but this is not the case for Bnei Yisrael. The primary idea is "one people with one language."<br>There are two aspects: being united within Bnei Yisrael and engaging in Torah and prayer, which is the power of Israel through their words. This unity is essential for accessing the Torah, as stated, "An inheritance of the congregation of Jacob." The more a person integrates into the collective of Israel, the more they merit understanding the words of Torah.

"Noach was perfect in his generation" (Bereishis 6:9). The Zohar explains that tzadikim have their names mentioned twice, like "Noach Noach" and "Shmuel Shmuel," because they have two aspects: one in the world above and one in this world. This highlights that the primary descendants of the righteous are their mitzvot and good deeds, bringing the potential of their souls into reality, as stated in Koheles 9:10, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might."<br>A person's mission is to perfect their deeds to connect the physical and spiritual realms, as taught in Avos 4:16, "Prepare yourself in the entrance hall so that you can enter the banquet hall." This is the meaning of Noach being "perfect in his generation." Similarly, "To do the Shabbos as an eternal covenant" reflects this concept, as Shabbos elevates all creation, linking the physical and spiritual worlds.<br>The courtyard gate (חצר) is shut during the six days but opened on Shabbos, symbolizing the connection between the two realms. The term "courtyard" relates to "half a form" (חצי צורה), indicating that creation was envisioned by Hashem before taking physical form. When the two forms connect, they create a complete form, which occurs on Shabbos when the inner gate is opened, uniting the physical and spiritual worlds.
Rashi (Bereishis 6:13) states that the final verdict to destroy the generation was due to their theft, while the pasuk suggests their primary sin was forbidden relationships. The answer is that the sin of forbidden relationships alone wouldn't have sealed their fate without the additional sin of thievery. The pasuk indicates this by stating, “The land was filled with thievery, and then Hashem saw the land was corrupt.”<br>Although Hashem knows all, the final destruction requires unanimous agreement among the accusers, as suggested in Iyov 33:23, “If there is one advocate among a thousand...” The generation's wickedness in thievery led to universal agreement on their guilt, sealing their verdict since their sins were fully exposed before Hashem.

In the Midrash, Avram saw a lit-up building, realizing Hashem's control over the world. The Chidushei Harim explained that דולקת (lit up) is related to chasing (דולקת אחרי), indicating that the world is drawn to one central point. The Zohar explains that everything's sustenance comes from its connection to what is above it, ultimately leading to Hashem.<br>Avraham sought to see how this central point sustained all creations without disconnection from Hashem, even in the physical world. He achieved this through self-nullification in response to Hashem's command of Lech Lecha, leaving everything behind.<br>Similarly, on Shabbos, when one ceases all weekday activities and accepts the yoke of heaven, the true essence is revealed. Shabbos is about stopping all actions, big or small, and through this nullification, it becomes clear, as it says, "Listen, my daughter, and see," and "For the name of Hashem will be called upon you" (Devarim 28:10).
The Rambam noted a difficulty in our parsha - that God says "Go forth..." without first mentioning why Avraham in particular was so precious as to receive such a command. It appears to me that the holy Zohar sees this very fact as what makes Avraham praiseworthy. He heard the call of 'go forth' which comes out from God to all people at all time, as it says 'oy to those who sleep in their holes (and do not hear)!' Our father Avraham heard the call and received its message. Perforce the Divine word was calling to him alone, because there was no one but he listening. Certainly this itself is his greatest praise - that he was ready to receive the call.

The Midrash says, "Hear, my daughter, and turn your ear," comparing it to someone who saw a lit-up building and realized there was an owner, just as Avraham realized there was a Master of the world. The Midrash questions why it says "hear" before "turn your ear." This can be understood from Hashem's command to Avraham, "Go to the land I will show you." Hashem didn't reveal the destination immediately because He values the desire and longing to draw close and understand more than the actual knowledge attained. This desire is what brings one closer to Hashem.<br>The growth process for a Jew involves longing to hear Hashem's voice, which leads to meriting to hear it. Once one hears, they must internalize this knowledge deeply, which increases their desire to hear more, creating a continuous cycle of growth. There is no rest in this world; it is a constant striving from level to level. The Midrash's "lit-up building" symbolizes the constant movement towards a point of perfection. Avraham was initially puzzled by this but learned that Hashem's will is for constant effort and no rest in this world.<br>This is reflected in "go to the land I will show you," teaching Avraham that he must always strive for the next level. The phrase "hear and turn your ear" indicates an initial hearing followed by deeper internalization and further striving. The Chidushei Harim adds that "lit up" (דולקת) also means "chasing," emphasizing the perpetual pursuit of perfection.
Rashi explains that "Lech Lecha" means Hashem told Avraham the journey would be for his benefit and good. Although Avraham was commanded to leave everything, it doesn't mean he was to separate from the world. Instead, he was to draw Hashem's holiness into every aspect of his life. The phrase "Lech Lecha" parallels "the holy angels run forth and retreat back," indicating that spiritual insights should be deeply internalized and then spread into all actions, making them enduring.<br>This explains why Avraham took his household and possessions with him, even without explicit instruction. He understood his mission was not to disconnect from the world but to influence it positively, starting with those closest to him.
The Midrash Tanchuma tells a parable of a man who, nearing his end, gave all his possessions to his slave and instructed him to allow his son in Eretz Yisrael to choose one item. The son, after consulting his Rav, chose the slave, thereby inheriting everything the slave owned. This parable illustrates the concept that the Yetzer Hara, like the slave, controls everything, but man has the ability to control the Yetzer Hara, as free choice is given to him.<br>The Yetzer Hara's power is not for its own sake but to enable man to uplift everything to Hashem by overcoming it. This is similar to the parable where the slave's possession was ultimately meant for the son. Man must subdue the Yetzer Hara, placing it under his control.
The Midrash (Tanchuma Lech Lecha 16) explains that when Hashem told Avraham to be “perfect,” Avraham wondered how circumcision, which seemingly involves a loss, could lead to greater perfection. The truth, as our sages explain (Chullin 58b), is that "extra is actually less." This means that when a person guards their energy and refrains from unnecessary actions, they achieve true completeness. Conversely, when one misuses their power for other purposes, it diminishes their strength where it is truly needed, resulting in a lack of wholeness.

The Midrash (Tanchuma) regarding Avraham’s discovery of Hashem states, “Hear my daughter and turn your ear.” This double expression indicates two levels of “hearing.” Initially, Hashem gives an awakening to realize the truth (the first hearing). It is then a person's duty to focus on this feeling, recognizing it as the main thing in life and disregarding other distractions. This is the essence of “Hear and see, and turn your ear,” meaning to block out all other interferences to hear the truth. The initial awakening teaches that there is something beyond human comprehension, prompting a person to nullify themselves to this higher power and reach the second level of hearing.<br>Avraham wanted to turn all creation towards serving Hashem. However, Hashem instructed him to leave everything and promised to make him a great nation. Avraham thought it would be better if the entire world served Hashem without resistance. Nonetheless, Hashem showed him that it is preferable to have one chosen nation dedicated to Him, which would be blessed and cursed but ultimately overcome everything. This concept is reflected in the Midrash’s “burning castle” analogy, where Hashem revealed that certain things exist solely to be nullified, demonstrating His dominion.<br>This principle applies individually as well. Perfection cannot be achieved in one go; it is through constant good actions and grace that one attains it. Initially, Avraham sought truth through intellectual means and nature. Later, Hashem instructed him to reach a higher level of hearing, unique to Bnei Yisrael, where they nullify their understanding entirely to Hashem, aiming not for self-perfection but complete subjugation to Him. Unlike the nations, who seek knowledge for pride, Bnei Yisrael seek to humble themselves before Hashem. Thus, after the initial hearing, they prepare for a deeper understanding and connection.
The verse “And Avraham took…the ‘nefesh’ souls that he made in Charan” (Bereishis 12:5) is translated by Onkelos as “The souls that they subjected to the Torah.” The term "nefesh" refers to one's desire, as seen in the verse “If it appeals to your nefesh” (Bereishis 23:8), indicating desire. In this context, it means that Avraham gathered and directed all his worldly desires towards serving Hashem. The word עשו (made) also implies forced, as in a forced bill of divorce (גט מעושה).<br>Hashem's command to Avraham to leave his land, birthplace, and father's house symbolizes redirecting all earthly desires to serve Hashem with all one's heart, soul, and possessions. “From your land” corresponds to serving with all one's heart, as thoughts are influenced by one's surroundings. “With all one’s soul” relates to one's birthplace, as the soul is drawn to family influences. “From your father's house” parallels serving with all one’s possessions, as Avraham left the security and abundance of his father's home for Hashem's honor. Avraham’s journey was motivated solely by the desire to fulfill Hashem's will, not for the promise of blessings.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 44:5) relates how Avraham asked Hashem that no future person should override Hashem's covenant with him. The Chidushei Harim questioned why Avraham would not want any future tzadik to surpass him. The answer is that Avraham knew no tzadik would override the covenant. His request was to reinforce the covenant and secure his status as the chosen one.<br>The Sefas Emes explains that even if future individuals surpassed Avraham in righteousness, they would still be recognized as his descendants. This contrasts with Avraham superseding Noach’s covenant, despite being Noach’s descendant. Hashem's covenant with Avraham elevated him and his descendants above all idolatrous nations. This allowed descendants like Moshe to potentially achieve even higher levels than Avraham. Moshe, despite being offered the chance for his descendants to become a great nation, refused, recognizing his power came from the forefathers.<br>The general principle is that each person should realize their true strength comes from the forefathers, even though they must toil hard, which is their mission in this world. Our sages teach, "A person should always say, 'When will my actions reach the actions of my forefathers?'" (Tana Devei Eliyahu Rabbah 25). The Chidushei Harim elaborates that in the blessing "Magen Avraham," Hashem promised Avraham that a point in every individual Yisrael would be shielded from ruin. This point helps each person on their level, reflecting the concept of the "maginim" protectors mentioned in the Midrash.
In the Mincha prayer on Shabbos, the song "Bnei Heichala" speaks of "Rava der’avin," a 'longing of longings.' This concept highlights that every individual of Yisrael has an inherent longing for Hashem. Even those who don't feel this longing still desire to possess it. Hashem mirrors this by yearning for us, even when we may not be worthy. During this time of "Rava der’avin," He accepts those who long for the longing, which is why we say "לית זעפין" (there is no anger).<br>The Chidushei Harim explains the verse in Mishlei (18:2), "לתאוה יבקש נפרד בכל תושי' יתגלע," as indicating that one who is separated (distanced) has a desire to attain the true desire. Every person of Yisrael has a deep-seated wish to at least want to desire Hashem. Through toil in Torah, this latent desire emerges and becomes actualized. The ultimate goal is to transform the potential into reality, turning the latent longing into genuine longing for Hashem.<br>Thus, the essence of the Shabbos Mincha prayer is to recognize and embrace this profound, inherent yearning within every Jew. It is a time when Hashem accepts even the desire to desire, fostering a deeper connection with Him. Through our efforts in Torah and mitzvot, we can bring this hidden longing to the forefront, fulfilling our spiritual potential.

The Midrash explains the verse (Tehillim 45:11): "Hear my daughter and see, turn your ear, and forget your nation and the house of your father." This verse refers to Avraham, who is likened to a traveler. He journeyed from place to place and came upon a castle that was illuminated, deducing that it must have an owner. Similarly, Avraham observed the ordered nature of creation, yet it seemed incomplete, prompting him to question if there was no one in charge. Hashem responded with "Lech Lecha," signifying that Avraham should continue his journey, for he must first remove all worldly matters from himself to truly repair these places. This self-sacrifice in serving Hashem is greater than wisdom, and only afterward can one merit to repair everything.<br>Our mission is evidently to repair these places, but it requires initial, illogical nullification. The verse teaches: "Hear my daughter," signifying the initial awakening from Hashem that people experience. Subsequently, a person must connect to this point and detach from everything. Only then can one expand this point, represented by "Turn your ear," acknowledging that everything in their life and body comes from Hashem. Through proper self-sacrifice, one can subsequently repair all paths effectively.<br>This concept also applies to every Shabbos, which is akin to a mini "Lech Lecha." During this time, a person takes a break from work, and by accepting Shabbos properly (nullification), one can also repair the days of the week. By dedicating oneself fully to Shabbos, one is empowered to address and repair the workdays that follow.
"And I will make you into a great nation" (Bereishis 12:2). The Gemara (Pesachim 117b) explains that this is the meaning of the words "The G-d of Avraham." The idea is that Bnei Yisrael draw Hashem’s dominion onto themselves through the acceptance of Hashem that our forefathers had. Avraham served Hashem with such dedication that it was as if Hashem could never fully repay him. Instead, his reward extended to the entire Bnei Yisrael for generations, making his actions a foundation for his descendants.<br>This concept is illustrated in the Midrash, which likens Avraham's blessing to a person who finds a beautiful tree and wishes to bless it. Realizing the tree already has everything, he blesses it that all its branches and offshoots will be just as fruitful. This analogy explains Avraham's promise to become a great nation: his influence would spread to his descendants, forming a unique nation devoted to Hashem.<br>Hashem rewards each creature with what is most precious to it. For Avraham, the most cherished reward was that a great and unique nation would emerge from him, dedicated to serving Hashem. This was the ultimate reward, ensuring that his dedication and service to Hashem would perpetuate through his descendants.
It seems Hashem gave Avraham numerous promises ("I will bless you," etc.) to test whether Avraham would act for the reward or solely for Hashem's command. The truth is clear from the continuation of the verses: "And Avraham went as Hashem commanded him." This shows that Avraham's motivation was purely to fulfill Hashem's will.<br>The promises served to magnify the trial, but Avraham's actions demonstrated his dedication to Hashem alone, not influenced by the prospect of reward. This highlights Avraham's unwavering commitment to serving Hashem for the sake of divine commandment.
"Go before Me and be complete" (Bereishis 17:1). This completion refers to the Bris Milah. A person possesses two powers: one physical, manifested in the body, and one spiritual, residing above and not manifest in the body. Achieving completeness involves connecting the physical to the spiritual power, a connection facilitated by Milah. This covenant (Bris) signifies a powerful bond, linking the body to the spiritual essence above it.<br>The Midrash (Tanchuma Lech Lecha 15) recounts Avraham’s confusion about how cutting a limb could lead to completeness. The idea is that by making the body imperfect, one can connect more profoundly to the spiritual element. The Zohar elaborates on this with the verse "Hashem desires to humble him, and therefore made him ill," indicating that through physical deficiency, one attains the soul's completeness.<br>The Zohar further explains that "Bereshis" can be read as "Bris Eish" (Covenant of Fire), referring to the Torah's fiery energy, which sustains the world. Through Torah, we connect this world to the holy life force, the source of all creation. The Torah is described as an "אמון," a nurturer, guiding and aligning actions, linking creation to the power above nature. This "Covenant of Fire" parallels the Milah, both essential for meriting Torah, as noted in the Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30:12).

The Midrash (Tanchuma Lech Lecha 1) teaches that if a person is traveling and wishes to read the Sh'ma, they must stop and read the first verse, accepting the yoke of Heaven. The Midrash explains that careful observance of mitzvot (commandments) merits great rewards. Avraham, known as "Avraham Ohavi" (Avraham who loved Me), exemplified this meticulous observance. Hashem, recognizing Avraham's dedication, commanded him with "Lech Lecha," signifying his separation from idol worshipers.<br>We previously explained (see Likutim) that since Avraham was already at the stage of loving Hashem, his first command was "Lech Lecha," not to love Hashem. This can be further understood by noting that while the entire world is commanded to recognize Hashem's Oneness, the concept of loving Hashem is specific to Bnei Yisrael. Through mitzvot, Bnei Yisrael connect their souls to Hashem, making the mitzvot unique to them. Recognizing Hashem's Oneness is a universal truth, independent of specific mitzvot observance.<br>Loving Hashem and meticulous mitzvot observance depend on human effort and their often unstable states. It is our duty to bring these moments and challenges closer to Hashem through our dedication to mitzvot. This process involves transforming every aspect of our lives, including our thoughts and actions, into opportunities for divine connection.
Avraham possessed both elements of faith and action. Initially, he was part of Bnei Noach and aimed to unify all creations under the oneness of Hashem. The Midrash refers to Avraham as "Achoteinu" (our sister), implying "ichud" (unity). This stage represented recognizing Hashem's oneness. Later, Hashem commanded him with "Lech Lecha," marking his mission to establish a nation devoted to Hashem through meticulous observance of mitzvot, aligning all actions with divine will. This aligns with the concept of Torah as a guiding path.<br>This dual-stage concept applies to all of Yisrael. First, there is the recognition of Hashem's oneness, followed by the detailed observance of mitzvot guiding our actions. The Mishna (Berachot 2:2) states that one should first accept the yoke of Heaven and then the yoke of mitzvot. Each mitzvah should be performed with a sense of unity with Klal Yisrael, as expressed in the plural form in blessings, “Asher Kidishanu.” Accepting the yoke of Heaven should be seen as part of Klal Yisrael's collective mission. We pray for Hashem to reveal His glory soon, so that "Hashem will be one and His name One," emphasizing our role in bringing about this divine unity.
The Midrash (Tanchuma Lech Lecha 3) explains that Hashem commanded Avraham with "Lech Lecha" to make his nature known in the world. This was not for Avraham's personal glory, but because when those who serve Hashem are glorified, Hashem's glory is magnified. As the Midrash Tanchuma Vayira 3 states, "One who runs away from honor will be chased by honor." This means that true honor belongs to Hashem, and those who avoid personal honor do so to ensure Hashem's glory is not diminished. Therefore, honor follows them, allowing them to reflect it back to Hashem.<br>Hashem uplifted Avraham and gave him honor to make Hashem more known in the world, turning everyone towards His oneness. Hashem's promise to make Avraham a great nation was to show that the success of Bnei Yisrael depended on Avraham's dedication. By strengthening his service to Hashem, Avraham would lead Bnei Yisrael towards Hashem. This promise was meant to inspire Avraham to accept his significant mission.<br>On an individual level, each person must realize that their actions have a significant impact, and they should strive to strengthen their service to Hashem, understanding that their dedication can influence and elevate others, just as Avraham's dedication did.
Lot merited to be with Avraham and to have descendants like David and Mashiach due to the merit of his father, Haran. Although Haran's self-sacrifice was imperfect—choosing Hashem only after Avraham's miraculous survival—his death still sanctified Hashem's name. Haran was burned in the furnace due to his allegiance to Hashem, making it a "kiddush Hashem."<br>Despite Haran's imperfect motives, Hashem rewards all acts of sanctification. Therefore, Lot was rewarded for Haran's ultimate sacrifice, which included the privilege of accompanying Avraham and having noble descendants.
The Ramban (Bereishis 12:2) questions why Avraham's righteousness isn't mentioned before the command "Lech Lecha." It seems that since Avraham was central to the world's existence, as hinted by "Behibar'am" (which spells Avraham), it's incorrect to attribute the world's existence solely to him. The world's existence is due to Hashem, though Avraham was the catalyst. This was all with Hashem's help. Understand that Avraham's role was pivotal, but the ultimate cause is Hashem. This concept might also be found in the teachings of the Maharal.
The Midrash Tanchuma explains that Avraham was initially puzzled by how performing "milah" (circumcision) and removing a part of himself could make him whole. True wholeness is achieved when a person understands their dependence on Hashem, demonstrating that completeness comes from Hashem, not from themselves. The act of nullifying part of oneself for Hashem’s sake is what grants true completeness.<br>This specific limb is chosen for the mitzvah because it holds the power of procreation, man's primary strength. It must bear the sign of the "bris" (covenant) to signify our inherent imperfection and reliance on Hashem. The verses "Those that seek Hashem will not lack" and "Those that fear Him lack nothing" teach that by sacrificing for Hashem, we gain true completeness. This concept is mirrored in Shabbos, where ceasing personal work and allowing Hashem to provide leads to rest and wholeness.<br>The "bris" signifies a connection between the receiver and the giver, leading to perfection. This explains why the mitzvah was given to man. The uncircumcised questioned why Hashem would create us uncircumcised if He desired circumcision. The answer is that man must perform this act for Hashem, demonstrating his dedication and achieving completeness. If man were created circumcised, he would not have the opportunity to show this level of commitment.

The Midrash (Tanchuma) on the verse "Hear my daughter, and see, turn your ear, forget your nation, and leave the house of your father" refers to Avraham Avinu. Avraham questioned why Hashem allows the wicked to prevail and destroy the world. Hashem responded that the existence of the wicked serves to highlight the righteousness of the tzadik, making him more beautiful by comparison. By distancing himself from the wicked, Avraham exemplified this concept, akin to a rose standing out among thorns.<br>Hashem promised Avraham, "I will make you into a great nation, and whoever you bless I will bless." Although Avraham would have served Hashem regardless of reward, these promises were to show that everything depends on him. Avraham's actions were for the sake of his descendants and the world's existence. This is reflected in the title "Avos" (forefathers), indicating that their actions were eternal and serve as a guide for future generations.<br>Mentioning "The G-d of Avraham, Yitzchak, etc." in our prayers signifies that the commitment of our forefathers to Hashem's dominion still exists within Bnei Yisrael. Through their merit, we can also accept Hashem's G-dliness. Additionally, Hashem's promise to bless those who bless Avraham extends to the wicked. Even if they cannot fully follow Avraham's path, by recognizing his righteousness and blessing him, they too will be blessed, benefiting everyone through Avraham.
Hashem told Avraham, "From the place where you are standing, all that you see, I will give to you and your descendants." The phrase "from the place where you are standing" seems superfluous. However, it teaches that the entire creation depends on the actions of the righteous. Hashem wanted Avraham to understand that his vision and reach could bring the entire world to recognize Hashem's Oneness.<br>This power extends to Avraham's descendants, who also have the ability to bring all of nature and creation closer to Hashem. Through their righteous deeds, they can influence the world to acknowledge Hashem.<br>Our sages teach that when a general rule is specified by an individual case, it informs the entire rule. Avraham and his descendants were part of the original creation, yet they are singled out to teach that the entire creation depends on Bnei Yisrael. Through them, the world comes to the realization and acknowledgment of Hashem.
Hashem told Avraham, "Go before Me and be perfect," introducing the mitzvah of milah. The Midrash quotes (Tehillim 25:14), "The secrets of Hashem are with those who fear Him." Avraham understood he was imperfect and felt embarrassed before Hashem. Hashem's response was that by going before Him, Avraham would attain perfection.<br>The Midrash explains that man is not born circumcised to allow for the perfection of creation. Nature is inherently imperfect, but a tzadik can connect the physical to its spiritual root, making it complete. This gift was given to Avraham, who received the covenant of the bris, connecting him to the upper source and making him whole. This concept is captured in "The secrets of Hashem are with those who fear Him," as those who fear Hashem can connect everything to its inner life force.<br>Just as Avraham changed nature through his service, we too can change nature through our service to Hashem. This is reflected in the verses (Tehillim 25:12), "Who is the man who fears Hashem? He will teach him the path he should choose," and (Tehillim 34:10), "There is nothing lacking for those who fear Him," because tzadikim connect to the source and gain new energy.

Rashi explains that Hashem told Avraham he would not merit children while outside Eretz Yisrael. Although Hashem can do anything, the land outside Eretz Yisrael could not receive the holiness of Avraham's descendants. Had it been able to, there would be no exile, as the place itself was lacking the necessary sanctity.
Hashem instructed Avraham with the words, "התהלך לפני והי' תמים" ("Go before Me and be perfect"). In contrast, the Torah describes Noach as "תמים הי' את האלקים התהלך" ("Noach was perfect with Hashem"), signifying that Noach needed support from Hashem. Our sages explain that Noach required divine assistance, while Avraham acted independently.<br>Noach was born circumcised, receiving extra help from birth to draw closer to Hashem. Avraham, however, achieved closeness to Hashem without this aid, even while uncircumcised. His overwhelming love and desire for Hashem led him to merit the removal of the "orlah" (foreskin), symbolizing spiritual impurities. This profound love allowed Avraham to alter the course of the world, becoming physically distinct from other nations through the covenant of the holy brit.<br>This unique path of service to Hashem is granted to Bnei Yisrael. Unlike other nations, where individuals maintain their inherent state without degradation, Bnei Yisrael are commanded to "Lech Lecha" ("Go...to the land that I will show you"). This signifies the power to connect to a higher spiritual source and elevate the world. Hashem did not reveal the destination immediately to Avraham, teaching that each person must continually strive for the unknown, aiming for "the place I will show you," reaching ever higher in their service to Hashem.

Bezrat Hashem
Go, to yourself, from your land. This is because a person is called "goer", and one needs to always be going from one level to another level, and even when one merits getting to a certain level in one's dedication to the Blessed Creator, even this becomes to the person a second nature. And therefore we always need to renew the ways of one's soul in the service of the Holy Name. And Avraham our father a"h was tested with ten tests, and in every test he was made into a new being/creation until he merited to be above nature, as it is written "Wisdom is more of a stronghold to a wise person than ten forces that a city may contain" (Eccl. 7:19) - there is always a force from the from the strength of nature, that tries to bring all back to nature alone - all those wise people that raised above all of it, as it is written "on three the evil impulse had no control, the three Avot" (Bava Batra 17a)

In the Midrash Lech Lecha (Bereishit Rabbah 39:1): <i>Listen, daughter, etc., and incline your ear</i> (Psalms 45:11) — it is compared [to a man who was traveling], etc. when he saw a castle burning. He said, "Is it possible that it lacks a governor?" The owner of the castle glanced at him, etc. As man is called a traveler, since he must always travel from one level to another. For habit becomes [second] nature. And what is natural brings forgetfulness and hides the internality of life, and this is even true with Torah and commandments if they become a habit. That is why one must constantly seek new paths and strategies. And that is why the Holy One, blessed be He, renews in His goodness the work of creation every day (alluding to one of the blessings in the morning prayers). So that nature does not become overpowering. And that is the castle. As this natural world burns everything that enters it, even though all of nature is from a point of light above. But it is drowned in nature. And nature eliminates everything, like the matter that is written: <i>but it could not be recognized that they had come inside them</i> (Genesis 41:21). And that is why the Holy One, blessed be He, renews in His goodness the work of creation every day. And a person must seek such novelty, as it is written: <i>watching daily at my gates</i> (Proverbs 8:32). And hence it is written: <i>Listen, daughter, etc.</i>, and it repeats afterward, <i>and incline your ear</i>. To say that, one must always be ready to listen. And that is [the meaning of] that which is written: <i>You, go forth</i> (Genesis 12:1) — there is a need to always travel to — <i>that which I will show you</i> continuously novel understandings. That is why man is called a traveler, as anyone who stands still without renewal is immediately governed by nature. And that is why the angels above, who are not within nature, are called standing. But in this world, man is called a traveler, as mentioned above.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48:b) on the pasuk (Iyov 19:26), “Even once my skin has been peeled off, I will behold G-d from my flesh,” explains that Avraham only saw Hashem after circumcising himself. Every creation contains Hashem's life force, but it is hidden by an external peel, called the "foreskin." Removing this orla reveals the divine life force.<br>The phrase "And He appeared to him" (Vayera) means that Hashem’s presence, previously hidden by the orla, became visible after circumcision, as reflected in “from my flesh I will see Hashem.” Additionally, “Vayera” connects to “And Hashem saw that everything He created was good” (Bereishis 1:31), indicating that Hashem’s observation sustains all creation.<br>This realization is unique to those who understand that the world’s life force is maintained by Hashem’s constant supervision, as stated, “the ‘eyes’ of Hashem are constantly on it” (Devarim 11:12). This divine oversight ensures the existence of everything.
One must understand that although Hashem derives pleasure from human deeds and the entire universe relies on the awakening of righteous actions from below, which in turn reveal Hashem’s providence, this is merely "at the opening of the tent." Hashem designed the world such that through physical actions, one can connect to higher realms, ultimately reaching Hashem Himself.<br>However, human actions are merely an opening, like the eye of a needle. Even if a person is "in the heat of the day," symbolizing burning love for Hashem, as exemplified by Avraham, who epitomized love and complete self-nullification before Hashem, he still recognized that he was only at the opening of the tent.

With G-d's Blessing
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48b) on the verse in Iyov, “And this, once my skin was peeled (and from my flesh I see Hashem),” explains that by removing the external foreskin covering the bris, the internal energy of Hashem present in everything is revealed. This concept is echoed by the Chidushei Harim, who interpreted the word “this” (זאת) to mean there is nothing else besides Hashem’s energy, hidden only by external distractions. This divine life force sustains everything, and as one detaches from externalities, the inner world becomes apparent. Thus, the phrase וירא אליו signifies that Hashem’s presence was always there, but Avraham could perceive it only after his circumcision.<br>Mankind was created to testify that Hashem sustains all. This testimony is unique to Bnei Yisrael, surpassing even that of angels. Angels, who see Hashem’s truth clearly, cannot serve as unbiased witnesses. However, in this world, called the world of falsehood, Bnei Yisrael overcome hidden truths and testify to Hashem by accepting His kingship and nullifying their desires. This is a complete testimony. The Midrash (Zohar B:90:1) also states that Bnei Yisrael, Hashem, and Shabbos testify for each other.<br>Regarding Shabbos, it is said, “One who pleasures the Shabbos” (Shabbos 118a), meaning that the joy derived from Shabbos itself, as Hashem rested on this day, allows one to forget all pain and distractions. The Chidushei Harim emphasized that it is not about self-indulgence on Shabbos but about deriving pleasure from the sanctity of the day itself.

Section 3

The Midrash Tanchuma (Vayera 1) states that on weekdays, the Shmona Esrei contains 18 blessings, while on Shabbos there are seven. This relates to the Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48b) on the verse, “And this, after my skin will have been pulled off.” The Chidushei Harim explains that the kingdom of Heaven is called זאת (this), signifying that everything derives its life force from Hashem. The principle is that Hashem gives life to everything, but this life force is more apparent in some things and more hidden in others. When the external layers are removed, the inner divine secret is revealed. This is why, after Avraham’s circumcision, Hashem appeared to him, revealing His presence everywhere, as expressed by “the world is filled with His glory.”<br>The pasuk praises Avraham for sitting at the opening of the tent despite Hashem’s revelation. This humility, even amid great spiritual excitement, shows Avraham’s sense of unworthiness. In truth, those who feel distant from Hashem should strive to draw closer, for Hashem embraces all. However, Avraham’s greatness made him feel humble. The Midrash also mentions that Hashem visited Avraham to heal him, linking to the concept of being “faint with love” from Shir HaShirim. While one should strive to sanctify their entire being through weekday prayers, a great person like Avraham, feeling unworthy, focuses solely on fulfilling Hashem’s will.<br>On Shabbos, when an extra divine light is revealed, one should set aside personal needs and pray for rest and purity of heart, trusting that Hashem will provide for all needs. This is why, even without explicit prayers for healing, the merit of Shabbos prayers can bring healing. This concept of “visiting the sick” signifies that the internal divine point brings life and healing to all things rooted in it.
Hashem appeared to Avraham in the plains of Mamre, which is mentioned to highlight Mamre’s reward for advising Avraham to perform the circumcision. The significance of Mamre’s advice lies in the understanding that through the brit milah, a covenant was established, setting Avraham and his descendants apart from other nations. Unlike Aner and Eshkol, who opposed the circumcision, Mamre believed in the necessity of this unique covenant and supported Avraham, despite knowing it would create a separation.<br>Mamre’s support earned him the merit of having Hashem reveal Himself in his territory. This teaches that a Jew must nullify his individual desires for the collective good of Bnei Yisrael. One must be willing to lessen his own honor to increase the honor of Hashem, understanding that true honor comes from self-nullification for the sake of Heaven. This aligns with the teaching that one who diminishes his own honor for the sake of Hashem ultimately increases both the honor of Heaven and his own honor.
Regarding the Akeida, Hashem said to Avraham, "Please take your son." Since Hashem had promised Avraham that his lineage would continue through Yitzchak, this request was significant. Hashem was essentially asking Avraham to relinquish the promise and offer Yitzchak as a burnt offering. This highlights Avraham's greatness, as Hashem did not command him explicitly but rather made a request, giving him the option.<br>Despite this, Avraham, driven by his love to fulfill Hashem's will, proceeded joyfully to sacrifice Yitzchak. Hashem emphasized "your only son," acknowledging that Avraham could trust Hashem to grant him another son, as He had done in his old age. However, Hashem clarified that Yitzchak was his only son, and by offering him, Avraham was offering the entire future of Israel. Avraham accepted this with joy, demonstrating his profound faith and dedication.
The knife used in the Akeida, called "מאכלת," signifies that Bnei Yisrael "eat" the reward of the Akeida for generations (Yalkut Shimoni 1:101). When Avraham "took the knife," he understood his actions would impact future generations, as he was the father of all nations.<br>Everyone should realize their actions affect future generations. Bnei Yisrael benefit from the Akeida because they supported their forefathers' righteous deeds. The forefathers' strength came from having the entire root of Bnei Yisrael within them, making the process just and true.

Section 4

5635
With G-d's Blessing
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48b) explains that the inner life force of Hashem, which sustains all creation, is referred to as "זאת." All of creation is connected to this inner point. The revelation of this point depends on the spiritual level of those who receive it, as the verse states, "The secret of Hashem is revealed to those who fear Him" (Tehillim 35:14). The Midrash further elucidates that when Avraham was circumcised, he received the secret of the 70 souls and 70 elders.<br>The division between light (אור) and darkness (עור) is symbolic of the 70 nations that obscure the divine light. The Torah of Rabbi Meir notes that the garments Hashem made for Adam and Eve were "garments of light" instead of "garments of skin." Through the mitzvah of Milah, Bnei Yisrael merit to remove this obscuring skin, revealing the inner light and the source of everything. This is referred to as "the opening of the tent," from where the divine influence begins to spread to the 70 nations. Bnei Yisrael, through Milah, are connected to the source before this influence is disseminated into the world.<br>Moreover, creation is divided into three categories: world (physicality), time (year), and soul (Bnei Yisrael). Corresponding to these are three covenants: the rainbow for the world, Shabbos for time, and Milah for the soul.
After the Akeida, Hashem said to Avraham, "Now I know that you fear Hashem" (Bereishis 22:12). This is puzzling—did Hashem not already know Avraham's fear? It seems that all Hashem's actions and causes are for Bnei Yisrael, as stated in Tehillim 40:6, "Your wonders and thoughts are for us." The Midrash on Tehillim 60:6 explains that the tests given to our forefathers were a banner of elevation. These tests allowed Bnei Yisrael to merit miracles because they demonstrated a willingness to transcend nature for Hashem.<br>Bnei Yisrael cannot survive without miracles, and the tests of our forefathers paved the way for these necessary divine interventions. The Mishna in Avos (5:3-4) connects Avraham's ten tests with the ten miracles in the Beis Hamikdash, emphasizing this link. Hashem's knowledge encompasses all time, as seen in Bereishis 18:19, "For I know him, that he will command his progeny for generations to come." Hashem's knowledge pertains to enduring righteousness, unlike the fleeting ways of the wicked (Tehillim 1:6).<br>Thus, "Now I know that you fear Hashem" signifies that Avraham's successful tests established a lasting merit for Bnei Yisrael. The term מאכלת (knife) indicates that Bnei Yisrael eternally benefit from this mitzvah. Hashem's knowledge, relevant only to eternal matters, is now applied. Avraham's fear of Hashem became firmly established, ensuring this merit for future generations.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48:2) explains that after Avraham circumcised himself, many converts joined him, as it says, "From my flesh, I behold Hashem." Avraham proclaimed that without the circumcision, Hashem could not have revealed Himself fully to him. This implies that while Hashem revealed Himself to Avraham even before the circumcision, the nature of the revelation changed. Before the circumcision, it was an act of divine grace, but afterward, it was a merit Avraham earned through his actions.<br>The Sfas Emes elaborates that Avraham's righteousness was inherent but could not manifest fully until the act of circumcision, which perfected his body and allowed the divine soul to connect more deeply. Similarly, on Shabbos, Jews receive an extra soul, signifying a covenant in time, just as milah is a covenant in the body. The verse (Bereishis 2:7) "Hashem blew into him a living soul" illustrates that the divine energy given to man is limitless, and the body must be purified to contain more of this soul. Thus, through circumcision and Shabbos, one draws more divine light into oneself.<br>Avraham's concern that circumcision would distance converts was unfounded, as many more joined him afterward. This is because being separate and holy allowed Bnei Yisrael to avoid the negative influences of other nations, thus enabling them to repair themselves properly. Consequently, they could draw down divine light to the rest of creation. This separation was not a barrier but a means to elevate and connect all nations to Hashem through Bnei Yisrael's holiness.
Avraham asked Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre for advice about whether to circumcise himself. This request was for their benefit, so they could gain some merit from the mitzvah of milah through their counsel. I later found that this idea is indeed mentioned in the works of the Chidushei Harim.
After Avraham passed the test of the Akeida, Hashem blessed him, saying, "Since you did this thing, I will bless you and make your children multiply" (Bereishis 22:16-17). This blessing, however, had already been promised to Avraham beforehand. So, what new reward was Hashem giving him now? The difference is that previously, Hashem's promises were considered a gift of charity, but now, Avraham earned these blessings through his own merits.<br>Avraham was not content with receiving blessings as a gift; he wanted to earn them through his actions. Something merited through one’s own deeds lasts forever. Therefore, even after Hashem's initial promise, Avraham requested children, desiring to achieve this through his own merit. Hashem's promise "Since you passed this test" signifies that Avraham now merited these blessings through his own righteous actions.
In the verse "Now I know that you fear Hashem" (Bereishis 22:12), the word "now" signifies that although everything is revealed to Hashem, the fear Avraham had was previously in potential and not yet actualized. The act of performing a mitzvah out of fear of Hashem transforms that potential into reality. <br>It is through the action itself that the fear of Hashem is fully realized and completed. Therefore, Avraham's fear of Hashem became complete only after the Akeida. By performing the mitzvah with fear, he truly became "fearful of Hashem." This aligns with the Midrash Matos (Bamidbar Rabbah 22:1) which states that those termed "fearful of Hashem" have their fear intrinsically connected to their physical being.

Section 6

5637
With G-d's Blessing
The Midrash relates how Avraham was concerned that no converts would join him once he circumcised himself. However, contrary to his fears, many more joined him. Avraham also said that if he had not circumcised himself, Hashem would not have appeared to him. This seems puzzling as Hashem had already appeared to Avraham previously. However, the earlier revelation was different—it was directed "to Avraham," signifying a spiritual connection. After the circumcision, the revelation was "to him," indicating a direct connection even with his physical body.<br>This direct revelation was possible because circumcision perfected Avraham's body. Before Adam's sin, his body shone like his soul, but after the sin, the body became clothed in physicality, as described by the "garments of leather." Bnei Yisrael merited the mitzvah of milah, creating an opening in the physical body and connecting it to its spiritual source. This is why it is called a "bris," a covenant, symbolizing this connection. The term "at the opening to the tent" refers to this opening, emphasizing the connection between the body and its spiritual source.<br>Thus, the Midrash means that by circumcising himself, Avraham's body achieved a level of perfection that allowed for a direct connection to Hashem and opened the way for converts to connect as well. Even before the mitzvah of milah, Avraham had perfected his body, lacking only this specific opening. Once he performed the milah, he achieved complete perfection. Consequently, Hashem appeared directly to him, signifying that Avraham's entire being, including his 248 limbs, was now perfect. Despite this, Avraham remained humble, always remembering the bris, and continued "sitting at the opening to the tent."
Hashem told Avraham, "Take your son, your only one, Yitzchak" (Bereishis 22:2). Rashi explains this gradual instruction was to give Avraham more reward for fulfilling each step. Each phrase—"your son," "your only one," "Yitzchak"—represents deeper emotional and spiritual challenges. Although Avraham would have obeyed immediately if told to sacrifice Yitzchak, the gradual revelation was significant.<br>This process reflects the idea that "the actions of the forefathers are a sign for their children." Avraham's actions created a spiritual framework for future generations. By introducing the command step by step, Hashem set a precedent allowing us to build our commitment gradually. Even if someone isn't ready for full self-sacrifice, they can start with smaller commitments, cultivating deeper love for Hashem and greater spiritual strength over time.<br>Rashi's explanation that Hashem's approach was "to make him precious in his eyes" means that these progressive steps made mitzvot more beloved and attainable, ultimately leading to complete dedication and self-sacrifice in serving Hashem.

Section 8

With G-d's Blessing
The Midrash explains how Avraham wondered how Hashem would appear to him. Hashem subsequently gave him the mitzvah of milah and told him, "Go before Me and be perfect." Even though milah involves removing part of the body, which might seem like a defect, it actually leads to spiritual perfection. The forefathers were so perfect that they were a "chariot for the presence of Hashem" in this world. Hashem gave us the gift of milah so that everyone can make this part of their body holy, connecting to the special spiritual light associated with it.<br>The pasuk states that Avraham was "sitting at the entrance to the tent," alluding to the idea that through milah, one opens a gate to Hashem. This correlates with the blessing that "the gifts of a person ease the way," meaning the more one detracts from physicality, the more they reveal their soul. Avraham's statement, "After my flesh was peeled," signifies that removing the physical barriers allows spiritual light to shine. Even a single point of revelation from the soul's upper source is enough to be called perfect. This concept also applies on Shabbos, where nullifying one's actions brings spiritual illumination, symbolized by the "sukkah of Shalom" connected to the upper tent.<br>The Midrash also explains that when Hashem appeared to Avraham, He told him to remain seated, hinting that his descendants would also connect to Hashem while "seated." Even though Avraham had perfected himself and could "stand" before Hashem, Hashem wanted to show that his descendants could also attain this connection despite their lower levels. This serves as a prelude for us, allowing us to find a point of spiritual connection while still in our physical state. This is the light of milah that every member of Bnei Yisrael merits, as it states, "Your nation are all righteous."
Rashi (Bereishis 22:5) explains that when Avraham said to Yitzchak, "Let us go till there - עד כה," he was alluding to the כה that Hashem had promised him: "Like the stars of the sky, so - כה your children shall be," wondering what would become of that promise. The crux of this test lay in Avraham's predicament: he was promised that Bnei Yisrael would descend from him, yet now he was asked to sacrifice his son. This test demonstrated Avraham's unwavering commitment to Hashem's commandments, regardless of their magnitude.<br>Avraham's willingness to sacrifice Yitzchak showed his readiness to fulfill Hashem's command, even if it meant giving up the future nation promised to him. This act encapsulated all the mitzvot and actions that his descendants would perform for generations. The words כה יהיה זרעך thus allude to the profound impact of this action on future generations. The word כה also signifies a revelation during times of darkness, unlike the clarity denoted by the word זה. This reflects the hidden and less clear nature of some prophecies.<br>Avraham's actions set a precedent for future generations, showing that even in times of obscurity, one can connect deeply with Hashem. Hashem attributes the righteous intentions of a tzadik as if they had performed the action. This "tikun" initiated by Avraham allows future generations to discover and reveal Hashem even in challenging circumstances. Hence, the knife used in the Akeida is referred to as מאכלת, symbolizing that Bnei Yisrael "consume" the rewards of Avraham's actions for all generations.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 55:1) explains that the term used to describe Avraham's test, נס (nes), can also mean a banner, symbolizing elevation and actualization of potential. The Mishna in Avot (5:3) states that the world was created with ten utterances, and Avraham was tested ten times. This connection highlights that just as the ten utterances are fundamental to the natural world's existence, the ten tests of Avraham are crucial for guiding Bnei Yisrael's existence through miraculous means.<br>The Maharal explains that just as there is an order in nature, there is an order in miracles. "And Hashem tested - נסה Avraham" signifies that through the actions of the forefathers, Hashem directs Bnei Yisrael in an order of miracles. These tests were not just for the moment but created a lasting impact, setting a foundation for continuous miraculous guidance.<br>The phrase "נס להתנוסס" indicates that some miracles are temporary, while others have enduring effects, continually producing miracles. The tests of Avraham were such enduring miracles, preparing the way for Bnei Yisrael. This idea is encapsulated in the term מאכלת, symbolizing that Bnei Yisrael "consume" the rewards of these actions, benefiting from the spiritual groundwork laid by Avraham.

Section 9



Section 10






"Now I know that you fear Hashem." The question arises: Avraham’s service to Hashem was primarily out of love, which is a higher level than fear. Why then is his fear emphasized here? The answer lies in the nature of Avraham’s test. Considering that Avraham left his homeland and willingly faced the fiery furnace of Nimrod for Hashem, sacrificing his son might not seem a difficult test. However, a person who serves Hashem out of love is naturally drawn to fulfill Hashem’s will with their entire being. All their limbs derive life from mitzvot.<br>In this case, Hashem did not truly desire Yitzchak's sacrifice. Therefore, Avraham's heart did not feel the usual love and natural pull to perform this mitzvah, as it was not Hashem’s true intention. This is the meaning behind "He saw the place from afar," indicating the test's difficulty and unusual nature. This was the true test for Avraham: to act out of fear rather than love when he did not feel the usual divine pull. Hence, it is said, "Now I know that you fear Hashem."<br>After this test, Avraham requested that Hashem not test him further. This request meant that he should not have to feel such distance from Hashem again, as his primary mode of service was through love.
The commandment for Avraham to slaughter his son Yitzchak was never intended to be completed in action. Hashem's will was for Avraham to be prepared to do so, demonstrating a very high spiritual level. The source of mitzvot is above nature, with their spiritual light manifesting in physical actions. Some mitzvot, however, exist only in thought and desire, signifying a level beyond physical deeds.<br>Avraham's ten tests corresponded to the ten utterances of creation, with the tenth test being the highest. Thus, Hashem’s statement, "Now I know that you fear Hashem," indicates that even without the action being completed, Hashem’s intention was met. This higher level of readiness and intention fulfilled the divine will.

The Midrash teaches that time is a created and limited entity, while the inner life force behind creation transcends these limitations. The tzadik connects everything to its spiritual root, avoiding attachment to its external form. This is what is meant by "whoever is clever will act with Da'as and a fool exposes his stupidity." Both the tzadik and the fool may engage in mundane activities, but the tzadik does so with Da'as, integrating understanding into actions. This deep connection brings about yishuv hada'as—peace of mind—where actions are performed with clear intent. Conversely, the fool disconnects from the source, acting without understanding.<br>The phrase "These were the days of Sara" indicates that all the life force during her days stemmed from her, connecting the physical to the spiritual. The Midrash continues, "Hashem knows the days of the righteous," meaning that through the actions of the righteous, who act with Da'as, the life force connects back to its divine root. Their inheritance is eternal, as they bring abundance to the world. The word "inheritance" (נחלה) is linked to "river" (נחל), symbolizing the flow of divine bounty through the tzadikim. The world (עולם) hides Hashem's glory, but the tzadikim reveal this hiddenness, elevating it to a spiritual level.<br>This aligns with the Mishna in Avot, where the tzadikim uphold the world created with ten utterances, lifting it to a higher, spiritual state. The term "perfect" (תמימים) refers to the harmony between understanding and action, achieving human perfection. Rabbi Akiva awakened his students by explaining that Esther's rule over 127 provinces was due to Sara's 127 years of life, where she illuminated the inner life force in each year. Similarly, Esther brought light to the hiddenness of Hashem in the 127 provinces ruled by Achashverosh. Rabbi Akiva's teaching encouraged his students to seize the moment, recognizing its unique spiritual potential.
The Midrash Tanchuma links Eshet Chayil’s traits to Sara. She does not fear gehinom because her household observed Shabbat and circumcision (mila), overcoming the world's hiddenness, similar to "shanim" in Yeshaya 1:18. Shabbat brings holiness to the weekdays, while circumcision, a covenant, brings inner light and removes the foreskin. Both signify infusing spirituality into the physical. As noted in Sfas Emes (Parshas Vayeira), Avraham experienced limited divine revelation until his circumcision.
In Rashi - The years of the life of Sarah: All of them were equally good: It can be said that it is the way of a simple person that by way of growing older and increasing his knowledge, his ways become settled. So it comes out that the more he ages, the more he discards bad traits and actions that he would do [in the past]. And if so, only his last moment is called the days of his life, such that he has attained a proper completeness, if he merits it. But with the righteous Sarah, all of her days were proper and without corruption. Even if she certainly elevated herself in her old age, it was not by way of pushing off the earlier actions from the days of her youth. Rather she elevated herself, according to how she was created. For all of a person's days are measured to fix something particular every day, and to raise oneself from one level to another. But she had no flaw or corruption to reform and act more properly. And that is [the meaning of] that which he wrote, "All of them were equally good." And understand [this].
The Chidushei Harim explains the Zohar on the verse about Avraham "coming with his days." The Zohar indicates that Avraham brought with him all the spiritual light he gained each day. When Avraham died, he carried all this accumulated light with him, meaning none of these enlightenments were ever lost or forgotten; they always remained with him.<br>Normally, a person may feel inspired by something new but eventually forgets it as the excitement fades. This is why one must constantly remember every inspiration to avoid the prohibition of "Lest you forget all that your eyes have seen" (Devarim 4:9). Forgetting occurs because we let go of the inspiration and become absorbed in physicality. Avraham, however, retained all his enlightenment throughout his life, constantly renewing his connection to Hashem.<br>Avraham exemplified the idea that true wisdom and enlightenment are never forgotten but continually renewed. This concept is tied to the teaching that "there is nothing new under the sun," indicating that true renewal exists above nature. One who connects deeply to the spiritual life force experiences constant renewal and can continually praise Hashem as if freshly created in each moment. This constant state of renewal is the essence of living with perpetual inspiration and spiritual vitality.
The Chidushei Harim explained the Zohar, which states that Eliezer was a true servant when he declared, "I am the servant of Avraham" (Zohar 1:103). Eliezer could have boasted of his own status when seeking a wife for Yitzchak, but he chose to identify himself as Avraham's servant, considering it an honor.<br>Eliezer's pride in being Avraham's servant was unique; he viewed it as a noble lineage. Lavan and his family recognized Eliezer's holiness, calling him "blessed of Hashem." Eliezer wanted them to understand that his greatness stemmed from his association with Avraham, not from his own merits. This aligns with the Midrash advising one to reveal their shortcomings first, showing Eliezer's humility in acknowledging that his virtue was due to his connection with Avraham.

The Midrash quotes the verse (Tehillim 37:18), “Hashem knows the days of the righteous and their inheritance will last forever,” referring to Sara's days. It compares her perfection to that of a perfect calf. The idea of תמים (perfection) is that all actions are connected to the inner divine source. This inner point, which gives life to everything, ensures that all parts are in unison. Just as the 248 positive commandments correspond to the 248 limbs of the body, each mitzvah connects to a specific limb, making a person שלים (complete).<br>Similarly, a person's years can achieve perfection if they are connected properly. Each day has unique renewal, as stated in Tehillim 19:3, “Each day proclaims Hashem.” The sages teach that since creation, no two days' light is identical. The phrase, “With His words, He brings forth the evenings,” means that Hashem ends the light of one day to bring a new one. One who receives each day's light properly gains more knowledge and connection, elevating day by day, year by year. This is how the world operates: each moment has unique energy, and each year brings new light until Hashem's intention for creation is fulfilled.<br>The phrase “like this perfect calf” refers to the entire period of creation. The light of the years depends on the generation's level. For Sara, the Torah states she lived 127 years, indicating she was never disconnected from the source of life. She constantly received new life force, growing from level to level. “Their inheritance will last forever” means that tzadikim bring new light continuously. One year of a holy tzadik can surpass a thousand other years, and through them, the world merits higher levels for future generations, with all the lights since creation shining continuously.
The Midrash on the verse “And do kindness with my master Avraham” teaches that even Avraham, in whose merit kindness exists in the world, needed kindness performed for him. The Chidushei Harim explains that even Eliezer, Avraham's servant, who knew of Avraham’s greatness, requested kindness for Avraham, not relying solely on Avraham's merit. Avraham had instilled in his people the understanding that even someone as great as him was entirely dependent on Hashem’s kindness, not just out of humility but as a reality of his existence.<br>In truth, even a person's good deeds are possible only through Hashem’s assistance, as it is said, “If not for Hashem’s help, we would not overcome evil.” Thus, despite the kindness in the world being attributed to Avraham’s merit, he himself relied on divine kindness. Avraham’s actions drew down this kindness into the world, serving as the conduit through which Hashem’s kindness flowed to the lower worlds.<br>The phrase “And do kindness with my master Avraham” signifies that Hashem’s kindness in the world is mediated through Avraham. Avraham created a channel for divine kindness to reach the lower realms. This is akin to the teaching in Ta’anit 24b, where the world is sustained in the merit of the righteous, illustrating Avraham as the pipeline for Hashem’s kindness to manifest in the world.
The Zohar praises Eliezer for proudly declaring, “I am the servant of Avraham,” seeing it as a great merit. Serving Avraham faithfully allowed Eliezer to transition from cursed to blessed. Similarly, anyone who longs to do Hashem’s will and praises Him for the opportunity to perform His mitzvot can, through such faith, transition from cursed to blessed and connect to Hashem. Believing that there is no greater merit than doing His will enables this transformation.<br>The Midrash (Zohar 1:103:2) interprets the verse, “A son honors his father and a servant his master” (Malachi 1:6), as referring to Eliezer. Eliezer’s declaration exemplifies true service. The Zohar teaches that from Eliezer’s mission, we learn the authentic way to serve Hashem.
The Chidushei Harim, citing the Kotzker Rebbe, explains that when Eliezer said אולי (“perhaps the girl will not be willing to come with me”), it is written as אלי (“to me”) because he had a personal interest, wanting his daughter for Yitzchak. This bias is only revealed when Eliezer recounts the story later. Initially, he didn't realize his bias; it became clear only after Rivkah was chosen.<br>The Torah repeats the story to emphasize this point, as our sages say, “the talk of the forefathers is more beautiful than the Torah of their children.” Eliezer feared his bias might affect the mission, even though he knew Hashem would fulfill Avraham’s will. He asked for success and reviewed the events to ensure he had removed his bias, allowing him to complete the mission properly.<br>Eliezer understood the mission's success was due to Avraham’s merit, not his own, despite being a tzadik. This teaches that everyone is a messenger of Hashem. Recognizing this and aligning one’s actions accordingly, while understanding that success comes from Hashem’s will, ensures one can fulfill Hashem’s will effectively.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48:1) on "Hashem knows the days of the righteous" explains that just as the righteous are perfect, so too are their years. The concept of תמים (perfection) can be understood in two ways: first, as being without blemish and complete. This applies to time, as each person is created to fulfill their mission within a limited timeframe, making the concept of completion dependent on time. The Chidushei Harim explains that each day brings new insights, as indicated by the term יום (day), which is associated with light, as in “Hashem called the light, day.” Hashem renews creation daily, planting new awakenings for each Jew to connect with Him. The verse “As I have commanded you today” implies that each day should be embraced with freshness. Thus, “Hashem knows the days of the perfect ones” refers to those who utilize the unique inspirations of each day to achieve completeness.<br>The Zohar adds that each day becomes a garment for the person, enabling them to approach holiness by overcoming worldly urges and making time secondary to holiness. The phrase “Their years are perfect” means that the righteous connect each day to its divine source, gaining new insights and elevating time itself. “Hashem knows the days of the righteous” signifies that their knowledge and growth come from Hashem’s guidance. The righteous elevate time by connecting each day to its divine source, gaining new insights, and thus perfecting their years.<br>The second interpretation of תמים is not questioning Hashem’s ways, as Rashi explains in Devarim 18:13, “You shall be perfect with Hashem your G-d.” This applies to time and nature, which may seem to contradict holiness. Through dedicated service, one can elevate everything by connecting it to Hashem’s inner essence, thereby sanctifying time and nature. By bringing everything closer to its divine source and elevating it, one can achieve true perfection, both in actions and in the sanctification of time.
“These are the years of Sara,” Rashi explains that all of them were equal in their greatness. This means that in each aspect of life, there is a general principle and an individual principle. The general principle is to accept the yoke of Heaven, while the individual principle involves daily actions, such as the 365 days of the year paralleling the 365 negative commandments, reminding us of specific prohibitions and ways to gain awareness of Hashem.<br>Each day, a person should attain a new understanding and keep it in their heart forever. This is the meaning of “coming in their days,” where all the understandings accumulate as one. The Torah warns, “Guard and protect yourself from forgetting the things that you saw,” emphasizing the importance of retaining these insights. Similarly, the commandment “These words that I command you today, shall be on your heart” underscores the need to internalize and maintain these understandings.<br>Even if we are far from attaining new insights daily, Hashem helps those who desire to nullify nature and time in service to Him. This aligns with the Midrash, “Just as they are perfect, so too their years are perfect,” meaning that the perfection of one’s heart allows Hashem to help nullify nature and time. As our sages explain, sanctifying the new moon involves bringing holiness into time and nature, and Hashem assists according to one’s desire.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 60:2) praises Eliezer for taking pride in being Avraham's servant. He could have served a lowly person but merited to serve someone as great as Avraham. The Zohar (3:112b) explains that in serving Hashem, there are two aspects: son and servant. The neshama (soul) represents the son, a part of Hashem, while in this world, enveloped in physicality, it represents the servant, needing to humble and nullify itself to Hashem's will.<br>A person must value this aspect of servitude. Everything in the world has an inner spiritual life force from Hashem. Realizing this, one should connect and nullify oneself to this spiritual element, transitioning from being a servant to a son. The servant aspect relates to daily occurrences and the weekdays, while Shabbat represents the son aspect, a time of spiritual connection.<br>We learn from Eliezer that serving faithfully allows one to transition from cursed to blessed. The Zohar praises Eliezer for his pride in serving Avraham. This is why our sages instituted reading the Shema twice daily. The Gemara (Sota 49a) states that each day since the destruction of the Beit Hamikdash, the curse of that day is worse than the previous. Bnei Yisrael's laxity in serving Hashem affects all worlds, especially without the Beit Hamikdash. However, reading Shema with all one's heart and accepting the yoke of Heaven can transition one from cursed to blessed. One should always remember that all worlds depend on man's actions, as stated in Tehillim 8:7: "You have laid the world at his feet."

The Midrash on the verse “Hashem knows the days of the righteous” (Tehillim 37:18) explains that just as the righteous are perfect, so too are their years. The Sfas Emes elaborates that Hashem renews the world daily, as we say in Shacharis, “He who renews the world every day.” This renewal prevents the world from drifting further from its divine source. Thus, every day brings new life and inspiration, and a person should seek new insights daily.<br>Each day builds on the previous day's inspiration. The tzadikim, who perfect each day, gain maximum energy and insight, continuously elevating their service to Hashem. This is the meaning of “coming in their days”—there was no day without spiritual growth and new understanding in Hashem’s service.<br>The verse “Hashem knows the days of the perfect ones” signifies that tzadikim gain new insights every moment, drawing down divine abundance to the world and connecting it to its source. The continuation of the verse, “their inheritance will last forever,” indicates that their influence benefits the entire world. By utilizing each day properly, one uplifts the following day, thereby elevating the entire world to higher levels of goodness and spirituality.
The verse “Hashem knows the days of the righteous” (Tehillim 37:18) can be interpreted as referring to Shabbat and the festivals. These are days free from physical labor, where all actions are connected to the source of life force, making them “perfect days.”<br>Additionally, “perfect days” can refer to Bnei Yisrael, as stated in Yeshaya 60:21, “Your people are all righteous.” The phrase “their inheritance will be for the entire world” means that the six weekdays are blessed through Shabbat. Shabbat is a renewal unique to Bnei Yisrael, making it easier to connect to Hashem. While the daily renewal from Hashem is for all creation and includes physicality, Shabbat’s renewal is specifically for Bnei Yisrael, who follow the righteous path. Even if one fails to repair what is necessary during the weekdays, Shabbat provides an opportunity for renewal and rectification of all the week’s days. Thus, Shabbat allows one to attain spiritual growth and repair, elevating the entire week.
The Midrash says that by faithfully serving the righteous, one transitions from being cursed to being blessed. Similarly, any person, through proper faith in serving Hashem, can move from being cursed to being blessed and can transform everything from curse to blessing. It is written that during exile, each day’s curse is greater, but through faith in Hashem, one can turn everything into a blessing.<br>The verse “A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son” is interpreted by our sages as referring to Avraham’s servant. We can further explain that during the weekdays, we are called servants, and on Shabbat, we are called sons. Preparation for Shabbat involves work during the weekdays. A wise servant on weekdays can attain Shabbat by working wholeheartedly and longing to connect to Hashem, directing all actions towards Him. This effort allows one to feel the holiness of Shabbat, realizing their unworthiness and feeling shame. This shame brings one closer to Hashem and grants the holiness of Shabbat. Thus, “A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son” means that through wise service and preparation during the weekdays, one can achieve the holiness of Shabbat and move from the status of a servant to that of a son.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 58:8) explains that Bnei Chet are mentioned ten times in the Torah because they helped Avraham purchase Me’arat Hamachpela, paralleling the Ten Commandments. The Sfas Emes elaborates that this hints at Bnei Yisrael, who help bring about Hashem’s "purchase" in the world by constantly testifying that “the world and everything in it belongs to Hashem.”<br>This comparison teaches us that just as the Torah details all the trees and fields surrounding Me’arat Hamachpela because they are significant, each person must recognize and testify to the importance of every detail in the world and connect them to the service of Hashem.
The Chidushei Harim explained the Zohar's words זקן בא בימים—Avraham was old, coming with days—meaning that Avraham brought with him the spiritual light of each day he lived, and not a single day was wasted. In the upper worlds, the soul is above nature and time. Man was placed in this physical world to elevate nature and time to a higher spiritual level. Days and time are called אור (light) because Hashem designed nature so that by overcoming physicality, man can uplift it to holiness, generating new spiritual light.<br>The term זקן (elder) refers to one who has acquired wisdom (chochma). Acquiring wisdom means preparing a place for it, making it an integral part of oneself. Just as Hashem is the source of everything, one who internalizes the light of each day and progresses step by step is considered to have acquired wisdom. Therefore, Avraham is called זקן בא בימים, as he consistently grew and acquired wisdom through his days, step by step, embodying the concept of integrating and elevating daily spiritual insights.

Section 5

5635
With G-d's Bleasing
The Midrash states, “Hashem knows the days of the righteous” and that their years are perfect. The soul's life force is above time and nature, but we are placed in this world to elevate the physical to the spiritual. Hashem constantly renews the world’s existence, and this renewal depends on human actions. By serving Hashem and recognizing that everything comes from Him, we can strengthen this divine connection.<br>Everything can be divided into three categories: the world, time, and mankind. Similarly, mitzvot are categorized into those related to the body, time, and the world, aiming to repair these elements. The verse “Hashem knows the days of the righteous, and their inheritance is for the entire world” refers to these categories: “the days of the righteous” pertains to time and mankind, while “their inheritance” pertains to the world.<br>A person’s understanding of Hashem is proportional to the light they bring into these elements, connecting time to Hashem. This is how the tzadikim’s years become perfect. Shabbat also connects time to Hashem, as stated: “So you shall know that I am Hashem who sanctifies you.” Through this testimony, Shabbat deepens our understanding of Hashem.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 48:1) explains that Sara’s ages—100, 20, and 7—signify that “just as she had not sinned at 20, so too she had not sinned by 100.” The comparison highlights her righteousness, as one becomes fully liable for sins at 20.<br>Koheles 7:20 states, “there is no one righteous who only does good and does not sin.” Accountability for sins varies with understanding and life stages. Yeshaya 65:20 mentions, “one who sins at 100 will be cursed,” and even angels are described as having sinned, showing absolute perfection is unattainable. Thus, Sara being “as sinless at 100 as at 20” means she remained free from significant sin, maintaining high righteousness throughout her life.
The Midrash states, "A wise slave will rule over an incapable son." What wisdom did Eliezer demonstrate? The Midrash teaches that through emuna (faith), one can elevate from a “slave” to a “son.” There are two levels of serving Hashem. As a son, one should recognize everything is from Hashem and remain humble. As a slave, one must control urges and not become despondent about their status, acknowledging they don't deserve even this level. Through this emuna, one can be elevated from a “slave” to a “son.”
"And my prayer is that I shall approach You, Hashem, in a time of willingness” (Tehillim 69:14). Although Hashem does not change with time, time itself can conceal Hashem's will. However, during holy times like Shabbat, when Hashem derives pleasure from creation, His will is more apparent in time and nature, as expressed in “it is very good” during creation. This sanctifies time, making it an auspicious moment for true connection.<br>Thus, Shabbat and other holy times are ideal for prayer, as stated in Tehillim 32:6, “all those who are righteous should pray at an auspicious time.” While it may seem better to pray during difficulties, the prime time for prayer is when things are going well, as everyone experiences favorable moments. At these times, one is closer to effective prayer. Through sincere desire and connection, the light and favor from Hashem can remain, drawing forth His goodwill.

The Chidushei Harim explained that Yitzchak’s re-digging of the wells symbolizes removing externalities to uncover the inner divine spark. The wells named Eshek and Sitna, which Avimelech's men fought over, represent the weekdays, while the well named Rechovot, which they did not fight over, symbolizes Shabbos. Every object contains a spark of holiness that is hidden by nature and externalities. The purpose of creation is for humans to recognize and clarify that everything is sustained by Hashem.<br>The pasuk "Wisdom cries out outside, in the streets it raises its voice" (Mishlei 1:20) refers to Torah being expanded in places of learning. The oral Torah aims to bring spiritual light into practical, physical experiences. The Midrash connects Rechovot with the expansion of holiness in the physical world, as stated in Devarim. The Avos' mission was to reveal the hidden light of Torah within creation.<br>Yitzchak was initially deceived by Eisav, believing that Eisav, as a "man of the field," was elevating the physical to Hashem. Eisav even asked about tithing from salt and straw, symbolizing the elevation of even the most mundane objects. Yitzchak's greatness, described as "growing very great," indicates his mastery over the Yetzer Hara, using it in service to Hashem. This aligns with the commandment to love Hashem with all one's heart, including the Yetzer Hara.
The ‘tasty dishes’ Yitzchak asked Eisav to prepare symbolize uplifting worldly matters to Hashem. The more distant something is from spirituality, the more valuable its elevation. In places of hiddenness, the essence resides in the taste, which is both highly elevated and lowly. Yaakov, who was above nature and inherently holy, lacked this connection. Only by following Rivka’s prophetic guidance and tricking Yitzchak could he engage at this level, similar to what Yitzchak intended for Eisav. This allowed Yaakov to descend and then uplift the physical to the spiritual. Yitzchak’s statement, “The voice is the voice of Yaakov, and the hands are the hands of Eisav,” reflects this transformation, where the physical (hands) is elevated to the spiritual (voice).
Yitzchak’s blessing to Yaakov, “And He shall give you,” is explained by Rashi to mean that Hashem should give and then give again. This repetition signifies that Hashem's will in bestowing blessings is for the recipient to use them to bring pleasure to Hashem through their service. When a person uses their blessings to fulfill Hashem’s will, it creates a cycle where Hashem continues to bless them anew.<br>This concept is reflected in Yitzchak’s blessing, indicating a continuous cycle of giving and renewal. The Midrash compares this to a sea that spills water into a hole, symbolizing reciprocal giving. Moshe Rabbeinu, representing all of Yisrael, embodies this principle.<br>The difference between Bnei Yisrael and the nations is that while all blessings originate from the dew of heaven, they become corrupted by the nations upon entering the physical realm. In contrast, Bnei Yisrael continually elevate their blessings back to their divine source, resulting in Hashem giving them repeatedly. Although “there is nothing new under the sun,” Bnei Yisrael connect everything to its source above the sun, experiencing constant renewal, as symbolized by the new month (Rosh Chodesh) being given to them.

This repetition signifies that Hashem's will in bestowing blessings is for the recipient to use them to bring pleasure to Hashem through their service. When a person uses their blessings to fulfill Hashem’s will, it creates a cycle where Hashem continues to bless them anew.<br>This concept is reflected in Yitzchak’s blessing, indicating a continuous cycle of giving and renewal.

Although “there is nothing new under the sun,” Bnei Yisrael connect everything to its source above the sun, experiencing constant renewal, as symbolized by the new month (Rosh Chodesh) being given to them.
The ten tests of Avraham Avinu were for the benefit of Bnei Yisrael throughout generations. The Mishna (Avot 5:3) states that Avraham was tested ten times to demonstrate Hashem's love for him. This means each person has a spark from Avraham within them, as explained by the Chidushei Harim. These tests empowered this spark to overcome all worldly obstacles, as each test corresponded to a level of darkness in this world. However, only those who wholeheartedly follow the path of our forefathers and seek to nullify their desires to Hashem can benefit from this legacy.<br>Similarly, Yitzchak’s willingness to sacrifice his life at the akeida instilled in us the capability to give our lives for Hashem. Recalling the akeida serves as a proclamation that we have dedicated our lives to Hashem, as the life force we inherited from Yitzchak is already bound to Hashem since the akeida.
The Midrash explains that certain aspects of a person's being, such as their limbs, can come under the jurisdiction of Hashem if they merit it. This concept is illustrated by Yitzchak, who, despite intending to bless Eisav, ultimately blessed Yaakov. This occurred because Yitzchak had completely nullified his own will to align with Hashem’s will, demonstrating true self-sacrifice akin to his willingness at the akeida.<br>This principle applies to anyone who accepts the yoke of Heaven each morning with a sincere heart, seeking to nullify their desires to align with Hashem’s will. By doing so, they ensure that they remain entirely under Hashem’s jurisdiction.<br>Moreover, Hashem orchestrated Yaakov's blessing through trickery to ensure that Yitzchak's personal desires did not interfere. Even the most righteous person may have personal involvement when blessing their own son. Thus, Yitzchak's unintentional blessing of Yaakov ensured that the blessing was purely from Hashem, as explained in the Zohar.
The blessing Yitzchak intended for Eisav was designed to help him find a spark of holiness despite his distance from it. Yitzchak knew Eisav was not righteous but believed he could still draw closer to holiness. However, Yaakov received this blessing, which extended to his descendants, ensuring that even if they are far from holiness, they can still find a spark of it.<br>Eisav's complaint, "and he took my blessing," indicates that the blessing was originally more suited to him, but Yaakov took it for future generations. The Zohar hints at this, stating that Yaakov hid the blessing for his children, saying he did not need all these blessings himself (Zohar 1:146:a/b).

The Chidushei Harim explained the significance of the wells that Yitzchak dug, which symbolize removing external barriers to reveal inner sanctity. The names of the wells, "Eshek" and "Sitna," represent the struggles and conflicts in serving Hashem. The final well, "Rechovot," symbolizes Shabbos Kodesh. During the week, the service to Hashem involves overcoming personal desires and the evil inclination, but on Shabbos, it involves attaining deeper spiritual insights.<br>Avraham's wells, which were covered by the Plishtim, were redone by Yitzchak. This mirrors the spiritual journey where initial love and desire to serve Hashem (symbolized by Avraham) can be obstructed by material desires. Yitzchak represents the repair through fear of Heaven. The Zohar (1:112a) explains that true love results in fear, which is encapsulated in "Avraham gave birth to Yitzchak."<br>The Zohar also compares mitzvot like tzitzit and tefillin to wells, indicating that Hashem imbued holiness in all physical things. Every action, even using money for charity, has a mitzvah attached, allowing us to find sanctity in the physical world. The Midrash (Tanchuma Naso 5) illustrates this with a king who built hiding places that his rebellious subjects used to hide treasures, unaware that the king knew all about them. Similarly, Hashem created the material world, enabling us to find spiritual truth everywhere, reflecting the concept of the wells.
The concept of Yaakov taking the blessings through trickery teaches that to attain the ultimate truth, one may use cunning. As our sages have taught, "One should be shrewd in the fear of Hashem" (Brachos 17a), which Rashi explains as using any form of trickery to deepen one's reverence for Hashem. When the primary goal is to reach the truth, it is not considered deception but rather a rectification of falsehood.<br>This principle is illustrated in the Mishna (Yoma 8:9), which states, "One who says, 'I shall sin and then repent,' is not given the opportunity to repent." The reason, as explained by the Sfat Emet (Shabbat Teshuva 5638), is that the sin taints the act of repentance, turning it into a transgression. Conversely, using falsehood to achieve truth elevates the falsehood itself.<br>In this world, known as the "world of falsehood," Hashem's intention is for us to find truth through the deception surrounding us. The genuine point within each person can withstand vast amounts of falsehood, as falsehood lacks stability and permanence. A single point of truth can nullify significant falsehood. This idea is reflected in Parshat Vayeshev, where it is said that "One spark from the blacksmith can burn a huge pile of flax," symbolizing how a small amount of truth can overcome extensive deceit.
The Midrash explains that while certain limbs like hands and feet are under a person's control, others like the eyes and nose are not. However, if a person merits, they can sanctify all their limbs, making them entirely under Hashem's jurisdiction. This is exemplified by Yitzchak, who blessed Yaakov instead of Eisav, demonstrating his complete submission to Hashem's will.<br>This concept contrasts with the wicked, who desire control over everything. A righteous person, desiring to be entirely nullified to Hashem, can achieve this level of sanctity. Although Hashem controls everything, He allows humans the choice to submit their actions to His will, thus returning their limbs to Hashem's jurisdiction.<br>Yitzchak’s immediate acceptance of blessing Yaakov, despite his initial intention to bless Eisav, shows his habitual nullification to Hashem. This reflects the primary purpose of creation, where the inherent holiness in humans, given by Hashem, must be aligned by repairing the external physicality to serve the internal divine essence.
The blessing Yitzchak gave to Yaakov was divinely orchestrated to ensure its purity, as all worlds depended on it. Yitzchak's blindness, as explained by Rashi, meant he had no evil inclination, making him a perfect, unbiased channel for Hashem's will. Thus, the blessing was given directly by Hashem, free from human interference.

"These are the generations of Yitzchak, Avraham begot Yitzchak" (Bereishit 25:19). The actions of our forefathers serve as a sign for their descendants, ensuring the benefit of Bnei Yisrael for generations. The holy scriptures state (Zohar 1:12a) that fear derived from love is genuine fear. This is reflected in the phrase "Avraham begot Yitzchak," with Avraham symbolizing love and Yitzchak symbolizing fear. As Rashi explains (25:19), there was clear testimony that Avraham begot Yitzchak. Fear that stems from love is pure and free of falsehood. This fear means being afraid of losing the deep connection of love with Hashem, which is the essence of true love.
Yitzchak redug the wells of Avraham that the Philistines had filled with sand. Love tends to spread to all things, allowing falsehood to mix in, leading to sadness and laziness, symbolized by sand blocking the wells. However, Yitzchak's attribute of fear is internal and protected, preventing it from being contaminated by falsehood.<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that the wells dug by our forefathers symbolize hidden divine life forces present everywhere. Our task is to remove externalities to reveal this inner holiness, termed "a flowing well of water." During the weekdays, this effort is marked by struggle and contention ("Esek and Sitna"), but on Shabbat, it is called "Rehovot," symbolizing expansiveness and ease.<br>"In the streets, it (the Torah) will raise its voice" (Mishlei 1:20). This means the Torah constantly awakens the hearts of Bnei Yisrael, but one must listen carefully. The Zohar (1:134b) states that the Torah calls out for engagement, yet few listen. "You shall surely hear my voice" (Shemot 19:5) spells שבת, indicating that on Shabbat, when Bnei Yisrael affirm Hashem's dominion, it is easier to hear His voice, fulfilling the verse "In the streets its voice is heard."
The prophecy given to Rivka about her children: "One nation will be mightier than the other" (Bereishit 25:23). This means each nation's strength derives from the other. Eisav's power is stolen from Bnei Yisrael, and Bnei Yisrael's power comes from overcoming Eisav's negative forces. This is reflected in Yitzchak's blessing to Yaakov: "You will have power over your brother" by overcoming him.<br>"The greater one will serve the younger one" implies that Bnei Yisrael should see themselves as "young" and humble, as stated in Devarim 27:29: "For you are the least of all peoples." When Bnei Yisrael become proud of conquering the evil inclination and lower their guard, they give it control. Each Jew must remain vigilant, remembering the constant threat of the evil inclination. The Midrash on Yitzchak's large household (avodah rabbah) indicates that despite his wealth, Yitzchak knew he needed to continually serve Hashem and guard against the evil inclination.<br>Yitzchak may have erred in thinking Eisav could remain "young" and humble. The truth is, the holier a person becomes, the more they gain fear of Heaven and humble themselves, fulfilling "the greater one will serve the younger one." The Zohar (1:122b) states, "A person who is great is actually small." Tehillim 34:10 says, "Fear Hashem, His holy ones, for those who fear Him lack nothing." Holiness follows fear, but one need not worry about missing out on holiness by maintaining fear. By attaching oneself to the fear of Heaven, a person will not lose out, as "those who fear Him lack nothing."
Yitzchak's blessing to Yaakov begins with "And Hashem shall give you." Rashi explains: “He shall give and repeat and give.” On the surface, there doesn't seem to be much difference between the blessings given to Yaakov and Eisav, as both were promised the fat of the land and the dew of the sky. The Zohar notes the difference in expressions: Yaakov's blessing uses "And He will give," while Eisav's uses "And it will be."<br>The simple explanation is that Yitzchak's blessing to Yaakov regarding worldly matters comes after Yaakov's spiritual perfection. Yaakov didn't seek the benefits of this world until he had properly prepared himself for the world to come. This concept is reflected in the Midrash on Parshat Vayeshev, where Hashem indicates that the righteous do not request worldly benefits until they have secured their place in the world to come.<br>Yitzchak's words to Yaakov, "See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that Hashem has blessed," imply that once Yaakov had achieved spiritual completeness, he could receive worldly blessings while remaining connected to the divine source. The phrase "And He will give" suggests continuous giving from Hashem, ensuring that the blessings always come from Him, keeping the recipient connected to the Source. This continuous cycle of giving and receiving creates harmony and generates more good, as indicated by "He shall give and repeat and give."

The Zohar explains that the wells Avraham and Yitzchak dug symbolize uncovering hidden sparks of holiness in nature. When we perform mitzvot, such as tzitzit and tefillin, we reveal this holiness. Everything in the world contains sparks of holiness, referred to as תמיד ("constantly"), as stated in Shacharit: "He renews the world constantly in His goodness."<br>This source, called מנוחה ("rest"), is where everything originates and spreads out. The more a person connects to this source, the more they can draw and expand from it. As this point spreads, it can be plumbed further, generating more. This is the idea behind "ברחובות תתן קולה" ("in the streets, it will raise its voice"), implying that as it widens, it gains more voice. Similarly, the more the wells were dug, the more the source was opened. This was the mission of our forefathers: to publicize the glory of Hashem. Through performing mitzvot, we continue this mission, drawing new life force and abundant holiness.<br>The pasuk describes how the Plishtim blocked the wells Avraham had dug, and Avimelech told Yitzchak to leave. By blocking the wells, the lights of holiness that spread from them diminished, causing the Plishtim to distance themselves. When Yitzchak redug the wells, he revealed Hashem's glory, leading Avimelech to recognize the truth and subject himself to Yitzchak.
Our sages explain that the pasuk in Tehilim (120:2), "Hashem, protect my soul from false speech," refers to Yaakov. When Yaakov needed to lie to his father by saying, "I am Eisav, your firstborn," he required Hashem's special protection. Falsehood inherently has no stability (Yalkut Shimoni 1:516), but those who lie give it existence. The Mishna (Avot 5:1) refers to such individuals as "The wicked who destroy the world created with ten utterances."<br>The tzadik, however, is constantly connected to truth. Sometimes, he may need to use falsehood, as halacha permits lying for the sake of peace. By remaining connected to truth, the tzadik can nullify falsehood's power. Since this world is called a world of falsehood, occasional lies may be necessary to correct it. However, this requires divine assistance to ensure one does not become attached to falsehood. Yaakov prayed, "Protect my soul," asking for protection from becoming attached to the falsehood he would utter.<br>This understanding helps explain the continuation in Tehillim: "Woe to me... I have dwelt in the tents of Kedar... I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war." Yaakov sought to remain truthful and peaceful, even when circumstances forced him to use falsehood.

The Torah details the wells that Avraham dug, which were later blocked by the Philistines and redug by Yitzchak. Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov are each called Avos (forefathers) because they each merited this status independently, not by relying solely on their predecessors' paths. The Midrash explains that each patriarch had to carve their own way. Avraham's path of love for Hashem was blocked, prompting Yitzchak to carve a new path centered on the fear of Hashem. This mirrors the famines mentioned in the Midrash, symbolizing blockages that each patriarch had to repair.<br>Avraham's overcoming of challenges established a foundation, but after each gain, a new challenge arose. This is reflected in the Torah's statement, "One nation will be great from the other," indicating the constant struggle and growth. The more one perfects themselves, the stronger the opposition, requiring continuous effort to overcome. Avraham's blocked path forced Yitzchak to find his own way. When Yitzchak planned to go to Egypt during a famine, Hashem told him not to, as Avraham had already repaired that path. Yitzchak's preparedness sufficed, so he didn't need to undergo all ten tests like Avraham.<br>Each person must repair ten stages in their spiritual journey. Although Avraham and Yitzchak had different paths—Avraham through love and Yitzchak through fear—both possessed all traits. Avraham's love led him to fear Hashem, while Yitzchak's fear led him to love Hashem. The Ramban explains that love and fear, seemingly contradictory in this world, complement each other in service to Hashem. True love leads to fear, and true fear leads to love, creating a harmonious relationship with the Divine.
When the Torah discusses the wells Yitzchak dug, it states: "The wells that the servants of his father dug," referenced in Bamidbar 21:8, "That was dug by nobles." These "nobles" are Avraham's servants, as it says, "the nobles of the nation have gathered, the nation of the G-d of Avraham." Since Avraham was a flowing wellspring, his people could dig wells and draw from this source. The phrase "with her staff" signifies following the tzadik (righteous person), enabling one to draw from his spring.
There is a distinct difference in the blessings that Yaakov received from Yitzchak compared to those of Eisav. Regarding Yaakov, it states (Bereishit 27:28), "And Hashem will give you," whereas regarding Eisav, it states, "Your place will be." This implies that Eisav's blessing is something fixed, while Yaakov's blessing requires constant renewal.<br>The tzadik (righteous person) prefers not to have anything solely from himself; he continuously desires to receive from Hashem whenever he is deserving. This ensures that he does not consume his portion for the world to come in this world. The Midrash explains "And Hashem will give you" to mean He will give and give again, highlighting the continuous nature of divine provision. This approach also fosters a deeper connection with and appreciation for Hashem each time He bestows blessings. The Rebbe of Pershischa noted that even a small amount from Hashem is significant, emphasizing the value of receiving directly from the Divine.<br>Additionally, whatever a person receives from human sources eventually depletes, whereas what is in Hashem's hands lasts eternally. This is reflected in the blessing "for our life that is given into Your hands." In contrast, Eisav's blessing is tied to his "resting place," and once he disconnects from the source, he loses the blessing and holiness. This is why the sages state that the wicked are considered "dead" even in their lifetime, as their life force comes from negative forces, not directly from Hashem. This underscores that Bnei Yisrael will receive blessings only if they remain worthy and connected to the Divine.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 63:2) explains that the pasuk "The G-d of Yaakov who redeemed Avraham" (Yeshaya 29:22) implies that Yaakov's merit saved Avraham from the fiery furnace. This indicates that while each forefather had personal merit, the source of miracles and the power to alter nature is uniquely attributed to Bnei Yisrael, beginning with Yaakov. Avraham and Yitzchak's contributions served as preparatory stages for Yaakov, likened to the "wings of the mitzvah."<br>The Zohar teaches that Torah and mitzvot performed without love and fear do not ascend on high. Therefore, Avraham's and Yitzchak's traits were essential preparations for Yaakov, who embodies Torah and mitzvot. This connection shows that Avraham's salvation was linked to Yaakov, whose divine service was built on his forefathers' foundation.<br>Additionally, the Midrash clarifies that Avraham was saved in Yaakov's merit due to Yaakov's profound love for Hashem. This love, though lofty, faces scrutiny in the Heavenly realms about how a human can truly love the Divine. However, since this love leads to fulfilling Torah and mitzvot, it acts as a defense, allowing this love to endure and remain within a person.
"And when you lower yourself, then you shall break his yoke from your neck" (Bereishit 27:40). Yitzchak's blessing to Eisav implied that Eisav should not be upset about the blessings given to Yaakov. If Eisav could truly humble himself, he could remove the yoke. This humility is a trait of Yaakov and Bnei Yisrael, as indicated in Devarim 7:7, "for you are few," meaning they elevate themselves through humility. However, Eisav cannot achieve this level of humility and is thus told, "you shall serve your brother."<br>Conversely, Yaakov is told, "You shall be a power over your brother," because Yitzchak did not need to teach him humility. True humility involves recognizing the truth and being inherently humble, understanding that everything comes from Hashem. Yaakov needed to be encouraged to strengthen himself, to be a leader, and not be subjected to others. Eisav was instructed to embrace humility to improve himself. This highlights the different paths: Yaakov to assert his strength and Eisav to learn humility.

The Midrash explains that when Yitzchak was born, there was a double rejoicing. Until then, the mention of "Toldot" (descendants) brought physical joy of a new generation. With Yitzchak, a new dimension of spiritual "Toldot" emerged, signifying a holiness that comes through this new generation. This is expressed by the words "ואלה" (and these are), adding a new element of joy.<br>This idea is also evident in the verses describing Yitzchak redigging the wells of Avraham. "And the well that the servants of Avraham dug, in the days of Avraham (בימי), were blocked up by the Philistines." The term בימי alludes to the sparks of light that Avraham introduced—kindness and love of Hashem. These sparks connected everyone through these traits, but they got subsequently blocked up. Yitzchak needed to introduce a new path, that of strength and fear of Hashem. The reason for any blockage was to force Yitzchak to find a new path in the service of Hashem. Similarly, on an individual level, when one works on certain things and then falls, it's to force a person to find a new path, correcting various traits. The entire path of our forefathers was to provide different ways for us to serve Hashem in various circumstances.<br>The Midrash notes that Avraham introduced old age (זקנה), and Yitzchak introduced suffering (יסורים). זקנה refers to honor, and through the honor and kindness that Hashem bestows, one gains knowledge ("zaken" refers to one who has gained knowledge). The goodness Hashem gives causes a person to become embarrassed and return to Hashem, following the path of Love introduced by Avraham. Yitzchak represents strength, and our sages tell us that one can only attain Torah through suffering. Nevertheless, the path of Avraham, that of love, precedes it and is universally good for all. This can be attained by realizing one's lowliness, removing haughtiness, and acknowledging the abundant good Hashem has given, thereby circumventing the need for suffering.
The Chidushei Harim explained that the wells Esek and Sitna, which were fought over, symbolize the weekdays, while the well called Rechovot, which was not contested, symbolizes Shabbat. During the weekdays, we struggle with the evil inclination. In contrast, Shabbat brings natural joy and peace.<br>Rechovot means "widening," as Hashem expands our paths. Achievements through personal effort can lead to limitations and haughtiness. However, on Shabbat, blessings come from Hashem, making them broader. As the pasuk states: "For Hashem has widened for us, and we have multiplied in the land."<br>This highlights that true expansion and blessing come from Hashem, especially on Shabbat, when achievements are due to divine grace, not human effort. Thus, Shabbat is a time of greater spiritual and material abundance, as indicated by the well named Rechovot.
"And Yitzchak loved Eisav for hunting was in his mouth" (Bereishit 25:28). The verse teaches that Yitzchak's love for Eisav was conditional, as love dependent on something is fleeting (Avot 5:16). Therefore, when Yaakov surpassed Eisav by bringing food from the hunt, Yitzchak's love for Eisav diminished. In contrast, Rivkah's love for Yaakov was unconditional and enduring. The Midrash supports this, noting that the more Rivkah heard Yaakov's voice, the more her love for him grew, independent of any conditions.<br>This enduring love mirrors Hashem's love for Bnei Yisrael, which is not dependent on our actions. It is an intrinsic love, with Hashem choosing us as His portion. This is evident in the verse, "I love you, says Hashem, and you said back, 'Why do you love us? Behold, Eisav is the brother of Yaakov, yet I have chosen Yaakov'" (Malachi 1:2), emphasizing that the love is inherent, reflecting the deep connection between Bnei Yisrael and Hashem at their very core.
It's evident that while this world is designated for Eisav, it must come through Yaakov. For Yaakov, it states "And He will give you," whereas for Eisav, it states "Your resting place shall be." All goodness flows through Bnei Yisrael, as was evident during the time of the Beis Hamikdash when other nations derived sustenance from its essence. The distinction in the blessings—where Yaakov represents the act of giving and Eisav the resting place—illustrates that the power of giving is the blessing given to Yaakov. Bnei Yisrael pass on pleasure to the world, while Eisav receives the essence of that pleasure. Bnei Yisrael are seen as the "leftovers," with the nations receiving the primary pleasure.<br>Had Eisav understood, he would have realized that Yaakov did not detract from him; in fact, when goodness comes through Yaakov, it benefits Eisav even more. Yitzchak's blessing indicated that Eisav would not lack anything due to Yaakov's blessing; the desired "fat of the land" would indeed be his. This principle still applies today, especially within Bnei Yisrael. As they nullify worldly pleasures and seek to connect to the divine source, they proportionately merit receiving blessings, with all goodness flowing through Bnei Yisrael.

“Yaakov left Be’er Sheva,” indicating a preparation for future exile, enabling his descendants to prepare properly for leaving the Holy Land. Yaakov’s journey to places where Hashem’s presence is hidden aimed to bring the glory of Hashem even to distant, hidden places. Be’er Sheva represents the life force from the seven attributes, and although Yaakov left this place of deep connection to Hashem, he carried that connection with him.<br>The Midrash quotes, “Then you shall travel securely,” relating to Yaakov’s travels. The word אז (then) connects to the 8th level, above nature's seven attributes, symbolizing Yaakov's complete nullification to Hashem. This allowed him to venture into hidden places and illuminate them. The pasuk emphasizes Be’er Sheva, as the strength Yaakov gained there enabled him to face the darkness of the outside world. Each person can learn from this by connecting deeply to Hashem before engaging in physical actions, allowing them to sanctify even mundane activities.<br>On Shabbos, one can draw life force for the entire week by fully connecting to its holiness. Be’er Sheva symbolizes Shabbos, while Charan represents the weekdays and toil. Rashi’s comment that a tzadik’s presence brings beauty and glory to a city refers to the inner connection to Hashem in everything. When a person maintains this connection, their actions align with this source. Conversely, when this connection is missing, the beauty and glory depart. Before leaving Be’er Sheva, Yaakov strengthened his connection to ensure it remained with him even in Charan. This is why the pasuk states, “And Yaakov left,” highlighting that his departure left a positive, lasting impact.
After Yaakov’s dream, he said, "I had no idea that this was a holy place." Rashi explains that Yaakov meant that had he known the holiness of the place, he would not have slept there, despite the signs from Shamayim indicating that he should.<br>We learn from Yaakov Avinu that even after such a soul-reviving dream, during a dangerous journey where he was promised protection, he was still upset about having slept there. Yaakov would have preferred to attach himself and connect to Hashem. As the Zohar explains, when Yaakov said, "I did not know," it hinted at a deeper connection to Hashem that he was previously unaware of.<br>Through the dream, Yaakov gained an added element of fear of Hashem. The general rule is that all enlightenment must bring a person to a greater fear of Hashem; without this, it is worthless. This teaching is also brought down in the name of the Ba’al Shem Tov.
When Yaakov arrives in Charan, he encounters the story of the well. The verse states, "And he saw there was a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep, and they would all gather there to remove the stone." This concept is present in every Jew. There is a divine source within everything that provides life and sustenance, symbolized by the well in the field. Even in places that seem desolate like a field, this core source remains. With wisdom and intellect, one can always perceive and recognize this inner life force.<br>The three flocks of sheep represent chochma (wisdom), bina (understanding), and da’as (knowledge). Through intellect, a person understands the internal mechanism in all things, the divine energy that causes every effect. However, the large stone on the well signifies that when this spiritual source manifests in the physical world, it becomes obscured, making it difficult to perceive this truth continuously due to physical distractions. The solution is to gather all desires and dedicate oneself entirely to Hashem before any action, thereby removing the stone. Additionally, by integrating oneself into the collective Jewish nation, the hiddenness is nullified, which will be fully realized in the future.<br>Currently, the Jewish people are the ones who gather everything towards Hashem. Even an individual who nullifies their personal desires for the sake of the community and acts for the collective good is considered to be acting in the name of the entire Jewish nation, thus uncovering hidden truths. This is exemplified by Yaakov Avinu, who, embodying the entire Jewish nation, was able to remove the stone on his own. As the Tzadik yesod olam, the righteous foundation of the world, the entire creation is sustained through his merit, allowing him to perform this act independently.

Regarding Yaakov’s journey to Charan, the Medrash quotes the pasuk, "Then you will go your way safely and not injure your feet." Although Yaakov fled from Eisav, as the pasuk states, "He ran," it also says, "And Yaakov left and went on his way." This shows that a Tzadik maintains a righteous path, even when fleeing. By leaving Be’er Sheva, Yaakov ensured he was connected to Hashem before departing. His journey aimed to prepare a place for future generations to uncover light in darkness.<br>Yaakov ventured into areas where Hashem's glory was hidden. For example, "And he came upon the place" signifies that he felt and awakened Hashem’s presence even in distant locations. When Yaakov said, "Indeed, Hashem is in this place, and I did not know," it indicated the place seemed far from holiness. It was hard for him to believe Hashem’s life force was there, but Hashem revealed that His glory fills the entire world, even if not immediately visible. This lesson is embodied in the Maariv (evening) prayer, which reveals Hashem in the darkness.
The Chidushei Harim, citing the Arizal, explained that Shabbos is referred to as a "field" (שדה), as it states, “We shall go out to the field.” This world is likened to a "desert," a place where Hashem's supervision is hidden. On Shabbos, however, the internal essence (pnimius) of Hashem is awakened, making it a time ripe for spiritual growth, much like a field ready for sowing.<br>This concept helps us understand the pasuk about Yaakov in Charan: “And there was a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep, and a big stone on top of the well, and they would gather together and roll the stone off.” On Shabbos, the wellspring of life is revealed, symbolized by the well in the field. The three flocks of sheep represent the nullification of Bnei Yisrael's hearts, souls, and possessions—בכל לבבך ונפשך ומאדך—corresponding to the levels of נפש, רוח, נשמה (soul, spirit, and breath). By nullifying everything to Hashem, one merits the light of Shabbos.<br>The pasuk, “And they would gather over there שמה,” is further elucidated by Iyov (34:14), indicating that when Bnei Yisrael nullify their entire energy to Hashem’s will, they can receive the light of Shabbos. This is also the essence of ceasing work on Shabbos, as one nullifies all personal energy and desires to Hashem. The Mishna in Avos teaches that one of the things created on Erev Shabbos was the mouth of the well, symbolizing the uncovering of spiritual light despite the accompanying darkness. By completely nullifying oneself, one can "roll off the stone" and reveal the Shabbos light. Nonetheless, Yaakov alone could uncover the well, showing that a person with a point of truth can achieve this with simplicity and without much effort.
Yaakov awoke from his sleep and exclaimed, "How great is this place; it is the house of Hashem and the gates of Heaven." This reaction is written in praise of Yaakov because any other person having such a revelation might have become haughty. However, Yaakov remained humble and became fearful. This fear signifies that he was a man of truth. Through this fear, Yaakov merited that his children would use this place for the Beis Hamikdash, as the pasuk states: "It is the house of Hashem." The Midrash explains that Hashem showed Yaakov the Beis Hamikdash both built and destroyed. Yaakov’s fear was the primary merit for the Beis Hamikdash's existence.<br>Yaakov also stated that this is “nothing other than the House of Hashem,” meaning that the place's existence is based solely on fear of Heaven. The Beis Hamikdash's existence depends on the level of fear of Heaven within Bnei Yisrael. The primary reason for its existence is the fear of Hashem, as it is written: "Pure, lasting forever." Through this fear, an opening is created in all places, as it states, “the gate of Heaven.”
Rashi comments on the verse, "And he came upon the place," stating that Yaakov instituted the Arvit prayer. He explains that it does not say "He prayed" to indicate a miraculous shortening of his journey. This connection between instituting Arvit and the miraculous quickening of the route seems unclear at first.<br>However, one can awaken Hashem's holiness in any place, depending on one's desire. Rashi's comment that Har Hamoriah came toward Yaakov means that Yaakov's intense desire to reach Har Hamoriah, despite its distance, caused it to come to him. This reflects the essence of the Arvit prayer, which is recited during darkness. In times of darkness, light is revealed only through a person's strong, supernatural desire. Everything depends on one's will.<br>The verse "Shalom to those that are close and far" (Yeshaya 57:19) implies that even spiritual distance is for the good, as it awakens a deeper longing for Hashem. Through this longing, one can bring Hashem's light even to the most distant places. Rashi's comment about the miraculous shortening of Yaakov's journey teaches that with true effort, there is no place where one cannot feel Hashem's inner light.
The Midrash Tanchuma (Vayetze 1) explains that Yaakov’s flight from Eisav was akin to the exile of someone who kills inadvertently, implying Yaakov was somewhat accountable for Eisav's distance. Yaakov had the potential to bring Eisav closer to Hashem, unlike us, who must distance ourselves from falsehood. However, due to his humility, Yaakov saw himself as unworthy, thus his actions were considered unintentional.

Section 3

With G-d's Bleasing
The Zohar explains that if someone wants to descend into a deep pit, they must first secure themselves with a strong rope to ensure they can climb back out. Similarly, when Yaakov left Be’er Sheva to travel to Charan, a place of spiritual darkness, he made an oath to Hashem with his entire heart. This oath involved committing his entire life force, symbolized by the seven traits of a person, allowing him to proceed safely to Charan.<br>The Midrash quotes the pasuk from Mishlei, "Then you will go your way safely, and not injure your feet," in reference to Yaakov’s journey. The word "אז" (then) signifies something beyond nature. When a person dedicates their seven traits entirely to Hashem’s will, they connect to a higher level and can travel anywhere without fear. This is exemplified in Yaakov’s journey when he "came upon the place" and instituted the evening prayer, ערבית. The evening, a time of mixed clarity, represents a mixture of good and bad. Yaakov was able to find the inner holiness and extract the precious from the mundane, discovering the good sparks even in darkness.<br>The continuation of the pasuk, "the sun was setting," indicates that Yaakov was in a place of spiritual darkness. Despite this, he connected to the hidden holiness there. These experiences prepared Yaakov's descendants to navigate the darkest places, always following in his footsteps. Hashem’s promise to Yaakov, "I will not forsake you until I have done what I promised," assures that Bnei Yisrael will never be forsaken, as Yaakov's connection to Hashem precedes them even in the darkest times.
Bereishis 29:2-3 describes, "The stone on the mouth of the well was large, and the shepherds would gather together and roll the stone… And Yaakov revealed the well." This illustrates the teaching of our sages that conquering one's evil inclination is greater than simply ignoring it. Typically, anyone wishing to draw water must roll away the stone, representing the evil inclination, but this is temporary as it is returned to its place. However, Yaakov did not just roll the stone; he revealed the well, uncovering the hidden holiness within the stone itself. He recognized that even the evil inclination is a hidden manifestation of Hashem, transforming it into good. This distinction between "revealed" (ויגל) and "rolled" (וגללו) highlights Yaakov's unique achievement.<br>Each Shabbos serves as preparation for the coming week, analogous to Yaakov leaving Be’er Sheva (Shabbos) and going to Charan (the weekdays). The Mishna notes that "the mouth of the well was created on Erev Shabbos," symbolizing the channeling of life force from the inner point outward. Be’er Sheva represents the light of the seven days, fully revealed on Shabbos. This dynamic reflects the deeper spiritual work of drawing holiness into our daily lives, as Yaakov exemplified.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 68:2) describes Yaakov's prayer, "I lift my eyes to the mountains, from where does my salvation come." Yaakov gave up all the support he had at his parents' home, the merit of his parents, and the holiness of Eretz Yisrael, placing himself in a situation where he relied solely on Hashem. This is what our sages meant when they said Yaakov inaugurated the evening prayer. A person in darkness typically cannot reach a place of prayer, as it states in Brachot 26b, "one who is in prison cannot free himself." However, Yaakov was different because he willingly placed himself in this situation, enabling him to establish this prayer.<br>We too inherit this energy from Yaakov, who, with absolute self-sacrifice, placed himself in dangerous situations to fight Hashem's battles. We face difficult battles from the yoke of exile and the evil inclination that constantly challenges us. The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 29:2) indicates that had Yaakov climbed the ladder with full faith, there would not have been any exile. However, Yaakov chose the path of exile to fight Hashem's battles. We follow in our forefather's path, trusting in Hashem that no harm will befall us, and we will merit to emerge from darkness into light, speedily in our days, Amen.
This is also the idea behind the vision and dream that Yaakov had. Although Yaakov did not need dreams, he placed himself in a situation of spiritual darkness where he could no longer see with a clear vision. Therefore, his revelations had to occur through dreams. Similarly, the entire exile is compared to a dream, as stated in Tehillim, "we were like dreamers." To grasp a vision during exile, a time referred to as "sleep," one must achieve it through intense dedication to Hashem throughout the day. Our sages explain that through intense longing for Hashem, like mushrooms that thirst for water, one can receive prophecy even at night, a time of sleep and darkness.<br>From this story, we learn about Yaakov's greatness. Despite attaining such an extraordinary dream, he responded with fear, saying, "How great is this place." It's remarkable that instead of becoming haughty from such a dream, Yaakov gained an added level of fear of Hashem. This reaction is a sign of Yaakov's truthfulness. As our sages explain, any action preceded by the fear of Hashem will truly last, and any action done with sincerity will leave an enduring impression of fear. Fear of Hashem is the beginning and end of everything, as we have discussed elsewhere.
"And behold, there was a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep crouching around it." The Midrash offers many interpretations of this verse, which can be applied to three elements: the world, time, and the soul.<br>In the element of the world, the well represents the Beit Hamikdash. The three flocks of sheep symbolize the Cohanim, Levites, and Israelites, as well as the courtyard, the inner sanctum, and the Holy of Holies. In the element of time, the well represents Shabbos. The three flocks of sheep are the three days before Shabbos, serving as preparation, as it states, "crouching before it." The phrase "from that well the flocks will drink" refers to the three days following Shabbos. In the element of the soul, the well represents the flowing wellspring within each Jew’s heart. The mouth of the well corresponds to the mouth of every person, as the power of Yisrael lies in their speech. By connecting all these energies to bring forth words of Torah in holiness, "living water springs forth."<br>Additionally, the mouth of the well symbolizes the Bris Mila, which is also connected to the speech of a person. "The stone was great on the mouth of the well" implies that an opening needs to be guarded, just as a door requires a lock. Despite this, Yaakov, being a man of truth, could easily uncover the well. All these concealments stem from falsehood, but for a man of truth, falsehood dissipates.
Rashi (Bereishis 28:1) asks: Why does the Torah mention Yaakov leaving (Vayetze Yaakov), when the focus should be on his destination? Rashi explains that the departure of a tzadik from a place has a significant impact. This seems puzzling because the initial question was based on the idea that knowing where Yaakov left from is not as important as knowing where he is going. Rashi's answer suggests a negative impact on the place once Yaakov leaves, which seems to strengthen the original question. However, this can be understood differently: When a tzadik is in a place, he is its glory, meaning the place's value comes from the tzadik's presence. The Torah teaches that even after the tzadik leaves, an imprint of his holiness remains, giving the place enduring significance.<br>This concept is also seen in the creation of the world. Before creation, there was only Hashem. After creation, the world's greatness lies in the divine imprint left by Hashem, which sustains it. Similarly, this principle applies to all actions a person performs. Each limb that engages in a mitzvah retains a level of sanctity, contributing to the individual's spiritual repair and the world's overall rectification.
"You shall spread out to the west, east, north, and south” (Bereishis 28:14). Our sages link this to the verse, “And I shall feed you the inheritance of Yaakov,” indicating that one who delights in Shabbos receives a boundless inheritance (Shabbos 118a). Hashem's name, שדי, signifies the attribute that limited the world's expansion, as the wicked were unworthy of its full potential. Similarly, the light of the first day was reserved for the tzadikim.<br>Physical limitations do not bind the tzadik, much like a king who can break through barriers. Since tzadikim sustain the world, no borders can confine them. This potential exists in every Jew, but the inner light is limited by the physical body. As the soul permeates the body, Hashem will expand one’s borders.<br>The phrase “I shall feed you the inheritance of Yaakov” suggests that everything is ready, yet we often lack the capacity to partake. Eating on Shabbos is a mitzvah that elevates the body and grants a limitless spiritual inheritance, overcoming physical constraints.

“And Yaakov left Be’er Sheva” (Bereishis 28:10). The Midrash quotes Mishlei (3:23): “Then you shall go with sureness.” Yaakov entered the darkest places to bring necessary reparation. The Zohar (2:52a) explains this can only be done when one is above nature, unaffected by it. This state is called "אז," where the oneness (א) overrides nature (ז). Nature encompasses the seven days of creation, with Shabbos being the light of these days, a taste of the world to come. Thus, Shabbos is Be’er Sheva—the well of seven, connecting all days to their source. When Yaakov left Be’er Sheva, he connected completely to Shabbos. Every Shabbos, by connecting to it, we can enter the weekdays to repair the world and our physical actions.<br>Another explanation of “Be’er Sheva” is that on Shabbos, everything in nature unites, becoming one. This unity opens the well, as the mouth of the well was created on Erev Shabbos (Avot 5:6). When all worlds and creation unite, it reveals the well, hinted at in the verse (Bereishis 29:3): “They (all the shepherds) gather together and roll off the stone from the well.”<br>The verse also states, “And they return the rock onto the well.” This teaches that one who conquers his evil inclination realizes that it is through this struggle that he reaches new heights. Hashem’s intention in creating the evil inclination was for good, as stated in Bereishis Rabbah (9:7): “And He saw that everything He created was very good,” referring to the evil inclination. Thus, the verse testifies that those who merit to roll off the stone understand this purpose and appreciate it, returning the stone to its place.
When Yaakov awoke from his dream, he exclaimed, “How great is this place” (Bereishis 28:17), attributing the holiness to the place itself. However, our sages explain that Mount Moriah actually came to him, indicating that the vision was due to Yaakov’s own merit. Both perspectives are true: Yaakov felt the place's holiness, yet it was his own greatness that brought the vision. This reflects Hashem's wisdom in preventing His loved ones from becoming haughty, by orchestrating events to keep the pure-hearted humble.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 69:1) explains that Yaakov's dream expressed his longing for Hashem, even in a parched land. Yaakov did not need dreams for revelations, but since he was outside Eretz Yisrael, he couldn't have visions while awake and thus received them in dreams. Yaakov desired Hashem's revelation even in darkness, necessitating dreams. This longing is reflected in the pasuk, “My soul longs for You, even in a parched and dry land.”<br>This concept extends to the Arvit prayer, which Yaakov instituted. The Gemara states that Arvit is optional, meaning only those who do not need it for themselves, but seek to bring Hashem's light into dark places, can truly pray it. This aligns with the idea of "When you lie down," indicating that one who is dedicated to Hashem’s service all day will naturally think Torah even in sleep. Thus, “You shall speak in them... when you lie down” means literally engaging in Torah thoughts even while asleep.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 69:1) quotes the pasuk in Tehillim (63:3), "My soul yearns for You, my heart pines for You. So I shall see You in holiness." The Midrash teaches that the greater one's desire and longing to serve Hashem in a spiritually dry place, the more one will merit to connect with holiness when some revelation comes. This concept comforted Yaakov, who was exiled from Eretz Yisrael to a spiritually barren land. Despite this, his intense longing allowed him to merit the vision in his dream, "So I shall see You in holiness." This intense revelation matched his desire, encouraging him as he "lifted his feet."<br>This principle applies individually and universally. One's longing for Hashem during mundane, spiritually dry times will result in a closer connection in the world to come. Similarly, the longing felt during the weekdays, filled with mundane tasks, parallels a parched land. This longing will subsequently be rewarded on Shabbos, a taste of the world to come, allowing one to bask in Hashem's glory.
The pasuk (Bereishis 30:25) states, “When Rachel gave birth to Yosef, Yaakov said to Lavan, send me.” Rashi explains this as the prophecy fulfillment: “The house of Yaakov will be fire, and that of Yosef a flame.” It is written in Tehillim (127:4), “Just as arrows in the hands of a mighty warrior, so too are the days of one’s youth.” This suggests that a person's actions can have a greater impact in areas where they themselves may be limited. Yaakov initially fled from Esav to Lavan's home, but upon the birth of his children, he returned.<br>Hashem gave man potential, and our mission is to actualize it, as stated in Bereishis (2:3), “He created them to do.” This means Hashem endowed everything with the power to spread and multiply. The more one's progeny, the greater the power of their source. This principle also applies to good deeds; the primary progeny of the righteous are their mitzvos and good deeds. Beyond the inherent potential given to each person, there is also an opportunity for additional strength through perfecting one's actions. This extra power is symbolized by Yosef. When Yosef was born, Yaakov no longer feared Esav. Just as a flame reaches further than the fire itself, one’s actions can extend their influence to places beyond their physical reach. Thus, Yaakov went to Charan to find his weapons and arrows, representing the actions that would protect him and extend his influence.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 68:1) quotes the pasuk from Mishlei (3:23), "Then you will go in surety." It compares two paths: one starts clear and straight but ends in thorns, while the other begins thorny but ends clear. These paths exist within each person. Recognizing that the seemingly easy path ends in thorns, one ultimately realizes the thorny path is the correct one. Persisting in the easy path leads to a thorny end, as true good is revealed only after effort. Yaakov, our forefather, ventured into difficult places to prepare the way for us. He is praised for the hardship in raising his children and is called the chosen of the forefathers because "forefathers" means preparing the way for their descendants. The leader takes on the thick of the difficulty.<br>"And Yaakov came to the place": Everything has a place, containing a point of truth, as falsehood has no foundation. A truthful person finds that point of truth wherever they go, and this truth drives away falsehood. "And he took from the stones of that place": The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 68:11) says the 12 stones Yaakov rested on became one. This signifies Yaakov uniting all separate parts to their original source, where they are unified. Returning to the source adds life force and renewal, symbolized by "And he placed them by his head," meaning he connected them back to their beginning.
"And he slept in that place" (Bereishis 28:11). Rashi notes this excludes the previous 14 years when Yaakov did not sleep, immersed in Torah study. David Hamelech similarly states in Tehillim (132:4-5), "If I give sleep to my eyes...until I find a place for Hashem, the mighty one of Yaakov," and earlier (132:2), "Vowed to the mighty one of Yaakov." This refers to "And he came to the place." The Midrash explains "Then you will go in surety," where "אז" signifies the perfection of the seven traits, connecting them to the source, thus perfecting all paths.
On the pasuk (Bereishis 29:7), Yaakov questioned the shepherds about gathering their flocks early. They explained it was because they needed all the shepherds to move the heavy rock covering the well. Despite seeing the large rock, Yaakov didn't consider it an obstacle, showing that the tzadik, who disregards worldly vanities, finds that falsehood cannot stand before him and flees from his presence. The rock's size symbolizes the difficulty of beginnings, which can be temporarily overcome through collective effort. The Midrash notes that after leaving prayer, the evil inclination returns, indicating constant challenges. However, it does not state that Yaakov returned the rock, signifying he had completely repaired that place, causing falsehood to disappear before him.
Bereishis 28:12 states, “And there was a ladder placed (מוצב) on the ground.” The term מוצב implies that the ladder must be placed by man, unlike נצב, which implies it stands on its own. This ladder represents a person's spiritual journey, where the body is grounded, but the soul reaches heaven. Heavenly angels ascend and descend on it, as man's body is lower than them, but the soul's root is higher. Thus, man is called a מהלך (one who moves) because he ascends these spiritual levels, unlike angels who remain static.<br>This ladder includes all the sources of human souls, and as man is a “small world,” these levels are contained within each person. After his vision, Yaakov felt fear, recognizing how far his soul's power reached and how all realms depend on him. This realization leads to humility and awe, not arrogance. Yaakov then made a vow, despite Hashem's promise of safety, because, as our sages explain, there is no assurance for a tzadik. This is because man constantly changes spiritual levels and requires new divine assistance at every step.

The Midrash quotes the pasuk in Mishlei (3:23) to describe Yaakov going to Lavan: "Then you will go your way safely...when you lie down, you will be unafraid." Indeed, Yaakov was running away from Esav, yet there was a calmness and surety in his travel. The Torah relates that he gained a state of perfection on this journey because, before he went on this journey, he spent fourteen years studying in the beis midrash of Shem and Ever. The Torah repeats Yaakov's journey, even though it was mentioned at the end of the last parsha, to teach us that his journey was different. Originally, he was escaping Esav, but after his time in the beis midrash, he was on a different spiritual level, embodying the concept of teshuva by connecting to its source.<br>This is why the Midrash uses the word אז, representing the connection of the alef, the oneness of Hashem, to the zayin, the seven days of the week. With this strength, Yaakov journeyed to Charan. Our sages explain that ויפגע במקום indicates קפיצת הדרך, where the land skipped ahead, symbolizing the supernatural nature of Eretz Yisrael, called ארץ צבי. This land stretches like a deer's skin and is not bound by natural rules. Nowadays, due to our sins, we do not see this supernatural revelation. During Yaakov's time, Eretz Yisrael was under Kenaan’s rule, and its latent power was not yet revealed. However, through Yaakov's longing for Eretz Yisrael, shown by taking stones from the place and putting them around his head, he demonstrated his love for the land. This concept is mirrored in the Gemara, where sages would kiss the stones of Akko.<br>It was very difficult for Yaakov to leave Eretz Yisrael, the land of holiness. Because of his great longing, the holiness of the Beis Hamikdash was revealed to him before its time. This is the idea of קפיצת הדרך, where even though it was not yet the time and the holiness was not externally recognizable, Yaakov revealed that "אין זה כי אם בית אלוקים"—it is not as it appears; rather, it is the house of Hashem. This idea is hinted at by our sages, who explain that Yaakov saw the Beis Hamikdash built, destroyed, and rebuilt, revealing its holiness even at this early stage.
The pasuk "And behold, there was a well in the field, and there were three flocks of sheep...and they would gather together and roll off the stone from the well" alludes to loving Hashem with all one's heart, soul, and possessions ("בכל לבבך נפשך מאודך"). These three elements help gather all 248 limbs to serve Hashem, symbolized by rolling off the stone from the well, which represents overcoming the evil inclination to reveal the pure Torah. The word "עדרי" (flocks) hints at "hidden" (העדר), indicating nullification of one's desires to attain this level. Additionally, the three flocks represent the patriarchs Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, corresponding to the three festivals: Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. Their influence at these times helps one receive special assistance in overcoming obstacles.
"Indeed, Hashem is in this place, and I did not know" (Bereishis 28:16). This reflects that Hashem, known as אין סוף (infinite), condensed His presence out of love for Bnei Yisrael, manifesting between the staves of the Aron in the Beis Hamikdash. Typically hidden (אין), Hashem revealed Himself (יש) in this sacred location. Yaakov's realization, "and I did not know," highlights Hashem's kindness, granting elevated states of holiness to His devout followers, which in turn fosters greater humility.<br>Yaakov was puzzled about not sensing the holiness of the place. Our sages explain that the sanctity was not inherent but revealed due to Yaakov's merit. The depth of holiness was shown through Hashem's love for Yaakov, demonstrating that divine revelation can occur even in unexpected places.

Yaakov embodied the entire creation, and his form is carved below Hashem's throne. Hashem folded all of Eretz Yisrael under Yaakov (Chulin 91b), necessitating his travels to various places. "Yaakov lifted up his feet and traveled to the land of Bnei Kedem," indicating he elevated even the lowliest places to their source. Rashi explains that after Hashem's promise, it was easier for Yaakov to travel. Initially, he feared the spiritual danger, but with the assurance of spreading to all corners, he continued confidently. Yaakov also introduced the Arvit prayer, symbolizing finding light in darkness.

"And he saw, and behold, there was a well in the field" (Bereishis 29:2). The phrase "and he saw" seems redundant; it could have simply stated, "And there was a well in the field." However, the stone covering the well symbolizes the evil inclination, which blinds us and blocks the Torah's life-giving water. This obstruction prevents us from seeing the water except during special times when the well's opening is revealed.<br>When we gather for the sake of Heaven, as the pasuk states, "They (the shepherds) would gather together and unroll the stone from the well," unity overcomes the evil inclination. Similarly, on Shabbos, when all creation is unified, the well's opening is revealed. One of the ten things created on Erev Shabbos was the "mouth of the well," symbolizing this revelation. Yaakov, representing the unity of Bnei Yisrael, existed in a state of unification, with his form carved below the Heavenly throne. Therefore, he could unroll the stone, seeing through the confusion of the evil inclination.<br>The Torah emphasizes "and he saw the well" to highlight Yaakov's elevated state. The pasuk in Yeshaya (58:13), "If you refrain from trampling the Shabbos...", signifies the elevation from lower stages to higher stages on Shabbos. Yaakov’s journey to the land of Bnei Kedem alludes to the gate in the Beis Hamikdash facing “Kedem,” which remained closed during the week but opened on Shabbos. The heavy stone on the well represents the days of the week, which receive sustenance from Shabbos, hiding all blessings within them.

"And he came upon the place and slept there" (Bereishis 28:11). Our sages explain that ויפגע means he introduced the Arvit prayer. "And he took from the stones of the place and placed them around his head." The stones symbolize the words of Torah and prayer that Yaakov placed in his mind and heart, leading to his dream. The Midrash elaborates that Yaakov's longing for divine revelation ensured he was constantly protected, resulting in the revelation in his dream.<br>Everywhere, the words of Torah are present, as the world was created through ten utterances. By toiling in Torah and prayer, one awakens the power of these words, sustaining the creation. The righteous sustain the world, similar to witnesses affirming a document, bearing the stamp of Hashem. Yaakov’s deep engagement with Torah and prayer altered nature for him—time and space responded to his spiritual state. The land moved towards him, and the sun set early, demonstrating the influence of holiness on the physical world.<br>This principle applies to the three primary elements: world, time, and soul. Through the power of a Jewish soul, holiness can be awakened in the world and time, aligning them with the will of the tzadik.
The well in the field refers to the oral Torah that Hashem planted within us. Although it exists in all of Bnei Yisrael, one must merit access to the mouth to give it expression, as we state before prayer: “Hashem, open my lips.” This is achieved by removing the stone that covers the well, symbolizing the evil inclination. Our sages instituted three daily prayers to provide us with the tools to uncover the well, hinted at by the "three flocks of sheep." By gathering the prayers of Bnei Yisrael, the source of the oral Torah is uncovered. As the pasuk states (Tehilim 65:3), "You who hear prayer, all mankind comes to You," indicating that while each individual has the power of prayer, connecting to the collective enables one to open and remove the stone, overcoming the blockages of the evil inclination.
Rashi interprets that the Torah's interruption to mention Eisav's actions is to emphasize the ongoing struggle between Yaakov and Eisav, reflecting the prophecy that "one nation will be stronger than the other." This parallels the constant conflict between the good inclination (yetzer tov) and the evil inclination (yetzer hara), where each seeks to undermine the other. Eisav’s decision to marry the daughter of Yishmael, instead of another Canaanite woman, was a strategic move to disrupt Yaakov’s path. Consequently, Yaakov had to find a new way to serve Hashem, which he did by hiding and studying in the Beis Midrash of Shem and Ever for fourteen years.<br>Our sages explain that both the righteous and the wicked have a portion in Gan Eden and Gehinom; the righteous can inherit the portion of the wicked in Gan Eden if they merit it, and vice versa. This dynamic is seen in the interactions between Yaakov and Eisav—Eisav took the red stew from Yaakov, which suited his nature, while Yaakov took the blessings meant for Eisav. Each one ended up with what was truly aligned with their character. This concept also applies to the internal struggle between the good and evil inclinations, where they constantly vie for dominance and influence over a person.
"And Yaakov vowed a vow, saying, 'If Hashem will be with me...'" (Bereishis 28:20). Despite Hashem already promising him protection and blessings, Yaakov made this vow. It appears that Yaakov sought to activate these promises through his own efforts. As it is written, "Hashem chose Yaakov, and Yaakov chose Hashem" (Tehillim 135:4), and similarly, "Hashem has chosen you" and "You have chosen Hashem" (Devarim 27:17-18). This highlights the mutual selection between Hashem and Yaakov, emphasizing the importance of personal initiative in spiritual matters.<br>The Ba'al Shem Tov teaches that a person must strive for their own awakening, as receiving something without personal effort might invoke the attribute of judgment. Yaakov was afraid because he sensed a divine awakening greater than his own preparation, as explained by the Ohr Hachaim. This lack of personal readiness worried him that the divine promise might not endure. Therefore, Yaakov made a vow to ensure that the blessings would be realized through his own merit and efforts, solidifying the divine promises with his personal commitment.
“Whatever You shall give me, I will surely give a tithe to You - עשר אעשרנו לך” (Bereishis 28:22). The mitzvah of ma'aser connects everything to holiness by dedicating a portion to sanctity, which extends to the rest. The tzadik prioritizes the ma'aser, making it the most important part, thereby including everything else in its holiness. This is the meaning of עשר אעשרנו and עשר תעשר (Devarim 14:22), emphasizing the primary role of the tithe.

In describing the ladder in Yaakov's dream, the pasuk uses the word מוצב (standing) instead of נצב, and ארצה (to the ground) instead of בארץ (on the ground). The ה at the end of ארצה serves the same function as a ל at the beginning, indicating "to the ground." This suggests that the ladder is not static but dynamically set from heaven to earth, symbolizing Hashem's continual renewal of creation.<br>The ladder signifies Hashem's daily interaction with the world through nature, renewing creation each day. This "order" of nature, emanating from Hashem's infinity, is called a "ladder" because it involves different interactions each day. The stages of the ladder represent the “tzimtzum,” or the gradual revelation of Hashem through various levels, allowing each person to ascend step by step, revealing Hashem's glory in the world.<br>However, Yaakov and Bnei Yisrael occupy a higher level. As the Midrash explains, Yaakov did not wish to climb the ladder but instead wanted to transcend the stages of nature entirely, with Hashem standing above him. This reflects two approaches in serving Hashem: discovering Him through nature and through the Torah. Accordingly, our sages instituted two blessings before the Shema in Shacharit and Arvit: one for nature (מעריב ערבים) and one for the Torah (אהבת עולם). In this order, we first repair nature through the ladder's stages before ascending to the Torah's levels.
Yaakov's vow after his dream reflects the practice of making vows during times of trouble (Bereishis Rabbah 70:1). By instituting the Arvit prayer, Yaakov emphasized heartfelt commitment and the longing for relief to better serve Hashem. This sincere dedication is what brings salvation during difficult times.
The pasuk states that the large rock והאבן was on the well. Seemingly, the correct word would be אבן; the extra ה signifies a specific rock. This rock represents the ultimate stumbling block, the evil inclination, which is present everywhere but is especially significant at the “mouth of the well.” This alludes to Tefila (prayer), the service of the heart, and the concept of the well of the Oral Torah. It is for this reason that we begin our prayers with the words ה' שפתי תפתח ("Hashem, open my lips").<br>The entire focus of the evil inclination is to obstruct one’s prayers, a challenge known to all who serve Hashem. The Zohar (1:147b) states that one who overcomes the snake will marry the daughter of the king. There is no easy solution to this difficulty in prayer; it requires complete dedication in all one’s actions to truly open one’s mouth in Tefila. This is why Tefila is called the “service of the heart,” as it demands ongoing dedication. The pasuk “and the flocks would gather there, and roll off the rock” hints at this longing, with the flocks symbolizing the desires that gather to remove the rock and facilitate prayer.<br>When Yaakov rolled off the rock himself, our sages compare the ease of it to pulling out a cork from a bottle. This comparison is significant because it teaches that just as a cork protects the contents of a bottle, the stone blocking prayer is essentially good. From the outside, it may seem that Hashem is hindering one, but in truth, it is a protective measure. The word ויגש ("and he approached") used here is also used with Avraham, and the Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 49:8) explains it refers to approaches of appeasement, war, and prayer. These three approaches correlate with the three daily prayers, and it is through these opportunities, signified by the three flocks of sheep, that we can roll off the rock and pray properly.
Our sages explain that when Rachel gave birth to Yosef, Yaakov could finally confront Eisav, as "the house of Yosef is a flame, and the house of Eisav is straw" (Ovadia 1:18). The name Yosef has dual meanings: "Hashem has gathered in my embarrassment" and "Hashem should add to me another son." These reflect the dual aspects of Shabbos, which provides an extra soul and signifies both cessation and nullification. Drawing light from the upper worlds on Shabbos banishes evil forces tied to nature, leaving no room for darkness.

Our sages explain that Yaakov introduced the Arvit evening prayer when he left Eretz Yisrael on his journey to the house of Lavan. The essence of Parshat Vayetze is the path that Yaakov carved for his descendants, especially for those who do not merit to be in the spiritual realm of Eretz Yisrael. This reflects our generation, where we have been banished from the “house of our life.”<br>Wherever one goes, regardless of how spiritually bereft it may be, one can make necessary reparations through the power of the Torah. This is the essence of Yaakov, as stated, "You give truth to Yaakov," where truth (emes) always refers to the Torah. The Torah provides a place (מקום) and existence to everything, as our sages tell us that everything has its place. Therefore, when Yaakov came upon the place (במקום) and took from the stones of the place (המקום), the stones symbolize the words of the Torah. Wherever one goes, there are always the words of the Torah, as nature itself is created through the ten utterances of Hashem, which are the letters of the Torah.<br>In some places, the spiritual element of the words of the Torah is hidden, while in others, like Eretz Yisrael or the Beis Hamikdash, there is more revelation. However, holiness can be found and ordered even in places where it seems hidden or confused. Yaakov's act of taking from the stones of the place and placing them around his head signifies organizing and ordering the Torah's teachings. The term "ושמו" (organizing) is akin to "ושמו בדיו" (organizing the curtains of the Mishkan). When Yaakov states אשר שמתי מצבה (that I placed as a monument), it means that Yaakov built a structure, specifically referring to the building introduced by Yaakov – the Arvit prayer.
Our sages teach that one who enjoys Shabbos is rewarded with an unlimited inheritance, derived from the promise to feed us the inheritance of Yaakov. This connection between Yaakov and Shabbos becomes clearer when examining Yaakov's vision of the ladder. Yaakov saw the ladder but did not mention it further, and our sages explain that Yaakov did not want to climb it. The ladder represents connecting the world to its divine source through natural processes, step by step, revealing G-dliness progressively.<br>However, there is another method of serving Hashem through the Torah, unique to Bnei Yisrael, where Hashem interacts above nature. Yaakov faced a test whether to climb the ladder for an easier life in this world or to choose the Torah's path. His request for bread and clothing with the clause "and Hashem will be with me" reflects his choice. The two methods correspond to the days of the week and Shabbos. Spirituality during the week involves natural processes, while on Shabbos, Hashem interacts with us above nature, offering an absolute connection.<br>One who longs for this level of connection, despite physical difficulties, is considered one who "enjoys Shabbos" and merits an unlimited inheritance in the world to come. While righteous individuals from other nations may receive reward in the world to come, the concept of an unlimited inheritance is unique to Bnei Yisrael. The reward in the world to come is based on one's efforts in this world, emphasizing the importance of preparing for the world to come. Bnei Yisrael, forsaking worldly gain for a connection to Hashem, merit a true infinity in the world to come.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 69:7) explains that in Yaakov's vision, he saw the Beit Hamikdash built, destroyed, and rebuilt. By stating, “This is not but the house of Hashem,” Yaakov negated everything else in service to Hashem. Our sages explain that Hashem folded all of Eretz Yisrael under Yaakov, representing the essence of the entire world. Just as Hashem is especially attentive to Eretz Yisrael, the rest of the world connects through it, centering on the Beit Hamikdash.<br>Yaakov dedicated the "place" entirely to Hashem, making its existence dependent on divine service. Thus, when Bnei Yisrael sinned, the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed. Yaakov's vision of its cycles of construction and destruction reflects this conditional existence based on our service to Hashem. Yaakov's actions underline the central role of the Beit Hamikdash and Eretz Yisrael in Bnei Yisrael's spiritual life. His dedication set a precedent that the Beit Hamikdash's state mirrors our adherence to divine service, emphasizing its importance as the focal point of holiness and the connection between Hashem and Bnei Yisrael.

When Yaakov came to Shechem, it says, "And he encamped by the city." The Midrash explains that Yaakov established the boundaries for Shabbat. Shabbat reflects the culmination of the work done during the week, elevating everything to its divine source. Although Shabbat is the day of divine connection, even during the week, there is a G-dly life force, though it comes through angels.<br>The idea of work during the six days is to find renewal through mitzvot, which contain Hashem's energy. By performing mitzvot, one elevates physical actions to divine levels, creating angels that provide protection. This is what Yaakov meant when he said he kept all 613 mitzvot while with Lavan, using them to fend off Lavan and Eisav. Therefore, Yaakov sent angels to Eisav, created through his mitzvah observance, which protected him.<br>Yaakov's statement, "For He will order His angels to protect you," means that mitzvot create angels that guard even in the physical world. After overcoming Lavan and Eisav, Yaakov reached a state of completion. In Shechem, which stands for "Shem Kevod Malchuto" (the name of His glorious kingdom), Yaakov needed protection to draw down divine will into the physical world. The main advice for protection is through mitzvot, aligning with the 613 limbs and sinews of a person and the world, allowing one to perform physical actions with a connection to Hashem.
My grandfather, my teacher of blessed memory, recounted in the name of the Rabbi of Lublin the interpretation of the phrase "I am unworthy of all the kindnesses" (Genesis 32:11). He explained that even the feeling of being small in one's own eyes is also a kindness from Hashem. It can further be said that through the kindnesses that Hashem has done for him, a person recognizes his own smallness. This is because, through the greatness of Hashem's kindness, a person comes to understand his own insignificance. I believe this has now been published in the book *Zikaron Zot*.
The Ohr Hachaim explains that when Yaakov told Eisav to take the gift, he said, "I have everything" (יש לי כל). This term "כל" signifies a blessing, similar to the sand of the sea that remains full even when some is taken. Yaakov was indicating that nothing would be lacking from him by giving to Eisav.<br>While Eisav said, "I have a lot," Yaakov's statement, "I have everything," seems even more encompassing. This raises a question: How can one claim to have everything when there are undoubtedly things they lack? The answer lies in being connected to the divine source. For someone attached to Hashem, whatever they possess embodies the concept of "כל" because everything at its source contains Hashem's life force, encompassing all.<br>This connection to the divine source means that one feels complete and lacks nothing, regardless of their material possessions. This idea is epitomized by Shabbat, where one feels all their needs are fulfilled. In contrast, Eisav's "a lot" is limited to human effort and thus finite. The Mishnah in Avot (4:17) further illustrates this by stating that one hour of teshuva and good deeds is more enjoyable than all of the world to come, emphasizing the completeness and unity found in divine connection. Therefore, Yaakov could truthfully declare, "I have everything."

The new name Yisrael was given to Yaakov by the angel, signifying that he had reached the level of angels. This strength remains in every Jew, as all worlds depend on their actions. The Zohar explains that the verse "He will send His angels to protect you" refers to both the good and evil inclinations, as every internal desire is an energy from Hashem, sent into this world for a specific purpose, and these energies are called malachim (angels).<br>There are different types of malachim: those from Eretz Yisrael and those from outside. During the weekdays, when work is permitted, our mission is to purify and reveal the hidden life force in mundane matters, which are the malachim of chutz la’aretz. Rashi says Yaakov sent real malachim to Eisav, implying they were hidden as malachim from chutz la’aretz, taking on physical dimensions. On Shabbat, the concept of malachim from Eretz Yisrael is revealed through Bnei Yisrael's true desires and excitement, elevating everything.<br>Malachim, or messengers, are used for tasks distant from the sender. This explains why mitzvot create malachim, as they occur in the physical realm. When the original intention is fulfilled, the messenger returns to the sender. The life force in everything is this angel helping to complete Hashem's will. Thus, "He will command His malachim for you" means that these angels assist a person in elevating actions from their physical element to their divine source.
"And You said, 'I will surely do good to you...'" This teaches that a person should not request based on their own understanding but should instead seek to fulfill Hashem's will, for that is truly the best.
After enduring 20 years with Lavan, battling Eisav’s angel, and surviving his encounter with Eisav, Yaakov arrives in Shechem "shalem" (whole). This state of completion arises from overcoming his trials, embodying the verse, "A tzaddik falls seven times and gets up." The Zohar explains this through "Many are the misfortunes of the tzaddik" (Psalms 34:20), indicating that these misfortunes refine and actualize his righteousness. The continuation, "Hashem will save him from them all," means that these trials elevate and perfect him.

“And Yaakov sent angels to Eisav.” The Zohar explains "He will send His angels to protect you" as referring to the good and evil inclinations. The evil inclination also serves for our benefit because overcoming it strengthens us, converting negative energy into holiness.<br>This explains how Eisav could receive such holy beings. Just as mitzvot create angels, refraining from transgressions also creates angels that help repair the world. Yaakov’s journey to Lavan was to extract these angels trapped in negative forces, enabling them to communicate with Eisav on his behalf, as Yaakov preferred not to approach Eisav directly.<br>Yaakov’s travels reflect converting darkness into light. When he left for Charan, day turned to night, and on his return, night turned to day, symbolizing his mission to bring light into dark places. This culminated in “Yaakov came to Shalem,” completing the world for Hashem. Shechem, representing "the glorious name of Hashem," signifies that Yaakov purified divine glory even in this world. His journey to Charan mirrors the six days of work, and his return to Shechem embodies Shabbat, as he established techum Shabbat, the boundaries for Shabbat.
I have become humbled from all the kindness. I heard in the name of the Rebbe of Lublin that Yaakov was giving thanks even for the feeling of humility he was experiencing. We can explain this further: the more a person receives kindness from Hashem, the more he should become humble, recognizing that Hashem gives him more than he deserves. This is what Yaakov meant with the word קטנתי, "I have become small (humbled)." Yaakov was saying that from every kindness he received from Hashem, he reached a new level of humility, until there was no difference in his state of humility and gratitude now and when he left Charan with nothing, as he said, "With my staff I crossed the river."<br>This is no small matter to remember 20 years later what one had. This is the mitzvah of remembering Yetzias Mitzrayim, to recall how Hashem took us out from all concealment and the evil inclination. By being in a low state, we avoid haughtiness, for Hashem cannot be with the haughty. Through remembering this, we can constantly reach humility and feel how Hashem continuously takes us out of Mitzrayim. The ultimate purpose of Hashem's kindness is achieved when a person reaches humility from these gifts, showing that he truly accepts and receives the kindness.<br>A person should strive to learn from the traits of our forefathers, as Yaakov says, "Protect me, the G-d of Avraham." The Medrash asks how Yaakov could pray to be saved from Eisav, as Eisav was also a descendant of Avraham and Yitzchak. The Medrash answers that this merit only applies to those who follow their ways, not Eisav. By choosing to follow the deeds of the forefathers with all one's heart, one can rely on their merit. Hashem said about Avraham, "Because I know him that he will command his children after him" to keep the Torah. The actions of our forefathers were written in the Torah so that all Jews could learn from them, as Hashem, the Torah, and the Jews are one.

Section 5




I have become humbled by all the kindnesses You have done for me. The Chidushei Harim explained in the name of the Rebbe of Lublin that Yaakov was also saying his humility was achieved through Hashem’s kindness. The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 76:5) explains that Yaakov acknowledged he was worthy of Hashem's goodness, but this recognition humbled him further. Each kindness received should lead one to greater humility and embarrassment, realizing that these blessings are not merited but are purely Hashem’s grace.<br>This is a sign of true kindness. Generally, the kindness of nations leads to haughtiness and does not endure. Our sages teach that Hashem repays the righteous over time, while the wicked are repaid immediately. Immediate reward makes the wicked haughty, leading to their downfall. Conversely, Hashem rewards the righteous only when they are properly prepared to attribute their success to His kindness. Just as relying on one’s merits prompts scrutiny in Heaven, recognizing Hashem’s role ensures that merits remain intact.<br>Yaakov's statement, “I have become humbled from all the kindnesses,” indicates that the kindnesses did not lead to haughtiness but to greater humility, preserving his merits. This explains the Midrash: Although Yaakov felt meritorious, he feared relying on his merits might lead to arrogance and temporal success. He sought salvation through Hashem’s kindness alone, invoking Hashem’s promise of abundant kindness to avoid the pitfalls of self-reliance and ensure lasting blessings.
The Chidushei Harim explained the verse, “When Eisav asks you who do you belong to and what is this gift for,” as also referring to the evil inclination, which tries to upset a person with questions like “Where are you going? Where are you from? In front of whom will you give a reckoning?” A person should strengthen himself and reply, “It is for your servant Yaakov,” meaning through nullifying oneself to Klal Yisrael, who are precious to Hashem, one shows that all actions are for the right purpose.<br>This is illustrated in the phrase “a Mincha gift to my master Eisav.” A Mincha offering is modest for those who cannot afford a regular korban. Hashem considers the poor man’s offering as if he sacrificed his own soul because it comes through self-sacrifice. This teaches us that through much effort in fighting the evil inclination, Hashem values everything Bnei Yisrael do, even if it seems small. Additionally, the continuation of the verse, “Behold, he follows us,” can refer to Hashem, indicating that even when we do just a little, Hashem completes it for us, as the verse says, “For the G-d who completes for me.”<br>Yaakov did all this not for his own sake, as he had enough merits to be saved from Eisav. Instead, he did it for us, to forge a path that can be used even when we lack merits. This shows that Hashem assists us in completing our efforts, ensuring that even the smallest actions are significant and valued.

“Your name will no longer be Yaakov, but Yisrael, for you have fought with beings and people and prevailed” (Bereishis 32:29). These two names, Yaakov and Yisrael, represent the body and the soul. Yaakov represents the body, from wisdom (Yud) to the heel (Eikev), while Yisrael represents the soul, meaning "Li Rosh" (a head for me). A person must perfect the body so the soul's power is reflected, thus becoming "Yisrael."<br>Yaakov's fight with the angel illustrates this. The human soul is greater than an angel's, but an angel's body surpasses a human's, as our bodies are bound to this world. However, Yaakov perfected his body to become a "Chariot" for Hashem, making his body as holy as his soul. Hence, he could fight the angel with his body, which had transcended its physical nature to become spiritual.<br>This transformation is why Yaakov's name changed. His body, once called Yaakov, became spiritual like his soul, now called Yisrael. This is reflected in "And Yaakov came 'Shalem'" (Bereishis 33:18), meaning his body and soul achieved harmony, or Shalom. In each Jew, the body and soul conflict, and Shabbat represents this harmony, offering a taste of the world to come where bodies will be perfected like souls. On Shabbat, this harmony is achieved according to one's weekly preparation, meriting an "extra soul," signifying the soul's power spreading into the body.

The Midrash on the Pasuk “And Yaakov arrived safe (Shalem)...and he encamped before the city” (Bereishis 33:18) explains that he arrived on Erev Shabbos as the sun was setting. This is derived from the word ויחן (encamped), and the word שלם (safe) is connected to שלום (peace), which is associated with Shabbos. The idea is that Yaakov's journey out of Eretz Yisrael represents the work of the weekdays. Through his hard labor, he merited the perfection of Shabbos.<br>This is the meaning of the Pasuk, “He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven, no harm will touch you” (Iyov 5:19). The suffering and challenges during the six days of the week lead to perfection and purity from negativity on Shabbos. Yaakov arriving as the sun set indicates his high spiritual level, akin to Hashem ceasing creation exactly at Shabbos. Yaakov perfected his physicality during the week, allowing him to enter Shabbos precisely at the right moment, symbolizing complete harmony and peace. This is learned from the word שלם, where שלום refers to Shabbos, indicating he arrived just as Shabbos began, similar to Hashem completing creation on the seventh day.
Yaakov's level was above nature, always in the realm of Shabbos, as our Sages explain that a Torah scholar is called “Shabbos.” However, Yaakov Avinu chose to immerse himself in the world's challenges, aiming to correct the realm of action for his descendants. This is why he faced difficulties with Eisav, paving the way for future generations. The phrase “He was fearful and concerned” reflects his fear of having to kill or be killed, even though he could have avoided this path. He wanted to confront and overcome the evil inclination.<br>The term מאוד (very) refers to the evil inclination and the angel of death. The Midrash states that even the chosen forefathers and prophets, promised safety by Hashem, were afraid because their actions impacted future generations. This is illustrated in Tehillim 49:6, “What shall I fear on a bad day? The sins of my heel will surround me,” indicating the fears for the last generations, the “heel of Mashiach.” The forefathers’ fear stemmed from concern for their descendants, who would face significant challenges.<br>Yaakov's desire to perfect all these places led him to find the “very good” hidden for those who fear Hashem, as discussed elsewhere. This concept of sending angels relates to the perfection of action, dependent on angels and the 39 forbidden actions on Shabbos. Man alone cannot overcome negative forces, so Hashem provided many Torah and mitzvos to create protective angels. The battle with Eisav's angel reflects this, similar to the Friday night tradition where the evil angel says Amen to the good angel's blessing. This journey brought Yaakov to Shechem, where he was “Shalem,” complete. Further details on the angels are discussed elsewhere, hence the brevity here.
"I have become small (humbled) by all the kindness and truth that You have done to your servant” (Bereishis 32:10). The Rebbe of Lublin taught that even Yaakov's humility itself is part of the truth and kindness bestowed upon him by Hashem. This means that Yaakov recognized his own smallness and understood it as a divine gift, a result of Hashem's benevolence.<br>We can further explain that “I have become small” reflects Yaakov's fear in a dangerous situation, yet he strengthened his faith, understanding that even his descent into a low and spiritually perilous place was a kindness from Hashem. The proof for Yaakov was that he crossed the Jordan with his staff, a sign that Hashem was with him. This realization made Yaakov certain that his trials were not absolute downturns but part of Hashem's greater plan for good. This understanding gave him confidence that everything Hashem does is ultimately for the best.
“And You have promised me that You will do good to me” (Bereishis 32:12). Could it be that Yaakov would question Hashem and imply a contradiction in His promises? Rather, we can explain that Yaakov's fear and concern were for his descendants in future generations. Yaakov acknowledged that if his descendants were not chosen and unique to Hashem, and if all of creation did not depend on them, he would not be afraid just because they are his children. However, since Hashem promised that his descendants would be as numerous as the sand of the sea and blessed, Yaakov sought mercy for them, knowing their significance in Hashem's plan.

"And Yaakov sent malachim - angels before him." We've previously discussed that the concept of a “malach” refers to forces of nature. Our sages explain that every blade of grass has a malach commanding it to grow. Similarly, the idea of perfecting one’s deeds during the week is reflected in “and you shall do all your work,” with sages teaching that a malach is created through each action. This represents the external level, but the inner essence of each Israeli is above the level of malachim, reaching the sanctity of Shabbat.<br>However, achieving the level of Shabbat is only possible through the perfection of one's actions during the weekdays. This is the significance of Yaakov sending malachim ahead, and is echoed in his statement: "I was with Lavan, and I kept the 613 mitzvot" – showing his engagement with nature while adhering to all mitzvot. This preparation protects the internal essence, the Torah itself, from Eisav, who opposes the Torah.
Yaakov says, "I have become small - קטנתי from all the goodness that You have done with me." The Midrash presents two opinions: one suggests Yaakov was expressing unworthiness, while the other implies he felt worthy. If the latter is true, the question arises about the meaning of קטנתי. The answer lies in Yaakov's humility; he recognized that his worthiness stemmed from acknowledging that all the kindness and truth bestowed upon him by Hashem were not due to his own merit. Despite the common association that claiming humility implies underlying arrogance, Yaakov’s humility before Hashem showcased his self-awareness.<br>Through this humility, Yaakov preserved his merits and did not lose them. The general rule is: if one perceives worthiness independently, they become dependent on their merits and may deplete them. However, someone aware that everything is a result of Hashem's kindness experiences reciprocity, receiving everything with kindness, and preserves their own merits. The essence of קטנתי is that Yaakov realized the responsibility resting upon him and his descendants. Hashem demonstrated that all the kindness and truth in the world emanated from Yaakov and his descendants, as indicated by the continuation of the verse ואיטיבה עמך, meaning through Yaakov's actions.<br>Similarly, the Patriarchs are the reason for the world's existence as Hashem interacts with it through their kindness and mercy. This aligns with the promise Hashem gave to Avraham, ונברכו בך, ensuring blessings for all nations through him. Consequently, the Patriarchs prayed that their actions wouldn't hinder this promise, as exemplified by Yaakov's plea regarding Eisav, “Please save me from my brother, from Eisav…and You said that you will surely give me goodness.” He was requesting that the good he had indeed endure. Each member of Bnei Yisrael must realize that everything depends on their actions. Through this understanding, one should structure their prayers before Hashem, fulfilling the verse (Tehillim 55:19), "...Because of the many that are with me."
Another interpretation of "קטנתי מכל החסדים - I have become small because of all the kindness and truth that You have done with Your servant" is that the mind's thoughts are far more numerous than the body's capacity. As our Sages teach (Avot 5:20), "Run like a deer," meaning that just as a deer's skin cannot contain its flesh, the human body limits the soul's expansion. Without the body, the soul would immediately return to its source due to its immense longing for the Creator.<br>Yet, this limitation also fuels the soul’s yearning to reconnect to its source, gradually uplifting the body as well. This is the essence of "run like a deer"—because the deer's skin cannot contain its flesh, it runs even further. Therefore, the foundation of one’s service to Hashem is this longing. Our Sages explain that prayer is termed "service of the heart," emphasizing that the heart's constant yearning to reconnect with Hashem is the core of divine service.<br>The righteous find no rest in this world; as they perfect their bodies, their minds expand, driving them to integrate external actions with internal truth. Yaakov's statement, "I have become small," refers to his body being too limited to contain all the divine kindness and truth bestowed upon him. Thus, Yaakov prays for protection from Eisav, representing negative forces. In the future, when the body is perfected, there will be no fear of negative influences. However, in this physical world, the body requires special protection and elevation, which was the focus of Yaakov's prayer.

“And Yaakov sent messengers before him” (Genesis 32:4). The question arises: why did Yaakov send messengers ahead, potentially provoking Eisav by displaying his wealth? The answer is that Yaakov intended to draw Eisav out of Eretz Yisrael so that upon Yaakov's arrival, he would be complete, as stated, “And Yaakov arrived whole” (Genesis 33:18). Yaakov himself was not afraid, for upon entering Eretz Yisrael, he reached a high spiritual level, making Eisav powerless against him.<br>However, Yaakov did this for the benefit of future generations, paving the way by confronting Eisav head-on and dealing with him through appeasement, gifts, and battle. This explains why he felt fear, as noted in the Zohar, because he was entering a dangerous situation for the sake of his descendants. To reassure himself, Yaakov recalled Hashem's promise, “I will surely do good to you and make your descendants as numerous as the sand of the sea.”<br>When Yaakov says, “I have become small from all the kindnesses,” he acknowledges that all the salvations, goodness, and truth bestowed upon others come through him, though he felt unworthy. He acted according to Hashem's will because he understood that the world depended on him. By confronting these dangers, Yaakov prepared the path for future generations, ensuring their ability to cope with similar challenges.
The Midrash explains that when “Yaakov arrived שלם (complete) and camped outside the city” (Genesis 33:18), it was Erev Shabbat. After making all necessary preparations, Yaakov drew a new light from the upper worlds, symbolizing Shabbat—a day of rest and a taste of the world to come. His name change from Yaakov to Yisrael reflects the dual names each Jew bears for this world and the world to come. Yaakov achieved the higher name, Yisrael, indicating his spiritual elevation.<br>Yaakov’s battles with Lavan and Eisav were under his first name, representing the physical aspect. Once resolved, he merited Shabbat’s spiritual energy and was called Yisrael. This concept extends to every Jew on Shabbat, where they can experience higher spirituality, encapsulated in “He spreads His Sukkah of Shalom on us.”
"And I have sent these to you to find favor in your eyes” (Genesis 32:5). Later, it repeats, “To find favor in the eyes of my master” (Genesis 32:8). Yaakov was likely truthful, aiming to draw Eisav closer, as the word הגדה implies drawing out, like sinews. Although Eisav could not reach Yaakov's spiritual level, if he found Yaakov’s path appealing and nullified himself to it, he too would achieve rectification. This is the idea behind the gifts, as Rashi explains.<br>Each person must prepare against the evil inclination through appeasement, gifts, and battle, to prevent it from controlling their life. However, one cannot rely solely on personal efforts and must beseech Hashem for mercy to overcome the evil inclination and its tricks, as our sages state: "If Hashem does not help, one cannot prevail" (Kiddushin 30b). The concept of gifts also involves awakening Hashem’s mercy on negative desires, recognizing that everything, even those seemingly disconnected from the divine, belongs to Him and was created for His glory. Thus, one should seek comprehensive rectification, not only personal salvation but also the subjugation of all evil forces.
“And a man fought with him” (Genesis 32:25). Our sages explain that the dust from this battle reached the throne of Hashem. This signifies that while other nations receive sustenance through their angels, Bnei Yisrael are directly connected to Hashem. Yaakov had to assert dominance even over these angels, demonstrating the potential power of humans over celestial beings.<br>The term ויאבק (wrestled) is linked to אביקה (a fire), as the Midrash explains the angel's attempt to intimidate Yaakov with fire. Yaakov, representing truth and completeness, was unafraid, embodying the prophecy “the house of Yaakov will be a fire” (Ovadia 1:18). Thus, Yaakov, embodying truth, achieved a higher spiritual level than the angel, as indicated by “You give truth to Yaakov.”
"And He called him E-l” (Genesis 33:2). The Gemara (Megillah 18a) explains that Hashem called Yaakov “E-l.” The term ויקרא (to call) signifies endearment, understanding, and connection, as seen in "Hashem called the light Day," meaning He endowed light with control over the day. Similarly, this divine connection was granted to Yaakov, symbolizing his ability to draw out G-dly energy in this physical world.<br>This was part of Yitzhak’s blessing to Yaakov: “And He shall give you” His G-dliness, ensuring that Yaakov's actions would always be connected to divine sources. Yaakov merited this more than any other tzadik because he represented all of Israel, upon whom Hashem places His name, as in “our G-d” in prayer. This fulfilled Yaakov’s request, “And Hashem will be an Elokim to me.” The subsequent story of Dina highlights that Yaakov was punished for not fulfilling his vow immediately, as he should have once Hashem’s promise was realized.

"And Yaakov arrived, complete, to Shechem and encamped facing the city" (Genesis 33:18). When Yaakov left Eretz Yisrael, the word ויצא (Vayetze) is used, indicating the loss felt by the place due to the tzadik's departure. Now, upon his return, Yaakov restored a new level of 'chein' (beauty) to the area, as suggested by the word ויחן (encamped), linked to 'chein.'<br>The Midrash interprets the verse from Job 5:19, "He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven, no harm will touch you," as referring to the six days of the week preparing for Shabbat. One must work both physically and spiritually, through prayer, to receive Shabbat peacefully. Similarly, this world is preparation for the world to come. Yaakov's journey out of Eretz Yisrael was a preparation to return peacefully, symbolized by ויחן, which signifies beauty and the perfection he attained upon returning to Eretz Yisrael. Our forefathers' love for Eretz Yisrael, akin to Shabbat, is why we are given Shabbat, and we must guard it, ensuring that "in seven, no harm will touch you."
“And Yaakov sent malachim” (Genesis 32:3), which Rashi explains as literal angels. When Yaakov blesses his sons, he mentions conquering Shechem with his "sword and bow," which Unkelos translates as prayer. This signifies that through one’s fervor in Torah and prayer, one can send fiery arrows against the enemies of Bnei Yisrael, as stated: "He commands His angels to guard you" (Psalms 91:11).<br>Even though the inner essence of a person is higher than that of angels, as the Midrash explains that the one being guarded (man) is greater than the guard (angels), our physical nature obstructs us. Therefore, we need Hashem’s assistance through angels, created by our Torah study and mitzvot. This enables us to ultimately rise above them, as it says, "upon their wings, they shall carry you" (Psalms 91:12). Thus, Yaakov sent the angels ahead of him as protection, acknowledging his physical limitations.

Section 11

With G-d's Blessing
At the beginning of the parsha, Yaakov sends angels ahead and prays to Hashem, expressing his humility: “I have become small from all the kindness that you have done with Your servant.” The Midrash references the pasuk in Iyov (5:19): “In six sufferings He will save you and in seven no harm shall befall you.” Externally, angels are higher than mankind, but internally (pnimius), the neshama of man is higher than angels. The Midrash illustrates this by stating that the one being guarded—man—is greater than the guard—angels.<br>Hashem arranged it such that angels depend on man, and vice versa, to teach us that without Hashem, there is no perfection. The concept of "help" from angels aligns with our sages' explanation that through every good deed, an angel is created. Our forefathers, being the chariot for Hashem's presence, were elevated like angels even externally. After death, all of Bnei Yisrael will experience this elevation without interference from the body. Rashi notes that Hashem usually doesn't unify His name on people while alive, but an exception was made for Yaakov, who attained a high level, physically, even fighting with an angel. The name "Yisrael" symbolizes this internal level, emphasizing the removal of external impediments.<br>Before reaching this level, Yaakov needed to send angels ahead, symbolizing his confronting Eisav early. If Yaakov had waited to meet Eisav in Eretz Yisrael, he would have been so elevated that Eisav would have no power against him. By drawing Eisav out, Yaakov set a path for his descendants to battle Eisav even in chutz la'aretz (outside the Eretz Yisrael). Using the word "קטנתי - I am small," Yaakov alluded to his external vessel being too small for his spiritual internal level. His spiritual greatness required a new 'garment,' the name Yisrael. This teaches us to interact with the world, recognizing the need for great work to perfect it while anticipating future perfection. Shabbos, where we prepare during the week and experience a taste of the world to come, embodies this concept. This understanding sheds light on the Midrash's quoted pasuk: In six days (referring to the days of the week and our toil in this world), He shall save you, and on the seventh (Shabbos, symbolizing the world to come), "No bad will touch you." Yaakov had already attained this level in this world.
Yaakov says, "I have become small from all the kindness that You have done to Your servant" (Bereishis 32:10), implying he did not earn anything and it was all through Hashem's kindness. We have explained that Yaakov's humility led him to feel that any level he attained was solely due to Hashem's kindness, and his entire life was a supernatural experience beyond human effort. Hashem reciprocates based on our attitude towards Him; hence, by not attributing any merit to himself, Yaakov ensured that his merits were passed on to his descendants for generations.
He prepared himself with gifts, prayer, and war. These correspond to "with all your heart" (prayer), "with all your soul" (war), and "with all your possessions" (gifts).

The Midrash on "I have become small - קטנתי because of all the kindness and truth that You have done with Your servant" offers two opinions: one says Yaakov felt unworthy, the other says he felt worthy. If he felt worthy, what does קטנתי mean?<br>Yaakov's humility stemmed from his high spiritual level as a “chariot for Hashem.” This high level comes with greater accountability, making him feel "small" and completely nullified to Hashem. Those at the highest levels before Hashem lose their independent existence due to their complete submission.<br>This idea is echoed in Tehillim (36:7), "A man and an animal, Hashem will save," referring to people who are wise but humble themselves like animals. The world has layers, and the concept of "animal" can be higher than "man" when it symbolizes nullification to Hashem. Yaakov, therefore, felt "small" and nullified. Despite having strategies against Eisav, he sought uninterrupted connection to Hashem, similar to David's plea in Tehillim (27:4) for constant closeness to Hashem.

The Midrash explains that when Yaakov came to Shechem after his encounter with Eisav, he was complete. The Midrash quotes the pasuk in Iyov (5:19): "In six He will save you and in seven no harm will befall you." The six refers to the six days of the week, aligning with a person's work in those six days leading to the concept of Shabbos—a state where no foreign influence can harm it. Yaakov himself was permanently in the state of Shabbos, as our sages teach (Zohar 3:29a) that Torah sages are always in the state of Shabbos. Even more so, Yaakov, who was chosen among the forefathers, had his form carved below the Holy Throne of Hashem, symbolizing perfection. This reflects the idea that "Hashem saw that everything He made was good," a vision that sustains the world and leads to the rest and completion embodied in Shabbos.<br>Our sages teach (Brachos 34b) that in places where the ba’al teshuva (those who repent) stand, even completely righteous individuals cannot stand. This is because returning to the original purpose for which Hashem created the world is an extremely high level. However, this status is often temporary and comes through thoughts of teshuva. Yaakov, being the perfect man according to Hashem's intention, had his 'form' carved under the Throne of Hashem, always in a state of perfection. Yaakov, wanting to perfect all aspects of the 'days of the week'—the concept of engaging with the physical world—felt "fearful and concerned" because of Eisav. The fact that someone wicked was chasing him bothered Yaakov, who served Hashem perfectly. He attempted to lower himself to allow Eisav some connection, hoping to uplift Eisav and the physical world. When this proved impossible, Yaakov separated from Eisav, and "Eisav returned to his way, and Yaakov traveled to Sukkot."<br>Yaakov then gathered himself and his family, as Rashi explains in the beginning of Vayeshev—this gathering saved him. The gathering of the righteous benefits them and the world, while the gathering of the wicked is detrimental. Eisav, representing the wicked, started with 400 men. The path of the wicked is that they start out easy but end in suffering, leaving Eisav with no one, while Yaakov remained intact and unified. The righteous need separation to gather all sparks of holiness into the unity of Hashem. This is the idea of (Esther 3:8) "a nation that is spread out and separated." The entire concept of exile is to gather all the sparks of holiness, leading ultimately to redemption. This aligns with the pasuk in Iyov, signifying that throughout the six days, Hashem constantly saves us in our worldly endeavors, yet on the seventh day, Shabbos—the ultimate redemption—"no harm shall befall you."
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 76:2) explains that when the pasuk states "And he was fearful and concerned" (Bereishis 32:7), it means that Yaakov was worried about two extremes: killing Eisav or being killed by him. Yaakov was concerned that if he distanced Eisav too much, Eisav might be completely lost, but if Eisav got too close, he could harm Yaakov's holiness. Thus, Yaakov "divided into two camps," reflecting his inability to unify with absolute truth while confronting wickedness. He had to lower his level, as indicated by his statement, "קטנתי - I have become small," signifying his divided state.<br>Once Yaakov left Eisav, he was elevated to the name Yisrael and was no longer troubled by Eisav. The name Yaakov was associated with his struggle with Eisav, dealing with him through trickery. With the new name Yisrael, he no longer needed to engage in such tactics and could connect to absolute truth. The name change symbolizes a rebirth, elevating Yaakov significantly. This explains why Yaakov used the term קטנתי, as he felt small like an infant being reborn.
In the pasuk "And Yaakov said, 'The G-d of my father...'" (Bereishis 32:9), the word "said" is used instead of a typical term for prayer, indicating that Yaakov was always in a state of constant prayer and connection to Hashem. This is reflected in his establishment of the arvit (evening prayer), which, unlike shachris and mincha, has no fixed time and is considered optional (רשות), suitable for someone truly free, like Yaakov.<br>Despite being "fearful and concerned," Yaakov's "saying" was a form of prayer. The darkness and opposition he faced did not distance him from prayer, exemplifying the essence of the arvit prayer, spoken in the night. This shows Yaakov's unwavering connection to Hashem, even in distress.

On the verse "And Yaacov wrestled.. until dawn", our Rabbis commentated that they made a cloud of dust that reached the throne of glory. Yaacov's portrait is engraved under the throne of glory, as it is written, "Give truth to Yaacov" and God's seal is truth. This is the portrayal of Yaacov, from which all of Am Yisrael come from as it is written, "all come from the seed of truth". This world is the world of lies, and truth can cannot fully appear, as the midrash tells us "truth said – don’t create a world of lies". There is opposition to the facet of Yaacov under the throne, Eisav and his power. As the midrash connects the name Eisav "עשיו" to the word "שוא" – worthless and unreal. Bnei yisrael, via the Torah which is truth, as our Rabbis teach "there is no truth but Torah" , and so "give truth (to Yaacov)" is in the present tense, as everyday Bnei Yisrael have a revelation what the truth is via the Torah. Bnei Yisrael's task is to reveal truth in the world of lies

Vayeshev



Section 1

...תרל"א
...Baruch HaShem
The word Vayeshev is the the idea of Shabbos. For until now Yaakov was involved with the difficult task of combating the 'klipa' the spiritual husk covering the holiness, of Eisav , Lavan and Shechem. Now Yaakov settled down and connected to his source, which is the idea of Shabbos, which is the idea of completely nullifying oneself to the source. This is what is meant by the Medrash that Yaakov gathering in of himself and his children saved him. Just as it says by Shabbos that it becomes one with the secret of Oneness. And through this connection with the oneness all the negativity falls away. And similarly when Yaakov ran away from Eisav. The Medrash says לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי, לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי מֵעֵשָׂו, וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי מִלָּבָן, וְלֹא נָחְתִּי מִדִּינָה, וַיָּבֹא רֹגֶז, בָּא עָלַי רָגְזוֹ שֶׁל יוֹסֵף. Yaakov did not have any rest From Eisav, Lavan Dina and Yosef. When tzadikim want to also have calmness in this world Because the will of the tzadik is to add more glory to HaShem in this world where his glory is covered and hidden. (Through revealing HaShem in everything). This is the idea of Yosef, which is connected to the concept of adding onto Shabbos before and after Shabbos. For through all the work of the 6 days, one yearns to receive the Shabbos with love. And through this one is able to even add Shabbos to the days of the week. [This idea is like the idea that water reflects whatever it sees, so too one's heart is reflected in another person. Just as a bridegroom goes to his bride, she comes out to greet him]. And this is indeed a great task to bring the holiness of Shabbos literally into the days of the week. (Certain laws of Shabbos apply during that time) This therefore is the meaning of the Medrash: The tzadikim wish to be at ease in this world. For they are bringing the idea of The world to come, a world which is always Shabbos, into this world. However they also want to be at ease in this world, and having this come easy in this world is not possible and therefore there is much hiddenness. (Bringing the concept of the world to come into this world, cannot be the same way as it is in the world to come. It is restricted, and covered by the husk of these worldly matters. This is what is meant by the adversity of Yosef. As Rashi explains Yosef was the Flame whereas Yaakov was the fire. And a fire without a flame cannot reach far. Yosef’s mission was to bring the flame of the fire to far places (even into this world, and therefore he was able to be Eisav’s adversary). This is what is mentioned in the Medrash that He saw a group of dogs and he sat between them. Yaakov also wanted to purify and extract the holiness even from the ‘dogs’, from the lowliness of this world. Similarly after the end of last week's parsha which goes through all the kings of Eisav, Yaakov goes and sits between them and through his flame is able to burn down all their ‘husks’
The Midrash (Bereishit Rabba 85:2) explains that the juxtaposition of Yosef being sent to Mitzrayim and Yehuda leaving his brothers is because the brothers felt the guilt of selling Yosef would persist if they stayed together. Therefore, they decided to split up.<br>The Chidushei Harim teaches that Yosef's mission was to be entirely holy and devoted to Hashem, as he is called a ‘crown of his brothers.’ In contrast, Yehuda's mission was to bring holiness into the mundane world, as indicated in Devarim 33:7, ‘bring him to his people.’<br>There was a debate among early chasidic leaders: some wanted a few very holy chasidim, while others preferred many chasidim, even if on a lower level. Yosef preferred to stay in one place of holiness and let it spread, while Yehuda believed in spreading out to bring holiness everywhere. Thus, the Midrash suggests that Yehuda's idea of spreading out was to disseminate Hashem's holiness throughout the world.
In Yosef's dream, he saw himself and his brothers gathering bundles of sheaves. Onkelus translates this as binding sheaves. The field, where they were binding the sheaves, symbolizes an open area accessible to all, much like how Eisav was described as a man of the field, representing a place of doing as one pleases.<br>The mission of the 12 tribes was to connect everything to its life force source in Hashem, ensuring that everything remains attached and connected to its origin, even the seemingly mundane and separate matters of this world. This concept aligns with the idea of sefirat haomer.<br>The Midrash explains that when Yosef's sheaf stood up, it was due to the silence of his mother Rachel, who remained silent when Leah was married in her place. This silence signifies the understanding that one cannot act solely based on their intellect and desires but should be nullified to divine guidance. Rachel's silence, despite knowing Leah was taking her place, demonstrated her recognition of Hashem's will.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 84:3) states that Yaakov wished to live in ease, but Hashem responded that it is not enough for the righteous to have Olam Haba; they also wish for ease in this world. Immediately, the issues with Yosef began. The desire of the tzadik is to bring holiness into this world, but first, he must purify himself completely, free from the influence of this world. When the righteous are at ease, it means they are entirely connected to their divine source, without any worldly interference. Yaakov, being on such a high spiritual level, was above nature and thus disconnected from the physical world, making it difficult for him to bring holiness into this world.<br>This task fell to Yosef, who could maintain holiness while being immersed in the physical world. This is why the pasuk states, "These are the children of Yaakov - Yosef," highlighting Yosef as the conduit through which Yaakov's holiness could reach the other tribes and all the worlds. Rashi's comment, "a fire without a flame does not reach far," means that for the fire to connect and transform, it needs a flame. Yosef was this flame, as he could elevate the good deeds of the tribes to Yaakov. Yaakov loved Yosef because Yosef would inform him of the good deeds of his brothers, showing Yosef's unique ability to connect with them.<br>The phrase "Yaakov settled in the land where his fathers had stayed" signifies that Yaakov connected to his divine source, embodying the concepts of teshuva and Shabbos, where everything is uplifted and connected to its higher source.
The Midrash (Tehillim 30:2) states, "I praise you Hashem for you have lifted me up." The Rav of Pershischa explained that דליתני (lifted me up) implies both elevation and humility. Hashem elevates a person while keeping them humble, allowing closeness to Him, as reflected in “He lifts the lowly” (Shacharis birkas krias shma). The Zohar interprets “Better a poor but wise youth” (Kohelet 4:13) as the good inclination, which is humble and wise.<br>One who is wary of the evil inclination and fears sin experiences constant renewal. In contrast, comfort leads to stagnation. Wisdom (חכמה) is seen as כח מה (“strength from nothing”), recognizing that all strength comes from Hashem, as indicated by “the beginning of wisdom is the fear of Hashem.” The word דליתני also suggests renewal and humility.<br>Yosef, described as "a youth" (Bereishis 37:2), signifies constant renewal through התעוררות (awakening). During Chanukah, Bnei Yisrael's lowliness allowed Hashem to perform miracles. As Tehillim (40:2) states, "I put my hope in Hashem... He lifted me out of the miry pit... and set my feet on a rock," illustrating that humility and calling out to Hashem bring salvation and renewal.
Yosef refused Potiphar's wife, saying, “My master trusts me with everything in this house except you, his wife. How could I do this wicked thing and sin before Hashem?” (Bereishit 39:8-9). This teaches us to combat temptation by recognizing that Hashem allows us the choice to sin, which should deter us from acting against His will. Yosef aimed to dissuade Potiphar’s wife from temptation, as he had no desire for her, shown by the term וימאן, meaning he refused without any temptation. His firm refusal allowed him to clearly state his position.

“These are the descendants of Yaakov; Yosef…” (Bereishis 37:2). Ovadia 1:18 states, “The House of Yaakov is a fire and the House of Yosef is a flame, and the House of Eisav like straw.” The Midrash explains that just as a single spark can destroy a large pile of straw, so can Yosef, the flame, overcome Eisav’s forces. Yaakov symbolizes the Torah, which is above nature. To internalize the Torah’s light, one needs strong desire and enthusiasm, embodied by Yosef the Tzadik.<br>Rashi (Bereishis 30:25) notes that a fire (Yaakov) without a flame (Yosef) cannot reach far. This implies that the more one feels distant from Hashem, the stronger their desire to draw closer. Thus, “These are the descendants of Yaakov; Yosef” means that through the desire and passion represented by Yosef, Yaakov’s influence extends and impacts the world.
The Zohar (1:179a-b) explains the pasuk (Kohelet 4:13), “An unfortunate boy is better than an old foolish man.” It teaches that constant danger from the evil inclination renews a person, leading to attachment to wisdom (chochmah). Conversely, haughtiness makes one see themselves as a king, causing them to forget their previous accomplishments.
In Bereishis 39:8-9, Yosef refused his master's wife, saying, “My master trusts me with everything in this house except you, because you are his wife. How could I do this wicked thing and sin before Hashem?” <br>We learn from this to guard against the evil inclination by recognizing Hashem’s trust in us. Despite His power to prevent us from sinning, He gives us free will to accept His sovereignty. This realization should humble us, guiding us to act according to Hashem’s will and affirming His dominion over all creation. Yosef’s example shows that initial refusal without rationalization is key. He first refused Potiphar’s wife and then explained his reasoning, highlighting the importance of firm refusal before contemplation.
On the verse “Yosef went to do his work,” the Midrash (quoted in Rashi) explains that he intended to sin but refrained after seeing the image of his father. Additionally, when Yosef saw “there was no man home,” it indicates he did not find himself to be a man (Bereishit Rabba 87:7).<br>This can be interpreted to mean that Yosef connected to his life source and realized he had no life if he acted against Hashem’s will. This is the meaning of “he did not find himself to be a man.” The image of his father represents the higher image and comparison above for everything in this world. Man’s actions cause an awakening in the upper worlds.<br>Understanding this, Yosef overcame his evil inclination. This realization of the impact of his actions helped him resist temptation, leading him to “run away and go outside,” completely detaching because he saw that sin was the opposite of life.

The Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 84:1) explains that Yaakov's ingathering with his children saved him from Eisav. While Yaakov's work with Lavan symbolized the weekdays, his settling represents Shabbos. The ability to settle came from the concept of ingathering, where everything becomes one with the secret of oneness, similar to Shabbos. This ingathering specifically refers to Yosef, as “the house of Yaakov is a fire and the house of Yosef is a flame.” The written Torah is like fire, but the life force of Torah in all creation, represented by the Oral Torah, is through Yosef, the flame.<br>The advice here is that by gathering all energies to the point of holiness, holiness descends. The flame, representing excitement, dissipates the evil inclination's enticements. This is reflected in the verse, “The wicked flee though no one gives chase, but the righteous are as confident as a lion” (Mishlei 28:1). Through the concept of nothingness (אין), where one nullifies his desires to his source, Eisav left the land due to Yaakov’s excitement and the resulting embarrassment.<br>The Chidushei Harim explains Rashi’s parable about Eisav’s kings and the flax dealer's camels. Flax, made of separate sheaves, symbolizes Eisav’s people, each one special on their own, while Yaakov’s seventy souls symbolize unity. Eisav aimed to make everything separate and significant on its own, whereas Yaakov aimed to bring all separations closer to the innermost point of oneness. On Shabbos, all creation draws closer to its source, achieving unity and becoming a vessel for Hashem’s blessing, which is peace and wholeness.
"But he refused. He said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me here, my master gives no thought to anything in this house, and all that he owns he has placed in my hands.” (Bereishit 39:8).<br>This teaches us to combat the yetzer hara by contemplating how we are entrusted by Hashem to follow His will, despite having the freedom to choose otherwise. Yosef, recognizing his master's complete trust, refused Potiphar's wife, illustrating that such trust should lead one to feel ashamed to betray it. This shame helps one avoid sin. Initially, one must refuse temptation without reasoning, which then allows for true understanding and wisdom to follow, as stated in Avot 3:9: "Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will endure."
It seems that Yosef's sale as a slave and his degradation by his brothers, who stripped him of his clothing, were pivotal moments. By maintaining his faith in Hashem and believing that everything happens for the good, Yosef was later able to flee Potiphar's house without his clothing. This earlier experience prepared him to degrade himself for Hashem’s will.<br>Yosef's actions teach us the importance of accepting Hashem's ways with joy and love. As Tehillim 66:5 says, "For He is held in awe.” The whole episode of Yosef’s sale was bewildering to his brothers. They couldn't understand how Yosef could separate himself and claim that eleven stars would bow to him when there were supposed to be twelve tribes of Hashem. <br>In reality, Hashem orchestrated events so that Yosef’s sons, Menashe and Efraim, became their own tribes, and Levi was counted separately. At the time, none of this made sense. Ultimately, Yosef was elevated above his brothers and not counted among the tribes, as it says, “He was a crown unto his brothers” (Bereishit 49:26).
The Midrash (Ruth Rabba 5:6) states that if Reuven had known Hashem would record his actions, "And Reuven heard it, and delivered him out of their hand" (Genesis 37:21), he would have carried Yosef on his shoulder to his father. This highlights that the deeds of our forefathers were imbued with Torah and intertwined with the future merits of their descendants. The verse, “For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of Hashem” (Bereishit 18:19), means Avraham connected his actions to his descendants, ensuring future benefits from his righteousness. This is why Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov are called “Avos” (forefathers). Their actions were foundational and recorded in the Torah, guiding Bnei Yisrael to understand and correct their ways. The Midrash implies that had Reuven known his actions would teach future generations, it would have strengthened his resolve, and he would have carried Yosef back to their father. Therefore, each person should consider how their actions impact their descendants, helping them remain steadfast against wrongdoing.

Yaakov wished to settle in peace, but Hashem said it is not enough for tzadikim to have peace in the World to Come; they also wish for it in this world. Therefore, the issue with Yosef occurred. Previously, Yaakov endured challenges to save him from Eisav and Lavan, as he prayed, “Save me from my brother, from Eisav.” Once saved, he became completely removed from negative influences. Now, his mission was to repair and perfect everything he had gone through.<br>This applies to everyone: first, one must fight the evil inclination, separate from it, and overcome ungodly thoughts and desires. Once achieved, one becomes a free person, worthy of the World to Come. This is akin to Shabbos, a rest without conflict. However, a tzadik is not satisfied with peace in the World to Come alone; he also seeks to settle in peace in this world, correcting all past experiences. This is the idea of bringing the peace of Olam Haba into this world.<br>When Yaakov faced the trials with Yosef, it wasn't a punishment but a necessary process to achieve such a high level of spiritual completion. Yaakov aimed to make all days as peaceful as Shabbos, but it wasn't the right time. However, he enabled Bnei Yisrael to find the rest of Shabbos even during weekdays on special occasions like Chanukah and Purim. The Medrash says the House of Yaakov will be a fire, the House of Yosef a flame, and the House of Eisav straw. When Yaakov and Yosef are fortified, Eisav becomes powerless. By performing worldly actions with holiness, Bnei Yisrael extract all holy sparks, leaving Eisav’s house as mere straw. This principle holds that where Yaakov and Yosef are present, Eisav is powerless, as seen when Yaakov could confront Eisav only after Yosef was born. This ingathering saves them from Eisav, causing Eisav to be “borne off by the wind.”

Section 6

Rashi, quoting the Midrash, explains that when Yaakov saw Eisav's generals, he was initially fearful. Hashem reassured him that one spark from Yaakov could burn them all, as “the house of Yaakov will be a fire and the house of Eisav will be straw.” Seeing Eisav's strength actually empowered Yaakov, enabling him to gather his energy to fight the negative forces. The prophecy “One nation shall be mightier than the other” suggests that a stronger evil inclination increases the strength of the good inclination to combat it.<br>This means that the stronger Yaakov’s fire, the more Eisav’s house becomes like straw. Holiness has a double blessing: it strengthens the tzadik and weakens the negative forces. The Midrash’s phrase “Yaakov settled” implies that he gathered himself and his children with increased strength, fortified by seeing Eisav's generals. This realization allowed Yaakov to settle confidently, knowing he had the strength to overcome them.
Yaakov desired to dwell in serenity, but Hashem questioned why a tzadik should seek peace in this world when he already has his portion in the world to come. Immediately, the “anger” of Yosef fell upon Yaakov (Midrash Bereishis Rabbah 84:1). Clearly, Yaakov would only seek serenity after perfecting himself completely. However, Hashem’s will is for every member of Yisrael to continually toil and add to their service, as the concept of Tosefes (adding more) has no limit.<br>This “anger of Yosef” signifies that any achievement and higher spiritual levels come through overcoming opposition, akin to the evil inclination. For one who has already perfected themselves and conquered their evil inclination, a new force arises, similar to the evil inclination, but entirely holy. This force, needed to further challenge and elevate one’s service to Hashem, is what is referred to as the “anger of Yosef.”
Yosef brought an evil report about his brothers to his father (Bereishis 37:2). It is clear that Yosef, the tzadik, was not involved in lashon hara (evil speech). However, a true tzadik cannot tolerate even the slightest hint of evil, similar to Eliyahu Hanavi, who said, “I have been extremely zealous” (Malachim 1:19:10).<br>The tribes understood that if Yosef remained with his father, they would be marginalized because Yosef was exceedingly holy and separated from worldly matters. Yosef is called “the crown (נזיר) of his brothers” and “בן זקונים,” signifying his purity and complete detachment from any evil. Although his brothers were also tzadikim, Yosef had to be in Mitzrayim first to later realize that his brothers were righteous as well.
That which the Holy One, blessed be He, did not reveal the sale of Joseph to our father Jacob, peace be upon him — even though it was because of an oath, nevertheless, why did He orchestrate it from heaven [like this]? It is possible that it was because it was for his benefit. As if he had known that Joseph was sold to Egypt, a place of licentiousness and impurity, it would have caused him even more distress. For it was a significant thing for the righteous Joseph to retain his holiness in Egypt. So it appears that the Holy One, blessed be He, did everything for the good. As the Children of Israel could not have been redeemed without it being preceded by the descent of Joseph to Egypt. And also Joseph's test in Egypt was only possible because of this itself, that he was sold through perversion and the corruption of justice. But this helped him avoid assimilation, and this merit helped him retain his holiness. And even Joseph's test with Potiphar’s wife, written in the Midrash, "And there was no man, etc." appears to have been a very great test. There are two types of tests: One that can be overcome with personal strength and another which is more powerful than this, that is only overcome by the will and the true and righteous heart of the righteous person [tzaddik], which merits that his free will that comes out of the test be taken away from him. That means heavenly assistance. And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, <i>But he refused, and said [...], "Behold, my master, etc."</i> (Genesis 39:8). And this explanation is written in Meor Einayim, that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave man free will about every action he wants to do, except that God, may He be blessed, requests from man that he should remember the yoke of His kingdom, may He be blessed, and know that everything is from Him. So man must, at the very least, keep this. And understand these things in the words of the righteous Joseph, <i>and he did not withhold, etc., besides you, etc.</i>. And it is enough for the wise with a hint. And it is with this that the righteous Joseph merited to get out of free will, as he remembered that even free will was given by the Holy One, blessed be He, so that transgressing His will, may He be blessed, is not just. Hence, despite his inability to overcome the test with his own power, the Holy One, blessed be He, removed him from the test because of the bitterness he had about [transgressing]. And this was preparation for all the exiles. As the exile of Egypt encapsulates all exiles; and the essence of exile is additional free will. For if man did not have free will at all, he would truly be free. And so when we merit to get out of free will, that is the complete redemption.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 84:14), quoting Yeshaya 57:13, teaches that Yaakov’s ingathering with his children saved them from Eisav and his generals, who were all blown away like the wind. This illustrates that everything depends on the power of gathering for the sake of Heaven, as stated in Avos 4:11, "Any gathering that is for the sake of Heaven will endure." Even though Eisav stayed with his father Yitzchak, while Yaakov was spread out in foreign lands, it was Eisav who eventually left for another land because of Yaakov. Yaakov, on the other hand, settled in the land of his fathers, demonstrating that spreading out benefits the wicked, while gathering in benefits the righteous and the world.<br>Eisav’s ingathering wasn’t genuine; it was only to facilitate his future spread. His nullification was self-serving and thus did not endure. Conversely, Yaakov’s time of dispersion aimed to ultimately gather and sanctify all the light he encountered. This is why Yaakov succeeded and endured. The rebuke in Yeshaya 57:13 highlights that gatherings not for the sake of Heaven lack the power to save. Yaakov’s true ingathering led to lasting tranquility, as righteous beginnings in suffering end in serenity (Bereishis Rabbah 66:4).<br>This concept applies to all of Yisrael. The weekdays represent dispersion through various tasks, while Shabbos unifies everything with the secret of oneness. By longing for Shabbos during the busy week, one can uplift everything to holiness, causing all waste to fall away. The verse in Ovadia 1:18—“The House of Yaakov will be a fire, the House of Yosef a flame, and the House of Eisav like straw”—illustrates that Yaakov’s fire (holiness) and Yosef’s flame (spreading holiness) ultimately reduce Eisav to straw. The wicked's power derives from sparks of holiness within them, which, when extracted by the righteous, leaves them powerless. This idea is echoed in the Midrash: Yaakov, by not fearing Eisav, removed his power, leaving him as chaff blown by the wind.
Rashi (Bereishis 37:1), citing the Midrash Tanchuma (Vayeshev 1), compares the mention of Eisav's descendants to a gem that fell into sand. One sifts through the sand (Eisav's descendants) to find the gem (Yaakov and Bnei Yisrael). The Torah details the generations from Noach to Avraham to establish Avraham’s lineage, but why list Eisav's descendants, who were born after Yaakov? The explanation is that Yaakov's perfection came through overcoming these negative forces.<br>The Torah first lists the kings of Edom (Bereishis 36:31) and then states "And Yaakov dwelt" (Bereishis 37:1). This sequence shows that the negative forces exist so the righteous can overcome them and achieve greater heights. This aligns with "And one nation will get strength from another nation" (Bereishis 25:23). Eisav’s power exists only to perfect the side of holiness. Thus, Eisav’s strength comes from Yaakov.<br>When negative forces dominate, their true purpose isn't clear. The Midrash (Yalkut Shimoni 1:140) likens this to chaff boasting that the field was planted for it. Yet, when the wheat is fully grown, the chaff is blown away. The chaff does protect the wheat, but this becomes clear only once the wheat is fully developed.
“And Reuven heard and he saved him from their hands” (Bereishis 37:21). Reuven acted with true intent to perform a mitzvah. When he returned to the pit and found Yosef gone, he feared that his advice had led to Yosef’s demise. However, Hashem testified that Reuven's actions indeed saved Yosef from being killed, as without Reuven's intervention, the brothers would have killed him. This teaches us that when a person intends to do a mitzvah with true intent, even if it seems unsuccessful, one can be assured that something positive comes from it.
The pasuk does not mention that the brothers' hatred for Yosef was due to the bad reports he brought to their father. It only states, “And they saw that Yosef was loved by their father, and they could not speak to him in peace” (Bereishis 37:4). It seems the Torah mentions the bad reports as the cause for Yosef's descent to Egypt. Had Yosef stayed and continued reporting negatively, the brothers would have been completely pushed away.<br>The explanation is that a true Tzadik presents the good deeds of Bnei Yisrael to Hashem. Yosef had not yet reached this level of perfection until after his trial with Potiphar’s wife, when he was then called Yosef the Tzadik and only presented their good deeds. Therefore, once the brothers came to Egypt, they lived in harmony with their father.<br>The sin of selling Yosef is attributed to the brothers because if they had been more righteous, Yosef’s reports wouldn't have affected them. Consequently, there would have been no need for Yosef to go down to Egypt. Thus, they were the cause of the descent to Egypt.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 87:5) states that Yosef said to Potifar’s wife: Hashem chooses from those He loves to be a pure sacrifice. This Midrash seems difficult; why seek distant reasons for Yosef’s refusal to sin?<br>The truth is, a tzadik overcomes the evil inclination by nullifying personal will before Hashem's will (Avos 2:4). Our sages explain that one should not say they are disgusted by forbidden things but rather, "I would like it, but my Father in Heaven has decreed otherwise." Complete refusal, as Yosef demonstrated, is extraordinary.<br>The Midrash reveals Yosef's method: he expelled all desire by contemplating his readiness to sacrifice his life for Hashem. Since one must give up life for the three cardinal sins, Yosef reasoned that if he could sacrifice his life, how could he not resist a sin that didn’t require his life? This calculation can help every Jew avoid sin by recalling their willingness to sacrifice for Hashem's commandments.
After Yosef withstood a severe test, which our sages say was greater than the forefathers' tests (Tanchuma Vayeshev 7), he was placed in jail. This can be understood as follows: Hashem punishes a tzadik at a time when his merits are great. We see this concept when Hashem judges Bnei Yisrael during the day when they are busy with mitzvos (Midrash Psikta Rabta 40 on Tehillim 9:9).<br>Yosef's imprisonment was likely a punishment for the bad reports he brought to his father about his brothers (Midrash Tanchuma Vayeshev 6). After passing the test and reaching the root of his good actions, Yosef established himself on a unique, high level. This caused the original sin to "reawaken," as Hashem is exacting with the righteous like a hairsbreadth. Thus, he was punished for his earlier sin.<br>This principle applies to everyone. When one perfects oneself, one must also correct previous actions. This should humble a person and prevent haughtiness when performing mitzvos properly. Instead, one should fear that previous actions might bring punishment, emphasizing continuous self-improvement.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 84:1) explains the pasuk, "And Yaakov dwelt in the lands of his fathers" (Bereishis 37:1), emphasizing that the gathering of Yaakov and his sons saved him from Eisav. Our existence revolves around mending divisions within the world. Thus, our souls engage in various pursuits, contributing to the restoration of all things through our involvement.<br>Final reparation, however, comes through nullification to the source, which is the essence of teshuva. When a person returns to their source and regrets their separation from holiness due to involvement in worldly matters, they can repair everything through the power of teshuva. The gathering and nullification were also due to Yaakov's prior efforts. As our sages teach (Megillah 6b), "If one says I toiled and I found [succeeded], you can believe him." This toil during the weekdays merits the rest of Shabbos.<br>Yaakov's efforts during his travels out of Eretz Yisrael led him to return to "the land where his fathers dwelt," symbolizing nullification to the source. This is why the pasuk states, "These are the descendants of Yaakov; Yosef." The effort in toiling in Torah represents Yaakov, and if done with truth, it leads to Yosef, symbolizing gathering and addition. When one connects all power to oneness, they gain more strength from the source, akin to the unity experienced on Shabbos, "when everything is united with the secret of Oneness."
The days of Chanukkah were established as festivals of praise and gratitude. Through hallel and hoda’ah—praise and gratitude—these days were instituted as festivals. The idea is explained by the pasuk, "You give a banner to be uplifted—נס להתנוסס—to those who fear You for the sake of truth" (Tehillim 60:6). Hashem performs miracles for Bnei Yisrael to elevate them and take them out of the natural order. Just as Hashem changes nature for us through miracles, we must awaken our souls to transcend the natural order, achieving the idea of "a banner to be uplifted." When Bnei Yisrael correctly utilize this opportunity, the miracle remains for generations.<br>There are two types of miracles: passing miracles and permanent miracles established in the soul of Bnei Yisrael. The sign distinguishing them is when Bnei Yisrael sacrifice their souls for the sake of truth. Then it becomes "to be uplifted for the sake of truth," and it endures forever. The word "truth" (קושט) also connects to "decoration" or "jewelry." When Bnei Yisrael shows readiness for miracles and are drawn toward them, they merit to escape the natural order.<br>This concept is described in Shir Hashirim (1:4), "Draw me, and I will run after you." This is the idea behind establishing the days of praise and gratitude. The days of gratitude became a miraculous time forever, as explained above.

The Midrash explains that it was the power of Yaakov gathering his sons that protected him from Eisav. Yaakov's children were born in Padan Aram, and he ultimately dwelt in the land of his fathers. In contrast, Eisav's children were born in Canaan, but he eventually left because of Yaakov. The end is what truly matters; Yaakov returned to his roots, whereas Eisav was afraid of Yaakov. Yaakov's original fear of Eisav was during his journey, but once he gathered his children, Eisav fled because of Yaakov.<br>On a deeper level, the word פני refers to Yaakov's inner light, revealing his internal strength as the fire of Yaakov. Consequently, "the house of Eisav was like straw," as they are interdependent; when one rises, the other falls. The pasuk from Yeshaya 57:13, "When you call out, you will be saved when you are grouped together," signifies that unity and connection to the source of unity bring salvation. On Shabbos, Bnei Yisrael unify with the secret of Oneness, causing all who sin to separate from them.<br>For the wicked, the order is reversed; they start united but eventually separate, "like chaff blown away in the wind." Yaakov's struggles with Lavan and Eisav aimed to extract the sparks of holiness trapped among them. The Torah quickly lists Eisav's chiefs and then focuses on Yaakov and his children, akin to sifting through sand to find a diamond. Yaakov understood that among his travails were diamonds—sparks of holiness—requiring him to fight Hashem's battles to extract them. This explains the use of the word וישב, signifying Teshuva, and מגורי, connected to גרים, hinting at the sparks of holiness.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 84:1) explains that Yaakov's gathering with his sons protected him from Eisav. While Yaakov faced hardships with Lavan and Eisav, he eventually "settled in the land of his fathers," reflecting a period of peace and spiritual connection. Eisav's ease during Yaakov's absence illustrates that the wicked may start easily but end in difficulty, unlike the tzadikim, whose challenging beginnings lead to clarity and ease.<br>Yaakov also prepared for future exiles, understanding the covenant that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land. The Zohar interprets מגורי as fear, yet Yaakov settled into this fear, embodying "a tzadik is sure like a lion" (Mishlei 28:1). The Ba’al Shem Tov teaches that escaping fears is futile, akin to a pregnant woman trying to outrun her fetus. Instead, one should find strength within difficulties, as Mishlei 14:23 states, "In every sadness, there will be extra."<br>Yaakov's story shows that after settling in fear, he produced positive outcomes (תולדות). This teaches Bnei Yisrael that solutions often lie within challenges. By gathering and connecting to their inner source, "truth shall sprout forth from the land," and difficulties can be transcended, bringing positive results.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 84:17) explains that when the brothers sold Yosef and "sat down to eat bread," their actions, though seemingly sinful, actually hold hope for the world. Our sages say that the entire exile resulted from this sin, but paradoxically, the survival of Bnei Yisrael in exile is credited to the merit of the ten tribes. The correct understanding is that the brothers were paving a new path for future generations. Recognizing Yosef's exceptionally high spiritual level, they sold him and chose to maintain their status, albeit lower than Yosef's supernatural level.<br>The brothers are criticized for not striving harder to create a path for future generations that matched Yosef's level. This criticism stems from Hashem's precise scrutiny of the righteous (Bamidbar Rabbah 20:24). Although they did not "see Heaven with their eyes" (Iyov 15:15), attributing the entire sin and exile to them due to their elevated status, their actions still serve as a source of hope for us in exile.<br>Their decision to sell Yosef and remain at a lower spiritual level than him provided a way for future generations to navigate exile. They prepared a path that, while not on Yosef's level, was still significant. This act is seen as a way to sustain and guide Bnei Yisrael through the challenges of exile, as elucidated in the Midrash.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 86:4) explains the verse (Bereishis 39:2), "Hashem was with Yosef in the house of his Egyptian master...and he was successful," to indicate that Yosef would "jump." This means that wherever a member of Bnei Yisrael goes, their inner essence accompanies them. In exile, this essence is often obscured, leading to an unsteady spiritual life force. Clarity occasionally arises, allowing one to draw strength from the revealed light available to the tzadik and all Bnei Yisrael, who are called tzadikim, "Your entire nation are righteous" (Yeshaya 60:21).<br>In Yosef's story in Mitzrayim, the Torah repeatedly uses the phrase ויהי, "and it was," to highlight the fluctuating experiences. Sometimes, divine truth was revealed; other times, it was hidden by negative forces and impurities. When recounting Yosef's time in prison, the Torah repeats ויהי ה' את יוסף - "Hashem was with Yosef" to indicate an interruption in clarity, symbolizing that holiness was not consistently established during his exile.<br>Despite this, hidden light persists in exile, as our sages teach that "there is an unlimited inheritance," and “not even a division of steel can separate Bnei Yisrael from their Father in Heaven.” This enduring connection ensures that even in the darkest times, the inner essence and divine light remain with Bnei Yisrael, providing hope and strength.

The Midrash explains that Yaakov's gathering with his sons protected him from Eisav. The Mishna (Avot 4:11) states, "Any gathering for the sake of Heaven will endure." While Yaakov faced many struggles and was away in Padan Aram, Eisav lived comfortably in Canaan. However, Eisav eventually left because of Yaakov, as his intentions were not for the sake of Heaven. Yaakov, despite his hardships, ultimately settled in the land of his fathers, showing that his journey was always intended for a higher purpose.<br>The Mishnah (Avot 5:17) also teaches that any argument for the sake of Heaven will endure, suggesting that Yaakov's disputes with Eisav and Lavan were ultimately for a righteous purpose. This is evident as Yaakov's intentions were revealed to be for the sake of Heaven, ensuring his actions had lasting significance. The pasuk from Yeshaya 57:13, "When you call out, you will be saved," indicates that everything depends on intention. For Bnei Yisrael, help can always be found, especially when intentions are pure. When salvation comes through gathering, it signifies that the intention was for the sake of Heaven.<br>The pasuk (Bereishis 37:1) states, "Yaakov dwelt in the land of his fathers - מגורי אביו," alluding to the connection back to the source, similar to the concept of Shabbos. Just as Yaakov now rested, when the effort of the weekdays is directed towards Shabbos, it is considered a gathering for the sake of Heaven. This gathering also refers to future generations, as the actions of the forefathers impact all generations. The forefathers' actions became Torah, teaching Bnei Yisrael, and their traversed places retained remnants of their holiness. The Midrash also explains Yaakov's lack of rest from Lavan, Eisav, Dina, and Yosef, symbolizing the four kingdoms that ruled over Bnei Yisrael. The lengthy exile is attributed to the sin of selling Yosef, emphasizing that our hatred towards one another has caused a wound in the source of the tribes, bearing the suffering of their sins.
The Midrash (Hoshea 1:4) explains that Yaakov and his sons went to Mitzrayim due to Yosef, orchestrated by Hashem for our ultimate benefit. Hashem wanted the exile to start with the tribes to prepare for redemption (Mishlei 13:24). The Mitzriyim couldn't rule over the brothers or Yaakov, so the sale of Yosef brought them to Mitzrayim voluntarily, not by force.<br>This voluntary descent was necessary as Yosef's righteousness laid the groundwork for redemption. Yosef's role and merit made the exile a preparatory stage for future salvation.

Section 12

5642
With G-d's Blessing Briefly
The Midrash explains that the gathering of Yaakov and his sons protected him from Eisav. The pasuk (Yeshaya 57:13) states, "When you cry out, your gathering will save you." As long as there were sparks of holiness in Eisav, he could pursue Yaakov. Once Yaakov and his sons gathered these sparks, Eisav was left with only chaff and straw, and was blown away like chaff.<br>When Yaakov "dwelt" (וישב), he metaphorically extracted all that was swallowed by the "pack of dogs" (symbolizing impurity). This aligns with Yosef's dream of gathering sheaves in the field, representing taking the sparks of holiness from Eisav, "a man of the field."<br>Thus, "when you call out, your gathering will save you" means that understanding and gathering the essential point connected to one's suffering leads to salvation.
"And they took him and threw him into a pit" (Bereishis 37:24). The phrase "and they took him" might seem redundant. It signifies their attempt to assume Yosef's role, as indicated by "they sat and ate bread." Though Yosef is the provider, they rejected his leadership and took his place.<br>Yosef was destined to reach a higher level, but the brothers retained their positions, with Binyamin filling Yosef's role, as noted in the Zohar. The brothers couldn't sustain Yosef's elevated level, leading them to bring negative reports about him to their father.<br>Yosef's severe testing was necessary, as Hashem elevates a person only after testing them. His apparent descent was actually for future elevation—“a descent for the sake of ascent” (ירידה לצורך עליה).

Section 13

5643
With G-d's Blessing
“And Yaakov dwelt in the land—מגורי of his fathers” (Bereishis 37:1). The Zohar explains that the word מגורי is an expression of fear.<br>Our sages teach that each of our forefathers had a unique trait: Avraham embodied love and kindness, Yitzchak embodied fear, and Yaakov combined both. Until this stage, Yaakov primarily operated in the realm of Avraham’s loving kindness, which is associated with travel and spreading holiness, as seen in Avraham's commandment "Lech Lecha." Love and kindness extend beyond obligation and help bring those who are distant closer, making Hashem's name beloved through one's actions (Yuma 86a).<br>Now, Yaakov transitioned to embodying the fear of Yitzchak. Just as Yitzchak was commanded not to leave Eretz Yisrael, Yaakov settled in the land. While pursued by Eisav, Yaakov was in the mode of Avraham’s loving kindness, drawing out sparks of holiness. Once this was complete, Yaakov shifted to the attribute of fear, which might explain why the “anger of Yosef” emerged. Yaakov, now dealing with divine judgment, found it challenging to maintain this state, as true completion requires a blend of divine judgment and mercy.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 85:1) explains that while Yosef, Yaakov, and Reuven were in a state of mourning, Yehuda’s children were born, bringing about the light of Mashiach from Yehudah. Mashiach comes with the "absence of thought," meaning the final redemption must come from Hashem's salvation beyond human comprehension. This is demonstrated by the birth of Mashiach during a time of mourning.<br>The brothers' argument with Yosef was for the sake of Heaven, evident from its endurance. This argument highlighted the existence of two Mashiachs: Mashiach ben Yosef and Mashiach ben David. Each brother believed in their perspective—either from Yosef or David. Mashiach ben Yosef begins the redemption, and Mashiach ben David completes it. First, Yosef was lost, then Yehudah's children were born in a hidden manner. Hashem, knowing their true intentions, took their good thoughts and created the light of Mashiach.<br>The tribes form the foundation of the world, similar to the forefathers. This is alluded to in Shemone Esrei, with 12 middle blessings corresponding to the 12 tribes and the first 3 blessings to the forefathers. The 12 requests represent new energies Hashem brings daily, such as forgiveness, health, and parnassa. Yehuda parallels "Shomea Tefillah," representing King David's voice. Ultimately, the Kingdom belongs to Yehuda as we need Heaven's help, symbolized in "Shema Koleinu." This applies individually, as Mishlei 19:21 states, "Many thoughts are in a man’s heart, but Hashem’s plan endures." While one must plan and prepare, Hashem's help is essential, ensuring that intentions for the sake of Heaven lead to His enduring plan.

Section 1



The concept of the dream mentioned in the Torah about the seven years of plenty and the seven years of famine hints that even the strength of the evil forces only exists because the abundance is in exile and hidden. However, they have no power of their own, except for the life force given by HaShem. This is what is meant by "and they swallowed... but it was not known." It seemed as if they had their own power, but this is not the case.<br>This was to show Pharaoh before the exile that even though Bnei Yisrael would be under his control, he still had no power against HaShem. In reality, it is written that "a new king arose who did not know Yosef," indicating that he had forgotten this concept as well.
The lesson from the story of the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine is that one needs to prepare during the good times when holiness is revealed. One should firmly establish the enlightenment received during these times so that it sustains them during the bad times when holiness is hidden. As it says in Koheles (7:14), "In a time of good fortune, be good, and in a time of misfortune, reflect." This means that during good days, one should immerse themselves in the goodness to properly reflect and know how to act during bad days.<br>Before any test, there is an enlightenment that teaches how to behave appropriately afterward. This might have been hinted to Yosef when he ruled over Egypt, suggesting he should prepare for the exile to come. Indeed, it is said in the Midrash that due to Yosef resisting Potiphar's wife, Bnei Yisrael were protected from forbidden relations in Egypt. Through the concept of Yosef, one can find light even in times of darkness.<br>Similarly, the gate of the inner courtyard facing east, which is closed for six days and opened on Shabbos (Yechezkel 46:1), teaches that the initial energy for renewal is closed during the six working days. During these mundane days, the work is to find the internal spirituality. However, through Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh, when the gate is opened, one can find holiness even during the weekdays. The active tense "Yipoteach" implies that Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh are keys through which one can unlock inner spirituality during the week. This concept is embodied in Yosef, who guarded the covenant, indicating the internal part in everything sustained by Hashem. By guarding this point, especially on Shabbos, one can connect and nullify their existence, becoming closer to Hashem. This helps during the weekdays, enabling one to find the Shabbos point even then.
In the name of the Chidushei Harim, I heard regarding the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles by the entrance to one's house. This is comparable to the outer keys. This also provides protection for this world. Through fear of heaven, the internal spirituality is protected from being overly drawn into worldly matters through love. 
We can learn from the Midrash on the verse "Hashem has found (matza) the guilt of your servants" that the word "matza" can also mean emptying, like emptying a barrel (Bereishis Rabbah 85:2). Even if someone cannot find any sin within themselves, and indeed there may be nothing apparent, as far as Hashem is concerned, there is certainly a sin. The brothers, who couldn't find any wrongdoing themselves, still acknowledged that Hashem found something. This was like emptying the last bit from the barrel. Despite this, they said, "How can we justify ourselves?" and could not lift their faces from shame. From this, we can learn how much more we should feel embarrassed before Hashem at all times.
The Midrash states that "He did not turn to the arrogant," referring to Yosef. It can be explained that since Yosef was deeply connected to HaShem, it seemed to him from the interpretation of the dream that he needed to ask the butler for help. Indeed, it was through the butler that he was eventually released from prison. However, because Yosef mistakenly added, "remember me," two more years were added to his imprisonment, and the butler did not remember him immediately. In contrast, someone who truly turns to the arrogant will have their desire fulfilled but will thereby sever their connection to HaShem.

Yosef interprets Pharaoh's dual dream as a single dream with one meaning, teaching that serving Hashem comes from a place of unity and spiritual depth. The dream suggests that famine days occur because the days of plenty are hidden within them. Similarly, during the week, blessings are blocked, just as during famine, blessings are concealed by physicality. The lack of blessing is not due to a shortage from Hashem; holiness is present even in the mundane, but it requires uncovering.<br>This idea is evident in Bereishis 41:56, "Yosef opened all that was within them," indicating that holiness is hidden in the mundane and accessible to those who reveal it. This concept aligns with Yosef and Shabbos; on Shabbos, the gate opens, allowing holiness to flow. Shabbos connects everything to the source, similar to Yosef, whose name means "to add." Yosef's blessings were additional to the main source, as he always remembered his sustenance's origin. Recognizing the holiness in everything helps endure hiddenness, exemplified by Yosef, who stayed connected to his source despite continual hiddenness.
When the brothers met Yosef, they did not recognize him because Yosef, even in Potiphar's house, had the ability to conceal his true identity and holiness. The Midrash explains that Yosef trusted in Hashem, yet he was punished for not relying solely on Hashem, resulting in an additional two years in prison. The seeming contradiction is resolved by understanding that Yosef did not truly place his faith in the butler but in Hashem. Yosef's request to the butler to remember him was because he believed the dream indicated that his salvation would come through the butler. However, Hashem's will was for the butler to remember him spontaneously, not through Yosef's prompting, hence the additional punishment.<br>Yosef's faith remained steadfast, as he did not truly depend on the butler. This unwavering faith was what ultimately led to his redemption, even when the butler initially forgot him. The distinction lies in that a person who sins purposefully faces dire consequences, while one who genuinely trusts in Hashem is saved, even if they err in judgment.<br>When the butler finally mentioned Yosef to Pharaoh, he demeaned him as a "Hebrew youth and slave," which was part of Hashem's plan to ensure that Yosef's redemption didn't depend on the butler's goodwill. This demonstrates Hashem's great love for Yosef, as his trust was solely in Hashem. Thus, the verse "Happy is one who trusts in Hashem and does not turn to the arrogant" aptly applies to Yosef.
The Medrash (Bereishit Rabbah 90:3) teaches that all the greatness bestowed upon Yosef as king in Egypt was a result of his own hard work and trials. "All they gave him was from himself." This means that whatever a person sacrifices of their desires to align with Hashem's will is considered their own, as they nullify and humble their will for Hashem.<br>Good deeds are performed with Hashem's help, but overcoming one's base desires and will is truly one's own achievement. As the Medrash (Bamidbar Rabba 15:14) says, one who fears Hashem deserves kingship. This refers to nullifying one's desires for Hashem, thus gaining mastery over one's desires. When a person humbles themselves properly before Hashem, all of nature and creation become subservient to them. This subservience to the person is essentially subservience to Hashem, making them worthy of kingship.

Pharaoh's dream, as recorded in the Torah, hints at a deeper lesson. All seven traits in a person, such as love and fear, can be used for good or bad. These traits aren't inherently different but can be misused. The Chidushei Harim explained that these traits serve as a parable to learn how to love Hashem more than physical things. However, one must not become absorbed in the physical parable itself.<br>The fact that the thin cows remained thin after swallowing the fat cows symbolizes that even though their internal essence was good, it wasn't apparent. Through Yosef the tzadik, who can open the closed gate and reveal the inner essence, it becomes clear that the internal aspect is primary. This is reflected in the verse, "Yosef opened all that was within them," indicating that he accessed the hidden holiness during the years of famine.<br>Similarly, on Shabbos, which represents Yosef, the internal life force is revealed. The weekdays involve physical labor, but Shabbos unveils the inner vitality of those days. In the physical realm, the mundane prepares for Shabbos, but internally, Shabbos opens and uncovers the life force already present in the six days of the week.

The Medrash (Yalkut Shimoni 147:4) states that there is an end to darkness, but as long as the yetzer hara exists, darkness prevails. The evil forces thrive when the light of holiness is hidden, much like darkness exists in the absence of light. When this hiddenness is removed from Heaven, the external shell (kelipah) is nullified, revealing the inner goodness. This concept is reflected in Pharaoh's dream: the years of famine came because the blessings were hidden. Even after the thin cows swallowed the fat cows, it was not apparent. The famine was only on the surface, hiding the internal blessings. Yosef revealed this hidden essence, as indicated by the verse, "Yosef opened all that was within them," referring to the hidden holiness during the years of famine.<br>Shabbos represents Yosef, revealing the inner life force of the weekdays. While the physical work of the weekdays prepares for Shabbos, Shabbos unveils the internal vitality already present in the weekdays. The Medrash explains that as long as the yetzer hara is present, darkness persists, stemming from false and empty thoughts. When people attach themselves to these empty values, they empower the darkness. However, at times like Shabbos and Chanukah, this darkness is diminished, revealing the internal life force in all worlds. On Chanukah, the mitzvah of lighting candles symbolizes bringing light to darkness, contrasting with Shabbos, which reveals hidden goodness.<br>The Gemara (Sota 21a) compares a candle to Torah, providing guidance. While a candle lights up a dark place, it doesn't provide complete direction until one recognizes the way at a crossroads. Shabbos, on the other hand, is an opening of hidden goodness, revealing the internal life force in everything, akin to the Torah, through which Hashem created the world. This light of Torah at the crossroads signifies that from the root, division begins. Once the Torah's light is revealed, darkness is entirely removed, and Hashem's oneness is manifest, as explained in the concept of "the end of two years," symbolizing the ultimate revelation of divine unity.
osef accuses his brothers of being spies, and they vehemently deny it. In reality, their descent to Egypt was a form of reconnaissance, preparing the way for their family's future exile to Mitzrayim. However, they were unaware of this purpose and still accepted Yosef's accusation, agreeing to bring Binyamin. They felt the truth in Yosef's words, which indeed turned out to be true.<br>The brothers' denial, stating they were twelve brothers, implied that such a mission required all twelve tribes to be together. They didn't realize that Yosef was already among them, and only Binyamin was missing. Therefore, Yosef commanded them to bring Binyamin, ensuring they could properly prepare the way for the generations to come.

The Medrash (Yalkut Shimoni 147:4) states there is an end to darkness, but as long as the yetzer hara exists, darkness prevails. The sin of Adam Harishon mixed good and evil in creation, creating a secondary force of evil. This is hinted at in the verse “It was at the end of two years,” where "shnatayim" (two years) represents this secondary force. In the future, this will be nullified, and Hashem will be one. The beginning of the exile in Egypt aimed to address this secondary strength, as Pharaoh's dream showed the seven lean years following the seven years of plenty, symbolizing how evil forces derive their power from holiness.<br>Pharaoh's dream and the years of famine illustrate that even in dark times, there is hidden good. The seven years of plenty were unified and connected to the source of life, while the years of famine represented disconnection and illness. The Medrash teaches that evil doesn't exist independently; it is a shadow created by man's actions. One who is attached to truth can navigate even the darkest times, as it is written, “Even if I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me.” The difference between the years of plenty and famine lies in their connection to the source of life. The seven years of plenty were unified, while the years of famine showed disconnection.<br>Yosef, who ruled over the land, symbolizes the desire for truth within every Jew. He provided for the entire nation, representing the internal fire within each person that physicality often hides. Yosef's role was to break through this outer shell and reveal the inner goodness. This teaches us that even in times of darkness, the hidden light can be accessed by those who seek it and align themselves with truth.
The Medrash (Bereishit Rabbah 90:3) explains that Yosef was rewarded for resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife. This raises a question: how can Yosef receive reward in this world for a mitzvah when rewards for mitzvot are usually reserved for the world to come? The answer lies in differentiating between positive commandments and prohibitions. Performing a mitzvah requires Hashem's help, which is why blessings are recited beforehand, acknowledging divine assistance. However, refraining from sinning, especially under temptation, is considered man's own effort.<br>The Gemara states that one who withstands a negative commandment is rewarded as if performing a positive mitzvah, and this reward can be received in this world. Usually, the reward for a mitzvah, which requires divine help, is reserved for the world to come. However, resisting sin, as Yosef did, is an effort that can be rewarded in this world. The Medrash details how each of Yosef’s limbs was rewarded, indicating the comprehensive nature of his resistance to temptation.<br>The main reason Yosef merited reward in this world is due to his unique trait of bringing blessings and abundance into the physical realm. Yosef is likened to a flame that extends its fire, symbolizing the spread of holiness even in this world. This characteristic allowed him to be blessed in this world, highlighting his ability to channel divine blessings into the material plane.
Yosef recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him, even on a spiritual level, because in Mitzrayim (Egypt), the place where holiness is restrained, everyone is hidden. As it says, "The darkness covers the light," and this was the essence of Pharaoh's dream discussed earlier.<br>The exile of Mitzrayim had already begun, meaning the holiness was concealed. Despite this, Yosef was able to recognize his brothers, while they did not recognize him. 
The Medrash (Bereishit Rabbah 90:3) states that Yosef was rewarded for resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife. It mentions that the angel Gavriel taught Yosef all seventy languages, but he only succeeded after an extra letter, ‘heh,’ was added to his name. This raises several questions: why is it important to know seventy languages? How could Pharaoh know them while Yosef did not? What significance did the added 'heh' have?<br>The Medrash explains that before Moshe’s death, he translated the Torah into seventy languages. All these languages derive from Lashon Hakodesh (the Holy Tongue), and the Torah gives life to all languages. They are different in form but carry the same essence. As the ruler of Egypt through the power of the Torah, Yosef needed to know all the languages to connect them to Lashon Hakodesh. This was a necessary preparation for the exile in Egypt, the first exile, where Yosef's control over the languages was crucial.<br>The addition of the letter ‘heh’ to Yosef’s name was significant because it represents the creation of the world, as indicated by the phrase “Behibaroam, be’heh’ bar’am.” This spiritual element empowered Yosef to connect all languages to their internal life source, Lashon Hakodesh. Thus, Yosef's ability to master the seventy languages symbolized his role in unifying and elevating the diverse elements of the world through the sanctity of the Torah.

They hurriedly pulled him out of the pit. The Zohar mentions that though Yosef descended into the pit, his redemption also stemmed from it, as indicated by the verse, "Drink water from your well."<br>Every person has a concealment, originating from negative forces due to one's evil inclination, called a pit. However, through the Torah, likened to water, one can rise from this pit. Torah provides additional strength to combat the evil inclination, representing human effort.<br>Torah descends to lowly places and is preserved, akin to water kept in a cistern. The "running water from your well" symbolizes the pure and holy source of one's soul from above, and through effort, one draws down the life force.<br>Shabbat embodies the elevated soul state, granting an "extra soul" without the need for earned merit through actions. Despite this, preparation is necessary to receive this light. During weekdays, one gains soul elevation proportional to their efforts. On Shabbat, holiness is accessed without merit, provided one is prepared.<br>Yosef represents the Shabbat element, existing in a state of elevated spirituality without physical toil, unlike his brothers who symbolize weekday efforts. When thrown into the pit, Yosef struggled because he wasn't accustomed to such work. Perhaps the brothers intended for him to understand their efforts, fostering mutual respect and love.<br>Hashem assisted Yosef in rising from the pit, and this connection is celebrated in the Midrash when the brothers prepared for Shabbat. Yosef personifies Shabbat spirit. Moreover, the term "slaughter and prepare" hints at Chanukah, linking the idea of redemption from the pit with Chanukah's victory. Thus, Shabbat and Chanukah are intertwined themes of spiritual elevation and redemption.
The Midrash (Tanchuma Tazria 5) recounts Tornes Rufus asking Rabbi Akiva whose actions are greater, man's or Hashem's. Rabbi Akiva answered man's actions, meaning that Hashem created the world in such a way that man's seemingly small actions have a significant impact. This underscores that everything created during the six days of creation requires man's effort to elevate it. While Hashem ceased His work of creation, He continues to show the righteous and the wicked the consequences of their actions. The perfection of the world is achieved through the connection between the soul and the body, and this applies to all creation, where the physical is sustained by the spiritual. This ongoing process depends on human action, as implied by "Hashem created to do"—meaning to complete. The Zohar highlights that a person's soul is their means to perfect the world. However, on Shabbos, this completion is achieved without human intervention, as "on that day He rested."
The pasuk "It was not apparent they had swallowed them” (Bereishit 41:21) is noteworthy because Paroh only mentioned this detail when recounting his dream to Yosef, not in his initial description. This omission and later inclusion are significant as they foreshadow Paroh's eventual forgetfulness of Yosef's contributions, leading to the enslavement of Bnei Yisrael. The explanation is that the years of famine, representing negative forces, derive their sustenance from holy sparks within the years of plenty. However, the wicked, like Paroh, fail to recognize this connection. This is why "it was not apparent"—the power of the negative forces is based on deception.<br>Yosef, however, nullified Paroh's trickery by stating that the "entire dream is one," indicating that even Paroh had sparks of holiness from Hashem's oneness. Yosef's interpretation that the years of plenty should prepare for the years of famine also hinted at the future exile in Mitzrayim, where preparation during good times would sustain them through hardship. Through the efforts of the forefathers and Yosef, a cure was prepared before the affliction, leading to their eventual redemption. This concept extends to all exiles, which are like dreams and illusions. Complete trust in Hashem reveals the inherent good in everything. By using our strength in Torah and prayer, we can nullify these illusions. Yosef, who provided for everyone, symbolizes the breaking of the external shell of illusion to reveal the truth, a role fulfilled by the tzadik.
Paroh said, "Do as Yosef commands you" (Bereishit 41:55), and Rashi explains that Yosef instructed the Egyptians to circumcise themselves before receiving food. This was considered a sin because it gave them the covenant of circumcision. However, Yosef, being a tzadik, could not bear to feed the uncircumcised. Despite this, it was seen as a fault because a tzadik should endure and support everyone at their level.
In the pasuk, “It must be because of the money being replaced in our bags the first time that we have been brought inside, as a pretext to attack us and seize us as slaves, with our pack animals” (Bereishit 43:18), and Yosef's reply, “All is well with you; do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have put the money in your bags for you. I received your money” (43:22), we see an important lesson. The Midrash and Zohar suggest that this scenario alludes to the fear of the ultimate day of judgment. Although the brothers were righteous and free from sin, even a tzadik, who conquers his evil inclination, fears seeing his inclination grow stronger daily. This is puzzling because one would expect that a tzadik’s strong will and dedication to Hashem would remove such desires.<br>However, Hashem's true desire is for one's service to be “back and forth” to uplift all desires to His service, thereby repairing the body. This is hinted at in the pasuk: “It is because of the money (kesef, also meaning longing or desire) that was returned to our pouches (the body).” The “money in their pouches” refers to the evil inclination crouching at the opening. Yosef’s response that “Hashem has given you treasure in your bags” signifies the hidden sparks of holiness in the body that need purification. Despite the constant return of desires, the tzadik’s good deeds ascend to Heaven. Therefore, one should not be disheartened by the strengthening of desires but should believe that their good deeds reach Heaven, fulfilling Hashem’s purpose.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 89:1) on the verse “It was at the end of two years” explains that Hashem sets a limit to the world's darkness. As long as the evil inclination exists, there is always darkness and confusion. The principle is that anything bound by time has a mixture of good and bad, like the six days of the week, which balance light with opposing forces. However, Hashem gave us Shabbos, a taste of the world to come, where negative forces have no power.<br>This mixture of good and bad influences a person, especially the "beinoni," who battles both inclinations. This creates darkness in the world. However, a tzadik who completely conquers his evil inclination is unaffected by these negative forces. Just as in the future Hashem will uproot all evil, eliminating darkness, so too a person who uproots all evil within himself experiences no darkness.<br>Hashem created the world with ten utterances, and the righteous sustain the world while the wicked destroy it. The beinoni, representing the general state of the world, experiences a mixture of control by both forces. This is why enlightenment is often followed by darkness, as symbolized by the seven fat cows being swallowed by the seven thin cows in Pharaoh's dream. However, Yosef, who was above time and sustained the entire land, was able to drive away the negative forces. This is the meaning of "the end of two years," as Yosef clarified that Pharaoh's dream was one, nullifying the duality of good and evil. For the beinoni, the solution lies in transforming the evil inclination through humility, as expressed in the verse “I will thank Hashem with all my heart,” meaning with both inclinations. The Chanukah candle on the left symbolizes subduing the evil forces.
The pasuk (Yechezkel 46:1) states, “The gate of the inner courtyard will be closed during the six days of the week, and opened on Rosh Chodesh and Shabbos.” Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh correspond to Yosef and Yehuda, respectively. Yosef represents Shabbos, while Yehuda represents Rosh Chodesh, which is awakened through nullification and praise. Through hallel and praising Hashem, both concepts are activated.<br>Tehillim 100:4 says, “Enter His gates with thanks, His courtyards with praise.” Gratitude opens the gate, and praise allows one to dwell in Hashem’s courtyard. Gates and courtyards represent ascending levels of closeness to Hashem. Tehillim 65:5 states, “Praiseworthy is the one You choose and bring near; he dwells in Your courtyards,” highlighting the different ways one can approach Hashem.<br>Tehillim 149:6 mentions, “The praise of Hashem is in their throats, a double-edged sword in their hands.” These double edges symbolize two types of praise: hallel (praise) and hoda'ah (gratitude). The double edges also represent the openings of the heart and mouth. The covenant of the flesh and the covenant of the tongue are also called double-edged, relating to Yosef and Yehuda. The gematria of הלל והודאה (hallel and hoda'ah) is 85, the same as פה (mouth), hinting at the secret of milah (circumcision). All praise should come from the heart and be expressed through the mouth.
The Midrash criticizes Yosef for trusting the butler while praising those who trust in Hashem, as in “Praiseworthy is one who places his trust in Hashem.” Those who trust in Hashem must be extra cautious not to "turn to the arrogant," as evil forces target the righteous more.<br>Yosef didn't truly trust the butler; the criticism was for even slightly turning to him. Such caution is expected from a tzadik like Yosef, who should avoid relying on others altogether.
“And Hashem shall give you mercy,” Rashi explains that Yaakov was saying to his children, “The One who said to His world ‘enough’ shall say ‘enough’ to my suffering” (Bereishis 43:14).<br>This needs further explanation: why did Hashem need to say “enough” to the world? The worlds are an expansion of Hashem’s expression. As these expansions descended, our lowly world was created, where there is apparent opposition to holiness. Hashem said “enough” to stop this process, as the world was created for tzadikim to transform bitterness to sweetness and clarify truth within falsehood. However, humans cannot repair everything alone, so Hashem combined the attribute of mercy with judgment.<br>Similarly, in the mission of the righteous, Yaakov repaired all these levels. When he reached the final stage, he needed to request mercy, just as the final stage of creation involved mercy. This is the idea of praying for the “time of need,” as the final reparation requires mercy and Hashem’s help. Yaakov felt he could no longer act alone and turned to prayer. This explains the meaning of “The One who said ‘enough’ to His world.”
In the name of the Chidushei Harim, the kingdom of Greece is represented by the thighs made of bronze (נחש, snake) in Nevuchadnezzar’s dream. Their intention was to prevent Bnei Yisrael from giving praise and thanks to Hashem by bowing down. Our sages taught that one who does not bow during “Modim” has a spine that turns into a snake (Bava Kama 16a). Therefore, during Chanukah, our sages instituted the practice of giving praise.<br>This idea contrasts with Yosef, who was called אברך (elderly in wisdom and young in years). He was known for his wisdom and youthfulness not just in his youth but throughout his life. As our sages explained (Taanis 20a), one should always strive to be soft as a reed. Even with wisdom and age, one must maintain the quality of nullification and bowing down to Hashem.<br>The spine holds a person upright and enables bowing, being the main life force. This is the essence of the name אברך, for Yosef was the source of life force. His constant renewal allowed him to be soft as a reed, bringing blessing upon him. Hence, he was called אברך, symbolizing his role as a source of life and blessing.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 89:1) explains "At the end of two years" as indicating that everything, including evil, has a time limit. Once its time is up, darkness ends. The word וייצר (formed) in the creation of man, written in plural, signifies the creation of both the good and evil inclinations. However, in the source of creation, everything is unified. By reconnecting to this source, both inclinations become unified. The term וייצר relates to צורה (form), implying that the evil inclination is merely an illusion, a falsehood. This is why it is called צלמות (shadow of death), as it has no real substance.<br>In Pharaoh's dream, the healthy cows grazing in the marshland symbolize peace during times of plenty. The Midrash explains that unity and connection awaken the source of creation, where dualities do not exist. The unhealthy cows are merely coverings that hide the good, as stated, "He created one against the other" (Koheles 7:14). Yosef clarified that Pharaoh's dream was essentially one, showing that the good and bad are not independent forces but part of Hashem's design. This is reflected in "At the end of two years," signifying the end of secondary negative forces.<br>The principle "The only vessel that contains blessing is peace" indicates that the existence of good depends on unity. This is symbolized by the cows grazing in the marshland. Similarly, Shabbos represents the unification of all things, allowing blessings to rest. Through the unity and connection, the source of creation is awakened, revealing that everything is ultimately one and allowing the blessing to manifest.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 89:1) states, “He placed an end to the darkness; as soon as its time was up, the evil was removed.” Initially, it might seem that darkness is merely the absence of light, making it incorrect to say “He creates darkness.” However, Hashem’s light shines everywhere, and darkness acts as a cover over this light. When the world is not worthy, Hashem created a “place” for His light to be hidden.<br>Darkness is considered to be in a high place, which is why the Torah uses יצירה (formation) for light and בריאה (creation) for darkness. As long as the evil inclination exists, Hashem's light cannot be fully revealed. Similarly, during the exile under the four kingdoms, Hashem’s dominion remains hidden, even though “Your dominion is the kingdom of the world.”<br>Pharaoh’s dream served as a prelude to the exile in Egypt. Yosef revealed that the source of unity spreads everywhere, explaining that “the dream of Pharaoh is one.” The famine merely covered and swallowed the years of plenty. Thus, it says, “Yosef opened all that was in them.” There is an internal point of good in every place, called כל, which Yosef unlocked. On Shabbos, this internal goodness is revealed through unification with the secret of oneness. The famine covering the land symbolizes the concealment of this internal goodness.
The Psikta (Rabti 8) on the verse “I shall search out Yerushalayim with candles” (Tzefania 1:12) suggests that the word אחפש (searching) can also imply freedom (חפשי). Hashem, who "spread over you a spirit of sleep and shut your eyes" (Yeshaya 29:10), will set us free, similar to how a slave is freed if his master blinds his eye.<br>The concept of Hashem searching with candles needs explanation, as "the darkness does not darken" for Him, and "the night shines like the day." However, the candles symbolize the neshama (soul), as it states, “The candle of Hashem is the neshama of man.” Hashem sent the souls of Bnei Yisrael to illuminate the darkness of this world. The Midrash Rabbah (Beha'alotecha 16:7) explains that the light is not for Hashem’s benefit but to elevate Bnei Yisrael.<br>The purpose of darkness is for Bnei Yisrael to awaken the hidden light. Hashem placed darkness in the world for Bnei Yisrael, and through their illumination, He will set us free with the candles. This is the idea in short.
In Bereishis 42:9, Yosef accused his brothers of being spies who came to reveal the nakedness of the land. The idea is that Yosef revealed to them that their journey to Egypt was meant to prepare the place for the future exile. <br>For this reason, Yosef wanted them to bring Binyamin down to Egypt. Although they were all together with Yaakov, the forefathers were on a higher level, above nature. It was the twelve tribes who were unique in their ability to function within the lower realms where Bnei Yisrael would operate.<br>Commentators explained that Yosef's words “And slaughter an animal and prepare it” hint at Chanukah. During Chanukah, the primary focus is on the twelve tribes. Therefore, the Torah reading includes the inauguration of the Mishkan and the offerings brought by the leaders of the tribes, as in the reading of זאת חנוכת המזבח. This connection has been explained at length earlier.
"And the brothers drank wine with him (Yosef)." Our sages explained that since the brothers had sold Yosef, they had not drunk any wine until now. Why did they drink now? It seems they felt they had achieved some form of reparation while seated before Yosef (unaware it was him), as indicated by their astonishment in Bereishis 43:33.<br>The forefathers represent reparation without sin, whereas the tribes' reparation comes after sin. This is paralleled in the inauguration gifts of the princes, which served as reparation after their laxity in bringing gifts to the Mishkan. Our sages taught that drinking wine often has a notable effect (Bereishis Rabbah 43:6), yet here, there is no negative outcome recorded. The reason is that their drinking was unintentional and not with a complete heart, as they were compelled to drink.<br>Commentators have hinted that "slaughter an animal and prepare it" (טבח והכן) refers to Chanukah. Similarly, "they became drunk with him" hints at Purim. Chanukah and Purim are the last of the open miracles, nearing the final reparation, which will be completed with the coming of the redeemer. The inner meaning of these words is understood through the commandment to become intoxicated on Purim until one cannot distinguish between "blessed is Mordechai" and "cursed is Haman," indicating a state beyond rational understanding.

(First Night) My master, my elder, my teacher, may the memory of the tzadik be for the world to come, said the reason why we bless "that made miracles" when we see the light of Chanukah. This is because the clarification of the miracles happens through the lights. And in truth it is written "these lights are holy". And it seems that after that there was the lightning of the menorah in those days through a miracle, even if there was no oil for the children of Israel to kindle. And now, even though at this moment when we do not have the menorah and the pure oil, it is still relevant to kindle because of the miracle, since this miracle remains for the generations. Yet the vessel for this kindling is the mitzvah of kindling the candle of Hanukkah as it is written "the candle is a mitzvah and Torah is light" (Prov. 6:23), meaning, the candle is the vessel to receive oil and wick and light. So too, the [positive] mitzvot corresponding to the 248 members of the body, plus awe plus love sum up 250, as candle (ner) does, as it is written in the Tikkunim. And it is important that the mitzvot are in action, and the light of the Torah hangs on them, and the mitzvot are written in the Torah and through them the deeds are also fixed. And this is also the fixing of the members of the body of a person. And the Torah brings awareness and wisdom to a person. And also the language "light of Chanukah", that was fixed by our sages z"l, in the blessing of the mitzvah, also, is explained as above, since they did not write "to kindle a light on Chanukah." There is the light of Chanukah. And through the fulfillment of the mitzvah we kindle this known light. And truly, the Tabernacle was hidden, and the menorah was hidden, and after that in those days there was the kindling - and then, through a miracle, even today the light shines. And regarding this my teacher, my master, my father, my elder, may the memory of the tzadik be for the world to come, said that since the western light shines due to a miracle, it also shines in the darkness, where it is hidden, as explained. And our sages fixed this, that we are to arouse and kindle that light through the mitzvah of the light of Chanukah, since through this mitzvah the revelation of the miracle comes about. [And see that the language used in the Tur is "to remind" and not "to remember", see there on paragraph 679 (Tur, Orach Chaim 682:1)]. And all those issues, the Tabernacle and the Menorah, they are found as a hint inside every person in Israel, in that there is in every person in Israel a piece in the Torah [and the revelation of the Menorah, that is hidden, also happens to a person, and in the days of the festival it can also be revealed, through the aspect of character traits].
In the book Kedushat Levi the explanation for " at this time" is that it is really now, that there is in every year a revelation of the miracles that were then, see there. However, in any instance, to feel the revelation of a  miracle one needs to be separated from nature. And according to the level that one is not stuck in nature and physicality, is the ability to feel, since a miracle is above nature. And yet, in any instance, through the mitzvah of kindling the light of Chanukah a person clings onto what is above nature, since the essence of the mitzvah is to cling and connect with what is above nature. Even when a person is doing things, dealing with daily actions and preoccupations, one can still be connected through the light of the mitzvah since they are in the aspect of doing in the physical, as explained. And my master, my elder, my teacher, may the memory of the tzadik be for the world to come, said that we determine holy days through Hallel and Thanks, since they fixed that a person reveals the days through Hallel and Thanks so that the days will open and illuminate for the person. And so he explained "a memory God made for God's wonders" (Ps. 111:4) - that a person should be reminded of the revelation of miracles and wonders in every years on those days, these are his words, may his memory be for a blessing....
(Second night) It is written "the candle of Ad-nai is the soul of a person, searching all one's inner parts" (Prov. 20:27). And in the Gemarah: "a search from candles. One candle from one candle" "I will search Yerushalayim with candles" (Pesachim 7b and Zeph. 1:12) see there. The issue is that the Tabernacle and the Temple are found inside every person in Israel, just as the verse "and I will dwell in them" (Ex. 25:8). And according to what a person clarifies for themselves, that all aliveness of the soul, about which we say every day "the soul You gave me is pure" - that is, that there is one pure point inside every person of Israel, just that this point is truly hidden and concealed. And in the time that the Temple was standing, it was revealed that all aliveness comes from the Holy One of Blessing. And this is the issue of the inspiration of the Shechinah, which is a proof that the Holy One of Blessing soaks Israel completely. And now, that the Tabernacle is hidden, in any instance a person can find this through searching with the candles, as explained. And the explanation is that the candles are the mitzvot, as explained above, and when we search with all our heart and soul [exert ourselves] to do a mitzvah with all aliveness, since the candle [ner] is soul, spirit and also the 248 parts of the body with which we do a mitzvah with awe and love, since the gematria of candle [ner] is as above, then this preparation and strength enables a person to find through the aspect of Tabernacle, and to arrive to that hidden point we spoke about before. And all the more so in those days, in which miracles were made that lights were kindled through a miracle, even though the aspect of candles was then missing from the Children of Israel. And also now, there is an immediate help through the mitzvah of the Hanukkah light to find, through the aspect of hidden [light], since the essence of hiddenness is darkness, in which we need candles to search and find, as explained. And the book Kedushat Levi explaines that Hanukkah is in the aspect of Koh, since Moshe received his prophetic powers through this word, and it is the most clarified inspiration. And the prophets in "Koh", even though it is concealed, it is a lens that is not seen. And in Hannukah there is a revelation also of the aspect Koh, which is set also in the dark and hidden place, as explained. And in any instance, since it is written "I will search ... with candles" it is explained that one can find, even today, the aspect of the Temple and Yerushalayim through searching. And so it is written "from 'no one seeks her' can be inferred that it requires seeking" (Sukkah 41a quoting Jeremiah 30:17). And this happens through the strength that a person has when they do mitzvot with all their aliveness, they will awaken the inner aliveness that is the pure point, and about which is said "searching all inner parts", that one is able to find with the force of innerness the Hidden Light that is in all inner parts, as explained. [And this is the issue of "one should consider oneself as having a holy object in one's innards" (Taanit 11b). And when a person fixes themselves like this, the verse about them is "and they will make Me a sanctuary and I will dwell in them" (Exodus 25:8). In them, really, as explained.]
(Third night of Chanukah) The halacha states that Chanukah candles are placed on the left of the door, with the mezuzah on the right, surrounding you with mitzvot. This aligns with the pasuk (Mishlei 3:16), "Length of days are in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor." The left side, representing this world, is secondary to the right, which symbolizes the world to come and holiness. The purpose of this world is to subjugate its material aspects and prepare for the spiritual world to come.<br>The mezuzah is on the right, as all mitzvot are primary and thus placed on the right. However, Chanukah candles are placed on the left to bring light into darkness and subdue hiddenness, turning the left into right. Rashi explains that when Hashem takes revenge on the wicked, His left becomes right, signifying that by subduing the left, it transforms into right, enhancing respect. Therefore, lighting the Chanukah candles on the left symbolizes turning darkness into light.<br>The mezuzah promises "length of days," aligning with "length of days are in her right hand." Chanukah candles, associated with "riches and honor," symbolize subduing the left. Riches, as explained by the Maharal, refer to what one earns beyond needs. The life Hashem gives is equal for all, but "riches and honor" are earned through good deeds, subduing hiddenness, and clinging to Hashem. This mission, subduing the left, is given to us in this world, making it a vessel for divine light. During Chanukah, overcoming adversaries transforms the left into right, symbolizing "riches and honor."
To better understand the idea of Hallel and Hoda’a (praise and gratitude), the Chidushei Harim explains concisely that they parallel Yehuda (Hoda’a) and Yosef (Hallel), adding that Hallel is a more revealed and clear light. Hoda’a is giving thanks for something that initially seemed negative but is later realized to be for the best. This is evident from the fact that vidui (confession of sins) is also called Hoda’a. The pasuk (Tehillim 111:1) states, “I thank You Hashem with all my heart - לבב,” using the plural form to refer to both the positive and negative inclinations. Hoda’a comes when one is grateful for overcoming temptations and tests, realizing and appreciating what was difficult at the time.<br>Hallel, on the other hand, is for those who are separated from worldly temptations and praise Hashem when they see His power and wonders. These two elements parallel Yehuda and Yosef. The idea of Hoda’a, giving thanks for something that initially seemed not to be kindness but is later recognized as good, is seen in the gemara (Eiruvin 12b), “They agree - מודים (connected to the word הודאה) (on this), implies that they argue (on something else).”<br>The miracle of Chanukah incorporates both elements. There are open miracles of defeating the Greeks and the oil, expressed in Hallel. Yet, there is also the element of the exile during the Kingdom of Yavan. Once they defeated this power, they realized it was part of the greater plan to defeat all kingdoms, demonstrating that the true Kingdom is Hashem’s. These are the two elements of Hallel and Hoda’a.
(Fourth night of Chanukah) The Chidushei Harim explained that "they contaminated all the oils" in the sanctuary refers to the thoughts in one's mind. When they "pierced the walls and contaminated," it meant disrupting the protective "walls" of emuna (faith) that keep Hashem's words clear and firm. The Greeks aimed to "remove Bnei Yisrael from the laws of Your will," eroding our emuna and promoting human will over divine wisdom.<br>The Maharal explains that the Greeks opposed true chochma (wisdom), which involves self-nullification to Hashem's wisdom, as indicated by the pasuk (Iyov 28:12), "From where (מאין) can chochma be found?" The Greeks' wisdom rejected higher understanding, leading to a deterioration in emuna and true chochma. Defeating the Greeks restored our emuna, symbolized by the word Chanukah (חנוכה) and the letters כה, which imply following Hashem with emuna even without intellectual understanding.<br>The Psikta (Psikta Rabti 3) calls the mitzvah of Chanukah "the mitzvah of our sages," emphasizing emuna in their words and the Oral Torah, which connects us to the divine above nature. This is why we cannot use the Chanukah candles for personal benefit—they are holy. The word Chanukah also relates to חנוך (education), as in (Mishlei 22:6), "educate the youth in his way," meaning emuna in the sages' teachings, even when beyond our understanding, as stated in (Devarim 32:7), "Ask your father and he will teach you."
Zot [THIS IS] Chanukah. It’s not clear what is meant by “Zot (THIS].”  I heard from my teacher (acronym not known by translator) that the meaning in the Midrash is that following the word Zot, comes Aaron [the High Priest] like in the words “with THIS I have faith.”  The Kingdom of Heaven is called Zot which is everything.  The point that gives everything life is called Zot which is the life-force in all things. On Chanukah we clarify this point that all comes from the blessed Hashem.  It’s written that “Aaron did (כן) thus” and Rashi explains this means that Aaron did not sleep.  The meaning of כן is like Zot.  
(Eighth night of Chanukah) The term "זאת חנוכה" (Zos Chanukah) refers to the eighth and final day of Chanukah and is derived from the Torah reading of that day. The word "זאת" (this) requires explanation, as it is not immediately clear. The Chidushei Harim explained that "זאת" signifies the kingdom of Heaven, which encompasses everything. This concept is seen in the Midrash on the verse “בזאת יבוא אהרן” (Vayikra 16:3) and “בזאת אני בוטח” (Tehilim 27:3), indicating that "זאת" represents the life force in everything, and on Chanukah, we clarify that everything is from Hashem.<br>The Torah states, “ויעש כן אהרן” (Bamidbar 8:3), and Aharon did so, meaning he did not deviate from Hashem's command. This idea of "כן" (so) is similar to "זאת," signifying adherence to divine will without change. This is also hinted at in the words of Yosef’s brothers, “כנים אנחנו, לא היינו מרגלים” (Bereishit 42:11), meaning they were truthful and not spies (מרגלים, related to רגילות, routine). The idea is to find renewal by being connected to the internal point, which aligns with Hashem's will.<br>We pray, “שמרה זאת ליצר מחשבות לבב עמך” (Divrei Hayamim I 29:18), asking Hashem to guard this intention in our hearts. Hashem protects this point within Bnei Yisrael, giving us strength even in exile, knowing that hiddenness is from Hashem and for our good. This concept is also expressed in “זאת אשיב אל לבי על כן אוחיל” (Eicha 3:21), meaning recognizing that everything, even hiddenness, is from Hashem, leads to hope. This is the essence of Chanukah, reinforcing our trust in Hashem during times of darkness, knowing it is ultimately for our benefit.<br>The Chidushei Harim noted that the final letters of “נכון לבו בטוח בה' סמוך” spell “חנוכה,” indicating that Chanukah strengthens Bnei Yisrael's trust in Hashem during exile. Similarly, the phrase “כי דליתני” (Tehilim 30:2) in the chapter of Chanukah means both lifting up and being in a low state, highlighting that even in lowliness, Hashem elevates us. The end of the chapter, “הפכת מספדי” (Tehilim 30:12), signifies that all hiddenness is merely a reversal of order, and when the external layer is removed, the internal good is revealed, bringing joy.<br>Chanukah, the days of miracles, occurred when Bnei Yisrael were at their lowest, and Hashem helped them. This teaches us that the greater the hiddenness, the greater the good that follows, as everything from Hashem is for the good. As much as we recognize and trust in this, the internal good will be revealed, affirming that all is ultimately for our benefit.

With G-d's Blessing
(First night of Chanukah) The miracle of Chanukah, symbolized by light, teaches us to find hidden light even in the darkness of exile. This explains why we say Hallel on Chanukah despite still being under Yavan's rule, while on Purim, we don't say Hallel because we remained under Achashverosh's authority.<br>The Chanukah miracle revealed that Bnei Yisrael could serve Hashem openly, even in exile's darkness. This realization—that they were still Hashem's servants despite the exile—was the miracle itself. This insight endures, connecting us to a level above nature even while in this world.<br>This understanding clarifies the phrase in Maoz Tzur: "בני בינה ימי שמונה קבעו" (children of understanding, days of eight, they established them). Instead of “eight days,” “days of eight” signifies a higher realm beyond nature (symbolized by the number 8, as opposed to the natural cycle of 7). Each day of Chanukah embodies this elevated spiritual element of “eight.”
There is an amazing idea in the miracle of Chanukah: it allowed Bnei Yisrael to fulfill the mitzvah of lighting the Menorah. The Menorah in the Beis Hamikdash was not needed for its light but to fulfill Hashem's will. When they lacked the means to light it, they were exempt from the mitzvah. Yet, Hashem performed a miracle, showing His special love by ensuring the candles were lit through us.<br>This power endures for generations. When Bnei Yisrael light the Menorah today, it symbolizes Hashem's desire for our service. This is more evident during Chanukah than at any other time of the year, manifesting in a miraculous and wondrous manner.
(Third night of Chanukah) The Gemara (Shabbos 21b) explains that our sages instituted these days for Hallel and Hoda’a—praise and gratitude. By recognizing their salvation and expressing heartfelt thanks, Bnei Yisrael drew the miracle's light into the world for generations. This principle applies individually as well; when one experiences salvation and acknowledges Hashem's kindness, the depth of gratitude determines how long the impact lasts.<br>This perspective clarifies the Rama: singing songs of praise during Chanukah meals makes them Seudas Mitzvah. The Magen Avraham extends this to any meal, arguing that praise transforms it into a Seudas Mitzvah. However, some debate this, noting that Chanukah's days were specifically established for Hallel and Hoda’a. Thus, expressing thanks and praise to Hashem during these days awakens their hidden light, turning them into days of celebration (Yom Tov) and making the meals Seudas Mitzvah.
(The fourth night of Chanukah) The Chidushei Harim explains that "These days were established as days of Hallel and Hoda’a" to teach us that during these days, every Jew can recognize that everything comes from Hashem. This is the essence of Hoda’a (gratitude), and it defines the identity of every Jew—יהודי, linked to the word "gratitude." Bnei Yisrael are called מעט (few) because we humble ourselves, acknowledging that all our achievements are from Hashem.<br>Hallel and Hoda’a serve different purposes: Hallel is praise for the good Hashem does, while Hoda’a is gratitude even when things don't go as desired. Both must coexist: even with much to be grateful for, one should not become haughty but should recognize that everything is from Hashem.
(Fifth night of Chanukah) The Chidushei Harim explained that the mitzvah of Chanukah candles, lit until "תכלה רגל מן השוק" (when the last feet leave the marketplace), symbolizes ending routine (רגילות) and infusing actions with renewed excitement. Additionally, "תכלה" connects to "כלתה נפשי" (my soul expires), representing the nullification of personal desires and unification with Hashem. The pasuk (Mishlei 20:27) says, "the candle of Hashem is the soul of man," highlighting our mission to bring Hashem's light to creation.<br>During the Beis Hamikdash period, the menorah symbolized this life force. The Gemara explains the menorah's light wasn't for illumination but to draw Hashem's light into the world. Creation must be nullified to Bnei Yisrael, and Bnei Yisrael to Hashem, realizing we are vessels like candles containing light. In the Zohar, נר (candle) equates to 248, representing mitzvot combined with fear and love (דחילו ורחימו). When Bnei Yisrael have this clarity, the nations and nature become nullified to them, as it states, "The wicked will prepare, and the tzadik will wear" (Iyov 27:17). This understanding makes the world a vessel for Hashem's blessing.<br>Chanukah's menorah miracle revealed that creation exists to connect to Hashem, as the Gemara states: it testifies that Hashem dwells in Bnei Yisrael. This shows everything as a vessel leading to Hashem. When aligned correctly, we draw newness from the source, as Hashem renews creation daily. This connection, experienced on Chanukah, continues when we light the Chanukah candles, elevating everything to the source, as indicated by the term "Beha’alotecha" (when you elevate).
(Sixth night of Chanukah) "We are not permitted to use them, only to see them." It is a mitzvah to see the Chanukah lights, indicating that they illuminate each Jewish soul, allowing self-reflection, as stated, "Reflect on three things..." The miracle of the candles was to enlighten those whose eyes were dimmed. The Gemara states that the light of a candle is good for searching, as it "searches all the inner chambers" (Pesachim 8a), symbolizing the divine spark within each soul seeking to illuminate hidden parts of a person.<br>The Midrash (Pesikta) explains "search" as freedom, suggesting that the divine spark, called "the candle of Hashem," dispels darkness. Even if one is enslaved by the evil inclination and cannot perceive the truth, the mitzvah candles can help reveal it. The Gemara states that the Chanukah candle is placed on the left, while the mezuzah is on the right. The mezuzah represents attachment to the divine source, while the Chanukah candle illuminates even those in darkness, helping them recognize their low state and return to their rightful place. This reflects the state of Bnei Yisrael during the miracle, as Hashem avenged them, showing their worthiness even in their perceived lowliness.
(Seventh night of Chanukah) The Kedushas Levi explains that the miracle of Chanukah is reawakened even now. This is because the miracle transcends time and nature. Time is within nature, where the inner divine life force is concealed. When this inner life force is revealed, it is called "this time." Hence, the miracle occurred within time, and the sages recognized that this miracle left a lasting illumination within time, referred to as "this time."<br>The phrase "in those days" signifies miracles beyond comprehension, described as "those" in a hidden sense. However, these miracles manifest "in this time," as mentioned. The placement of the Chanukah candle on the left also signifies its power to illuminate even the left side, transforming it into the right, as our sages stated, "Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power," meaning even the left becomes right when fulfilling Hashem's will.<br>Additionally, the holy books explain that the days of Chanukah provide illumination for the challenging days of Tevet. The month of Tevet, written without a vav, symbolizes something that requires improvement. Rashi comments that Tevet is lacking when not improved, indicating that it becomes good through our actions.
(Eighth night of Chanukah) "Zos Chanukah" implies that the essence of Chanukah culminates on the eighth day, highlighting the miracle's eight-day duration. The Chidushei Harim explained that despite the impurity of all the oils, one pure jug remained, symbolizing the hidden spark within every Jew that Hashem protects.<br>This inner life force, representing the aspect of the "eighth" (beyond nature), is the soul within each Jew. The purpose of creation is for this inner spark to permeate all our actions and transform everything into inner holiness. While this spark remains intact, the miracle was its expansion into all seven attributes, making the miracle of the first day significant as it initiated this process.<br>The phrase "Zos Chanukah" signifies that the hidden spark, beyond comprehension, extended to the most accessible level, becoming visible and tangible to us. This represents the complete integration from the highest, incomprehensible realms to the visible, tangible world, embodying the full miracle of Chanukah.

Section 3




(Second night) In the sefer Kedushat Levi it is explained that "at this time" means that the miracle renews itself in every year, see there. And this means that the miracle that is fixed in time fixes a clarification of holiness through the time, for the generations, even though every miracle happens beyond [the concept of] time, since in any instance the root of time and nature is connected to Above. And a person needs to believe that there is no change, and this is what we say "in those days in at this time", since every one unit of time is just a moment hidden in nature, and then it goes up to its root, as explained. And in truth, a miracle that is left connected in time and nature is a greater marvel, and maybe it was because of that that one cruse of oil was left over, even if it would be possible to have light through a miracle without oil, but this would mean that there was no pertinence of this miracle in nature, and for it remain forever [this is necessary]. And through the lights we can find the Hidden Light in these days, and this is the point of the mitzvot, to illuminate, to find through them the Hidden Light in this world. And the mitzvot of the lights of Chanukah, that are specific for these days, since the search is with the candles, as explained. And so my teacher, my elder, PBUH, said, regarding "a memory God made for God's wonders" (Ps. 111:4) that due to the mitzvot a memory was made, to arouse the wonders that happened on those days, as explained. ...
"Made in truth and equity" (Ps. 111:8). It seems that we can understand that this verse applies to a person who does a mitzvah that can only be done in truth. Meaning, a person who is truth and equitable in those character traits are made [by them] and this is why the expression "made" is better.

Section 4












The mitzvah of lighting the Chanukah candles, known as נר איש וביתו, is performed by the head of the household with his family (Shabbos 21b). Unlike Shabbos candles, which promote peace and are fulfilled by simply having them lit, the Chanukah candles' mitzvah is in the act of lighting itself. If a deaf, senile person, or child lights them, the obligation is not fulfilled. This raises the question: why shouldn't each individual light their own candle?<br>The answer lies in the collective strength of the family. By gathering all household members, one can perform the mitzvah with greater perfection. The Chanukah candles are lit outside, symbolizing the need to bring light into the darkest places through one's actions. Hashem created humans to bring the light of Torah into physical actions. Thus, a person should not isolate themselves but strive to elevate everything to Hashem. Bnei Yisrael are praised for accepting exile willingly, as it allowed them to bring light into darkness and fulfill Hashem's will.<br>In the exile to Mitzrayim, Yaakov and his children came איש וביתו, each man and his household, preparing themselves with self-sacrifice to fulfill Hashem's will. Similarly, the Chanukah candles are lit outside, symbolizing this collective effort. The Mehadrin (Shabbos 21a) practice of lighting a candle for each family member represents an even higher level, addressing and elevating each detail connected to them. If only we could merit to achieve this general level of repair.

Section 5

With G-d's Blessing
(First night of Chanukah) On Shabbos and Yom Tov, Bnei Yisrael experience rest, a merit they achieved when in their rightful place. However, the miracles of Chanukah and Purim are festivals that Bnei Yisrael merited during exile, lacking the clear rest and completion of Shabbos and Yom Tov. This is the difference between the words זה and כה. Moshe's prophecy used זה, indicating absolute clarity (אספקלריה המאירה), while other prophets used כה, lacking that clarity.<br>Chanukah is named to signify that they felt a semblance of Shabbos peace, but not with full clarity (אספקלריה שאינה מאירה). The word חנוכה combines חנו (they rested) and כה (without clarity). This serves as a true testimony to Bnei Yisrael, showing that even in exile, they were never disconnected from their original place, and Hashem strengthens them even in exile.<br>This also explains why our Sages compared the days of Chanukah to the sacrifices on Sukkos (Shabbos 21b). The Midrash (Naso, Pinchas Bamidbar Rabbah 21) teaches that by bringing the Sukkot offerings corresponding to the 70 nations with a full heart, Bnei Yisrael merited additional festivals. Through their wholehearted korbanot for the nations, desiring to elevate them and prioritizing Hashem's honor over their own, they merited more festivals even under foreign rule, such as Chanukah and Purim.
The mitzvah of lighting the Chanukah candles is to place them at the entrance of one’s house, outside (Shabbos 21b). The Chidushei Harim explained this based on the Gemara, which states that the “outer keys” refer to fear of Heaven (Shabbos 31b). The light of the Chanukah candles aims to bring us closer to fear of Hashem.<br>When lighting the candles, one should intend to draw their heart towards fear of Hashem. All mitzvot guide and help a person to serve Hashem, effective only to the extent that the person desires it. The door's entrance symbolizes the inner point of one’s heart, before it is divided into many thoughts and actions. This inner point is located at the entrance, and the Chanukah candles help guard the doors of one’s heart.<br>If a person lives on an elevated floor, they should place the Chanukah candles at the window facing the public domain (Shabbos 21b). This refers to the tzadik who lives on an elevated spiritual level and does not have any thoughts that are not focused on Hashem. Such a person should light the candles by the window facing the public domain to extend the light even to the public domain through the windows and openings, symbolizing the spreading of divine illumination to the broader world.
(4th Night of Chanukah) One who is accustomed to kindle lights will merit to have children who are Torah scholars (Shabbos 23b). This is as the pasuk (Mishlei 6:3) states: "Mitzvah is a candle and Torah is light." The Chidushei Harim explained that this means bringing light into routine actions. Mitzvot should not be performed by rote but with thoughtful intention, as wisdom and intellect do not age or become routine. This is why the term זקן (elder) is associated with one who has acquired wisdom, as wisdom remains constant even as the body ages.<br>The Midrash in Bechukotai (Vayikra Rabbah 35:1) on the pasuk (Tehillim 119:59) states, “I considered my ways, and turned my feet to Your decrees,” meaning that David constantly considered how to serve Hashem and thus overcame routine actions. This idea is encapsulated in “One who is accustomed to lighting,” referring to someone who continually uses their mind to perform mitzvot thoughtfully, ensuring their actions are guided by wisdom and intellect. Therefore, such a person will merit children who are Torah scholars, aligning with the teaching of our sages (Bereishis Rabbah 30:6) that the primary descendants of tzadikim are their mitzvot and good deeds.
The Maharal (Ner Mitzvah p12) explains that the Greeks aimed to lead Bnei Yisrael away from their faith using "outer wisdoms" (חכמה חיצונית), non-Torah-based wisdom. The word יון (Greek) is connected to אונאה (trickery), as the Greeks intended to deceive Bnei Yisrael. Intellectuals can blur the lines between truth and falsehood, but every Jew has an inherent point of connection to Hashem, known as da’as, which helps them recognize the truth.<br>The Chanukah miracle involved oil, symbolizing this truth. Oil is unique in that it is fully drawn out by the wick, while water remains separate. Similarly, Bnei Yisrael are compared to oil, as stated in the Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 36:1) on the pasuk (Yirmiya 11:16) “A fresh olive.” Bnei Yisrael do not mix with the nations. The Chanukah salvation clarified the da’as within every Jew, drawing them to the truth and highlighting the superiority of da’as over chochma. Da’as is an inner understanding from a lofty place, while chochma is intellectual and can be subject to falsehood. This concept will be further explained with the help of Heaven.
The miracle of Chanukah, centered around the menorah, indicates that the Greeks' primary aim was to defile the oil. They sought to distance Bnei Yisrael from Hashem through wisdom, knowing that the written Torah was already translated into Greek (Megillah 9b). The Midrash (Tanchuma Vayera 6) explains that Moshe requested the Oral Torah be explicit, but Hashem responded that it would be regarded as foreign. The Oral Torah, understood through the sages' comprehension of Hashem's will, testifies that the Torah belongs solely to Bnei Yisrael.<br>The menorah's candles, which have no logical reason (as they are not needed for light), symbolize a chok, a statute beyond reason. Only Bnei Yisrael, through their emunah in Hashem and His chukim, believe they can illuminate before Him, even without understanding how or why. Unlike the offerings in the Beis Hamikdash, which served for atonement, the menorah testified that Hashem’s presence rests among Bnei Yisrael, independent of their actions. The Ner Ma’aravi, which miraculously remained lit, demonstrated Bnei Yisrael's integral connection to Hashem.<br>Any mitzvah whose reasoning is less known to man reaches higher spiritual realms. The mitzvah of the menorah, understood by Bnei Yisrael as not dependent on their actions, was beyond the control of foreign powers. The pure jug of oil found was stamped with the Kohen Gadol's seal, symbolizing a divine kindness. This elevated nature of the menorah, untouchable by foreign influence, strengthened Bnei Yisrael during the Greek exile and facilitated the Chanukah miracle, highlighting their closeness to Hashem without the need for reason.
(Sixth night of Chanukah) The Ran explains that one opinion forbids using the Chanukah candles for counting money because they are a commemoration of the Menorah in the Beis Hamikdash, which was not used for light. This implies that by commemorating the Menorah, the sanctity of the original Menorah also applies to the Chanukah candles. Therefore, lighting the Chanukah candles awakens the energy of the Menorah.<br>The Ramban (Bamidbar 8:1) explains that Hashem promised Aharon that his service of lighting the Menorah would last forever, as the lights of the Menorah are awakened when we light the Chanukah candles. Aharon merited that the light of the Menorah remains, allowing Bnei Yisrael to access this light during auspicious times like Chanukah. Similarly, every day contains unique mitzvot through which we can attain the light of the Menorah.<br>The pasuk (Tehillim 111:8) states, “Well founded, for all eternity,” teaching us that all mitzvot, even those from the time of the Beis Hamikdash, remain eternal because they are done with truth and honesty. The light of the mitzvot exists in a very high place since they are performed with truth. Therefore, when a person acts correctly and seeks truth, the light of these mitzvot becomes accessible to them.
Hallel and Hoda’a (praise and gratitude). It seems that Hallel was instituted for the miracle of the candles, as this miracle is not mentioned in Hoda’a. Hoda’a pertains to situations that could not have been sustained without divine intervention, prompting thanks to Hashem for His help, similar to the four who must give thanks. Therefore, Hoda’a was instituted for the rescue, while Hallel was for the miracle of the candles, which was an additional expression of love and joy, appropriate for Hallel. This will be further explained with Hashem’s help.
(Seventh night of Chanukah) Hallel and Hoda’a represent joy and humility. The Chidushei Harim explained that they correspond to Yosef and Yehuda. Both are essential for every Jew, as the joy of a mitzvah cannot be sustained without preceding fear and humility, ensuring it lasts. Our sages taught that these elements are interconnected. Recognizing one's place enhances the joy of fulfilling Hashem's will. The sages said, "Praise Hashem's servants, not Pharaoh's servants," meaning that when freed from physical servitude, one can truly accept divine sovereignty. The primary joy should be in the ability to serve Hashem.<br>Hoda’a, or gratitude, involves humility and a broken heart, as the evil inclination only dominates through arrogance (as explained in the Zohar, Vayeshev). Thus, Hoda’a prepares one for Hallel. This idea aligns with the sages' teaching about the interplay of good and bad days during Chanukah. The light and goodness of Chanukah help expel the negative influences of the evil inclination. The Midrash explains that Torah learning requires displacement of trivial matters, symbolizing the balance of Hallel and Hoda’a. Therefore, Hoda’a (gratitude) leads to humility, which in turn allows for true Hallel (praise), completing the cycle of spiritual growth and joy during Chanukah.
(Seventh night of Chanukah, Rosh Chodesh Tevet) It is taught that the Greeks aimed to nullify three mitzvot: Rosh Chodesh, Shabbat, and circumcision. The question arises why they targeted Rosh Chodesh specifically. The interpretation that this refers to the additional sacrifice (Korban Mussaf) seems strained. It appears their true aim was to abolish the sanctification of the new month, angered by the fact that the sanctity of time depended on Bnei Yisrael, as it is stated, "Israel sanctifies the times."<br>The Gemara mentions that the Greeks demanded Bnei Yisrael write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the G-d of Israel. This seems contradictory because it acknowledges "the G-d of Israel" while denying their portion. The Greeks wanted to eradicate the belief that holiness is influenced by Bnei Yisrael's actions and that they indeed have a portion in divine matters. They aimed to nullify the idea that their deeds could awaken sanctity in the heavens.<br>Hashem responded by giving us Chanukah, which also relates to the concept of the month. Rosh Chodesh symbolizes renewal, with its sanctification dependent on Bnei Yisrael. Similarly, Chanukah represents renewal, even during the darkness of the month's end. In essence, Rosh Chodesh and Chanukah are connected: Rosh Chodesh marks the beginning of renewal, and Chanukah signifies renewal at its conclusion.

Hanukkah and Purim are illuminations deriving from the three Biblical holidays. Only the three holidays explicitly mentioned in the Torah are considered “Written Torah.” Corresponding to them are the holidays are of the “Oral Torah.” These are lights that are received similarly to how the light of the moon derives from the light of the sun, as everyone knows. Thus, by virtue of the Jewish people accepting the holidays properly, each holiday leaves an impression on the congregation of Israel. And by virtue of this, [the Jewish people] established other, corresponding holidays. Hanukkah derives from the holiday of Sukkot, and Purim derives from the holiday of Shavuot. We hope that there will yet be another deriving from the holiday of Passover, as it says, “I will show him wondrous deeds As in the days when You sallied forth from the land of Egypt” (Micah 7:15).

The name Chanukah comes from the expression of renewal, and so there was the inauguration of the altar. And the point is there through the affixing of Halel and Thanksgiving [to those days]. And the midrashim state: "not everyone who wants is able to say a song, only someone for whom a miracle was done can, and if one says a song it is known that all one's sins were forgiven, and one is made into a new creation, see the Song of Deborah in Judges. And so too in these days, that they merited to sing Halel and to give thanks for the miracle in which there is renewal, and that renewal remains forever. And the reason is that through the song there is renewal because a miracle is a door to the Root Above Nature, and in there, there is always renewal, since "there is nothing new under the sun" - but above the sun there is. And one who says a song about a miracle makes known that one belongs to and clings to the miracle, and there is renewal in that person. And so too I heard from my elder, my teacher, z"l, "until the foot (regel) stops in the marketplace": through the Chanukah candles the repetition [regilut] is cancelled, and we can come out of the and nature and come into renewal: and more, through the name Chanukah comes intruction [chinukh], which is preparedness for future redemption.

For Hanukkah and Parashat Miketz
(a) In the name of my grandfather and teacher, of blessed memory:  He explained the disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel as to whether one increases day by day or decreases.  He explained that, in the lamp, there is an aspect of illumination and one of combustion, that being to burn the waste material and to purge the inside by the fire of desire for Him, may He be blessed.  And Beit Shammai are of the view that, initially, it is necessary to "depart from evil [and (then) do good]" (Ps. 34:14), and thus the practice of decreasing day by day.  And Beit Hillel are of the view that the main idea is to increase day by day, such that the enthusiasm that illuminates through him will purify his body and will automatically purge the waste material.  (b) And this is also what is written that Yosef placed Menashe first, while Ya'akov placed Efraim first.  For the name Menashe is from "God has made me forget [nashani] ... my travail" (Gen. 41:51), as with "forget your people and your father's house" (Ps. 45:11), and he thought this about Ya'akov.  But Ya'akov our ancestor, peace be on him, realized that not everyone is prepared for this, and he placed Efraim first [see Gen. 41:52:  Efraim "for God has made me fertile (hifrani)"], corresponding to the view of Beit Hillel.  Thus far [my grandfather's] statement, may his memory be for a blessing.  (c) And according to this, both the formulation "increases day by day" and the formulation "decreases day by day" make sense, for they are in truth two paths.  There are those who proceed by diminishing the subjugation of the body, and there are those who proceed by increasing the light of the spirit and of the insides.  And this is a matter of "Ehad marbeh v'ehad mam'it" [originally, it is all the same whether one does much or one does little, provided that one directs one's mind towards Heaven.  Ber. 5b, 17a].  And these two aspects are of Hallel and Thanksgiving, as we have said elsewhere.

R’ Elazar of Worms says in his work ‘the Rokeach’ that the thirty-six candles we light on Hannukah parallel the thirty-six hours for which the original light of the six days of creation shone, before it was hidden away. If this is so, then it appears that each Hannukah candle draws from the or haganuz, the hidden light of creation, and gives light in great darkness, as our Sages hinted with their description of the or haganuz as a light which shined from one end of the world to the other (Chagigah 12a). There is no hiddenness or obscurity (he’elem) before this light. We call the world (olam) which obscures (ma’alim) and hides this light ‘the natural,’ but the original light of creation shone through all these layers of concealment and it was hidden away for the righteous; on this it is written “A light shines for the upright in the darkness…” (Psalms 112:4) It is also written “The people that walked in darkness have seen a brilliant light…” (Isaiah 9:1) The generation which lived in the days of the wicked Greeks walked in darkness, as the Sages taught “darkness refers to Greece which darkened the eyes of Israel…” (Bereshit Raba 2:4), nevertheless they served God with a spirit of self-sacrifice even in the midst of this darkness. That is why they merited that the hidden light shine for them, and some of its illumination remains, radiating from year to year even in these lowly times. Every servant of God must rejoice during these days when a touch of the hidden light illuminates Divine service. The primary intent of the wicked ones was to make us forget God’s laws and Torah, and the Hannukah lights bring us to remembrance.

On Chanukah, holiness and purity descend to the Jewish people. But "the Greeks defiled the oils," such that it follows that the holiness left, as it is written (Ezekiel 7:22), "ruffians shall invade it and defile it." As purity is the preparation (precondition) for holiness. "To make them forget Your Torah," is the aspect of the soul, which is what receives the holiness. "To divert them from the statutes of Your will," are the commandments which purify the body to be a ready vessel, as it is written (Psalms 51:12), "A pure heart, etc.; create a steadfast spirit, etc." As the body needs purity. And they are are called, "the statutes of Your will," because they are called (considered) statutes for the body. However the soul is from the root of the commandments and the Torah. And when the Holy One, blessed be He, "stood for us," He brings down purity to the body and holiness to the soul. That is the "praise and the thanksgiving," as I have written in another place. "You took vengeance for us" - just like they brought in impurity into a holy place, so too did the Holy One, blessed be He, take vengeance, and "gave over the impure into the hands of the pure." So therefore during these days, we are able to purify ourselves even in the impure places outside the Land [of Israel].
It is found [that] it is a commandment to place the Chanukah light in the opening of one's house. The explantion of, "to place," is that there should be a fixed impression in the house of the Jewish person. Behold [the Rabbis] said, "The mezuzah is on the right and the Chanukah light is on the left." They equated it with the mezuzah, which is permanently fixed at the opening; likewise should the impression of the Chanukah light remain fixed in the opening. And they fixed it on left, as it is written (Proverbs 3:16), "In her right hand is length of days" - for the one who involves himself in Torah for its sake. However the Chanukah light gives light even to those who do not do it truly for its own sake. Nevertheless they acquire a pure spirit from the left.

Yehuda approached Yosef. The name Yehuda is connected to the word 'Hoda’a,' meaning giving thanks, and this name is given to all Jews as 'Yehudim.' The Chidushei Harim explains that we are called 'Yehudim' because we give thanks to Hashem for everything, big or small, recognizing that all comes from Him. It is this attitude of gratitude that enables one to approach Hashem, especially in times of distress. In times of need, when Hashem seems hidden, the correct advice is to nullify one's will to Hashem's will, understanding that even in hiddenness, Hashem's life force is present. Yehuda's approach to Yosef exemplifies this, as he recognized and internalized Hashem's presence in the world.<br>Yehuda approached Yosef, who symbolizes the internal point of holiness derived from Hashem. At that time, Yehuda was in great distress, as evident from his plea, but his approach was to connect to the internal truth behind the scenes. He didn't add anything new in his monologue with Yosef but reiterated the story to accept Hashem's will at every step. By clarifying that everything is from Hashem, the internal truth is revealed. As Yosef, representing the pnimius, could no longer hold himself back, the external interferences were nullified. This concept is also seen in Shabbos, where everything becomes unified through nullification to Hashem, removing harsh judgments.<br>The Medrash interprets Yehuda's actions as aligning with Hashem's mastery, showing that even in mundane matters, Hashem's life force is present. When one nullifies their will to this source, they are saved. This concept is further illustrated when Yaakov was concerned about going down to Mitzrayim. Yosef, who connects the mundane to Hashem's source, reassured Yaakov by sending wagons, symbolizing that everything is connected to the singular source. This connection was essential for Yaakov to be transported spiritually by his sons, highlighting that the journey to Mitzrayim was part of Hashem's larger plan for redemption.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 93:11) describes the brothers' shame when Yosef revealed himself, saying, “Woe to us on the day of judgment, woe to us on the day of rebuke.” Their embarrassment came from realizing they had misjudged Yosef's hidden holiness. This mirrors the future realization that mundane matters are filled with hidden holiness.<br>This understanding should deter sinning. Recognizing that everything contains Hashem's life force makes it unthinkable to misuse it against His will. Yosef, representing the internal aspect (pnimius), guards the covenant (bris). The bris symbolizes inner holiness, and removing the foreskin represents shedding externalities. This is why the brothers feared Yosef upon recognizing his true nature.
When Yaakov met Yosef, he did not kiss him because he was saying the Shema, filled with love for Hashem, as explained by the Chidushei Harim quoting the Maharal. The question arises why Yosef did not also say the Shema. The answer lies in Yosef's ability to connect to Hashem even while involved in mundane matters, remaining true to himself even in his Egyptian master's house. In contrast, Yaakov, being above nature, was completely connected to Hashem at that moment and could not kiss Yosef.
"Remember the Shabbos day to keep it holy" (Shemos 20:8). The Gemara (Beitza 15b) teaches that one should set aside a nice portion for Shabbos from what they find during the week. This means dedicating the internal, sacred aspect of everything to Hashem. Shabbos represents the source of life in all things, the divine life force from Hashem. Similarly, Yosef the tzadik, who guards the covenant, embodies this internal holiness, as previously mentioned.
"And his heart fainted…and he saw the wagons that Yosef sent…and the spirit of Yaakov was revived" (Bereishis 45:26-27). It was difficult for Yaakov to go down to Mitzrayim, but this is why Yosef preceded him. Yosef represents the connection between worldly matters and the inner divine element (pnimius) within them, nullifying all externalities. The wagons (עגלות) symbolize this idea, as their root word עיגול means circle, indicating that everything returns to its source and is unified.<br>This concept is also mentioned in the sefer Kedushas Levi. Initially, Yaakov did not believe his sons because his connection to them was through Yosef. The brothers acted as a chariot for Yaakov, and it was through Yosef that Yaakov was drawn to them. When he saw the wagons, he realized the deeper message and his spirit was revived.

The Midrash teaches that Hashem created man to uplift everything to Him, for He made man upright and perfect (Kohelet 8:29). The term 'aravta' (surety) in Mishlei also means 'eiruv' (connection), indicating that each person has a connection to holiness in the source of their soul. However, through involvement in mundane matters, this connection can be obscured, causing everything to appear dark. An example is the sale of Yosef by his brothers, which distanced them from brotherly love and made them see Yosef as an enemy, even though he truly loved them. The advice is to have complete trust in Hashem, even in dark times, recognizing that His life force is always present.<br>When one gains this clarity and is prepared to sacrifice their will and humble themselves, the internal divine element (pnimius) is revealed. Yehuda's self-sacrifice for Binyamin exemplifies this. Just as after Yehuda’s acceptance, Yosef (symbolizing the pnimius) could not hold back and revealed himself to his brothers, so too, the internal mechanism and life force will be revealed. Sin obscures this connection, but humility and truth reveal it. Yehuda’s plea “bi Adoni” also reflects his recognition that Hashem’s life force is within him, even if hidden by his sins.<br>This concept explains the Medrash that when Yosef revealed himself, the brothers were shocked, a reminder of the great day of judgment. Their misjudgment of Yosef as a non-Jew and their shock upon seeing his true holiness highlight how sins can obscure the truth. On the day of judgment, it will be revealed how even the most despised things contain Hashem’s holiness, and how sins can turn this holiness into perceived evil. This understanding is crucial, though it has been elaborated elsewhere.
According to the Chidushei Harim, the Gemara (Shabbos 89b) states that Yaakov should have gone to Egypt in iron chains, but Yosef's merit saved him. The "iron chains" symbolize a spiritual descent, moving from level to level until reaching a low enough state to enter Mitzrayim.<br>Hashem arranged it so that through Yosef's preparation, Yaakov could go to Mitzrayim without descending spiritually. Yosef urged Yaakov to come quickly, recognizing it was a unique opportunity for him to maintain his spiritual level. Yosef's urgency also stemmed from the fear that any delay might lead to a fall in Yaakov's spiritual state, as true tzadikim do not fully trust themselves. Yosef's insistence on haste was due to his concern that Yaakov might lose his high spiritual level if delayed, reflecting the vigilance tzadikim maintain over their spiritual condition.
The Medrash (Bereishis Rabba 94:6) explains that Hashem promised Yaakov He would uplift him and all future tzadikim, on the condition that Yosef ‘place his hands on Yaakov’s eyes.’ This signifies that any distress a person experiences is ultimately for their benefit, leading to a greater level of spiritual elevation. Hashem's promise to Yaakov, ‘I will also uplift you,’ indicates that Yaakov will reach an even higher level than before the descent.<br>The condition that Yosef places his hand on Yaakov’s eyes refers to maintaining a proper perspective, ensuring that all feelings and views are preceded by the fear of Hashem. Recognizing that everything, both great and small, comes from Hashem's life force allows distress to transform into good. Similarly, the mitzvah to remember the exodus from Mitzrayim reinforces the understanding that all life force originates from Hashem.<br>This concept is mirrored in Shabbos, where Bnei Yisrael testify that the creation of the world is solely by Hashem. The pasuk in Devarim (5:15) links the exodus from Mitzrayim to the observance of Shabbos, showing that both share the same underlying idea. This is the essence of Yosef, who remained constantly connected to the pnimius, the internal divine life force.

In the Medrash, we find a connection to the verse in Mishlei (20:5) which states, "The designs in a man’s mind are deep waters, but a man of understanding can draw them out." This refers to Yehuda, who, by connecting one event to another, was able to uncover the truth about Yosef. This teaches us that within each person lies a way to correct their path, as Hashem has placed His fear in every heart. This hidden point requires effort to uncover.<br>The method to reach this divine point within is through the nullification of one's will to the truth. As it is written, Yosef could no longer hold himself back, symbolizing the inner essence within everyone. When a person nullifies their ego, this inner truth, likened to Yosef, is revealed.
In the Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 94:6), Hashem promised Yaakov redemption from Mitzrayim on the condition that Yosef would place his hands on his eyes. This means that by dedicating all one's energies to serving Hashem, a person can be saved. The name Yosef signifies this gathering of energies for divine service, which brings blessings and increase, as "the vessel that holds blessing is Shalom."<br>On Shabbos, the six days of the week receive their blessings through their nullification to Shabbos. In exile, gathering all energies towards Hashem sustains and redeems us. "Yosef will place his hands on your eyes" symbolizes aligning one's intellect and will with the desire to connect to Hashem. When this alignment occurs, the name of Hashem rests upon the person, as indicated by "placing his hands upon your eyes."
When Yaakov met Yosef, he was saying the Shema, reflecting his love for Hashem during his joyful reunion, as noted by the Maharal (Gur Arye Bereshit 46:29). Yosef, however, did not say Shema because his trait allowed him to conceal his true self, so his essence was not apparent outwardly. This ability is gained through enduring trials from afar, enabling a person to do good in a hidden manner.

The song of the Arizal traditionally recited on Friday night before Kiddush mentions entering "the gates of the apple orchard." The question arises, why mention gates instead of simply entering the orchard? The truth is that the 'apple orchard' signifies the omnipresence of Hashem's glory, as it is written, "the whole earth is filled with His glory." Before Yitzchak blessed Yaakov, he said, "the smell of my son is like the smell of a field blessed by Hashem," which Rashi explains refers to an apple field. The main effort is to open this point, hence the mention of gates, because accessing the gate leads to the garden being open. On Shabbos, this gate is opened, as it says in Yechezkel 46:1, "The inner gate shall be closed during the six days of work, but on Shabbos, it shall be opened." The holiness of Shabbos, though within the realm of time, is a taste of the world to come, making it easier to feel holiness on Shabbos compared to weekdays. This understanding extends to the belief that Hashem's glory is everywhere, even if not apparent, which is the faith every Jew must have in the one God.<br>This faith, though not fully comprehensible, leads to the truth, as truth and faith are two levels, paralleling Yosef and Yehuda. In the future, Hashem's oneness will be clear, but now it remains a secret. This concept is above human comprehension, as the world was created with Hashem's name. Yehuda's plea, "Please my master," contains the divine name, indicating that through faith in Hashem's oversight, one can amend their ways even in times of hiddenness. Belief in possessing a pure Godly soul, as stated in "the soul you gave me is pure," helps one to nullify themselves to Hashem's life force. This leads to the revelation of truth, as seen with Yehuda, where Yosef revealed himself after Yehuda's nullification. Yosef and Yehuda parallel Shabbos and the weekdays; on Shabbos, a divine point is revealed to each person, which should be drawn upon during the week, leading to further revelation on the following Shabbos.
The Chidushei Harim explains that Yaakov was meant to descend to Mitzrayim in chains, but Yosef's merit allowed him to maintain his spiritual level. When Yaakov saw the wagons ('agalot') sent by Yosef, his spirit revived, realizing he could descend honorably. This contrasts with descending in chains ('shalshalot'), which is degrading. Yehuda burned Pharaoh's wagons due to their idolatrous carvings, and Yosef instructed his brothers to mention their last study of 'egla arufa' to reassure Yaakov.
In the Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 93:2), it appears that the tribes' unity under Yehuda enabled them to prevail over Yosef. As explained by the Chidushei Harim, the disagreement was that Yosef chose to be a tzadik who, through his holiness, would draw everyone to Hashem. In contrast, the brothers believed each person should serve Hashem through their own efforts. While heaven favored Yosef's approach, Bnei Yisrael preferred the brothers' choice. Both perspectives hold truth, as the brothers' service was made possible by Yosef's holiness. The brothers' method also aimed for unity, and had Yosef known this, he wouldn't have opposed them. <br>Ultimately, their unity was due to Yosef, who embodied the collective needing the individual. When the brothers nullified themselves to Yehuda, this unity allowed Yehuda to approach Yosef. The Medrash explains this as two forms of oneness clashing. Yosef couldn't hold back upon seeing their unity and acknowledged their method of serving Hashem.
“And Yosef harnessed his chariot” (Bereishit 46:29). Whatever is under a person's control is called ‘his chariot’. Thus, the entire world is a ‘chariot’ for Hashem, the King of the world. Each individual must draw everything under their control towards the service of Hashem. This is how one humbles oneself to Hashem, by subjecting everything they have to Him.<br>Yosef's rulership in Mitzrayim, where the Egyptians were subjugated to him, was a preparation for the exile in Mitzrayim. The Egyptians became a ‘chariot’ for Yosef. When Yosef went to greet Yaakov, he needed to first harness his chariot, meaning he had to properly control all that was under him, which was far removed from Yaakov's truth, to prevent it from falling apart upon meeting Yaakov. Similarly, when Yaakov left Eretz Yisrael, he connected himself deeply to withstand negative forces. Yosef, in contrast, attached all of this world under his control to not lose it when encountering Yaakov's holiness. Thus, when Yosef ascended, he harnessed his entire chariot to draw everything towards Hashem, embodying the trait of Yosef the tzadik to draw everything to Hashem.

"And Yehuda approached him…" (Bereishit 44:18). The Midrash (Rabba 93:2) explains the verse, "If you provided surety for your friend" (Mishlei 6:1-3), as referring to Hashem. Rashi elucidates that each person is a guarantor for his neshama, tasked with returning it to its Father in heaven. Despite the neshama becoming sullied through sin, true teshuva from the depths of one's heart can transform sins into merits, as seen when Yehuda’s repentance led Yosef to reveal himself. While we might not fully understand how sins convert into merits, this transformation is due to the divine influence within us. Just as one turns their heart back to Hashem, so too do their sinful actions transform (Mida keneged mida).<br>Bnei Yisrael, being part of Hashem, retain their identity even when they sin, granting them the strength to approach the divine essence within. This is reflected in the phrase "And he approached him," meaning Yehuda approached his own internal Godliness. Yehuda’s plea, "Bi Adoni," can be interpreted as "Hashem is in me." It is essential that one's desire be solely for the sake of Heaven. Yehuda’s words, "Let your servant speak," signify that all intentions should align with royal manners, enabling one to speak to the Master of the Universe. When one clarifies this intention genuinely, even if tainted by sin, they can find a way to return to Hashem.
On the pasuk (Bereishit 45:3-4), “And his brothers could not answer him because they were afraid of him...I am Yosef your brother whom you sold to Mitzrayim,” there is a difficulty. If Yosef was trying to console them, why did he mention the sale, which would embarrass them more? However, there was a deeper consolation here. The brothers definitely felt Yosef's holiness, as indicated by their fear of his countenance. Yosef was telling them that he reached this high level of righteousness because they sold him to Mitzrayim. This realization alleviated their guilt, as they thought he would have been greater had he stayed with their father, but this was not the case at all.<br>It then says, “and the brothers spoke to him,” contrasting their initial inability to speak to him peacefully. Now, they could converse with him, free from jealousy. In truth, one cannot be jealous of someone who has perfected their unique role and place, as everyone has a specific place designed for them, making jealousy irrelevant. However, until the tzadik has fully perfected himself, jealousy is possible. In the future, when everyone has corrected themselves and is in their proper place, there will be no jealousy. This is as it says in Yeshaya 11:13, “Then Ephraim’s envy shall cease and Yehuda’s harassment shall end; Ephraim shall not envy Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not harass Ephraim.”
In the Shabbos zemiros, it says, “Baruch Hashem daily etc. sent to Babylon etc.” This connects to Shabbos through the Midrash, which states, “I will redeem you, on condition Yosef will place his hands over your eyes” (Rabba 94:6). This means that the concept of Yosef the Tzadik applies to every Jew, serving as a merit for their redemption, as it says, “I will go down with you.”<br>On Shabbos, the redemption is awakened because each Jew experiences an awakening of desire for their Father in Heaven. This desire embodies the essence of “Yosef,” the fiery flame of Godliness. In exile, the Heavenly Presence supports us in the merit of Shabbos. Therefore, on Motzei Shabbos, we pray for redemption, as it says in the Yerushalmi (3b), “If Bnei Yisrael keeps one Shabbos properly, they will immediately be redeemed by the son of David.”

On the pasuk “And Yosef could no longer hold back” (Bereishit 45:1), it follows Yehuda's approach to Yosef. The term "Eilav" can refer to approaching Yosef, his own essence, and Hashem. Yehuda's speech did not present new arguments but clarified the truth, leading to redemption, as “truth springs up from the ground” (Tehillim 85:12). The story of Yosef and his brothers serves as a parable for Bnei Yisrael's service to Hashem. The sages say, “Woe to us for the day of Judgement... if the brothers couldn't stand before Yosef, how much more so before Hashem.” This teaches that Hashem's presence is everywhere, even in darkness (Tehillim 139:12). In times of distress, nullifying oneself to the truth, as Yehuda did by offering to be a slave in place of Binyamin, leads to the revelation of the truth. Yehuda's sacrifice prompted Yosef to reveal himself, showing that everything was good and there was nothing to fear.<br>The phrase “And Yosef could no longer hold back” relates to the concept of capacity, as in “It’s capacity was 2000 baths” (Melachim 7:26). Hashem created the world with layers of measure. When one nullifies themselves to the level above, it causes an overflow of blessing from the higher level to the lower one. Yehuda's submission to Yosef exemplifies this. Yosef only sought Yehuda's acknowledgment of his kingship. Despite thinking Yosef was a foreigner, Yehuda, being a man of truth, accepted the reality and humbled himself. This teaches that when one nullifies their will to Hashem and admits the truth, their darkness turns into light, as the Medrash explains on the pasuk “If you provide surety for your friend.”
The words of the Maharal are known regarding why Yaakov didn't kiss Yosef when they met, as he was saying Shema. The Maharal explains that whenever a tzadik experiences love and happiness, he channels it into the service of Hashem. Therefore, Yaakov recited Krias Shema at that moment of intense joy to bring it all into the fold of serving Hashem. Simply put, Yaakov was afraid that experiencing such physical joy might cause him to momentarily forget his love for Hashem. By attaching himself to Hashem beforehand, he avoided experiencing the physical love.<br>This is the meaning of loving Hashem with both your positive and negative inclinations. How can one serve Hashem with his negative inclination? The explanation is that by being aware of the negative force within, a person takes precautions and connects himself to Hashem with love. Through this method of taking correct measures to protect oneself, one essentially uses the negative inclination for a positive outcome, converting the negative into positive. This answers the original question, as the person serves Hashem with his negative inclination by transforming it.<br>Similarly, the Gemara (Brachos 35a) resolves a contradiction in verses: "the earth and all it contains is Hashem's" versus "Hashem gave the earth to man." Before making a blessing, the food belongs to Hashem; after the blessing, it is given to man. The answer is that after making a bracha, man can uplift what is his to Hashem. This is the purpose of the bracha—to connect every action to holiness. This concept is evident in the after-bracha, which is the main blessing, as the Gemara says, 'if one makes a bracha when he is satisfied, surely he should make a bracha when he is hungry' (Brachot 48b). The idea is that by making a bracha before enjoying something, one prepares himself to not get disconnected through physical pleasure. This remembrance diminishes the physical attachment, allowing him to convert everything into the service of Hashem.
“And now don’t be sad etc.” (Bereishit 45:5) – The word ‘va’ata’ (and now) signifies repentance. The brothers corrected their sin of selling Yosef through their pain over Binyamin. They did not forget this sin for over twenty years, as shown when they said, “Hashem has found the sin of your servants” (Bereishit 45:16), referring specifically to their sin of selling Yosef, as they had no other significant sin.
In the Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 94:6), the promise “I will redeem you, on condition that your descendants follow the leadership of Yosef” is explained. The simple interpretation is that the redemption from Mitzrayim is dependent on Yosef’s energy continuing in Bnei Yisrael. However, it can also mean that both the exile and redemption depend on Yosef’s energy. The pasuk implies that Hashem’s presence (“I Myself will go down with you...I Myself will bring you back”) is conditional on Yosef’s leadership. This indicates that the root of exile is redemption, and redemption sustains the exile.<br>Hashem’s promise to Yaakov was that healing would precede the plague, ensuring divine support during the descent into Mitzrayim. This is symbolized by the enumeration of the 70 souls of Yaakov’s family, representing the forces countering the 70 nations. Yaakov, or Hashem, completes the count, indicating the overarching source of strength. The 70 souls are connected to their forefathers through Yosef, who provided life force during exile. The exile officially began only when the new king “did not know Yosef,” signifying the loss of Yosef's sustaining influence.

Section 7

With G-d's Blessing
In the Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 93:1), it advises, "My son, if you provide surety, run away from three things...from providing surety for another." This means one should avoid guaranteeing another person's obligations, as it is challenging enough to fulfill one's own responsibilities. However, the guarantee in the pasuk from Mishlei refers to providing surety to Hashem, as Rashi explains, meaning every Jew committed at Sinai to uphold the Torah. True guarantee pertains to one's inherent responsibility to their soul, as demonstrated by the principle that all of Yisrael are responsible for one another (Shavuot 39a). Yehuda's guarantee for Binyamin's safe return was genuine, stemming from this responsibility, ensuring he could fulfill it.<br>The Medrash aims to strengthen the resolve of Bnei Yisrael, emphasizing that they can always fulfill their commitments. Mishlei continues, "Go grovel and badger your fellow," teaching that through effort and longing, one can reach the truth of Torah and prayer. There is always hope, as it says, "Search in it and search in it" (Avot 5:22), and "Hope in Hashem... and hope in Hashem" (Brachos 32b). Yehuda exemplified this by not losing hope even when he found himself guilty; he clarified the truth and maintained his integrity. This principle is always accessible to every Jew.
In the Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 93:4), it states, "Deep waters run in the heart of man, and a person of wisdom can draw them forth" (Mishlei 20:5). This applies to every Jew; through effort, one can discover within themselves many ways to serve Hashem in any situation. This aligns with the saying, "I have toiled and have found" (Megila 6b). The truth is that when a person strives to find this hidden point in their soul, Hashem grants them renewal from Heaven.<br>This concept is illustrated by Yehuda and Yosef, representing the days of the week and Shabbos, respectively. Yehuda symbolizes the toil of the weekdays, where one must "drink the water of your pit" to uncover the hidden light within. This requires a "man of wisdom" to "draw it forth," linking one string to another, symbolizing the effort needed to approach holiness. Through this toil, one merits the aspect of Shabbos, represented by Yosef, the crown of the brothers, signifying a cessation from mundane activities. This is further explained by the verse, "drink flowing waters from your well," indicating the continuous, renewed flow from above.
On the pasuk “And Yosef harnessed his chariot” (Bereishit 46:29), it signifies that man was created to rule over nature, as stated in "he shall rule over the fish of the sea" (Bereishit 1:26) and "laying the world at his feet" (Tehillim 8:7). Man controls nature, making it his chariot. When a person accepts the yoke of heaven and humbles himself before Hashem, all of creation is nullified to Hashem through this person. This can only occur when one overcomes negative inclinations, thus gaining control over creation. Yosef's reward for overcoming his trials was his rulership in Mitzrayim, which prepared Bnei Yisrael for the upcoming exile. Without Yosef preceding them as a ruler, Bnei Yisrael could not have withstood the impurity of Mitzrayim. Yaakov's level was above nature, and he needed Yosef to harness everything under his control, making it subjugated to the general force of Bnei Yisrael.<br>The Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 94:4) explains that Yaakov exclaimed Yosef's greatness for withstanding the tests of Mitzrayim and fulfilling the verse, “How abundant is the good that You have in store for those who fear You, that You do in the full view of men for those who take refuge in You” (Tehillim 31:20). This "good in store" is earned through efforts and trials in this world. The reward of the world to come is dependent on one's actions in this world. There is a correlation between great good and great bad, as overcoming great bad leads to meriting great good. Yosef's steadfastness in Mitzrayim allowed him to remain a tzadik and achieve this level of greatness.

My son, if you have stood surety for your fellow and given your hand for another, you have been trapped by your words. To extricate yourself, go and humble yourself before your fellow (Mishlei 6:1-3). This refers to accepting the dominion of Heaven, through which all can be corrected. Yehuda guaranteed Binyamin's return and persisted with Yosef until he revealed himself. This acceptance and self-nullification to the yoke of Heaven allowed Yehuda to uncover the truth. As it says in Kohelet 3:20, everything comes from the earth and returns to it, symbolizing nullification to the source. Yehuda's primary trait was his admission of the truth, enabling the world's repair. "Truth shall sprout from the earth" (Tehillim 85:12) implies that justice from Heaven requires truth from earth.<br>The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 93:4) quotes Mishlei 20:5, "Deep waters run in the soul of a man, and a person of understanding can draw them forth." This signifies putting deep understanding into action. A fool desires only to air his thoughts, lacking lasting impact. Yehuda and Yosef represent two elements in serving Hashem. Some tzadikim receive holiness serenely without effort, while others maintain righteousness through challenges until they find stability. Both are necessary, representing the days of the week and Shabbos. Yosef symbolizes Shabbos - serenity, while Yehuda symbolizes the workdays. This is hinted at in Amos 9:13, "And the plowman shall meet the reaper," with Yehuda as the plowman and Yosef as the reaper. Isaiah 11:13 states that Ephraim's jealousy will be removed, and Yehuda will no longer provoke Ephraim. The workdays prepare for Shabbos, and Yehuda's final actions reconnect him with Yosef, signifying the ultimate unity and removal of jealousy.
Our sages taught (Rashi 39:11) that when Yosef came to do his work, he saw an image of his father and refrained from sinning with Potiphar's wife. This does not imply that Yosef had fewer merits or that his test was easy. Rather, it illustrates that Yosef's primary effort was in seeking divine assistance and holiness from above. While everything is governed by divine justice and requires significant personal effort, Yosef's main focus was to receive help from above.
Yehuda tells Yosef that if Yaakov sees Binyamin does not return safely, Yaakov will die (Bereishis 44:31). This raises the question: how did Yehuda know that Yaakov would die if Binyamin did not return? Yehuda understood this from Yaakov's words, "Hashem - אל שדי shall have mercy on you" (Rashi explains that Yaakov used the word שדי, implying "the one who said די - enough to the world, shall say enough to my suffering"). Yaakov would only use such an expression if he knew it was a matter of life and death. Our forefathers were willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of future generations, understanding their own suffering was for the greater good.<br>This explains why Yosef did not reveal his whereabouts to Yaakov, just as Yitzchak did not reveal it to Yaakov. Although a father's mercy is greater than a son's, they both learned from Hashem, who did not reveal that Yosef was alive, indicating it was best for Yaakov not to know. However, when it reached a critical point, with Yaakov himself saying he would die if Binyamin did not return, Yosef realized it was the right time to reveal the truth. Knowing that Yaakov’s life was at stake, Yosef was compelled to disclose his identity.
To each of them, Yosef gave a change of clothing; but to Binyamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing (Bereishit 45:22). The internal essence, or pnimius, remains constant, but the external garments change according to a person's spiritual level, as it says, "they remove one form and wear a different form." The benefit of going through exile is to rectify these external garments. When Bnei Yisrael left Mitzrayim, they took silver, gold, and clothing, with Rashi explaining that the clothing was most prized (Shmot 12:35).<br>Yosef showed the way to 'dress' in different spiritual garments, as he did in Mitzrayim, where his brothers did not recognize his righteousness. Chazal explained that Yosef gave Binyamin five garments as a hint that his descendant, Mordechai, would wear five royal garments before King Achashveirosh (Megillah 16b). This was due to the extreme hiddenness of Hashem during Esther's time, and Mordechai rectified these five levels of garments. This concept is reflected in the tradition of changing clothes on Purim, aligning with the idea of 'change of clothing.' Yosef prepared the way for Bnei Yisrael's descent to Mitzrayim, as also indicated by the wagons he sent and the preparations made, and by the idea that Yaakov should have come down to Mitzrayim in iron chains.

The Midrash quotes the pasuk in regard to Yehuda: "The designs of a man’s heart are deep waters, and a man of understanding can draw them forth" (Mishlei 20:5). It has been explained elsewhere that "man’s heart" refers to each person’s own heart, signifying that one can find the truth within oneself. By repairing the entire body, comprising the 248 limbs and 365 sinews that parallel the 613 mitzvot, one connects a rope to another and a string to another until the internal essence, or pnimius, is revealed. A person is called "a man of understanding" when the understanding spreads throughout the entire body, illuminating the soul.<br>This concept is akin to searching for treasures, as stated in Mishlei 2:4, indicating that one must believe there is a holy spark in every time and place, especially within a person's soul. One who is aware of this hidden spark will search diligently until it is found. This process is described as "truth shall sprout forth from the land." We learn from Yehuda that he did not have any complaints against Yosef; rather, it was through heartfelt words that the truth was revealed to him. When the Torah says "Vayigash Eilav" (He approached him), it means Yehuda approached his own essence, embodying the idea of "a man of understanding."
The primary idea of "Vayigash eilav - Yehuda approached him" is that Yehuda approached Yosef, signifying that by then, there was no longer any jealousy between Yosef and the other tribes. Yehuda realized they had already corrected the sin of selling Yosef. He was able to say "and his brother (Yosef) died" because if Yosef were still alive, his whereabouts would have been revealed. The proof is that immediately after Yehuda spoke, Yosef revealed himself.
The Midrash (Shocher Tov Tehillim 105) explains that Hashem told Yaakov He would go down to Mitzrayim with him. The Chidushei Harim elaborates that although Yaakov was supposed to descend in iron chains, Yosef's preceding him spared him from this. The idea is that for Yaakov to descend to a spiritually low place like Mitzrayim, he would normally need to lower himself through many stages. However, due to Hashem's love for Yaakov, He allowed him to go down without changing spiritually. This is conveyed in the words, “I will go down with you and come up,” indicating that Yaakov would maintain his spiritual level even in Mitzrayim and would be elevated upon leaving.<br>This preparation was made possible by Yosef, who paved the way for his family’s descent to Mitzrayim while maintaining their spiritual integrity. Hashem gave each member of Bnei Yisrael this sign (אות), representing the mitzvot that can illuminate even in darkness. A sign is necessary only in hidden places, not where everything is revealed.<br>This concept is also reflected in the verse, “And your nation are all righteous; they will inherit the land forever” (Yeshaya 60:21). The term לעולם (forever) refers to the world and all its hiddenness and exile. Despite these challenges, Bnei Yisrael are saved through this divine sign.
Yehuda says to the ruler, “How can I go up to my father and the lad (Binyamin) is not with me, lest I witness the woe that would overtake my father” (Bereishit 44:34). This statement is puzzling because Yehuda should have mentioned his guarantee to his father. However, Yehuda felt more pain from witnessing his father's suffering than from the risk of losing his reward in the world to come. He demonstrated this profound pain to the ruler (Yosef) to awaken his mercy for their father.<br>Yehuda's genuine concern for his father's anguish deeply moved Yosef, who could no longer hold back his emotions. Although Yehuda's initial involvement was due to his guarantee, his progression from one level of empathy to another led him to forget his own pain entirely and focus solely on his father's. This narrative serves as a lesson for Bnei Yisrael in their relationship with their Father in Heaven, emphasizing the power of selfless devotion and empathy.
“You shall tell my father all my glory in Mitzrayim and all that you have seen” (Bereishit 45:13). Initially, the brothers were afraid of Yosef (Bereishit 45:3), but now they saw his light and his encompassing trait called “כל,” symbolizing connection. They realized that Yosef was indeed a tzadik. Previously, they could not speak to him peacefully (Bereishit 37:4) because they could not follow his leadership.<br>Now, when Yosef said, “For you see that it is my mouth that speaks to you,” they accepted his leadership, recognizing the path he opened as essential for preparing for the ultimate redemption. They now understood and appreciated Yosef's role, acknowledging that the exile had begun. Thus, the pasuk states, “and afterwards his brothers spoke to him,” indicating their acceptance and alignment with his leadership.

The Midrash interprets the verse from Mishlei (20:5), "The designs in a man's heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out," as referring to the Torah, which is likened to water. The Oral Torah, in particular, is called "deep waters." The root of the Torah exists within every Jew, as it is written, "An eternal life He planted within us." However, one must exert effort to uncover this hidden point in the heart, as stated in Mishlei (2:4), "If you seek it like treasure."<br>This concept is exemplified by Yehuda and the tribes. Yosef represents the Written Torah, connected to the forefathers, while Yehuda represents the Oral Torah. When both are properly understood, they unify, as seen in the verse "And Yehuda approached him (Yosef)." This unification is further illustrated by the verse, "One with another they approach" (Iyov 41:8). The Oral Torah is embedded within the Written Torah, derived through inferences and hints by the sages. This requires human effort and wisdom to clarify and bring to light, achieved through mitzvot and good deeds, which serve as the means to this end. This is akin to connecting rope with rope and string with string.
Our sages explain that when Yosef cried on Binyamin’s shoulders, he was weeping over the future destruction of the Beis Hamikdash. This connection may be understood through the verse "And Yosef could no longer hold back," implying that ideally, he should have restrained himself. Had Yosef managed to hold back, there might not have been any exile or destruction.<br>The sages teach that the entire exile and the challenges of future generations are rooted in the actions of our forefathers. The efforts of the patriarchs were a preparation for their descendants, but they could not bear all the suffering, as evidenced by "And Yosef could no longer hold back." This moment signified to Yosef the impending destruction. Even this brief lapse, which we have been unable to fully rectify over many generations, highlights the immense efforts and contributions of our forefathers and the tribes.

The Midrash brings the verse from Mishlei (20:5): "The thoughts of a man’s heart are like deep waters." It explains this with an analogy to a deep well, where the deeper the water, the sweeter and cooler it is. Similarly, there is a profound point of Torah within each individual in Bnei Yisrael, and the more effort one puts into revealing it, the greater the discovery. This depth is hinted at in Tehillim (31:20): "How great is Your goodness that You have hidden." Additionally, Mishlei (19:21) states: "The thoughts of man are many, yet the plan of Hashem will persevere," indicating that each person has a “nekuda tova,” a point of absolute goodness, which is the “plan of Hashem” hidden in their heart.<br>This point, called the “plan of Hashem,” suggests that one can align all their thoughts towards this central thought, nullifying other distractions to let this point persevere. By connecting everything to this central point, as expressed in the Midrash of “tying one rope to another,” one finds and links everything to holiness. This effort is symbolized by the work done during the weekdays, compared to Yehuda and the rest of the tribes. As expressed in Mishlei (5:15): "Drink water from your cistern, and liquid from your well," these two sources of water are likened to the days of the week and Shabbos.<br>Yosef is compared to Shabbos, representing the rest of Shabbos, a special light attained through overcoming tests. When tested, one brings light to places lacking it, as seen when Yosef was thrown into a pit, which was empty of water—implying a hidden light. Subsequently, he was brought to Mitzrayim, a land of impurity, and through his strength, he withstood the test, advancing from the level of בור (pit) to באר (well). The other brothers needed to find this hidden light in nature, representing the Oral Torah, which explains the Written Torah through effort. Each soul in Bnei Yisrael embodies these elements, but Yosef and his brothers were repairing the world on a broader scale, part of the “deep advice” of the exile in Mitzrayim, enabling Bnei Yisrael to draw the Torah into the world.
The Midrash interprets the verse, "If you have put up security for your neighbor," in relation to Yehuda, who said, "For your servant has guaranteed the boy." He then explained, "How can I go up if I see my father's sorrow?" This shows that Yehuda's primary distress was not due to his guarantee but rather the thought of his father's sorrow. It can be said that Yehuda knew that since he had guaranteed Binyamin's return, it was a sign that he would indeed be able to bring him back to his father.<br>Similarly, the guarantee of the Israelites, who accepted the Torah, means they should strengthen their faith in Hashem and believe that He will surely help them fulfill their commitment. As it is said, "I have sworn, and I will uphold it, to keep Your righteous judgments." In the same way, all of Bnei Yisrael are guarantors for one another, and through this mutual responsibility, each person can help their fellow Jew, as explained in the mitzvah of helping with loading and unloading burdens. The term "guarantee" (ערבות) is related to the word "mixture" (תערובות), indicating that the guarantor is inherently connected to the matter at hand.
The Midrash interprets the verse, "For your eyes can see that it is my mouth that is speaking to you," in relation to Yosef's reunion with his brothers. This concept connects to the Zohar’s explanation that during the exile in Mitzrayim, the concept of speech (דיבור) was in exile. This is seen in the verse, "This is what their father said to them," indicating that the clarity of divine speech was hidden during their exile. Yosef, however, represents the "mouth of speech," linking speech to voice.<br>When the brothers returned to Yaakov and recounted their encounter with Yosef, the verse states, "They spoke all the words that Yosef spoke to them... and the spirit of Yaakov was revived." This revival indicates that Yaakov recognized something in Yosef's words that resonated deeply, reflecting the essence of Yosef the tzadik. The clarity of Yosef’s words is reminiscent of the revelation at Sinai, where it is said, "They saw the voices," symbolizing the clear and direct communication from Hashem.<br>Yosef's time in Mitzrayim was a preparation for Yaakov and his family's eventual descent there. Yosef served as the intermediary, connecting Yaakov's spiritual insight (Da’as) to the practical actions (Ma’ase) of the brothers. When Yaakov saw the wagons sent by Yosef, his spirit was revived, understanding that Yosef would provide for their spiritual and physical needs. Yosef's message to Yaakov, "lest you become impoverished," hinted at both physical and spiritual sustenance. Yosef knew that Yaakov's continuity depended on him, as indicated in the Midrash, where Hashem conditioned Yaakov's move to Mitzrayim on Yosef’s presence. This principle extends to future generations, where the power of Yosef enables redemption in difficult times. By connecting our actions to Torah and mitzvot with longing and love, we bring the light of Torah into every mitzvah, embodying the essence of Yosef.

When Yehuda confronts Yosef, he states, "בי אדוני" ("Please, my master"), which can also mean "in me." The Midrash likens Yehuda to the plower and Yosef to the reaper. While the reaper holds a higher status as the one who completes the process, Yehuda ultimately rises to Yosef's level. This is illustrated by the verse in Zechariah 6:12: "from beneath him, it will grow," suggesting that those below empower those above, with Yehuda symbolizing the lower level.<br>This concept extends to the universe, where the forefathers are above the 12 tribes, who are above the rest of the world. Yosef embodies all the forefathers, while Yehuda represents their descendants. The "קול" (voice) signifies Yaakov, Yosef is the "הבל" (breath necessary for sound), and Yehuda is the "דיבור" (words, or actual leadership). Before these elements were refined, they couldn't achieve their purpose. The verse "before Yosef was sold" (Genesis 37:4) implies they couldn't speak peacefully, indicating they hadn't reached completion. Now, Yehuda's "בי אדוני" signifies that mastery lies within him, in the power of his diligent work at the lower levels.
Yosef tells his brothers, "I am Yosef whom you sold" (Bereishit 45:4). The word "whom" is connected to "whom you broke" (Shemot 34:1) referring to the luchot. Yosef comforts his brothers, as it was through the sale that he achieved his success.
The Midrash Tanchuma (Vayigash 6) explains that Yaakov sent Yehuda ahead to Mitzrayim. This parallels mitzvot, which serve as Hashem's messengers. The mitzvah is likened to a candle, while the Torah is the light. Yaakov, representing the Torah, could only descend to Mitzrayim if preceded by Yehuda, symbolizing mitzvot and the Oral Torah. Mitzvot act as the body's physical covering, representing the 248 positive commandments, but the inner essence is the light of Torah. Similarly, Bnei Yisrael, called Yehudim, prepare the world through mitzvot for the future, when a new Torah light will emerge (Yeshaya 51:4).

Section 13

5644
With G-d's Blessing
The Midrash Bereishis Rabbah 93:3 describes the encounter between Yosef and Yehuda, relating it to the pasuk in Mishlei (20:5): "the thoughts of man are like deep waters, and a man of understanding can draw them forth." There are two distinct methods of serving Hashem, hinted at in the pasuk (Mishlei 5:15): "Drink water from your cistern, and liquids from your wells." The water from your cistern alludes to the Oral Torah, literally planted inside us by Hashem, connected to the "service of the heart," which is prayer. It parallels the days of the week and the 613 mitzvot, dependent on one's actions. The twelve tribes are the source of the 613 mitzvot, paralleling the 248 positive commandments and 365 negative commandments. The forefathers and the twelve tribes form the pillar for the 600,000 souls of Klal Yisrael. Moreover, the 13 tribes (including Menashe and Ephraim) plus 600, alluding to the 600,000 souls, make up 613. The 12 tribes represent the twelve sides of a 3-dimensional cube, symbolizing all physical things in this world.<br>The written Torah, on the other hand, is the inner light, while the candle, compared to a mitzvah, spreads the light of the Torah. Yosef, the tzadik, is above this spreading out, called a flame, and compared to "liquids from your well," representing a higher level, that of Shabbos and the extra soul that comes on Shabbos after preparations during the week. Furthermore, the Zohar explains that during the exile in Mitzrayim, "dibur" (speech) was in exile. Dibur represents clarity and leadership of Hashem in the world, covered by the thick allusion of nature. Bnei Yisrael revealed it by actualizing Hashem's presence through mitzvot preparation, gaining Torah and revelation. Similarly, the tribes made necessary changes and repairs. Before selling Yosef, the Torah states, "They could not speak to him in peace," indicating the absence of leadership. It was only when "Yehuda approached Yosef" that the brothers followed his leadership.<br>The pasuk states, "And Yosef could no longer hold back… And no one stood with him when Yosef confessed to his brothers." This alludes to two forms of Yosef. Originally, when the brothers met him, he was not actually "Yosef," changing between forms. During the time of the Beis Hamikdash, this revelation and clarity were apparent. The Midrash on the pasuk (Shir Hashirim 1:5) "I am blackened but Beautiful" hints at this, blackened during the week but beautiful on Shabbos. Yosef hid this facet, revealing it only when meeting his brothers and father, symbolizing a hidden form now revealed. His statement, "You can see that it is my mouth that is speaking," alludes to a revelation, akin to the prophet's faces burning like flaming torches with the spirit of Hashem.
Hashem promises Yaakov, "I will go down with you to Mitzrayim." This guarantees that Hashem's presence is always with Bnei Yisrael in exile, embodying the concept of "עמו אנכי בצרה" ("I am with them in their pain"). It was in Yaakov's merit that Hashem's presence accompanied us in exile. The chain of events began with Yosef going to Mitzrayim due to his brothers, which led to Yaakov's descent to Mitzrayim, ultimately bringing Hashem's presence there.<br>Yaakov's influence remains with Bnei Yisrael in every exile. Our sages teach that Yaakov's form is carved below Hashem's holy throne, signifying his enduring presence. Yaakov's merit lies in his trait of אמת (truth), as stated, "You give truth to Yaakov." Hashem's stamp is truth, and since this world often disguises Hashem's truth, through the repair of truth, we can access Hashem's life force even in exile. The Chidushei Harim explains that through the trait of truth, Yaakov was able to "live" in Mitzrayim, signifying survival and spiritual vitality in exile.<br>This concept also applies to Shabbos, as it is said, "One who pleasures the Shabbos inherits an unlimited reward, the inheritance of Yaakov." On Shabbos, everything returns to its source, exemplified by the command, "No one shall exit his place on Shabbos." This return to the source is the essence of truth, aligning with Yaakov's enduring legacy of אמת.

Section 14

5645
With G-d's Blessing
The argument between the brothers and Yosef exemplifies the Mishnah (Avot 5:17): "An argument for the sake of Heaven will endure." This dispute arose from each brother's unique approach to serving Hashem. Yaakov represents the essence of Torah, which is expounded through thirteen attributes. Therefore, each brother had a distinct spiritual path. The Torah is described as both fire (Yirmiya 23:29) and water (Yesaya 55:1). Yosef, symbolizing fire, embodies enthusiasm in divine service, while Yehuda, symbolizing water, represents humility and prayer.<br>In Klal Yisrael, all these different energies are necessary, and true perfection comes from the harmony of these traits. Hashem created each trait purposefully, and they are all equally good. We must embrace each trait with joy, humility, and strength, adapting as needed until reaching true completion. On an individual level, a person's internal conflicts in serving Hashem, if for the sake of Heaven, will ultimately lead to enduring spiritual growth.<br>The concept of complementary forces is also seen among heavenly angels, as stated, "He who makes peace on High..." Michael, the angel of water, and Gavriel, the angel of fire, coexist in harmony. Similarly, the Midrash Tanchuma (Vayigash 3) compares Yosef to an ox and Yehuda to a lion, reflecting the balance of gevura (strength) symbolized by fire.
The midrash states that Hashem promised Yaakov redemption for Bnei Yisrael on the condition that Yosef is in charge. The Chidushei Harim explained that where there is the element of Yosef and the guarding of the brit (covenant), Hashem’s promise to redeem is fulfilled. This symbolizes drawing down new life energy from the source, as seen in the mitzvah of brit milah, which changes a person’s natural form. This duty prevents us from drowning in nature and encourages us to draw new life force constantly.<br>On a deeper level, the organ involved in brit milah represents awakening life force, emphasizing that continuity and renewal come from changing nature. Avoiding routine and finding new enthusiasm in Torah and mitzvot connects one to their source. This is the essence of Yosef the tzadik, symbolizing gathering desires and connecting them to the source, thus bringing down new life force. Shabbos, with its additional neshama, represents this concept of new light from above, akin to Yosef.<br>Yehuda was sent ahead to establish a Torah teaching house in Mitzrayim, reflecting two preparations needed before Yaakov and his children could come to Mitzrayim: the covenants of the tongue and the skin. Yosef's covenant, symbolized by a locked garden, protected Bnei Yisrael from illicit relations in Mitzrayim, leading to their redemption. Yehuda's covenant, symbolizing the tongue, reveals Hashem’s glory to the world. Yosef's descent to Mitzrayim was hidden, while Yehuda’s role was public, teaching the masses. These roles parallel the redemptions of Mashiach Ben Yosef and Mashiach Ben David, with Yosef’s level being higher but hidden.

Vayechi



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Written Briefly
The Chidushei Harim commented on the verse "and Yaakov lived in the land of Mitzrayim," explaining that through the attribute of truth (emes), one can maintain spiritual life even in Mitzrayim. This is why the Torah specifically states "and Yaakov lived" rather than simply "and Yaakov was." It emphasizes that Yaakov was spiritually alive because he embodied truth, as indicated by the verse "You gave truth to Yaakov."<br>Being alive in this context means being connected to the divine source of life. The Zohar elaborates on this idea with the verse "and Yaakov’s spirit was revived." This revival is akin to flowing water (mayim chayim), which symbolizes a continuous connection to the source. Yaakov's joy and spiritual vitality in Mitzrayim stemmed from this deep connection, which awakened and increased his life force. Even in Mitzrayim, a place of impurity, Yaakov understood that the external reality was merely a shell concealing the inner divine life force of Hashem. <br>Our sages teach that the wicked are considered dead even while alive because they are disconnected from this life source. The Midrash Tanchuma expounds that our purpose in this world is not to be attached to it but to elevate everything to Hashem. The term "ger" (stranger) implies drawing near, signifying the extraction of holy sparks from within the nations or situations of exile. This was the essence of the exile in Mitzrayim, where holy sparks were embedded. The "great wealth" mentioned in the Torah refers to these extracted sparks. Yaakov wished to reveal that the exile is merely a concealment of divine energy, but since this revelation would nullify the concept of exile, it remained hidden. However, through emunah (faith), one can perceive this truth and realize that all concealment is temporary. This hidden truth requires effort to uncover, and through the Oral Torah and Shabbat, the light of Yaakov can be found even in times of concealment.
The Midrash states, "Listen to your father Yisrael; just as Hashem creates worlds, so too does your father." This suggests that the life force sustaining Bnei Yisrael in Mitzrayim came from Yaakov. Hashem prepared for the exile by ensuring Yaakov's influence, as the Zohar explains regarding Yosef's subjugation to the tribes. Similarly, "Yaakov lived in Mitzrayim" implies that Yaakov provided the life force needed to endure Mitzrayim. This is the essence of "creating worlds," where Yaakov infused vitality even within hiddenness and darkness, enabling a connection to divine life force through emes (truth) and emunah (faith).
The Zohar (1:248:1) on "and so (vezot) Yaakov spoke to them" (Bereishis 49:28) explains that Yaakov instilled in his children the concept of 'zot', representing holiness and the divine life force, as opposed to 'eile' (separation). 'Diber' (he spoke) signifies leadership, teaching them to align all their actions with 'zot', the inner divine essence. This underscores the importance of focusing on the inner life force in all aspects.
The Chidushei Harim explained Yaakov’s request for Yosef to swear to bury him in Eretz Yisrael, stating that Yaakov bowed down to Hashem because his family was complete and Yosef was a king (Rashi on Bereishis 47:31). The swearing, 'shavua,' is connected to 'shiva' (seven), symbolizing the connection of all seven traits (midos) to the life force. This act revealed Yosef’s spiritual aspect to Yaakov.<br>The necessity of the oath was profound. Yosef's ability to resist immorality, crucial for Bnei Yisrael's purity in Mitzrayim, was significant. The Zohar explains that Yaakov's burial in Eretz Yisrael was promised by Hashem, contingent on Yosef's role. By making Yosef swear, Yaakov transferred his spiritual power to him, allowing Yosef to embody Yaakov's vitality even in Mitzrayim. Yaakov's prostration indicated his gratitude, seeing his legacy continue through his sons. The brothers' fear after Yaakov's death arose because they sensed that Yosef now held this inherited spiritual power.

Section 2

With G-d's Blessing
The Chidushei Harim explained that the blessing Yaakov gave Yosef, adding “The blessings of your forefathers are greater than mine,” refers to Shabbos. It is said that one who enjoys Shabbos inherits an unlimited inheritance. This means that recognizing all life force comes from Hashem, acknowledging that there is a divine spark in everything, brings greater blessing and connection to the source of life. This divine spark is limitless because it comes from the Infinite.<br>Enjoying Shabbos means focusing all pleasures on this inner point of spirituality, which represents true rest. One who realizes this as the main reason for enjoyment will be blessed. Yaakov’s blessing to Yosef, “To the utmost bounds of the eternal hills,” refers to the point that all creation desires to connect to, as it gives life to everything. The Chidushei Harim also explained that “Yaakov lived in the land of Mitzrayim” signifies that with the aspect of Yaakov, which is Emes (truth), one can live even in Mitzrayim. This Emes is the awareness of Hashem’s life force in everything, sustaining the world.<br>Falsehood does not last, but truth sustains the world. When one is connected to truth, they are not bound by limitations because everything, even physical constraints, draws strength and sustenance from this divine point.
The Midrash asks why the pasuk says "he blessed Yosef" when the blessing was actually for Yosef’s children. The answer is that all blessings come from the aspect of Yosef, meaning that when everything is connected to the divine source, which is Hashem’s life force in everything, there is a constant flow of renewal and blessing. Similarly, on Shabbos, it says, "He blessed...and sanctified it," meaning that from Shabbos, the six days receive their blessing. When Bnei Yisrael testify to Hashem’s creation on Shabbos, they too receive this blessing by connecting to the source.<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that the blessing to "multiply like fish" means that just as fish open their mouths to catch new drops of water, Bnei Yisrael eagerly receive new words of Torah. Even though they are involved in the physical world, their main sustenance is Hashem, and they stay connected to the source of blessing. The phrase "Hashem will make you like Efraim and Menashe" signifies that even though Efraim and Menashe are a generation after Reuven and Shimon, they were elevated to the same status through their connection to the source. This blessing allows every Jew, even a thousand generations later, to draw on the forefathers' blessings. Thus, "he blessed Yosef" also means that Yosef was elevated through his sons' elevation, making his status equal to that of his father Yaakov.

Section 3




Rashi (47:28) asks why the parsha of Vayechi is closed, explaining that once Yaakov died, the hearts and eyes of Bnei Yisrael became blocked due to the hardships of bondage. The truth is that the hearts and eyes of every Jew are focused on Hashem, but after Yaakov's death, this truth became hidden. The pasuk "do not follow after your hearts and eyes" (Bamidbar 15:39) refers to when they are in a state of hiddenness and externality, representing the main exile where the inner divine life force (pnimius) is in exile.<br>The Chidushei Harim advises that through emes (truth), one can awaken the life force even in hidden and difficult situations, as it says, "You give truth to Yaakov." The principle is to align one's desires with the inner truth (pnimius) and not follow external falsehoods. The more one genuinely desires Hashem's will, the more the truth is revealed. In the most hidden places, the deepest truths are often concealed. This is exemplified by the mitzvah of circumcision, where the most holy part of the body is covered by the foreskin, symbolizing that holiness is often found in the most concealed places. As our sages say, "the secret of Hashem is revealed to those who fear Him," referring to the mitzvah of circumcision.
“And he blessed Yosef...the angel who redeems me shall bless the lads ‘nearim’”. The word ‘na’ar’ implies awakening, as a ‘na’ar’ (lad) has more energy and arousal than older individuals. Thus, the blessing Yaakov gave Yosef was one of awakening, aligning with Yosef's youthful nature.<br>The phrase "who redeems me" refers to the protection of a divine spark inherited from the forefathers. The Chidushei Harim explains that each Jew carries a protective point from their ancestors, symbolized by "the shield of Avraham." This "oti" (sign) represents the covenant of holiness that remains with their descendants and needs protection from harm. The blessing "they will multiply as fish do, in the land" means that even amidst physicality, the divine spark from the forefathers will spread and protect Bnei Yisrael wherever they dwell.

With G-d's Blessing
Rashi explains that the parsha of Vayechi is closed because, upon Yaakov’s death, the hearts and eyes of Yisrael were blocked due to the hardship of bondage. Another reason is that Yaakov wanted to reveal the end of days, but it was hidden from him. All life force, even in exile, comes from the Torah; it is just concealed. This parsha, marking the beginning of exile, is written in a closed fashion to hint at this hidden vitality.<br>The phrase "Yaakov lived in Mitzrayim" signifies that Yaakov was able to draw and connect to the life force even in the darkness of Mitzrayim. The Chidushei Harim taught that through the aspect of truth, one can live even in Mitzrayim, as it says, "You give truth to Yaakov." In exile, when clarity is lacking, we need emuna (faith) to reach emes (truth).<br>Yaakov wanted to reveal the end of days, representing the source of oneness, but this remains hidden in exile. On Shabbos, everything unites with the secret of oneness, elevating all souls to their source, especially Bnei Yisrael. This is why Shabbos is associated with the limitless inheritance of Yaakov. The Zohar teaches that while Yaakov couldn't openly reveal the end of days, he did so in a hidden manner. When Bnei Yisrael gather and nullify their will to Hashem's life force, they connect to Yaakov's spiritual place, as he did not die but continues to live through their seeking and devotion.
The Zohar (1:256:1) explains that the verse “Asher’s bread shall be rich” (Bereishis 49:20) refers to the double portion of bread on Shabbos, symbolizing both earthly bread and the heavenly manna. The 12 tribes are the foundation of the world, and Yaakov gave them the connection to the source of life force, represented by the word 'zot' (this). This point of divine kingship is the source of all life.<br>Asher, being the last of the tribes, serves as the final link in transmitting this life force from the Torah to all creation. During the weekdays, Bnei Yisrael prepare with great effort to merit the rest and blessing of Shabbos, as reflected in the double bread, which symbolizes both the inherent blessing of Shabbos and the reward for weekday toil.<br>This concept is akin to the relationship between Yissachar and Zevulun, where Zevulun's support enabled Yissachar to learn Torah. Though Yissachar's role in Torah study is crucial, Zevulun is mentioned first due to their sustaining role, mirroring how weekday efforts connect to and enhance the sanctity of Shabbos.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabba 96:1) explains that the parsha of Vayechi is closed because, upon Yaakov’s death, the eyes and hearts of Yisrael were blocked due to the hardship of bondage. Another reason is that Yaakov wanted to reveal the end of days, but it was hidden from him. This parsha, called "ויחי יעקב בא"מ" (“And Yaakov was alive in the land of Mitzrayim”), signifies that Yaakov could still be spiritually alive in Mitzrayim. The exile began only when Yaakov's life force was blocked. The Torah records the actions of the forefathers to ensure their legacy is remembered eternally. Although Yaakov's vitality was hidden to allow the exile to unfold, the physical bondage only began after Yosef's generation died. However, the spiritual exile of the mind preceded the physical one, starting when Yaakov died.<br>When Yaakov died, Yosef's brothers felt the onset of exile, fearing that selling Yosef had caused it. Yosef, who remained connected to Yaakov’s level of spiritual vitality, reassured them that everything was for the best, as the root of exile is redemption. Yaakov’s desire to reveal the end of days aimed to clarify that all hardships are merely hidden divine goodness, but this truth remained concealed to necessitate the exile. Nevertheless, Yaakov managed to reveal this truth in a hidden manner. There are two types of divine revelation: clear vision (אספקלריא המאירה), representing Yaakov’s emes (truth), and unclear vision (אספקלריא שאינה מאירה), representing emuna (faith). Though Yaakov couldn't reveal the truth clearly, he indicated that redemption can be accessed through emuna in the darkest times.<br>This concept is essential in exile, where Hashem prepares hidden lights that one can connect to through emuna, bringing about redemption. The Chidushei Harim taught that through the attribute of emes, any Jew can find vitality even in the greatest difficulties, as exemplified by Yaakov in Mitzrayim. Returning to Yosef and his brothers, they felt the exile starting and saw Yosef as the source of redemption. They feared their past actions against him had caused the exile. Yosef reassured them that Hashem had intended it all for good, to bring about the survival of many. Yosef, connected to redemption, did not feel the exile, and he cried when he saw his brothers already experiencing it.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabba 96:1) explains that Yaakov bestowed unity upon his sons. The phrase "This ‘zot’ is what he spoke unto them," interpreted by the Zohar as referring to the kingdom of heaven, symbolizes divine unity. Yaakov's blessing was for their actions to be guided by this oneness, the source of all blessings. After instilling this unity, Yaakov blessed each son individually.

The Midrash explains why this parsha is closed (Bereishis Rabba 96:1). It praises Yaakov's actions, highlighting that he remained spiritually alive in Mitzrayim, completely connected to Hashem, unaffected by its impurity. These 17 years in Mitzrayim prepared the way for the entire exile. The parsha is closed to us because we cannot comprehend how Yaakov drew holiness in such a place. If we understood this, there would be no exile. However, every Jew has the potential to awaken this life force anywhere, as it says, "He placed our soul in life" (Tehillim 67:9), meaning our soul is rooted in life and can awaken the divine in any situation.<br>The Midrash also states that Yaakov wanted to reveal the end of days but was blocked. This is likened to a confidant of a king who, upon seeing the king, refrains from revealing secrets and instead speaks of the king's honor. Yaakov wanted to show his children that Hashem's glory is present even in the depths of evil. However, Hashem did not want this revealed, as it would negate the purpose of exile. Hashem's revelation to Yaakov prevented him from revealing this secret, ensuring the exile could occur as intended.<br>Yaakov's characteristic was to place himself in dangerous situations, creating pathways for his descendants. He referenced this when blessing Menashe and Efraim, saying, "The angel who redeemed me from all bad," implying he ventured into dark places and was saved. Yaakov wanted to teach his children this path but was prevented from doing so, as this knowledge was meant to remain hidden.
The verse from Yaakov's blessing to Yehuda (Bereishis 49:11) states: "He tethers his ass to a vine, His ass’s foal to a choice vine; He washes his garment in wine, His robe in the blood of grapes." Our sages explain that Bnei Yisrael are likened to a vine that cannot be grafted with any other species, symbolizing the unique, unchangeable essence within every Jew, referred to as 'gefen' (vine). This intrinsic trait, instilled by Hashem, is the core of Jewish identity.<br>Yaakov's blessing emphasizes the mission of connecting all personal awakenings to this core essence. "He tethers his ass to a vine" means subjugating the physical body (represented by the ass) to the soul (the vine). Similarly, one's traits should be refined according to the Torah, not for personal wisdom, but to become a vessel for serving Hashem. The Torah dwells in a perfected body, and actions aligned with its teachings endure forever.<br>The phrase "his ass’s foal to a choice vine" further symbolizes strength, as the word אֲתֹנ֑וֹ (ass’s foal) is linked to איתן (eitan), meaning strong. The Torah is called 'oz' (strength), indicating that actions done for the sake of Torah have lasting strength. "He washes his clothes in wine" signifies the purification of physical actions, which serve as adornments to the body when performed with purity.

The Midrash (Tanchuma Vayechi 2:1) describes life as fleeting, comparing it to a shadow. The main idea of days is spiritual light, which manifests in physical time. This concept is reflected in the phrase "He constantly renews in His goodness the creation of the world," indicating that Hashem continuously renews these lights. However, these lights in the physical realm are like shadows of the superior, spiritual days. Yaakov Avinu perfected himself to the extent that he uplifted his days to Hashem, as the Zohar (1:621:2) states about his death: "the days of Yisrael’s death grew near," meaning he brought his days closer to Hashem.<br>Yaakov's ability to remain spiritually alive even in Mitzrayim, the darkest of places, demonstrated his connection to the divine source of light. This is why the parsha is blocked; it signifies that Yaakov's life force was hidden to allow the exile to occur. The Medrash also explains that Yaakov wanted to reveal the end of days to his children but was prevented by Hashem. This is likened to a king's confidant who, upon seeing the king, refrains from revealing secrets. Yaakov, who was above nature, had the power to hide the life force in Mitzrayim and wanted to teach his children how to find the divine light even in darkness.<br>Yaakov's mission was to guide his children through the exile. He called Yosef to pass on his spiritual energy, as Yosef was able to connect the brothers to Yaakov's power. This is why Yaakov said, "Gather together, and I will tell you what will be at the end of days," emphasizing unity and the power of oneness. This oneness is also the secret of Shabbos, where everything becomes unified. The emphasis on keeping Shabbos is that it embodies this oneness, leading to redemption. Yosef's role in revealing the sign of redemption, "פְּקוֹד יִפְקֹד," further illustrates this connection.
The pasuk states, "And he blesses Yosef saying, the angel who redeemed me, shall protect the lads, and they will multiply like the fish." The question arises: what blessing did Yaakov give Yosef, as it seems directed only at Menashe and Efraim? The explanation is that Yaakov blessed Yosef with the ability to spread his own power. The source of life force comes from Yosef, but when this blessing descends into the lower worlds, it requires protection. In exile, due to the dominance of negative forces, holiness cannot be readily revealed. This is why marital relations are forbidden during years of famine, as the negative forces hinder the spread of holiness.<br>The solution in exile is through the Torah, which is compared to water. As fish are protected from the evil eye by the sea, so too can people be shielded by the Torah. The Midrash explains that just as fish eagerly await drops of water, Bnei Yisrael eagerly await the Torah. The more one longs for Torah, the more it protects them. Rashi in Bereishis notes that fish were given an extra blessing because they are constantly fished, indicating that Yosef needed an extra blessing for similar reasons.<br>This concept parallels Shabbos, which is the source of blessing for the days of the week. Just as Shabbos requires extra protection, so does Yosef’s blessing. This is why we ask for Hashem’s "sukkah of peace" on Shabbos. Therefore, "And he blessed Yosef...they should multiply like the fish" signifies the spreading of Yosef’s power, protected and flourishing even in challenging times. The blessing to Yosef ensured that his spiritual influence would extend and endure, safeguarded by the Torah’s protective power.
The pasuk states, "And Yosef’s brothers saw that Yaakov their father had died, and they were worried, perhaps Yosef will hate us and pay us back for all the wrong that we have done to him" (Bereishis 50:15). This raises a question: knowing Yosef was righteous, why would they suspect him of hating them?<br>The brothers had deeply repented for selling Yosef and believed their actions caused the exile to Mitzrayim. Despite the exile being part of a divine plan, they thought it was their fault, leading them to fear Yosef's resentment. Yosef reassured them, saying, “You thought you were doing me harm, but Hashem intended it for good.” Their sincere repentance had transformed their sins into merits, and Hashem had turned their actions into something positive.

The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 96:1) explains two reasons why the parsha of Vayechi is “stuma” (blocked). One reason is that Yaakov's eyes were blocked because he wanted to reveal the end of days to his children, but it was hidden from him. The second reason is that all the suffering he had previously experienced was now blocked off, allowing him to spend his final years in harmony.<br>The explanation is that the “inheritance of Yaakov is without borders,” meaning that as long as Yaakov was not “blocked,” the exile could not begin. Once his “eyes became blocked” and he could not reveal the end of days, the exile was able to start. Similarly, because Yaakov lived his last years in peace, the exile began. Had he suffered during those years in Mitzrayim, there would have been no need for further exile. Hashem had mercy on Yaakov and did not allow him to suffer more, leading to the subsequent period of exile.<br>The pasuk “And Yaakov lived in the land of Mitzrayim” serves as a testimony for all generations that Yaakov's life force can be found in any time of difficulty, though it may be hidden. On Shabbos, when we merit the inheritance of Yaakov, there is an awakening of redemption. Yaakov’s instruction to his children to “gather together” emphasizes the importance of unity, which awakens Yaakov’s energy and the redemption. The two expressions of gathering, הקבצו and האספו, represent the concepts of Yosef and Yehuda, corresponding to Mashiach ben Yosef and Mashiach ben David. Our sages taught that if Bnei Yisrael kept two Shabbats, they would be redeemed, reflecting the dual aspects of Shabbos: one as a gift (Yosef) and one achieved through toil (Yehuda). Additionally, this unity includes Binyamin, as hinted in the Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 98:2), where Yaakov instructed his children to respect Yehuda and Binyamin. This unity and effort lead to lasting redemption.
The Gemara explains that Yosef is called עלי עין because he controlled his eyes, sanctifying what he saw. Consequently, in Shilo, part of Yosef's land, offerings of lesser sanctity and the second tithe could be eaten from any place that had a view of Shilo. This extended "view" was a merit of Yosef's sanctification, as explained by the Chidushei Harim. Yosef's guarded vision sanctified even areas outside Yerushalayim, aligning with the teaching that "even an iron fence cannot disrupt Bnei Yisrael from their Father in Heaven." The reciprocal love between Bnei Yisrael and Hashem nullifies all barriers.<br>The phrase “בנות צעדה עלי שור” (the girls climbed upon the walls) implies that the sanctity extended the walls of Yerushalayim to the furthest point visible from Yosef’s territory. This is akin to Tehillim (104:3), “The sea saw and fled,” where the sea parted upon seeing Yosef’s coffin, a reward for Yosef’s fleeing from Potiphar’s wife. Yosef's exceptional self-control merited nature's change in his honor, similarly causing the walls to "flee" and extend due to Yosef's sanctified vision.

Our sages explained that this parsha is “blocked” (Bereishis Rabbah 96:1). The meaning of a parsha is to reveal and explain the light of the Torah that can be understood by man. However, there are explanations that are hidden and those that are revealed. The Zohar states, “Yaakov revealed what he indeed wanted to reveal” (Zohar 1:234b). As long as Yaakov was alive, his inner light overcame the darkness and hiddenness, but when he died, this light became concealed.<br>Yaakov's descent to Mitzrayim was a preparation for the coming exile. The pasuk states, “And Yaakov lived in the land of Mitzrayim” (47:28), indicating that by “living” in Mitzrayim, Yaakov placed and hid the light of holiness and the life force there. This light could be found in Mitzrayim but was hidden. In all exiles, this point of life force exists, but it is only through nullification to the inner pnimius that one can find this inner point, which is the secret of redemption. Yaakov's instruction to “gather together” means that through unity and nullification, one can awaken Yaakov's life force even in the darkness.<br>On Shabbos, when everything unites with the secret of oneness, the redemption is awakened, as it states, “in the merit of Shabbos we are redeemed.” The Chidushei Harim explained that through the trait of truth, one can awaken this life force in difficult times, as the pasuk states, “And Yaakov lived,” representing the trait of truth (Micha 7:20). However, truth is also hidden in exile, and the way to reach it is through emuna, which serves as the opening to truth. The hiddenness exists to purify the quality of emuna, and when truth is fully revealed, emuna is no longer needed. Thus, the source of hiddenness is emuna, and through emuna, there is an opening for redemption.

As Rashi quotes from the Midrash, the parsha of Vayechi is “blocked” because when Yaakov died, the eyes and hearts of Yisrael became blocked. The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 1:4) teaches that the world's creation was for Bnei Yisrael, who are its purpose. The forefathers are like the brain and head of Yisrael, with their influence flowing down through the generations. While the brain affects the whole body, its impact is strongest in the head and less so in the lower parts, mirroring how the forefathers' influence diminishes over time, culminating in our era, the “heel of Mashiach.”<br>After the exile from Mitzrayim, Bnei Yisrael reached high levels, though later generations experienced fluctuations. In Mitzrayim, the neshama's life force was imprisoned, marking the first stage of the brain affecting the body. This is why we must always remember the exodus, as it was the beginning of Yisrael's perfection. The Midrash (Mechilta Beshalach 2:6) likens this to a fetus being born, highlighting its foundational importance in Yisrael's development.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 97:3) compares redemption to sustenance, stating that just as redemption comes from Hashem, so too does sustenance, even more directly. Yaakov endowed his children with the ability to connect to a source above nature. Just as redemption is miraculous, one must recognize that sustenance is also miraculous and comes directly from Hashem's provision. The Gemara (Shabbos 107b) notes that Hashem sustains the entire world, from the horns of wild oxen to the eggs of lice. Similarly, the phrase “He gives bread to all the living” is in the present tense, indicating continuous provision.<br>Yaakov's blessing to Yosef underscores this concept, as Yosef symbolizes the ability to draw blessings and connect them to their divine source. This is why the pasuk states, “He blessed each one according to their blessing.” The explicit term "blessing" is only mentioned with Yosef because he is the source of blessing, and through him, all the brothers received their individual blessings. When one is truly connected to the inner point of the neshama, there is an added blessing to that point. This is akin to the idea of “Drink water from your pit” and then “From your well,” emphasizing the importance of connecting to one's inner source for true blessing.

Section 11

5641
With G-d's Blessing
We have explained elsewhere (Vayechi תרל"ט) that when the pasuk states "Vayechi Yaakov," and Yaakov lived in Mitzrayim, it refers to a hidden effect of holiness that Yaakov left there. This is why the parsha is called “blocked,” as the lights found in exile are hidden but can be accessed by anyone who nullifies themselves to the klal (all of Bnei Yisrael). This concept is highlighted in Yaakov’s instruction to “gather together,” which is especially auspicious on Shabbos. The Gemara (Shabbos 118a) states that on Shabbos, we merit to receive the limitless inheritance of Yaakov.<br>The Midrash states that redemption is juxtaposed to sustenance, both occurring daily. Yaakov ensured that a life energy remains, allowing every Jew to find the light of holiness even in the darkness of exile. This is the essence of Krias Shma and prayer, “Shma Yisrael,” where through nullification to the klal, one finds this life force. The Chidushei Harim explained that through seeking Hashem, one finds life. When Yaakov died, the brothers feared the loss of this light, but Yosef, being on a higher level, remained connected to Yaakov's life force. This is why they sought Yosef, who had accepted the responsibility of standing in Yaakov’s place, allowing Yaakov to be buried in the cave of Machpela. Yaakov's bowing to Yosef and giving him a "שכם אחד" (shoulder above his brothers) signifies Yosef’s elevated status among the tribes.
The pasuk states, "And you will be doing me a true kindness." Our sages teach that burying someone who died outside Eretz Yisrael in Eretz Yisrael brings impurity, as it is considered a sin. However, this did not apply to Yaakov, who remained spiritually connected to Eretz Yisrael even in Mitzrayim. Therefore, it is called a “true kindness” because Yosef understood that Yaakov genuinely belonged in Eretz Yisrael, despite passing away in Mitzrayim.

Section 12

5642
With G-d's Blessing
Gather together, and I will tell you, assemble and listen. (Bereishis 49:1-2) There are two types of gatherings. One is to awaken the power of influence, represented by Yosef the tzadik. This aspect was realized by them, preparing them correctly for the exile. The second type is to be ready to receive, symbolized by Binyamin. This aspect was not yet perfected. Therefore, the revelation of the final redemption was hidden from Yaakov, as it marked the beginning of the exile. The primary exile is the inability to unite the hearts of Bnei Yisrael as one, which we pray for in the blessing of redemption, "and gather in our exiles." On Shabbos, when everything becomes unified, there is an awakening of redemption.<br>The phrase "And Yaakov lived in the land of Mitzrayim" means that Hashem provided healing before the punishment. Yaakov saw the benefit of the exile in Mitzrayim, as Hashem told Avraham, "And afterwards, they will leave with a great inheritance." In Mitzrayim, we were formed into a nation, likened by our sages to a baby being born from an iron furnace (Devarim 4:20). This is the secret of the end of days that Yaakov wanted to reveal. This was also known to Yosef, which is why he cried when the brothers spoke to him. The brothers were concerned, feeling the darkness of the exile and Yaakov's death. They feared they had caused his demise, believing Yaakov had perfected everything and would not be subject to death. However, our sages explained that "Yaakov did not die" (Ta’anis 5b). Yosef reassured them that Yaakov brought the light of life into Mitzrayim to sustain a great nation.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 20:9) states, “that shepherds me, that redeems me.” Sustenance is compared to redemption; both are daily and miraculous. This comparison reveals that redemption involves recognizing daily renewal in nature, as stated, “Who renews creation every day.” Similarly, the effort one puts into earning sustenance is also miraculous. There are open miracles and hidden miracles within nature. The wise will understand that just as Hashem renews nature every day, new redemptions are revealed daily in the hearts of those who serve Him. When this sense of renewal is present, exile ceases to exist. This concept is reflected in the daily blessings before the Shema, which focus on the renewal of light and darkness (representing nature) and the Torah and mitzvot (representing inner spiritual renewal). The first blessing is about the natural world created through the ten utterances, and the second is about the inner life force renewed through the ten commandments.<br>This process is unique to Bnei Yisrael. After these two blessings, we reach the unification expressed in the Shema. This is hinted at in the verse “He shall bless the lads,” signifying the daily renewal represented by Ephraim (internal life force) and Menashe (renewal of creation). Ephraim precedes Menashe because, although we first need to repair nature, everything ultimately aligns with the Torah. <br>The two elements of renewal, form and substance, stem from the original act of creation. This concept is further illustrated by Yosef, who represents unity and from whom these two elements derive. The exile in Mitzrayim only began after Yosef's death when Menashe and Ephraim took his place, marking the start of feeling the exile.
All these were the tribes of Israel, twelve in number, and this is what their father said to them, he blessed them, each man according to his blessing, he blessed them. (Bereishis 49:28) The form of Yaakov was carved under the throne of Hashem, resembling Adam, whom Hashem created. Yaakov's form below mirrored his form Above, as he was drawn to his divine source. Encompassing all of Bnei Yisrael, he was aptly named Yisrael. This is hinted at in "each man according to his blessing," signifying that Yaakov was a man on earth reflecting his divine source.<br>The pasuk testifies that Yaakov could bless his children because the essence of a blessing is to draw from the divine source to the earthly form. Yaakov provided each son with a specific place and connection to him, as indicated by "This is what their father said to them." The word דיבור (speech) implies leadership, as in "He leads nations," showing that Yaakov guided his children, being their source.

“All these are the tribes of Yisrael, twelve in number, and this is what their father said to them, he blessed them, each man according to his blessing, he blessed them.” (Bereishis 49:28) The Sfas Emes is puzzled by the seemingly extra word "כל" (all). The tribes represent the extension of the forefathers, akin to the 13 principles used to expound the Torah. The essence of the Torah is beyond human comprehension, much like the elevated status of the forefathers, who serve as the divine chariot. The 12 tribes act as vessels that contain and limit the divine light of the Torah, making it accessible. Yaakov, embodying the Torah, has children who disseminate its teachings.<br>The word "כל" (all) signifies "only" and implies measurement (Yeshaya 40:12) and yearning (Tehillim 143:7). The tribes, similar to the forefathers, are vessels that limit and contain the divine light through their yearning to receive the forefathers' influence. This longing facilitates the Torah's "limitation" and "measures," represented by the 13 principles for expounding the Torah.<br>Thus, "all these are the tribes of Yisrael" indicates that through their yearning and containment, Yaakov could bless them and impart the Torah's teachings, each according to his blessing.

Section 14

“Gather together and I will tell you...unite and hear” (Bereishis 49:1-2). There are two types of gatherings: one represented by Yosef, which brings down blessings from Above, and the other by Yehuda, representing the ultimate Mashiach ben David, which comes from the energy of the receiver. The pasuk in Tehillim (103:20) teaches us that Bnei Yisrael awaken Hashem's words and then are prepared to hear them. These elements remain with us daily, as reflected in the Shma and in prayer, which requires heartfelt effort.<br>Our forefathers and the children of Yaakov are the foundations of the world, having planted deep roots for us. Their actions were purposeful, as seen in the pasuk: “These are all the tribes of Yisrael and he blessed them,” meaning he connected them to their divine source. The phrase “and he blessed them” refers to their connection above nature, with Yosef being the explicit vessel of blessing—Shalom. This is hinted at in the pasuk, where Yosef's blessings are mentioned twelve times, paralleling the twelve tribes. Yosef received the collective blessing of his brothers, as detailed in Yaakov’s blessing to him, indicating that Yosef's role was to distribute the blessings to the other tribes.<br>In Shir HaShirim (8:6), various elements symbolize the forefathers: “Love” refers to Avraham, “as fierce as death” to Yitzchak, “darts of fire” to Yaakov, and “a blazing flame” to Yosef. These foundational traits are deeply embedded in Bnei Yisrael. Therefore, the verse continues: "Vast waters cannot extinguish the love," signifying the enduring nature of their spiritual legacy.
This parsha is “blocked” because the eyes and hearts of Yisrael were blocked during the exile. Just as their eyes and hearts were blocked, so too the parsha is blocked. Hashem told Yaakov, “I will go down with you to Mitzrayim” and “I am with you in your suffering.” The exile is not just about punishment but follows a specific order, just as the exodus does. The Zohar states that the Torah, Yisrael, and Hashem are one, meaning that just as Hashem's name and the Torah are both revealed and hidden, so too are the souls of Yisrael.<br>In the time of the Beis Hamikdash, there was revelation both Above and below; in exile, everything is blocked. Bnei Yisrael are praised for having both elements: “I am blackened” in exile “and beautiful” in redemption. We are called “A locked garden,” referring to our ability to remain distinct and not assimilate even when among other nations. This is also symbolized by “Like a rose among the thorns” and “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest.” When Bnei Yisrael are in exile, Hashem is also, so to speak, hidden. However, knowing the secret of hidden and revealed gives us strength in exile, as we maintain our emuna even in difficult times.<br>The concept of “a locked garden… a locked fountain” refers to the hidden (heart) and revealed (eye) aspects being blocked in exile. The eyes and heart are central, as stated in the Shema, “do not follow your heart and your eyes,” because they have the most holiness and therefore the most blockages. Tefillin represent these two elements: the tefillin of the hand, placed by the heart, and the tefillin of the head, placed “between your eyes.” Yehuda represents the tefillin of the hand, as it states, “Your hand is at the neck of your enemy,” while Yosef represents the tefillin of the head, as it states, “The head of Yosef” and “above the eye.”
"And Yaakov called his sons” signifies bringing them closer, as seen with the angels who call to each other. It also implies appointment, as in “Hashem called the light ‘day’,” meaning He assigned its role. Yaakov gave each tribe its specific role and showed each one its place and connection to him. Just as Yaakov's form was engraved below the Heavenly throne, giving existence to creation, the tribes served as the world's pillars. The tribes are referred to as “the eyes of man,” representing the form of Yaakov and by extension, Adam, with the tribes as branches of this tree.<br>The pasuk states, “And so וזאת he spoke to them and blessed them.” The blessing given was the attribute of וזאת, symbolizing Malchut Shamayim (the Kingdom of Heaven). By connecting them to וזאת, they merited the blessing of וזאת הברכה. This is reflected in the Midrash, where Moshe continued from where Yaakov left off. The phrase וזאת אשר דיבר indicates appointment to the concept of Malchut Shamayim, and the blessing was through this וזאת.<br>When Yaakov blessed Yosef’s children, he said, “bring them to me and I will bless them,” meaning that by bringing them closer, they would automatically be blessed. Similarly, when one's soul is elevated and connected to its source, it receives blessings. This concept is also seen in the blessing of Shabbos: “He blessed the seventh day.” Shabbos uplifts and brings all of creation closer to their source, resulting in automatic blessings.

Before Yaakov’s death, he gathered his children and said, “Gather together… and I will tell you what will happen at the end of days” (Bereishis 49:1). Our sages explain that Yaakov was preparing them for the upcoming exiles and wanted to reveal the end of days. The 12 tribes are the pillars on which Bnei Yisrael relies during exile, while the three forefathers (Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov) are above this “world of separation.” The tribes, however, continue until the end of days. Yaakov’s command to “Gather together and unite” implies they exist in this world of separation, similar to Haman’s criticism that Bnei Yisrael are “separated and spread out among the nations” (Esther 3:8). This separation is about revealing Hashem’s oneness in a world that appears divided.<br>The Midrash explains that the four flags of the tribes correspond to uprooting the four exiles. The four rivers flowing from Gan Eden represent the four kingdoms of exile, not as wicked entities but as channels extending from Gan Eden to the world of separation. The 12 tribes are the borders for the nations, with the forefathers in Gan Eden forever and the tribes ascending and descending to uplift the lower realms. This is hinted at when Yaakov said “What will happen to you in the end of days,” indicating that the tribes will endure till the end of generations. It is with the merit of these tribes that we plead “In anger, remember the love,” referring to the love the tribes have for Hashem. This love is symbolized by the names of the tribes inscribed on Aharon’s breastplate as a remembrance before Hashem.<br>The forefathers and the tribes are vessels prepared by Hashem to sustain the world's existence. Bnei Yisrael, following the path of the forefathers, must strengthen themselves in the merit of their roots, as stated in Tehillim 29:1, “Give praise to Hashem, the sons of the mighty.” The relationship between Hashem and Bnei Yisrael is both as a Father and a King. Through the Torah, Bnei Yisrael comprehend Hashem’s ownership of the world, reflecting the forefathers' understanding. The concept of Hashem’s Kingdom is to fight those who rebel against His rule, which will be fully revealed in the future. Bnei Yisrael are sent into a world of separation to testify to the Yoke of Heaven’s Kingdom. The 12 tribes and their flags symbolize fighting Hashem’s battles, with Bnei Yisrael ultimately repairing everything as both a “son” and a “servant,” embodying the missions of the forefathers and the tribes.
Yaakov blesses Yosef (Bereishis 49:22): “Yosef is a graceful son, whose eyes overcome the wall. The girls stepped over the walls.” The Chidushei Harim explained, based on the Gemara (Zevachim 118b), that since Yosef sanctified his eyes by not looking at forbidden things, he merited the privilege for Bnei Yisrael to eat sanctified food within eyesight in Shilo, whereas in Yerushalayim, it had to be within the walls. This is the meaning of “the girls stepped on the walls” (referring to the other tribes) while “Yosef was above the walls.”<br>The phrase פורת עלי עין (“a wild ass by the water”) can be understood as Hashem telling Yaakov that Yosef will protect him. Yaakov's form is engraved below Hashem’s holy throne, symbolizing the divine form in the world. This form, known as the “eye of Yaakov,” is always present within Bnei Yisrael, as it states, “All that see them will recognize them.” However, the world is not ready for this revelation among the wicked. When Bnei Yisrael gathered at the Beis Hamikdash, separated from the nations, this form was placed upon them, especially during the three pilgrimage festivals when all males ascended to the Beis Hamikdash. The Mishkan and Beis Hamikdash served as protective walls, separating Bnei Yisrael from the nations, allowing them to connect to the form of Yaakov. This is what Yaakov hinted at when he said, “Gather and I will tell you the end of days.”<br>Yosef had a unique power that protected him from the negative eye (ayin hara). As our sages explained, his blessing, “They will multiply like the fish in the sea,” signifies protection from ayin hara. Yosef could attain high levels of holiness even among the wicked and prepared the place for Bnei Yisrael in Mitzrayim. Yaakov was concerned about descending to Mitzrayim, fearing the negative eye of the wicked. Hashem assured him that “Yosef will place his hand on your eyes,” meaning Yosef would provide protection even in dark places. This is the essence of פורת עלי עין, signifying two types of service: the tribes created impenetrable walls, while Yosef blinded the eyes of the wicked, preventing them from obstructing the light of the tzadikim. On Shabbos, we experience a partial fulfillment of Yosef’s blessings, as Hashem spreads the Sukkah of Shalom upon us, giving us the “eye of Yaakov” and the extra neshama, reflecting a unique light and protection.

With G-d's Blessing
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 96:1) explains that this parsha is "closed" because, from this time, the eyes and hearts of Yisrael became blocked due to the difficulty of the exile. Another explanation is that Yaakov wanted to reveal the end of days, but it was hidden from him. Although there was no actual servitude to the Egyptians during the lifetime of the 12 tribes, they already felt the exile internally in their service to Hashem—symbolized by the "eyes and the heart," represented by the Tefilin of the head and arm. The Tefilin of the arm represent a bodily connection to Hashem, tied next to the heart, while the Tefilin of the head represent the connection of the mind, symbolizing neshamos.<br>This is the idea behind "האספו התקבצו" – gather together and unite. If the tribes had gathered and united properly, Yaakov would have revealed the end of days. The 12 tribes are the light spreading from the forefathers until the end of generations. Yaakov organized them, commanding how they should carry his body and march in the midbar, each according to his responsibility, uniting them for all future generations. The 12 tribes are referred to as "Mighty in power, those who do His will," representing action, while the forefathers are the source higher than action, being the "chariot" for Hashem's resting place.<br>This is the idea of אור (everlasting light) and נר מצוה (the candle of mitzvot), spreading the light of the Torah into the vessels symbolized by the 613 mitzvot. This concept is hinted at in Bereishis 49:33, "And Yaakov completed instructing his sons, and gathered his legs," implying that he connected them to him, like lighting a candle from a fire, placing his power in them.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 97:3) links Yaakov’s words, "The angel that protects me… that guards me," to sustenance and redemption, suggesting both are daily needs. Our prayers reflect this: "He renews through His goodness, the creation every day." In exile, daily redemption is crucial to combat constant challenges, as noted in the Gemara (Sukkah 52a).<br>Yaakov’s precedence of Efraim over Menashe mirrors the order of sustenance before redemption. Menashe signifies redemption ("Hashem has repaid me for all my toil"), while Efraim represents multiplication and sustenance. The Chidushei Harim explains this as "turn from evil" and "do good." Yosef first turned from evil, but Yaakov allowed for Hashem to open our hearts to Torah even if imperfect. Thus, sustenance (Efraim) precedes redemption (Menashe), enabling enlightenment and the ability to turn from evil.<br>Sustenance includes daily spiritual renewal, and redemption is a continuous process, combating daily struggles. Our prayers use the present tense "Gaal Yisrael" (Redeemer of Israel) to indicate this ongoing need. The order of sustenance before redemption highlights the importance of daily spiritual nourishment for achieving ultimate redemption.
In Bereishis 49:5-6, Yaakov says, "Shimon and Levi are brothers; in their 'secret,' my soul should not enter." Rashi explains this refers to the incident where the tribe of Shimon confronted Moshe about his marriage to a Midianite woman. Why did Rashi highlight this seemingly negative behavior? Since it is called a "secret," it suggests that Shimon and Levi did not approach Moshe brazenly, like wicked people. Instead, they aimed to elevate negative forces to holiness, similar to Moshe's actions. However, not everyone can claim such a right.<br>Shimon and Levi had the power to elevate everything to holiness. This is why they are called אחים, connected to the idea of “אחות לנו קטנה" (we have a young sister), which means to bind and connect (Midrash Lech Lecha, Bereishis Rabbah 39:3). However, this power needed to come from all of Klal Yisrael. Therefore, Yaakov spread them out among the nation, and this power remained with the tribe of Levi and Moshe, who led the entire nation.<br>Perhaps through the sale of Yosef, instigated by Shimon and Levi, they compromised this ability. Yaakov said, "Through their anger, they killed an ox (Yosef)." Despite this, Yaakov's words to the tribes were blessings, as stated, "And Yaakov blessed them," each according to his mission. By spreading Shimon and Levi among Klal Yisrael, Yaakov ensured they could influence the entire nation and fulfill their mission properly.

Bnei Yisrael are compared to stars, each known by name to show Hashem’s love for them (Rashi Shmot 1:1). This teaches that each person is part of Hashem’s army, meant to bring light even in darkness, like in Mitzrayim. Just as an angel’s name reflects its mission, Bnei Yisrael’s names represent their divine mission. Unlike angels, Bnei Yisrael must maintain their purity despite worldly challenges. Their names were mentioned before and after exile to signify that despite the hardships, they remained unchanged.
The term "each person and their house" (Bereishis 1:1) symbolizes the extensions and dependencies of a person. Bnei Yisrael, who draw life force to the entire world and their future generations, are called "Beit Yisrael" (House of Yisrael). Even in exile, they could connect to the source of life from the holy forefathers and tribes. This connection was a preparation for exile, ensuring that, despite the absence of servitude while Yaakov’s children lived, their strength was linked to Beit Yisrael, aiding their survival during difficult times.
Hashem appeared to Moshe in a flame, symbolizing the inner life force of Yisrael that remains connected to Hashem, though hidden in exile. The Zohar explains Hashem's name "Ehyeh" as indicating that while currently hidden, it will be revealed. This is reflected in the translation of "I will go through Mitzrayim" as "I will be revealed." Redemption comes through connecting to this inner point, represented by Yosef. The servitude began when Pharaoh "did not know Yosef" (Shmot 1:8), signifying a loss of unity among Bnei Yisrael.<br>Moshe’s words, "Now the matter is known" (Shmot 2:14), indicate that the exile was not merely a punishment but a mission to reveal hidden lights in darkness, likened to stars illuminating the night. The Ohr HaChaim (Shmot 1:1) describes this descent into Mitzrayim as an expression of Hashem's love. Moshe initially could not understand why Mitzrayim could subjugate Bnei Yisrael until he saw their disunity, realizing that the lack of unity and the presence of tale-bearers among them—symbolized by not knowing Yosef—made them susceptible to subjugation.
In the Midrash (Shmot Rabbah 15:14), Moshe questions, "Who am I to take Bnei Yisrael out of Mitzrayim?" Hashem reassures him, saying He Himself will redeem Bnei Yisrael, promising, “I will go down and save them.” This raises the question of what Hashem's response means regarding Moshe's humility and concerns.<br>Moshe's humility led him to seek confirmation that the redemption would be entirely Hashem's doing, fearing that his involvement as a mere human might cause harm. Hashem's promise, “I will be with you,” along with the statement, “Did I not give the power of speech to man?” clarified that Moshe would act as Hashem's messenger, ensuring the actions were Hashem's own. This concept of a messenger being as the sender himself (שליח ש"א כמותו) reassured Moshe.<br>This profound humility may have led Moshe to become the most humble man on earth, as he sought complete nullification of self. Consequently, Hashem's promise, “I will go down and save them,” was fulfilled through Moshe's role as His faithful messenger.

Section 3

5633
The Midrash (Shmot Rabbah 1:3) compares Bnei Yisrael to stars, created to illuminate the world's darkness as stars light up the night. This symbolism extends to the concept of "names," which recall the essence of a person or thing. Hashem’s Name, similarly, is recognized through His miraculous deeds and the unification of His name by Bnei Yisrael, making His glory known in this world. These divine acts, like the exodus from Mitzrayim, are distant from His essence and hence are referred to as "names."<br>Bnei Yisrael's exile was only in their "name," as stated, “You called our names like your name,” meaning they retained their identity as Bnei Yisrael. Their unity could awaken and connect to Hashem’s Name. However, in exile, this connection to the source was lost, which constituted the essence of the exile. The Midrash explains that Bnei Yisrael were redeemed because they did not change their names, signifying that the core of redemption was maintaining their original identity.<br>Moshe's query to Hashem about what to tell Bnei Yisrael when they ask, "What is His name?" reflects their disconnection from Hashem's Name during exile. Hashem’s response, revealing the name "Ehyeh," signifies that through their desire and will to emerge from darkness and reconnect with Hashem—an act of teshuva—they can find their place. This desire becomes their connection point, fulfilling the essence of redemption.
Moshe’s concern, “And they will not believe me,” arises because the exile from Mitzrayim is the root of all exiles, and its redemption prepares for all future redemptions, which we recall daily. Thus, Moshe requested Hashem redeem Bnei Yisrael despite their lack of faith. He understood this from Hashem’s words, “Ehyeh in other exiles,” showing that all future difficulties are tied to this foundational redemption.

Section 7

Rashi (Shmot 1:1) explains that Bnei Yisrael are recounted in the beginning of this parsha to demonstrate Hashem’s love, comparing them to stars called by name. This recounting as they enter exile shows that their descent wasn't due to hatred but love, akin to a father disciplining a beloved son (Mishlei 13:24). The Midrash (Shmot Rabbah 1:1) further explains that their names are tied to redemption, as Hashem sends the light of redemption with them into exile, always preparing the remedy before the affliction.<br>Each star and angel, given a name by Hashem, has a unique mission, reflecting the connection to their source and enabling them to fulfill their roles. This is analogous to Bnei Yisrael, each having a unique name and mission. The word "calling" (קריאה) denotes endearment and connection, emphasizing that Hashem’s glorified name encompasses all missions. Each person’s unique name signifies their role, and completing their mission completes their name, with these names helping them achieve their purpose.<br>The pasuk "These are the names of Yisrael that are coming to Mitzrayim" teaches that even in exile or difficulty, Hashem has not forsaken them. The term "coming" (הבאים) implies that Hashem's connection accompanies them into any strait, suggesting that even their names experience exile. This connection ensures their salvation. Before the exile, Bnei Yisrael were connected to their divine source, like stars receiving their mission, emphasizing the importance of their unique roles in Hashem's plan.
When Hashem appears to Moshe at the burning bush, Moshe expresses concern that Bnei Yisrael will not believe him. Hashem's response, "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh," implies that He will be with Bnei Yisrael in this and future exiles. Moshe's request was for redemption even when faith is lacking, like in our current exile. Hashem performed miracles to demonstrate His presence in all exiles, not just Mitzrayim. <br>Moshe, the root of all prophets and righteous leaders, questioned his role because he foresaw that he would not complete the redemption by entering Eretz Yisrael and that Bnei Yisrael could not maintain his spiritual level, as shown by the sin of the Golden Calf. Therefore, he suggested sending Aharon. Hashem reassured Moshe by showing him the giving of the Torah, indicating that at that moment, Bnei Yisrael would reach Moshe's level. Although they later sinned, having once attained this level meant they could return to it after proper repentance.<br>Ultimately, through Moshe, we will achieve the final tikun (reparation). This explains Moshe's concerns and Hashem's assurances, highlighting Moshe's role and the enduring significance of his leadership for all generations.
Moshe returns to Hashem after Pharaoh's harsh decree and asks, “Why have You treated Bnei Yisrael so harshly, and why did You send me?” Moshe felt responsible, believing that his involvement as the messenger caused their suffering. This sentiment was rooted in the fact that Moshe personified the pure Torah and divine judgment, a level of absolute perfection difficult for most to attain.<br>Our sages explain that Hashem initially wanted to create the world with strict judgment but saw it couldn't endure without mercy. Similarly, during the exodus, Bnei Yisrael couldn't maintain the level of judgment alone, necessitating Aharon's involvement, representing mercy, to ease their redemption. To exact retribution on the nations, Bnei Yisrael needed to rectify their actions. However, at that time, they were not sufficiently meritorious, and the divine judgment was upon them. Had they accepted their suffering with love, it would have rectified everything.<br>Moshe, attributing the situation to his own perceived shortcomings, returned to Hashem in a form of teshuva, thereby sweetening the harsh judgment and combining it with mercy. As the tzadik of the generation, Moshe had to repent for the entire nation, embodying the principle that all of Bnei Yisrael are responsible for one another. This act of returning to Hashem was Moshe's way of fulfilling this responsibility.

Section 1

In the midrash (Shemot Rabbah 5:6) " and I turned to see… that which he already did…” (Ecclesiastes 2:12). For a person should know that every action affects his essence in a place so high that a person’s understanding cannot reach there at all. And because of this, it is necessary that all the intellect and all the desires are nullified to the will of Hashem. Similarly, I heard from my father, my master, my teacher and mentor, the righteous one who should be remembered for life in the World to Come, about what the midrash says, that if Reuven had known that the Torah had written about him “in order to save him” (Genesis 37:22), he would have carried Yosef on his shoulders back to his father (Rus Rabbah 5:6, Vayikra Rabbah 34:8). God forbid that he would have done this because of the honor that the verse would attest to him, but if he had known that the matter affected so much that the verse would write… Until here are the words of my father.  And every action of a person is already decreed in heaven. And that is what the verse means, “that which he already did” (Ecclesiastes 2:12). Because on high, every action that a person will do is already decreed before Hashem; if so, it is not pertinent to question Him. And certainly it seemed obvious to King Solomon that his heart would not be led astray. But a person's actions affect that which is above his ability to understand. And consequently, there can be a change in the essence of a person. And if so, a person cannot know this at all. And it is written (Shemot Rabbah 5:6) that the letter yud in the word “yirbeh” (increase) went up before Hashem and said, Solomon is nullifying me! And is it true that someone who performs a sin nullifies a letter? But certainly through sin a person is cut off from clinging. But King Solomon knew that through the power of the Torah that was in him and the life force of Hashem which he was connected to without separation, he said “I will increase and not be led astray [and that's what the verse says, “God is with me and I will prevail” (Proverbs 30:1)]. And therefore, the yud, which signifies thought [which is the essence, as we say “the end is action, the beginning is thought” (Friday night prayers)], went up and said… And similarly by Moshe. He said, “Why did You do evil to Your nation?" (Exodus 5:22). Certainly he was not able to depict, God forbid, the evil of Israel. And Hashem responded to Him, “I am God” (Exodus 6:2), that all existences are through My will; if so, questions and challenges are not pertinent. And He also commanded him to say to the children of Israel, “I am Hashem” (Exodus 6:6), so that they will know that even the exile of Egypt was only through the life force of Hashem, because all existences are from Him. “And they didn’t listen to Moshe because of shortness of breath” (Exodus 6:9), because when they were in exile, this matter was not revealed [the meaning of “shortness of breath” is the life force of Hashem that is in a person, as it is written “and He blew into his nostrils a breath of life” (Genesis 2:7). And in exile the clinging to the essence of the life force is halted] and that is what is written in the midrash, that everything is from the Torah, He established in it positive commandments and negative commandments… (Shemot Rabbah 6:1), meaning that every action of a person of Israel has a life force in Torah and mitzvos that are dependent on action. And therefore the action of a person affects that which is above, and it draws from the life force of Hashem. And similarly what is written about the holy Sabbath, “that Hashem created to make” (Genesis 2:3), meaning that which is done even now through the desire of Hashem at the time of the creation, and on the Sabbath the children of Israel testify about this, that the truth was made clear. And this is what is written “and you should honor it from doing your desires…” (Isaiah 58:13), the Sages explained that all your work should be done. We can say as we said above, that one should know that also that which a person is doing is already done through the will of Hashem, as it is written “a person only injures a finger below if they decree so about him on high” (Chullin 7b), and that is what is written “that which was already done” (Ecclesiastes 2:12), as we said above. And on the Sabbath it is the aspect of nullification and the acceptance of the yoke of heaven, to nullify oneself to the essence of life. And through this, every action is drawn after its essence in heaven. Because it is written, “He did wonders” (Psalms 98:1). And the Rama in Orach Chaim explained “and does wondrous things” (Blessing of Asher Yatzar), that the action has in it an aspect of wonder, (see the Magen Avraham there, Orach Chaim 6:1). And also the wisdom of a person needs to be nullified to the aspect of the essence of wisdom, as it is written “from where is it found…” (Job 28:12). Because a person knows that when he grows and becomes wiser, he sees that that which he did not consider to be a sin beforehand was a mistake, and so too afterwards even more. If so, for true wisdom there is no measure, and all knowledge must be nullified to the word of Hashem, and everything will be drawn to the essence, as we said above.
“And you should know that I am Hashem your God who takes you out…” (Exodus 6:7). This is a promise that they will know that Hashem took them out from the land of Egypt. And this is the reason for the entire exile, that a person should know that from his side he is set to be in exile. And this is the practice for every person from Israel. Similarly I heard from my father, my master, my teacher and mentor, whose memory should be a blessing, that if a person truly knew that everything is from Hashem, they would not hide from him anything, and all the hiddenness is so that it will not seem like it is from Him, and the words of the wise are grace. And a person needs to know, even during a time of favor when he has a little bit of clinging, with all that, it cannot be forgotten that he is set, from his side, for any sin and iniquity. Only with the help of Hashem. And this is what is written, “so that you will remember the day that you left Egypt all the days of your life” (Deuteronomy 16:3), meaning even when he is clinging to the living God. And similarly the Sages wrote that this comes to include the days of the messiah, which is a good time, when the evil inclination is not in control. Nevertheless, he has to remember well, that if not for His mercy we would still be in Egypt. As it is written, “if He hadn’t taken us out… we would still be enslaved…” (Passover Haggadah). And this Hashem wanted to ingrain in Israel at the time of the exile, that they should know that all this was so that they would know after the entire redemption and after the receiving of the Torah, that Hashem took them out of Egypt. And this is what it says by the Sabbath, “a remembrance for the exodus from Egypt” (Kiddush for Friday night), for it is a day of rest, and a person must know that it is from Hashem. And therefore, every day we mention the exodus from Egypt before the unification of krias Shema to know that if not for His mercy we would be in Egypt. And through making this truly clear, every day we leave from the meitzar (straits - same root as Mitzrayim which means Egypt) and we are able afterwards to accept the yoke of Heaven. And we say, “You brought us out from Egypt and You redeemed us from the house of slavery” (Morning Prayers). It seems that the explanation is that there were two things: the hard work of the slavery, and also that they were truly under the hand of Egypt. And it is written in the holy Zohar, that as long as a person has a different yoke, he cannot accept the yoke of Heaven. This is why slaves are exempt from accepting the yoke of Heaven. And therefore, after the exodus from Egypt we accept the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. And so too it is written, “and I will take out…” and then afterwards “and I will take you to Me as a nation…” (Exodus 6:6-7), as we said above. [Even so, after this he should also know that if not for His mercy we would be in Egypt, and this is why we mention also after krias Shema the exodus from Egypt and redemption. And afterwards we can come through that to prayer.]
“And I will take you out… from under the burden (sivlot) of Egypt… " (Exodus 6:6). I heard from my father an explanation of “sivlot” (burden), that they were not able to bear, in any manner, the impurity of Egypt. And from that came the redemption afterwards. And it seems that it is from this that Moshe, our teacher, took them out, as he said “Behold the children of Israel did not listen to me” (Exodus 6:12). Because afterwards it is written “and I will redeem…” (Exodus 6:6), if so, before they heard and it was not properly disgusting to them, and they did not leave from under the burden, consequently how will Pharaoh listen, which happens afterwards? But really they had left the burden of Egypt, but the attribute of Moshe was on a higher level, for he was further separated from the land of Egypt, and so it is written “they did not listen to me…” (Exodus 6:12). And this was the idea of having Aharon join, that their clinging to Moshe would be through Aharon [and that is what is written “and He commanded them…” (Exodus 6:13)], as we said above. And afterwards it is written, “and you should know that I am Hashem your God who takes you out from under the burden of Egypt” (Exodus 6:7), that after the whole redemption, one must know that if not for the help of Hashem, we would still be under the burden of Egypt, which is an bad aspect, as we said above. And this is advice for all of Israel, that one should habituate himself to hate evil with the utmost hatred. Like the Sages said, a person should incite his good inclination against his evil inclination (Berachot 5a). And this is the beginning of the redemption, as we said above.

My father, my master, my teacher and mentor, the righteous one who should be remembered for life in the World to Come said, that the reason there was a need for ten plagues was to remove the shell and hiddenness from the ten ma’amarot (sayings) to make them into the ten dibrot (utterances). Until here are the words of my father. The explanation is, that in this world it is hidden, the fact that the root of the life force of everything is only the letters of the Torah, the ma’amarim (sayings) that were created by Him. And this is what it means, that they give reward to the righteous who uphold the world that was created with ten ma’amarot (Avot 5:1). The explanation is that they know and cling to the essence of the life force which is hidden, that exists through the ten sayings. And through each plague, He removed the hiddenness of one ma’amar (saying). And they became the ten dibrot. The meaning of dibbur is a language of conducting. Like it is written, “there is one leader - “dabar" - for a generation" (Sanhedrin 8a). And like it is written in the holy Zohar, the explanation of “and you should speak (ve-dibarta) about them when you sit in your house and when you go on your way…” (Deuteronomy 6:7), that he should conduct all of his actions by the words of Hashem and His unity and His love, that all his actions should be for the sake of Heaven. And this is the explanation of “by His word (bidvaro) He brings on evening” (Evening Prayers). The aspect of the Kingdom of Heaven, that His honorable name should also be within the mixture and the hiddenness, through faith [like it says, “truth and faith” in the evening prayer (Brachot 12a), like we wrote elsewhere]. And during the time of exile, the truth is hidden. And that is what the holy Zohar writes, that the aspect of dibbur was in exile. And that is what Moshe, our teacher, said, “and I am of closed lips” (Exodus 6:12), “I am not a man of words” (Exodus 4:10). And at the time of the receiving of the Torah, the aspect of dibbur was revealed, as it is written, “and Hashem spoke (va-yidaber)” (Exodus 20:1). [And this is what is written in the midrash (Devarim Rabbah 1:1), once he merited the Torah, “these are the words that Moshe spoke…” (Deuteronomy 1:1).] And in the midrash, “the weight of a stone…” (Proverbs 27:3), that the creation of heavens and earth was not weariness for Hashem. What does weary Him? Those who anger him… (Shemot Rabbah 13:1). The explanation of weariness is only that which is hidden in this world. And it is found that it refers to one who says “my strength and the ability of my hand…” (Deuteronomy 8:17). And also Pharoah who said “mine is my river…” (Ezekiel 29:3). And we can learn from this, for on the holy Sabbath which is called “rest”, the One about whom it says “He does not tire” (Isaiah 40:28) ascribed rest to Himself! The explanation is that on the holy Sabbath it was revealed that everything is from the life force of Hashem, as it is written “even an ignorant man, the fear of the Sabbath is upon him” (Talmud Yerushalmi Demai 4:1). [And therefore, on the holy Sabbath the children of Israel testify that Hashem created the world, as it is written “the one who says “and He completed” becomes a partner… that this knowledge is more rest, as we said above].
In the midrash on the verse “for I have hardened his heart” (Exodus 10:1), it explains that Hashem hardened Pharaoh's heart so that it would be a help to redeem Israel (Shemot Rabbah 13:1). Because they were not worthy. And this was a reason to harden his heart. “And the anger of a fool is stronger than both of them" (Proverbs 27:3). And this is to teach every person from Israel that he should not be discouraged when he sees the hiddenness. Because everything is for good. [As it is written, “and as for me, my feet almost strayed… surely You set them in slippery places…” (Psalms 73:2,18), and it is written “and Your thoughts are towards us” (Psalms 40:6).] And this is what is written “come to Pharaoh" (Exodus 10:1), because even the hiddenness itself is a help for the good, “for I have hardened his heart…” (Exodus 10:1).
In the midrash “human and beast…” (Psalms 36:7), “and when he is eight days old he should be circumcised” (Genesis 17:12), that he should see the face of the matron first (Vayikra Rabbah 27:10). Because it is written, “give a portion to seven and also to eight” (Ecclesiastes 11:2). “To seven” – seven days of creation. “To eight” – eight days until circumcision (Kohelet Rabbah 11:2). The explanation is that circumcision is the aspect of eight which is above nature. And we can come to this through the aspect of the Sabbath, to bring the sanctity of the holy Sabbath also into the days of the week. And this is giving a portion to seven, because the Sabbath is a taste of the World to Come. And through them we are able to also come to the aspect of eight. 
“This month is for you” (Exodus 12:2). This idea is for the redemption from Egypt. Because in exile, this renewal is missing. As it says, “and a new king arose” (Exodus 1:8). And at the time of redemption, which is when it is made clear that everything is the life force of Hashem. And from this comes renewal. Because the life force of Hashem has constant renewal, as it says, “renews every day, constantly” (Morning Prayers). And the explanation of “constantly” is every day. Only one who forgets and who is enmeshed in nature, about him it is written that “there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). But someone who is clinging to the internality of the life force of Hashem has constant renewal. And that is what is written, “this month is for you” (Exodus 12:2). That every person from Israel can awaken this renewal through faith, when he clarifies in his heart that everything is from Hashem. And this is the difference between the Sabbath and Rosh Chodesh. That the Sabbath is a trace of the World to Come, established and standing, that there is no hiddenness. As it is written, “disappear from it” (Zohar Terumah). But Rosh Chodesh is to illuminate even the weekday with renewal. And this is dependent on Israel, as it is written “to the God who completes for me” (Psalms 57:3; Shemot Rabbah 15:2). And this is what Rashi says, and what is written in the midrash, that Moshe, our teacher, had difficulty, until He showed him, “like this, see and sanctify…” (Rashi on Exodus 12:2, Midrash Tanchuma Shmini 8). And didn’t He only speak to him during the day? Rather… He showed it to him at nightfall (Rashi on Exodus 12:2). Because the aspect of Moshe, our teacher, is a clear vision, the aspect of the Sabbath. And this is the meaning of “and Moshe will rejoice” (Sabbath Morning Prayers). But the aspect of month is by way of faith, as we said above. And He showed it to him at the time of dark, at twilight. And it says “this” to let him know that Hashem and His name are one. And sometimes it has to be by way of faith in order to awaken the renewal, as we said above.

The commandment "This month is for you" (Shemot 12:2) is the first mitzvah given to Bnei Yisrael. Rashi explains that the Torah should have started from this mitzvah, but it begins with Bereishis to show "The power of His actions He told His nation, to give them the inheritance of the nations." Bnei Yisrael are intrinsically connected to the Torah, which is above nature and constantly renewing, unlike the natural world where "there is nothing new under the sun" (Kohelet 1:9).<br>Bnei Yisrael were first sent into this world to repair it, which is why the Torah starts with creation. We must repair the natural world before reaching the Torah's higher level. Similarly, on an individual level, the neshama is above nature but is clothed in the body, necessitating the repair of the body to attain the neshama's level. Nationally, Bnei Yisrael first needed to repair their physicality before achieving internal spiritual connection. "This month is yours" signifies that prior efforts were for the world's sake, but with the Torah, it becomes unique to Bnei Yisrael.<br>This concept is also reflected in "And I have separated you from the nations" (Vayikra 20:26). By being mixed with and then chosen from the nations, Bnei Yisrael elevate sparks of holiness. This explains the eirev rav, the mixed multitude that joined Bnei Yisrael from Egypt, showing the exile's purpose to uplift converts. Therefore, the Torah states "One Torah for the citizen and the convert" (Shemot 12:49), indicating that once Bnei Yisrael were chosen, they gained the power to elevate converts immediately.
The verse "They will completely expel you" (Shemot 11:1) implies that Pharaoh's expulsion of Bnei Yisrael would leave no trace of exile's impurity. This is evidenced by their immediate designation as "צבאות ה’" (the army of Hashem), with the Zohar comparing them to angels. This highlights the praise for Bnei Yisrael, who, despite exile, maintained their purity.<br>Rashi's commentary on Shir Hashirim 1:5, "like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Shlomo," explains that Bnei Yisrael are 'easy to wash,' meaning any impurity from exile is superficial and easily removed. The phrase "Do not see that I am black; it is from the sun" signifies that their darkness is external, caused by the nations. Each exile demonstrates that their inner essence remains unchanged. When leaving exile, the removal of impurities becomes a source of adornment, symbolized by the borrowing of silver and gold vessels. This is reflected in Shir Hashirim 1:11, "Chains of gold were made for you," indicating that their purification allowed them to take these vessels, free from any residual impurity.
Regarding the mitzvah of Tefillin (Shemot 13:9): "They shall be a sign on your arm and a remembrance between your eyes, so that the Torah of Hashem will remain in your mouth." The verse (Tehillim 103:20) states: "They do His will to hear His voice." The commandment of Tefillin uses the word "קשירה" (tying), indicating that by tying our actions and nullifying them to Hashem, we merit Torah. The Zohar explains that Pharaoh tied up the slaves in Mitzrayim to prevent their escape, but the binding of the wicked does not endure. When Hashem chose us as His servants and gave us mitzvot, it allowed us to connect our powers to Him through them. This is the essence of the mitzvah of Tefillin and Tzitzit, where through tying ourselves to Hashem's dominion, we merit Torah.<br>The phrase "תהיה תורת ה'" (the Torah of Hashem will be) refers to a renewed Torah, meaning that when Bnei Yisrael are properly aligned, the Torah is renewed in their mouths. Every mitzvah has many levels, and by nullifying oneself to Hashem, we free ourselves from negative forces and connect to His service. This parallels the Exodus from Mitzrayim, where Hashem undid the knots of the wicked and bound us to His service. This concept applies daily as we remember the Exodus, transitioning from negative bondage to holy servitude, thereby meriting Torah.<br>During weekdays, this connection is achieved through Tefillin, tying our actions to Hashem. On Shabbos, the complete nullification of actions allows us to merit Torah without Tefillin, as the nullification is greater than tying actions. Internally, Bnei Yisrael's neshama is pure, and mitzvot repair the external 'clothing.' On Shabbos, we awaken the internal neshama, while during the week, Tefillin achieves a similar effect. This is reflected in the verse (Devarim 28:10) that nations will see Hashem's name upon us, referring to the Tefillin of the head. Shabbos and Yom Tov elevate us even higher than Tefillin, as they are stamped with the king's seal (See Shir Hashirim for further understanding).

The Zohar (Raya Mehemna 2:92a) states, “Shabbos includes the entire Torah,” and the Gemara (Eruvin 69b) says that one who denies Shabbos is considered an apostate of the entire Torah. This is because the receiving of the Torah and the Ten Commandments maintain the world’s existence. Just as a person first has an evil inclination and later gains a good inclination to convert negativity to positivity, the world first experienced chaos (תהו ובהו) and then received the Ten Commandments to renew and repair the world's life force, revealing that everything is from Hashem through the Torah, as stated in Bereishis Rabbah 1:1.<br>The Torah is the vessel through which Hashem’s life force is enclothed in physical actions, allowing one to connect to Hashem even in this world. This is the meaning of “The Torah of Hashem is perfect, it restores one’s soul” (Tehillim 19:8), indicating that the Torah reconnects the soul to its source. The concept of Shabbos, where Hashem rested (וינפש), elevates everything to Hashem, bringing a new life force to the level of nefesh. Through Shabbos, life force is drawn to the weekdays, linking them to their source.<br>Shabbos is the root of the Torah, channeling the life force of the Torah into creation. As it says in Shemos 20:10, “He rested on the seventh day, therefore He blessed it,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael can return to their place of rest and connect to Hashem. Hashem’s rest on Shabbos allows for the drawing of energy from the source of blessings, embodying the essence of all brocha.
The Chidushei Harim explained the name Yisro in light of the pasuk “For the remnant of his inheritance,” as the Gemara (Rosh HaShana 17a) interprets this to refer to one who regards himself as unimportant. Yisro considered himself as extra or unworthy, which is why he was called Yeter (literally extra). Before Yisro converted, his humility was not noteworthy, as he was indeed extra and unimportant. The significance comes when it is connected to Hashem, as indicated by the pasuk “The remnants of His legacy נחלתו.” After he converted, the letter vav was added to his name, becoming Yisro, symbolizing his connection to Hashem.
The Gemara (Shabbos 88a) explains Tehillim 103:20, “Mighty creatures who do His bidding, ever obedient to His bidding,” as referring to Bnei Yisrael’s commitment to accepting the Torah by first saying “na'aseh” (we will do) before “nishma” (we will hear). They believed Hashem would not command more than they could handle but committed to reaching the level of “nishma” through their actions, not just as a gift from Hashem.<br>This is the meaning of “creating His words,” as every action contains Hashem’s energy. As it says in Tehillim 33:6, “With the word of Hashem, the Heaven was made.” By performing actions correctly, they could hear the voice (kol), which is above words (dibbur). The voice is the inner essence of words before they are divided into syllables.<br>Through their actions, Bnei Yisrael merited to hear Hashem’s voice. This also explains the Gemara (Rosh Hashanah 27a) that “remember” (zachor) and “guard” (shamor) were said simultaneously. Guarding (shamor) relates to the level of words hidden in creation, while remembering (zachor) is a higher level, attained through proper guarding, where no guarding is needed.

Section 2

5634
(Tehillim 103:20) "Fulfilling His words, listening to His voice” describes Bnei Yisrael’s commitment when they said "na'aseh v'nishma"—first they do, then they hear. This is because Bnei Yisrael awaken the word of Hashem present in every place. The Torah says, “If you will surely hear שמוע תשמעו My voice,” indicating that Hashem’s voice, which is the Torah, can always be heard. When Bnei Yisrael’s actions align with the Torah, Hashem’s word is revealed to them, as seen in the Ten Commandments.<br>The phrase “all these words” in Shemos 20:1 teaches that the ten utterances (used to create the world) were on a general level, and the Ten Commandments were to repair and uplift these utterances. After the exodus from Mitzrayim, this voice and these words were revealed, allowing even Yisro to hear. The Torah was given on Shabbos because Shabbos is a time when all work ceases, and actions are nullified to Hashem, reminding us of the exodus from Mitzrayim.<br>On Shabbos, the concept of exodus is awakened, revealing Hashem’s voice. The first letters of “you shall surely hear My voice” spell שבת (Shabbos). Therefore, Moshe returns the crowns of "na'aseh v'nishma" to Bnei Yisrael on Shabbos, symbolizing the renewal of their commitment to Hashem.
The Midrash (Shemos Rabba 28:1) states that Moshe received the Torah by taking it and as a gift, without payment. The Chidushei Harim explained this in line with the Gemara (Megillah 6b) “If one says I toiled and I found (success), believe him.” This means that one merits success in Torah through hard work, but ultimately as a gift from Hashem. When Hashem sees one toiling for the sake of Heaven, He grants it as a gift.<br>Receiving the Torah requires giving up one's entire self and desires for its sake. However, one does not need to pay money for it; the main point is having a true desire to connect to the Torah. For those with genuine desire, the Torah grants life in this world and the next.

The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 27:1) on “And Yisro heard…” states: "Do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father. If you do, you shall not enter the house of your brother." If Bnei Yisrael had fully followed their forefathers, whose deeds were in complete connection to Hashem, they would have been the “chariot of Hashem’s presence.” After the exodus and splitting of the sea, they were prepared for this level, repairing the world as our sages taught: “The nations heard and trembled…”<br>However, due to their sin in Refidim, where their hands weakened from Torah, they lost this connection. The pasuk continues: “If you forsake Him, do not enter…” leading to “Amalek came…” They needed new strategies to withstand the hiddenness from the 70 nations, having fallen from their original connection above nature.<br>Hashem sent Yisro, who nullified the nations' power by recognizing Hashem, saying, “Now I know.” This broke and subjugated the negative forces, as the Zohar explains. Yisro’s recognition of Hashem’s greatness was pivotal. Hence, it is said, “You have done kindness with Bnei Yisrael when you took them from Mitzrayim” (Shmuel 1:15:6).<br>
The Midrash on the pasuk (Yirmiya 16:19) “Hashem is my strength and stronghold” explains that besides the strength Hashem gives Bnei Yisrael, as stated “He is my strength and I praise Him,” there is an additional element: the ability of Bnei Yisrael to gain strength and power is also due to Hashem’s help. This is the meaning of the double expression “my strength and stronghold”—the capability to connect to Hashem’s power is itself granted by Hashem. Therefore, Hashem gave Bnei Yisrael the Torah, which is called עוז (strength), enabling them to connect to divine power through Torah and Mitzvot.<br>Bnei Yisrael, in their own right, are prepared to be completely attached to Hashem, similar to the Avos, representing “Hashem my strength.” However, Hashem wanted to uplift the entire world through Bnei Yisrael, connecting even the nations to Him through the stronghold (מעוז) of Torah and Mitzvot. This is reflected in the pasuk “...He is my stronghold, to You nations will come.” The Midrash on Shir Hashirim elaborates that through the power of Torah and Mitzvot, which bring light to physical actions, people of truth from the nations can perceive the fragrance of holiness and convert.
The Midrash on the pasuk (Tehillim 68:19) “You went up on High, and took a captive” refers to Moshe ascending to Heaven and bringing down the Torah. The primary dwelling of Hashem is below, so the Torah being held in Heaven was considered a captive. Moshe returned and brought the Torah down to those below, as was originally intended at the beginning of creation.<br>The Torah is meant for Bnei Yisrael when they are properly prepared. Since the Torah represents the path of truth and true direction, when Bnei Yisrael stand in truth, they are naturally ready to receive it. This is why it says the Torah was given to Moshe through taking, even though it is a gift. The world was created so that through repairing their actions, mankind connects to their source, making the Torah a gift. Through teshuva, we merit to receive the Torah. "You went on High" signifies teshuva, and this is why the Torah was given on Shabbos.
“Remember the Shabbos day, to sanctify it.” This teaches us that through remembering Shabbos, its holiness is enhanced. The explanation is that the source of Shabbos is very elevated. However, as much as Bnei Yisrael remember Shabbos and guard themselves from impurity and negativity during the week to be ready to receive Shabbos with purity, they draw down the holiness of Shabbos into this world.<br>Our sages taught to honor Shabbos by wearing clean clothing. This means the extra soul that every Jew receives on Shabbos requires a holy and pure body, which is the cover and clothing for the spirit of the soul within. This preparation is dependent on the weekdays, as the pasuk says: “Six days you shall work and do all your work,” meaning one should feel as if all work is complete. Then, on the Seventh day, it is Shabbos for Hashem. When Shabbos arrives, one must yearn to receive it with purity. By doing so, even in that one moment, it is as if “All your work is complete.”

“In the third month” (Shemos 19:1). The giving of the Torah was the third major renewal in the world. The first was creation, symbolized by Avraham and the concept of kindness (Tehillim 89:3). The second was the exodus from Mitzrayim, symbolizing Yitzchak and the concept of judgment, hinted by the start of the exile from Yitzchak's birth. The third is the giving of the Torah, symbolizing Yaakov and the internal mechanism of the world.<br>These three events parallel Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshama. Just as individuals progress from Nefesh to Ruach and Neshama, the world needed these stages. If it were possible to receive the Ten Commandments immediately, Hashem would not withhold this goodness. However, we first needed to attain the level of Nefesh, then Ruach, and finally Neshama.<br>These three concepts are also paralleled in the festivals of Sukkos, Pesach, and Shavuot. On Shabbos, these three levels are reflected in the three meals. Shabbos commemorates creation, the exodus, and the giving of the Torah. The primary reason for Shabbos is to study Torah, as it states, “The entire Shabbos should be devoted to Torah” (Tana Devei Eliyahu Raabah 1). On Shabbos, we receive an extra soul, just as we did when we received the Torah.
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 27:9) teaches that accepting responsibility means being accountable for others, as in Mishlei 6:1, “If you have stood surety for your fellow.” Bnei Yisrael, upon receiving the Torah, became guarantors to perfect the world through it.<br>While it seems Bnei Yisrael are borrowers of the Torah, the Midrash clarifies they are guarantors. Hashem told them, “The entire world is Mine, and you will be a nation of priests” (Shemos 19:6). Separated from the general populace, they now influence everyone else. In response, Bnei Yisrael said, “Whatever Hashem says we will do” (Shemos 19:8), committing to repair creation, as it says, “Through Hashem’s words, the Heavens were created” (Tehillim 33:6).<br>Everything depends on Bnei Yisrael. As they improve, the rest of creation follows. Similarly, when a Rav betters himself, his students follow. The Midrash says leadership means others depend on him. The double expression “You shall surely rebuke” (הוכח תוכיח) shows that self-rebuke leads others to improve. Thus, the entire nation follows Bnei Yisrael.
"And they traveled from Refidim" (Shemos 19:2) demonstrates Bnei Yisrael's belovedness, as they were elevated from Mitzrayim to receiving the Torah in just three months. "In the third month" signifies this rapid spiritual ascent. Another expression of their belovedness is their journey in one day from Refidim, a place symbolizing their weakness in Torah, to Har Sinai—a significant physical and spiritual trek.<br>They camped in the wilderness because they couldn't find rest in previously settled places like Mara and Refidim. The generation that left Mitzrayim was so spiritually elevated that they couldn't bear the physicality of other locations. This is similar to Rav Shimon ben Yochai, who couldn't tolerate physicality after years of spiritual immersion in a cave. Bnei Yisrael's preparation was complete only in the wilderness, the ideal place Hashem chose to give the Torah. The sefer Tiferes Yisrael also discusses this reasoning.

Section 11



Section 12

5644
The Midrash (Yirmiya 16:19) explains the pasuk, "Hashem is my strength and my fortress on days of suffering," highlighting how the nations heard of Bnei Yisrael’s miracles and joined them. The souls of Bnei Yisrael are connected to the Torah, as stated in the Zohar: "The Torah, Hashem, and Bnei Yisrael are all one." This connection means Hashem is their actual strength. "My fortress" refers to indirect strength from Hashem, a lower level than direct divine energy. This concept parallels the difference between future comprehension and current, partitioned understanding. This also relates to "na’aseh v’nishma"—doing before hearing, akin to angels whose mission is their life force, while Bnei Yisrael, in their physical bodies, need to bring out the sparks of holiness from within this world.<br>These two levels correspond to weekdays and Shabbos. "My fortress" applies to weekdays, while "my strength" is Shabbos, a direct divine connection. The pasuk (Shemos 20:8-9) states, "Six days you shall work, and on the Seventh day, it is Shabbos to Hashem your G-d." Everything is Hashem’s, but He chose specific parts: Bnei Yisrael as His people, Shabbos and Yom Tov as holy times, and Eretz Yisrael, Yerushalayim, and the Beis Hamikdash as sacred places. Currently, we lack the Beis Hamikdash, yet Bnei Yisrael and Shabbos testify to each other’s uniqueness. Shabbos, a day of the soul, elevates physical time beyond nature, as seen in the absence of manna on Shabbos.<br>The pasuk "Six days Hashem created the Heaven and earth" indicates a combination of divine and physical life forces in creation. On Shabbos, a purely spiritual day, there is no such combination. Shabbos is a unique inheritance for Bnei Yisrael, free from foreign interference. Weekdays involve toil and a battle against negative forces, but Shabbos is a day of rest where the soul overpowers the body. This additional soul on Shabbos, referred to as an "extra soul," signifies increased power, subjugating the physical. The fear of Shabbos affects even the unlearned. Hashem’s name and blessing rest on these three elements—time, space, and soul—making Bnei Yisrael the vessel for blessing all souls. Shabbos blesses the weekdays, and Yerushalayim is the source of all blessings. Without the Beis Hamikdash, daily curses worsen, as the primary source of blessing was the Beis Hamikdash.
The pasuk states (Shemos 18:1) that Yisro heard all that Hashem had done for Bnei Yisrael, including taking them out of Mitzrayim. This seems redundant since the exodus is part of what Hashem did. We can explain that the exodus opened the door for converts. The Midrash states that until then, no slave had ever escaped from Mitzrayim. The exodus expanded the power of holiness, allowing converts to join Bnei Yisrael, as seen with the "great multitude" that accompanied them. Thus, Yisro's ability to hear and connect to holiness was due to the exodus.<br>The Midrash also connects Yisro's arrival with the battle against Amalek, illustrating the concept that a fool misses opportunities while the wise become wiser (Mishlei 19:25). The exodus clarified the distinction between good and evil, separating the sparks of goodness within the nations and drawing them to Bnei Yisrael. Those with a desire to do good could approach through Bnei Yisrael, while the truly wicked, like Amalek, were clarified and separated into the side of evil. Thus, the goodness of Yisro and the wickedness of Amalek were both revealed through the exodus.

In the verse, 'Thus shall you say' etc., for the 'women [...] with gentle language' etc., 'and tell [...] harsh matters'. And there's a difficulty, that with one expression being said, according to Rashi, 'in this language and in this order'. And perhaps one could say that really these words are for women and those who are lacking understanding. They are only words of encouragement how the Holy One, blessed be He, brought us close and uplifted us. But people that understand, know that this is not a small thing and that they are receiving with this, a great and awesome yoke to serve the Creator of the world and to clarify his kingdom, may it be blessed, in the world. And therefore it says with this expression and in this order that it was revealed before Him, may He be blessed, that with this expression each person will continue according to their path. The women with encouragement. And the men with an awesome undertaking. And in the Gemora we also find a disagreement whether commandments were given to us to derive benefit from. And the law is that they weren't given to us to derive benefit from, as mentioned above.

"I am Hashem your G-d who took you out of Mitzrayim.” The Midrash (Shemos Raba 28:6) states that all the souls of Bnei Yisrael were present at the giving of the Torah, meaning the words “that took you out of Mitzrayim” were addressed to the entire Jewish nation, past, present, and future. Just as Bnei Yisrael were physically in Mitzrayim, their souls were also spiritually subjected to Mitzrayim’s power. At the receiving of the Torah, Bnei Yisrael were uplifted and came under Hashem’s presence, signifying a direct connection to G-d without intermediaries.<br>This is the essence of “Who redeemed you from the house of servitude,” as nature itself is a “house of servitude.” Bnei Yisrael were redeemed from this and entered the realm of the world to come, not subjected to natural laws but directly under Hashem’s guidance. Shabbos, a taste of the world to come, testifies to this special relationship, as it commemorates the exodus and receiving of the Torah. This unique relationship elevates Bnei Yisrael above angels, who are naturally higher than souls, by virtue of the Torah.<br>At Har Sinai, Bnei Yisrael experienced and felt Hashem’s G-dliness, transcending physicality. Without the sin of the Golden Calf, they would have lived in a perpetual Shabbos state. On Shabbos, the extra soul received at Sinai, beyond the house of servitude, returns, testifying to the exodus and Torah. Shabbos is thus called a witness, as Bnei Yisrael are witnesses to Hashem’s special relationship with them. Through Torah, which is a form of testimony, Bnei Yisrael become witnesses to Hashem’s G-dliness, as seen at Har Sinai. The Torah, in which every Jew has a portion, serves to remind them of their testimony, engraved in their souls. As the Gemara states, even if a witness forgets, a written testimony can remind them, similar to how Torah study reminds Jews of their divine testimony.

Mishpatim



Section 1

5631
Rashi (Shemos 21:1) explains that the words "and these are the laws" indicate that, like the Ten Commandments, the laws in this parsha were also given at Sinai. The Chidushei Harim clarifies that Hashem instructed Moshe to teach these laws with their reasons to ensure Bnei Yisrael understood that even logical laws are divine commandments. This is why Jews cannot take their cases to gentile courts, even if those courts follow similar laws. The law's logical aspect is because Hashem willed it to be understood that way.<br>The Medrash states that Hashem teaches His words to Yaakov, meaning He follows His commandments. When Bnei Yisrael said, "We will do and we will hear," they created the words of Torah. Through learning Torah and prayer, man's effort and inner will bring life to the Torah's words. This means Hashem gives Bnei Yisrael the power to draw the inner life force from the Torah, allowing them to find constant renewal in its words through their dedication and effort.<br>The Chidushei Harim also notes that "place before them" signifies valuing Torah above oneself, similar to "na’aseh v’nishma" (we will do and we will hear). When one prepares with this level of dedication, the wellspring of Torah opens up. Hashem's intention is for Bnei Yisrael to use these laws as a foundation to understand all of Hashem’s laws through their efforts. While Moshe desired complete revelation, the Torah was given with layers of hiddenness to allow Bnei Yisrael to find Hashem’s inner will through toil, perfecting both the soul and body. This ensures that every Jew, through true desire, can find the true law in everything and not err.
"I am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have made ready. Pay heed to him and obey him. Do not defy him, for he will not pardon your offenses, since My Name is in him." (Shemos 23:20-21). Even during the six days of work, there is hidden holiness in mundane actions. Bar Kappara taught that acknowledging Hashem in all our ways is a fundamental principle (Proverbs 3:6). Everything, even mundane actions, contains Hashem’s life force and mitzvos, requiring extra awareness and protection.<br>"You shall serve Hashem your G-d, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will remove sickness from your midst." (Shemos 23:25). This refers to Shabbos, a taste of the world to come, where spiritual clarity and healing prevail. On Shabbos, there is no need for personal requests. The blessing of bread and water signifies connecting all actions to serving Hashem. "Blessing" (brocha) means connection, drawing everything to Hashem's service. The Gemara (Brachos 48b) teaches us to bless Hashem after eating, showing that eating can connect us to His G-dliness.<br>Properly connecting to Hashem through eating brings health and removes illness. The Zohar explains that improper eating leads to haughtiness and illness, while Shabbos eating is a mitzvah that uplifts and prevents harm. Recognizing hidden holiness in mundane actions and connecting them to Hashem can transform and elevate even simple acts, bringing blessings and health.

Section 2

5632
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30b) explains the connection between the end of the previous parsha, which discusses using a ramp instead of stairs for the mizbeach, and the beginning of this parsha about judges. The reason for not using stairs is to prevent revealing the cohanim's nakedness, even though they wore pants. Rav Avina clarifies that this teaches cohanim to take careful steps, and similarly, judges should be meticulous in judgment.<br>Spiritual growth or ascending the mizbeach should not be attributed to personal strength or understanding but should be done because Hashem commanded it. "Do not reveal your nakedness" signifies that performing mitzvos for personal desires diminishes their value. Similarly, "You shall place before them" means decisions, even daily interactions, should align with Hashem's will, not personal inclinations.<br>Acting based on personal desires is like taking hasty steps. The Mishna in Avot 1:1, "Be patient in judgment," emphasizes that one's entire self should be dedicated to careful and deliberate judgment, ensuring every action aligns with Hashem's Torah and will. This approach ensures all actions and judgments are thoughtful and adhere to divine commandments.
"Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor, in order that your ox and your ass may rest, and that your bondman and the stranger may be refreshed." (Shemos 23:12). Shabbos is a way to connect all actions to Hashem by serving as a testimony that Hashem created the world.<br>The phrase "in order that your ox and your ass may rest" suggests that Shabbos uplifts everything. This concept is elaborated elsewhere (see Sefer Avodas Yisrael on Parshas Mishpatim). The reason for "six days you shall work" is so that "your ox and ass may rest." Ideally, Bnei Yisrael would exist in a world of perpetual Shabbos.<br>However, Bnei Yisrael's souls are sent to this world to repair the animalistic soul and to welcome converts. Therefore, there are six days of work. In the future, the rest of Shabbos will extend to everything, including one's ox and the stranger, connecting them to divine rest.
In the name of the Rebbe of Kotzk, on the pasuk (Shemos 22:30) "You shall be holy people to Me: you must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs." This teaches us that guarding holiness must be constant in a person's actions and thoughts.<br>Hashem does not lack angels and Heavenly seraphim; what He desires is holy people. Therefore, He placed holy sparks in the world in a limited, hidden way. Our sages taught that "you must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field" refers to anything beyond one’s normal boundary, indicating that holiness needs to be nurtured and protected from physicality.<br>The phrase "You shall be holy people to Me" is a promise that Bnei Yisrael will eventually become completely holy to Hashem. Thus, we must protect ourselves now to be worthy of being placed at the head of the King. The Midrash (Vayikra Rabba 2:5) compares this to creating a crown, where adding more stones makes it more beautiful, symbolizing the more we can enhance our holiness, the better. This concept is also a secret of the mystical teachings of our early sages.

(Shemos 21:1) "These are the laws that you shall place before them." The Chidushei Harim, quoting the Rebbe of Parshischa, explains that "before them" means these laws should come before Bnei Yisrael's own self and life, embodying the idea of na'aseh before nishma (self-sacrifice).<br>Rashi (21:1) notes that just as the Ten Commandments were given at Sinai, so too were these laws. This teaches that even if we understand the laws logically, it is because Hashem willed it so. The understanding follows Hashem’s will, not the other way around. The true essence is to accept Hashem's commandments, recognizing that their logic is secondary to His divine will.<br>The pasuk (Tehillim 99:4) "You have established justice" implies that Hashem's will makes His laws just, and everyone acknowledges this. The commandment of Hashem should precede human understanding, as indicated by "before them." Bnei Yisrael's declaration of na'aseh v'nishma showed their preference for doing Hashem’s will over understanding the reasons, which then enabled them to comprehend the laws. This principle applies to all mitzvos: fulfilling them with simplicity and dedication leads to understanding their deeper meanings. This explains why Hashem instructed Moshe to teach the reasons for the laws, as Bnei Yisrael merited this understanding through their commitment.
The Midrash (Shemos Rabba 30:18) interprets “These are the laws that you shall place before them” as indicating Hashem’s future vengeance on the nations. Hashem's ability to judge evildoers depends on Bnei Yisrael's adherence to justice. If Bnei Yisrael follow true justice, Hashem can be exacting with the nations. If Hashem must judge Bnei Yisrael favorably, He must also judge the nations favorably. Thus, “before them” means Hashem’s judgment hinges on Bnei Yisrael’s actions.

Section 4

5635
Rosh Chodesh Adar Rishon
The Midrash (Shemos Rabba 30:9) explains Tehillim 147:19, "He tells His words to Yaakov, His statutes and laws to Yisrael," with a parable: a king feeds his son from his own portion. This signifies that Hashem uses the very laws He chose for Himself to guide Bnei Yisrael, elevating them with His mitzvos.<br>Mishpatim, given after the Ten Commandments, are laws with logical reasons. The Chidushei Harim explains that Rashi (Shemos 21:1) emphasizes the need to explain mishpatim clearly because their logical nature might make people think they are less divine. Hashem wanted Moshe to strengthen emuna, teaching that even logically understood laws are ultimately Hashem’s will.<br>The pasuk "You who established equity" (Tehillim 99:4) means that what seems correct to us is because Hashem willed it so. Moshe initially hesitated to explain the reasons behind mishpatim, fearing it might weaken emuna. However, Hashem assured him that Bnei Yisrael could understand the reasons while maintaining their faith, as demonstrated with na’aseh v'nishma. "Before them" means Hashem gave Bnei Yisrael the ability to draw down understanding and find it appealing, akin to His own words, highlighting the essence of the Oral Torah.
The Chidushei Harim, quoting the Rebbe MiParshischa, explains that "You shall place before them" means Hashem’s laws should take precedence over the essence of Bnei Yisrael. This reflects the commitment of na’aseh before nishma, where Bnei Yisrael were prepared to sacrifice their lives to follow Hashem’s laws. This is especially relevant to mishpatim, which seem logical but must be followed because they are Hashem's will. True understanding of the Torah’s reasons comes through nullification to Hashem.<br>Yechezkel 46:1 states, “The gate of the inner court facing east shall be closed on the six working days; it shall be opened on the Sabbath and the new moon.” "Facing east" symbolizes nullification to what is above nature. On Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh, the souls of Bnei Yisrael are elevated, allowing them to attain the inner reasons of the Torah. On Shabbos, the completion of creation, "ויכלו," signifies the filling of all creation with abundant life force. Hashem gave each creation life to the maximum extent it could contain.<br>The creation of man on the sixth day represents the internal life force of all creation, as stated in Yeshaya 45:12. Man’s nullification and self-sacrifice on Shabbos draw renewed life force to the entire creation. This highlights the importance of Shabbos in connecting to Hashem and sustaining all of creation through spiritual elevation and dedication.
A slave's ear is pierced after six years if he chooses to remain in slavery because his ear heard Hashem's commandment “they are My slaves” and not anyone else’s. This piercing is not done immediately when he first sells himself.<br>Initially, the slave may think he can serve both his human master and Hashem. After six years, he should realize that serving another master detracts from his service to Hashem. Choosing to stay a slave indicates a failure to follow Hashem's command, hence the ear piercing.<br>Though repeated transgression might seem to lessen accountability, one who has sinned and understands its gravity is more accountable. Initially, selling himself due to financial hardship isn’t a sin. However, choosing to remain a slave when he can go free shows that his initial sale wasn’t purely out of necessity, thus warranting punishment.
The laws in Mishpatim provide valuable lessons for serving Hashem. For example, the laws of safekeeping (Shemos 22:6-7) discuss what happens when someone entrusts money or vessels to another for safekeeping and they are stolen. If the thief is found, he must pay double. If not, the guard must swear he hasn’t mishandled the property.<br>Metaphorically, Hashem entrusts us with "money" (our desires and drives) and "vessels" (our bodies) to guard. The evil inclination is the thief trying to steal these. If one resists this thief, there is an advantage, as the thief must repay double. The best advice is to avoid physical pleasures, as being involved with them makes one liable even for uncontrollable circumstances.<br>The Gemara (Baba Metzia 34a) explains that if the guard opts to pay rather than swear, he collects double if the thief is found. This means that even if a person sins, returning to Hashem wholeheartedly can elevate them to a higher level, converting willful sins into merits. This highlights the unique advantage of a repentant sinner, whose deliberate sins become merits.

Section 5

5636
The Midrash (Shemos Rabba 30:3) explains that the letter "vav" in "And these are the laws" teaches that just as the Ten Commandments were given at Sinai, so too were all these laws. Tehillim 147:19 refers to the Ten Commandments as "His word to Yaakov" and the mishpatim (laws) as "His statutes and laws to Yisrael." These stages mirror Yaakov and Yisrael—first, one must perform mitzvos without intellectual examination, and then one can merit understanding their reasons.<br>Understanding Torah requires special care to avoid arrogance. Initially, one must accept the yoke of Heaven with fear, ensuring the lasting impact of their knowledge (Avos 3:9). This is why the parsha starts with "vav," indicating that these laws cannot stand alone but must build on one's prior service to Hashem. Rashi explains that Moshe was concerned about teaching the laws' reasons, fearing Bnei Yisrael might not be worthy. However, Hashem reassured him that they are worthy, having committed to "na'aseh v'nishma" (we will do and we will hear).<br>The Zohar (3:111b) describes serving Hashem as both a slave, performing His will, and as a son, seeking His treasures. This dual service is reflected in the commandments and the laws. During the week, we serve like slaves, battling the evil inclination. On Shabbos, we serve like sons, aligning our will with Hashem's and experiencing peace. Shabbos brings completion and harmony, as it reveals Hashem's justice and truth. Tehillim 29:11 states, "Hashem gives His nation strength; He blesses them with peace," indicating that overcoming the evil inclination through Torah leads to the peace of Shabbos. Disputes for the sake of Heaven, which occur during the week, will endure and find resolution on Shabbos, as our sages taught that the world endures through Shabbos. Thus, while slaves are ready to fight the King's battles during the week, Shabbos offers rest, like sons at their father's table.
(Shemot 22:13-14) One who borrows items is responsible for damages, even if they are accidents ("ones"). However, if the owner is involved in the transaction, the borrower is exempt. This teaches that a person's actions are inherently linked to their essence. Hashem has given each person precious tools, such as their senses and a pure neshama. As explained in the Zohar on "when a person sells his daughter as a maidservant," a person can use these gifts as they will, enjoying the benefits, and thus is liable for accidents caused by their actions.<br>The way to avoid such strict judgment is through self-sacrifice to Hashem, making Him part of one's actions. This is likened to "borrowing with the owner," where complete commitment to Hashem exempts one from liability for accidents. If a person truly accepts Hashem’s dominion, their actions, even those that go wrong, are considered beyond their control and thus not their fault. Conversely, without proper acceptance of Hashem's dominion, accidents are considered negligence.<br>We see this principle in the case of a borrowed animal that dies due to its work, where the borrower is exempt. This indicates that sometimes Hashem gives a person tasks they cannot complete. Therefore, one should not be disheartened when unable to finish all tasks properly. This understanding reveals that sometimes, despite one's best efforts and the tools given by Hashem, completion of certain missions may not be possible.
The Zohar on Shemot 23:13 explains the phrase “In all the things I have said you will be guarded” (tishameiru), instead of “you will guard” (tishmeru). This teaches that the words of Torah themselves provide protection for a person. Hashem has given us the Torah and mitzvos, through which we can find all our needs, eliminating the need to seek solutions elsewhere. <br>The phrase “in everything that I have spoken” indicates that this protective power exists in every word and letter of the Torah. The Chidushei Harim interpreted the pasuk (Devarim 5:19) “A great voice, ‘lo yosaf’” (which Targum translates as "did not stop") to mean that every letter of the Torah continuously provides all that a person needs at any time. This completeness and protection are inherent in the Torah and mitzvos.<br>However, this protection is contingent on one’s awareness and commitment to the Torah. It is written as a commandment because it depends on a person’s recognition and dedication to the fact that all their needs are met through the Torah. As stated in Avot 5:22, “Delve deeply in it, for everything can be found in it.” The extent to which one understands and believes this determines the fulfillment and revelation of the Torah’s protective power, highlighting the importance of human choice in this process.

Section 6

5637
The Midrash on Tehillim 147:19 explains, "He tells His words to Yaakov, His statutes and laws to Yisrael," highlighting that unlike humans, Hashem commands Bnei Yisrael to observe what He Himself observes. The ten commandments are Hashem's way of maintaining the world, just as He created it with ten utterances. By giving these commandments to Bnei Yisrael, Hashem entrusts them with the world's existence, as each mitzvah sustains a part of creation. As Bnei Yisrael upholds the mitzvot, the world functions accordingly, placing the world's fate in their hands.<br>Additionally, Hashem's laws are given to Bnei Yisrael, signifying an even greater responsibility. When Beis Din rules, even if mistakenly, Hashem honors their decision, showing that divine justice is entrusted to them. This Midrash emphasizes that Hashem adheres to the decrees given to Bnei Yisrael, reflecting His unique relationship with them. These two levels—accepting the yoke of Heaven and understanding the laws—progress sequentially. First, Bnei Yisrael must commit to the commandments without fully grasping their reasons. This acceptance of divine will allows them to later comprehend the laws.<br>This concept is encapsulated in "na'aseh v'nishma" (we will do and we will hear), where action precedes understanding. The parsha begins with "And these are the laws," indicating that understanding mishpatim follows the commitment to the ten commandments. Thus, the vav connects the stages, reinforcing that one must first accept the commandments to merit understanding the laws.
(Shemot Rabbah 30:3) Just as a queen is escorted by guards before and behind her, so too is the Torah surrounded by laws. Before one can merit the Torah, one must refine oneself through the attribute of judgment, correcting all actions. This leads to receiving the Torah, which is the attribute of mercy, as explained in the previous parsha (Shemot Rabbah 28:1).<br>Even after receiving the Torah, one must avoid becoming haughty. Constant repentance through the Torah allows one to recognize Hashem's goodness and feel humility. This ensures the Torah remains with them. True fear of Hashem, stemming from understanding, follows Torah comprehension, contrasting with the initial fear that arises from lack of understanding.<br>The Midrash's example of guards illustrates this: those in front prevent the wicked from approaching, while those behind remind those already connected to the queen not to grow too close and forget her status. This ensures constant awareness of reverence and awe. [This concept is symbolized by the letter ‘vav’ between the two ‘heh’s.]

Section 7

5638
The Midrash on the pasuk “These are the laws you shall place before them” (Shemot 21:1) and Tehillim 99:4, "Mighty king who loves justice," states that if Bnei Yisrael do not keep the Torah's laws, Hashem will take it back. The Torah is called עוז (power), and as Bnei Yisrael accept its power, their hearts align with the truth. Even though laws depend on the judge's understanding, this power is given to Bnei Yisrael because their understanding follows the Torah and Hashem’s will. Therefore, the laws were given after they accepted the Torah. The word ואלה (and these) connects this to the previous statement, indicating that receiving the Torah enabled them to judge the laws, as seen in Tehillim 147:19, “He tells His words to Yaakov, His statutes and laws to Yisrael.”<br>We have explained that as one nullifies their intellect to Hashem’s mitzvot and statutes, they align their mind to the Torah's truth. This is the essence of weekdays compared to Shabbos. On Shabbos, an extra soul and clarity of דעת (knowledge) are given, but this is proportionate to the effort and nullification of desires during the week. Although weekday clarity is less, this effort allows one to attain Shabbos knowledge.<br>The Midrash's analogy of the Torah surrounded by laws before and after, like guards protecting a queen, signifies that one must constantly evaluate their actions to merit receiving Torah. Similarly, after receiving Torah, one must guard against physicality to maintain the Torah's light. These two protections ensure the lasting impact of Torah, as discussed in detail elsewhere.

Section 8

5639
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30:9) on “He teaches His words to Yaakov” explains that Hashem's governance, unlike a human king's, binds Him to the same laws He commands. Hashem entrusted Bnei Yisrael with the Torah and the world's governance, as stated in Tehillim 111:6. Hence, they need instruction in His laws, underscoring the mitzvah to not pervert judgment, as it affects the world's foundations. Rashi emphasizes that legal matters should be judged by Bnei Yisrael, not by idol worshippers, even if their laws align.<br>The Rav of Pershischa explains that “before them” means prioritizing the law above one's existence, requiring self-sacrifice. This commitment, shown in Bnei Yisrael’s declaration of “na'aseh v'nishma,” granted them the power of judgment because of their loyalty. Hashem saw their faithfulness and entrusted them with this responsibility, tying their ability to judge to their wholehearted acceptance of the Torah.<br>“He tells His words to Yaakov” refers to the commandments, with the Torah as the life force of creation. By accepting the Torah, Bnei Yisrael were entrusted with creation and later merited the laws. Their belief and commitment to Hashem's commandments, even without comprehension, led to understanding laws and reasons. Emuna (faith) leads to truth, and through weekday efforts, one merits Shabbos, achieving true understanding and rest. The term ואלה (and these) signifies an additional reward, similar to the extra soul on Shabbos, indicating that the power of the laws is an extra reward for their initial acceptance of the Torah through emuna.

Section 9

5640
Briefly
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30:9) on “And these are the laws that you shall place before them” highlights that Hashem's governance differs from a human king's. A human king might command laws without adhering to them, but Hashem gave us the Torah, and its laws follow the decisions of Beis Din. These laws, given to Bnei Yisrael, are the true laws of the Torah, essential for all levels of creation. Rashi notes that just as the first commandments were given at Sinai, so too were these laws.<br>The Midrash Tanchuma on Tehillim 99:4, “The mighty King who loves justice,” contrasts Hashem with a human warrior who might not follow laws. Hashem, who is mighty, loves justice and gave the Torah to Bnei Yisrael, empowering them to direct all creation. “He tells His words to Yaakov” means that these “words” are the directives for all creation, as everything is included in the Torah.<br>Thus, the laws were entrusted to Bnei Yisrael because the world depends on them. The Midrash in Shoftim explains that perverting justice shakes the foundations of the world, underscoring Bnei Yisrael's responsibility to uphold the Torah and its laws to maintain global stability.

Section 10

5641
"And these are the laws that you shall place before them.” The term “these” indicates that Hashem revealed to Moshe the heavenly source of these laws. According to the Midrash on the verse “He tells His word to Yaakov, His statutes and laws to Yisrael,” it is taught that the laws by which Hashem governs the universe were given to Bnei Yisrael. “You shall place before them” aligns with the verse “Righteousness and charity You have made,” signifying that Bnei Yisrael were endowed with the capacity to grasp the true essence of every law. This is reflected in Rashi’s interpretation that the reasons for the laws were to be explained to Bnei Yisrael, indicating they received the foundational understanding of these laws at Sinai.<br>The Ten Commandments and the entire Torah, being the names of Hashem, are embodied in the Torah’s words. Similarly, the laws, rooted in Hashem’s higher knowledge, are enacted by Bnei Yisrael through practical application. The verse “Righteousness and charity You have made in Yaakov” emphasizes the physical manifestation of these profound reasons within the laws. The acceptance of the Torah aimed to refine the practical level through Bnei Yisrael. Knowing the source allows one to draw parallels and derive new laws, as it is said, “Just as the first ones were from Sinai, so too these laws are from Sinai.”<br>Regarding Shabbos, “Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall stop, so that your ox and donkey can rest,” signifies that by nullifying the weekday activities and observing Shabbos daily, holiness is drawn into the realm of action. This rest extends to the physical and animal soul, enhancing their spiritual state. The promise of rest alludes to future completeness, where efforts in this world will be rewarded in the world to come, with Shabbos offering a taste of this eternal rest.

Section 11

5642
The word ואלה ("and these") in Shemos 21:1 indicates that the laws in this parsha were given at Sinai, just like the Ten Commandments. This teaches that there are mitzvot between man and Hashem, represented by the Ten Commandments, and mitzvot between man and his fellow, represented by the mishpatim (laws) in this parsha. The mishpatim are the ways for a person to gain personal perfection and are associated with the Oral Torah.<br>Both types of mitzvot come from Hashem. As the pasuk states, "Hashem gives power to His nation" refers to the Torah, and "Hashem will bless His nation with peace" refers to the mishpatim. The Midrash explains that even though these laws are given to the sages, they are ultimately gifts from Hashem. The idea of derech eretz preceding the Torah means that as one purifies oneself and perfects one's traits, one becomes worthy of more Torah. This process leads to continual growth and perfection.<br>The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30:3) states that the Torah has laws before and after it, indicating the importance of mishpatim. The first law discussed is that of the Eved Ivri (Jewish Slave), emphasizing the need to be extra careful not to abuse or misuse one's fellow Jew, which is even more critical than monetary loss. This underscores the significance of interpersonal laws and their role in achieving personal and communal harmony.

Section 12

5644
Mishpatim and Shabbat Shekalim.
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30:9) on "And these are the laws that you shall place before them" and the pasuk “He tells His word to Yaakov” explains that Hashem gave Bnei Yisrael the Torah and is bound by the decisions of Beis Din. The judgment belongs to Hashem, but it is given specifically to Bnei Yisrael because they nullify themselves to His will, making them fitting vessels for His judgment.<br>This is reflected in “Judgment and charity you have worked in Yaakov,” highlighting that Bnei Yisrael were chosen for these traits, unlike the nations whose kindness is self-serving. Bnei Yisrael's charity uplifts them, and thus, they do not accept shekalim from other nations, as stated in Nechemia 2:20. Judgment, based on the judge's understanding, requires complete nullification to Hashem. Bnei Yisrael are unique in this capacity because they recognize that understanding (da’as) is a divine gift.<br>The phrase “Judgment and charity you have worked in Yaakov” signifies that Bnei Yisrael complete Hashem's will, remaining connected to their source. Hence, judges are warned against bribery even when pronouncing the correct law, as any personal bias disconnects them from Hashem. The true judgment belongs to Hashem, and Bnei Yisrael's role is to uphold it with complete integrity.

Section 13

5645
Mishpatim and Parshat Shekalim
The Midrash on Tehillim 99:4, “Justice and righteousness you have made in Yaakov,” explains that unlike humans in power, Hashem loves righteousness and all His actions are just. Although the nations are commanded to establish justice (Sanhedrin 56a), “His statutes and laws are given to Yisrael” because Bnei Yisrael can achieve true judgment. The judgment belongs to Hashem, and Bnei Yisrael are merely vessels through which Hashem's laws are actualized via the Sanhedrin.<br>The phrase “You have made” signifies that Bnei Yisrael’s actions are empowered by Hashem. These actions stem from the hidden lights within their souls, which are considered the handiwork of Hashem, as stated in the Zohar (2:99b) and the pasuk “And souls I have made.” The judgment of Hashem is not merely logical; it requires the deep understanding (da’as) possessed by the sages, which is rooted in their divine souls. This is supported by the pasuk, “from Me your fruit is provided.”<br>Similarly, the righteousness and generosity in the hearts of Bnei Yisrael are powered by Hashem. The pasuk “Charity uplifts a nation, but the kindness of the nations is a sin” (Mishlei 13:4) and the sages' explanation that the nations' kindness is self-serving illustrate this. The actions of Bnei Yisrael are connected to their divine source, making them truly the actions of Hashem. Bnei Yisrael serve as vessels to actualize these divine potentials. This idea is echoed in the teaching that in Adar, the attribute of giving is awakened in the hearts of Bnei Yisrael, aligning with “Justice and righteousness you have made in Yaakov.”
In regards to the piercing of a slave's ear who chooses to stay with his master beyond the required time, our sages (Kidushin 22b) explain that the ear is pierced because it heard at Har Sinai that Bnei Yisrael are Hashem’s slaves, not slaves of other slaves. The Chidushei Harim adds that the ear receives this defect because the slave did not fulfill the mitzvot, implying it is better for him not to hear further commandments.<br>From this, we learn that the attribute of goodness is greater than punishment. If a person daily accepts Hashem’s service and recites “You shall love Hashem your G-d with all your heart,” this commitment helps open his ears to hear Hashem’s commandments, as stated in the Shema, “That I have commanded you today.” This daily affirmation enhances one's ability to gain deeper understanding.<br>One must merit to hear divine messages, as indicated by “If you hear, you will merit to hear.” The mitzvah of mezuzah serves as a reminder of accepting Hashem's dominion, with the door and mezuzah as witnesses. This helps Bnei Yisrael remember they are Hashem’s slaves. Even if someone’s ears are initially closed, daily acceptance of Hashem’s dominion will eventually open them to hear His commandments.
(Shemos 24:5) “And he sent the youth of Bnei Yisrael and they offered burnt offerings…” Rashi explains that the "youth" refers to the firstborn. We need to understand why they are called youth when firstborns are generally older than their siblings. The idea is that the firstborn possess the power of renewal, which is why they are referred to as "youth." This renewal makes them uniquely suited for serving Hashem. Similarly, Bnei Yisrael are called "youth" (Hoshea 11:1), as they are referred to as “My firstborn Yisrael.” This signifies their constant connection to the source of renewal.

Section 14

5646
The Zohar explains the verse “And if a person shall sell his daughter as a maidservant” (Shemos 21:7) as referring to the neshama. Hashem has, in a sense, "sold" the neshama to the body. There are two types of relationships with Hashem: as a servant and as a son, as stated in the Zohar Behar (2:205a). Bnei Yisrael are called “sons of Hashem your G-d” (Devarim 14:1), which refers to the neshama. However, the neshama is enclosed in the body, and through service as a servant during the weekdays, one perfects the body and attains the level of a son. On Shabbos, we are on the level of a son, refraining from work because it is a "Day of the souls," receiving an extra soul.<br>This dynamic came about through Adam's sin. Before the sin, the body was as pure as the neshama is now. Through sin, we have been "sold." The verse “If she does not find favor in the eyes of her master, and he does not redeem her” (Shemos 21:8) suggests that had there been no sin, we would remain on the level of sons. Nevertheless, the possibility of redemption exists, meaning we can transition from being slaves to sons, even in this world, through teshuva.<br>The Midrash elaborates that the Torah, now clothed in physical mitzvot, needs to be elevated from level to level. The process of service and elevation mirrors the journey from slavery to sonship, emphasizing the potential for spiritual growth and redemption.

Section 15

5647
The Midrash explains that just as a queen is guarded before and after, so too the Torah is surrounded by laws. Rashi notes that the extra "vav" in "ve'eileh" teaches that all laws were given at Sinai, emphasizing that everything stems from the Torah, which is the source of all blessings. The generations before the giving of the Torah were preparatory, just as individuals must prepare themselves to learn Torah. The laws given before receiving the Torah signify the need for preparation, while the laws after signify the application of Torah to refine one's actions continually.<br>On an individual level, one must first correct their ways to merit receiving the Torah. This is reflected in the sequence of "na'aseh v'nishma" (we will do and we will hear), showing that commitment precedes understanding. After hearing the Torah, one must further refine their actions according to its teachings, leading to deeper insights. This cycle of commitment, learning, and application is continuous and essential for spiritual growth.<br>The main focus should be doing everything for the sake of Hashem. As one works to better themselves and be prepared for Torah, Hashem will assist them. The pasuk “You shall be holy people to Me” implies that holiness is above nature and can be attained through Torah and mitzvot. Moshe's transformation on the mountain, described as becoming like a holy angel, symbolizes this potential for renewal. Each Jew has a part in this holiness, especially on Shabbos, when we receive an extra soul and our spiritual countenance is enhanced. The 613 mitzvot, paralleling our body, are the true essence, and distancing from physicality allows for deeper spiritual revelation. During the week, we strive to distance from physicality, and on Shabbos, we focus on receiving inner spiritual light.

Section 16

5648
Rashi explains that the parsha begins with the letter 'vav' to link the Mishpatim (laws between man and his fellow) to the Ten Commandments (laws between man and Hashem). This connection teaches that Bnei Yisrael merit receiving the Torah through unity and peace. Rabbi Akiva's principle, "You shall love your fellow man like yourself," is central to the Torah. "Hashem gives strength to His nation" refers to the Torah, while "Hashem blesses His nation with peace" refers to the Oral Torah, which is accessed through harmony by fulfilling Mishpatim. The Midrash explains that Mishpatim foster love among people, thus improving relationships with Hashem and others.<br>A person must improve their relationship with Hashem to merit the written Torah and repair relationships with others to merit the Oral Torah. The pasuk, "He tells His words to Yaakov, His laws and statutes to Yisrael," indicates that the name Yisrael is a higher level than Yaakov. Improving relationships with others is a significant merit, aligning with the concept of Yisrael as "Yashar Kel" (straight with Hashem). Initially, man was created straight, but sin introduced crookedness, jealousy, and hatred. Mishpatim help straighten these flaws, as indicated by "You shall place before them," connected to placing Hashem's name, representing the wellspring of Torah within Bnei Yisrael that needs to be actualized.<br>The mitzvot between man and Hashem and those between man and his fellow are interconnected. The mitzvot between man and Hashem enhance understanding of the written Torah, while fulfilling Mishpatim brings out the latent power of the Oral Torah. Good relationships through Mishpatim enable the realization of this inner potential, as "the ways of Hashem are just, the righteous shall go through them." By fulfilling these mitzvot, we bring latent spiritual power into the world.

Section 17

5649
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 30:12) on "He tells His words to Yaakov" (Tehillim 147:19) explains that one must be circumcised to receive the mitzvot. At Har Sinai, Bnei Yisrael became vessels prepared to receive Hashem's commandments, as reflected in the term 'segula' (treasured nation) (Shemos 19:5). The Ohr Hachaim explains 'segula' as being enabled to keep Hashem's mitzvot. The word 'magid' (tells) implies drawing, indicating Hashem draws Bnei Yisrael to follow His leadership.<br>Therefore, the parsha begins with "These are the Mishpatim (laws) that you shall place before them," showing that Bnei Yisrael, as prepared vessels, can now receive Hashem's laws and statutes. The pasuk concludes with "He has not done this for all the nations," meaning Bnei Yisrael's souls are different from those of other nations. This distinction is highlighted in the Aleinu prayer: "He has not made us like the nations of the world." Consequently, other nations do not know Hashem's commandments because their souls are not prepared in the same way.<br>In essence, receiving the Torah at Har Sinai transformed Bnei Yisrael into vessels capable of fulfilling Hashem's mitzvot. This unique status, encapsulated in the term 'segula,' underscores why only Bnei Yisrael are drawn to and capable of following Hashem's laws.
The Zohar explains that the pesukim discussing the laws of slaves and maidservants (Eved and Amah) allude to a deeper meaning. Bnei Yisrael are called the ‘sons’ of Hashem, which refers to their souls. However, these souls are clothed in physical bodies, referred to as 'slaves' or 'maidservants'. Hashem's intention is for the body to be elevated by the soul, a unique ability given to Bnei Yisrael.<br>The pesukim state that if a girl is sold as a maidservant and her owner or his son refuses to marry her, she shall go free. This symbolizes the elevation of the body to the soul. Even if the body is not elevated to the highest levels, it must still be protected. The soul remains different and must be safeguarded even if it cannot achieve lofty heights. Man's mission in this world is to repair the body, as stated, “You shall be men of holiness,” referring to Bnei Yisrael's ability to attain lofty holiness. One can elevate the body by drawing holiness from the soul, creating a new existence.<br>The word ‘תהיון’ (you shall be) implies new existence and healing. Breaking physical desires allows the soul to shine, creating a new sense of being. The primary focus should be for the sake of Heaven. Constantly striving for holiness and doing Hashem's will ensures divine assistance. This effort repairs the weekdays, representing physicality, so that even the body can rest and be elevated on Shabbos, as indicated by the pasuk, “Your ox and the son of your maidservant shall rest.”
The pasuk states, "Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest." This teaches that the purpose of the weekdays is to lead to Shabbos, where we rest from our work. Shabbos gives meaning and existence to all actions of the week, as it says, “So that your ox, etc., shall rest.” Shabbos is a taste of the world to come, and by nullifying our weekday activities to it, we elevate physicality and gain the light of the soul.<br>Only the souls of Bnei Yisrael can truly experience this, making Shabbos a testimony to them. Through the efforts of the weekdays, we merit Shabbos. The pasuk describes a rose among thorns, symbolizing those who find holiness even during the week, and merit greater revelation on Shabbos. The Midrash explains that just as people leave the shade of an apple tree during a drought, the nations left Hashem's shade, but Bnei Yisrael remained faithful with “Na’aseh v’nishma.”<br>On Shabbos, Hashem's leadership is revealed, unlike during the week. The Zohar explains that no manna fell on Shabbos because it blesses all other days. Bnei Yisrael, believers and sons of believers, merit the taste of Shabbos. As it states, “For His shade, I longed,” Shabbos allows us to rest under Hashem's Sukkah of Shalom.

In the midrash, thriving olive oil, etc.: Just like there are two types of oil in the olive, the clear [oil] and the oil that comes out through grinding, so too are there two types of oil in the Children of Israel. And there is [also] the <i>aguri</i> olive, the oil which is accumulated [<i>agur</i>] inside it. And it is like this from the angle of the collective of the Children of Israel, and that of every individual. As one who is among the Children of Israel has clear oil in him. And on the individual level, everyone must exert himself to actualize that oil, which is mixed with waste, from its potential. But there needs to be much exertion to refine it, that it be drawn by the wick. For with man, there are the aspects of action, speech, and thought. And the candle refines all of them. As the oil is the aspect of thought; action is in the commandment. [And] when the pure thought is drawn into action, the Torah comes to him through the power of speech. And we have already written in another place, that the generation of Moses, peace be upon him, was the aspect of, one picks [the first olives] at the top of the olive tree and it lights up for all of the generations, as it is written: <i>to raise a light continually</i> (Exodus 27:20). However there is something similar to this in every generation, and even in every individual. As [everyone] has times in which he has pure thoughts. And at the time when such a pure thought is found, it is necessary to cling to it so that it will shed light on other times, to refine even unrefined thoughts from the power of this thought. And this is [the meaning of] <i>that they take for you, etc. clear, etc. to raise a light continually</i>. And on the holy Shabbat, there is a revelation of clear oil in each Jew. For our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, sheds light on the Children of Israel every Shabbat, as it is written in the books. Hence there is no need for refinement on the holy Shabbat since it is the aspect of clarity, the calm waters. And on the work days, it is necessary to bring out the oil that is mixed with the waste. And likewise is it with the generations during the time of the exile. So all of the afflictions that come over the Jewish people are to bring out the oil mentioned above. It is like it is written in the midrash, "All of the nations come, etc. and surround, etc." In any event, it is necessary to see that from the power of afflictions, oil is refined. And that [is the meaning of that] which the prophet rebuked them: <i>A thriving olive tree, etc. He called, etc.</i> (Jeremiah 11:16) — that the afflictions and the exile not, God forbid, be for nothing. Rather, it is to find the oil through them, as mentioned above.

For Purim



Section 1

5631
The pasuk states, "Therefore they called these days ‘Purim’, due to the lottery - פור” (Esther 9:26), indicating that the primary miracle of Purim is tied to the lottery. The difficulty is why the name is ‘Purim’ (plural) when Haman cast only one lot. However, there were actually two lots. The second lot was Bnei Yisrael's lot, as the outcome of Haman's lot directly affected them. Since the lot to destroy Bnei Yisrael was impossible, it had to be reversed, turning Haman's lot into a lot of salvation for Bnei Yisrael.<br>This reversal required prayer and calling out to Hashem for salvation. The prayer "Asher Heni" reflects this, showing that פור (lot) became פורים (lots). The miracle is evident in the lottery, which indicated that Bnei Yisrael should be destroyed according to nature. Their salvation, however, was entirely miraculous, beyond natural means. The lottery demonstrated the natural decree, but Hashem's intervention changed the outcome.<br>The Midrash explains that Haman's letters indicated that "they must be prepared for this day," meaning the lottery determined the event's timing. This was necessary for the events to be reversed for Bnei Yisrael's good, creating two lots. The necessity of the lot being reversed highlights the miraculous nature of the salvation, showing that it was not a natural occurrence but a divine intervention that transformed a decree of destruction into a celebration of life.
The Midrash says that Haman cast lots based on the days of the week, but he did not succeed. He then cast lots based on the months of the year. This raises a question: if it didn't work on the days of the week, why would it have any power based on the months, since it still has to fall on a particular day?<br>The days of the week are dependent on Shabbos, which is given to Bnei Yisrael and fixed. In this realm, Haman has no power. However, the months are also given to Bnei Yisrael, as it states, “This month is yours.” Bnei Yisrael sanctify the new month, drawing newness into nature. This is the difference: Shabbos is above nature, while the months represent Bnei Yisrael's power to bring renewal into nature itself.<br>Haman's primary hatred was the opposite of a tzadik. A tzadik draws life force to creation, while the wicked are disconnected from the source of life. Haman's words, “There is one nation spread around and divided,” hint at Bnei Yisrael's power to bring unity into places of division, even in exile. This angered Haman. The miracle of Purim, “the month that was reversed,” signifies that newness came into nature, causing the miracle. Haman and Amalek had a hold in the natural realm, and this was switched to goodness.
On Purim, Bnei Yisrael re-accepted the Torah, as the Gemara (Shabbos 88a) states: “They accepted it once again during the days of Achashverosh,” and Rashi explains this was out of love for the miracle performed for them. The pasuk states, “They established and accepted,” which parallels na'aseh v'nishma. Typically, acceptance precedes fulfillment, but here, fulfillment came before acceptance, similar to na'aseh v'nishma.<br>The Gemara in Megillah explains that in Heaven, they established what Bnei Yisrael accepted down below. Tosefos questions why the pasuk of קיימו וקיבלו is used again, but it seems that both ideas are connected. The Zohar explains that Bnei Yisrael's commitment to na'aseh before nishma is like “those who fulfill His will to hear His will.” This means that by longing and yearning for Hashem’s words, Bnei Yisrael awaken the divine command.<br>The fulfillment of mitzvot occurs in the physical realm, but the desire to fulfill Hashem’s will reaches above nature, touching the very source of Hashem’s words. By proclaiming “we will do,” Bnei Yisrael awaken Hashem’s will, creating the divine command, which they then hear and fulfill. This is the meaning of “they fulfilled His desire to do,” leading to the creation of the dibur and its acceptance. The sefer Ohr Chadash, quoting Midrash Tanchuma on Noach, states that this reacceptance on Purim specifically refers to the Oral Torah.
The mitzvah of giving mishloach manot aims to foster greater love among Jews. The Midrash explains that Mordechai, referred to as "a Yehudi," signifies "one," illustrating unity. The principle “You shall love your fellow man like yourself” means that when a person connects to the inner life force where all Bnei Yisrael are united, they will naturally love their fellow Jew.<br>Rashi explains that “your fellow man” also refers to Hashem, emphasizing that in the source of inner life force, everything is one. Mordechai represented all of Klal Yisrael, and through love, he united them, bringing merit to Bnei Yisrael. A Yehudi is called "one" because they are connected to this inner life force, the source of unity.<br>The pasuk “And they stand to save their lives” (Esther 9:15) uses a singular expression, similar to how Bnei Yisrael were referred to as 70 Soul (singular) when serving Hashem, who is one. The Chidushei Harim explains that the unity at Har Sinai, expressed as ויחן (singular), was a preparation for receiving the Torah. Similarly, on Purim, this unity helps us re-accept the Torah.
The Chidushei Harim explained that the gathering of Bnei Yisrael to save themselves on Purim parallels the gathering commanded by Hashem when receiving the Torah. This gathering was marked by self-sacrifice. The annihilation of Amalek requires such self-sacrifice, where one nullifies themselves to the source of life force. The 13th of Adar, a day of gathering, symbolizes this necessary unity and dedication.<br>To fully eradicate Amalek, one must connect deeply to the source of life, beyond the soul's realm, where Amalek has no memory or power. This is the essence of the mitzvah of “remembrance” in Parshat Zachor, which involves an inner, heartfelt memory that drives action. Unlike general knowledge, which can be forgotten, this deep remembrance is so embedded in one’s soul that it cannot be forgotten, ensuring that actions are aligned with this profound understanding.<br>The Gemara (Megillah 17a) compares the commandment of remembering to that of fulfilling, indicating that just as actions must be complete and immediate, so too must remembrance be deeply ingrained and immediate. Superficial remembrance, which can be forgotten, is not sufficient. True remembrance is akin to action, fully integrated into one's being. This concept is similar to juxtaposing the blessing of geula (redemption) to tefilla (prayer), symbolizing the elevation to a level above one’s soul, where Amalek has no influence.

"And Mordechai returned to the gate of the king" etc. Our sages say, may their memory be blessed, that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. The explanation for 'and he returned' is that he returned in repentance. This is the way of the tzadik {righteous}, through which he is assisted by HaShem, may He be blessed. He subjugates himself further through the shame from before Him, may He be blessed. And Mordechai regretted that he caused the whole decree. And now HaShem, may He be blessed, did a kindness like this for him. He became further ashamed. And he returned/repented. Because certainly, repentance through the shame is not like that like before {one has shame}. That there are two (ways of gaining) humility. Firstly, through worthlessness {that a person understands that he is worthless}. And the second, through greatness as it is written elsewhere {that a person realises his greatness - who he is and what he has - and  realises that he doesn't deserve  any of it}. And this is the difference between a tzadik {righteous person} and a rasha {a wicked person} as it is written "and Haman went out etc." ... "happy and with a good heart" because of the feast. And this was his downfall. But by Mordechai it says 'and he returned/repented' as written above. Furthermore it is apparent that Mordechai knew that HaShem, may He be blessed, will certainly help the Jewish people as it is written "relief and deliverance" etc. And so it's written "and he knew all that had happened" etc. However through this way, that all tzadikim {righteous}, that even though they know of the salvation, nevertheless they are able to cry out with a truly complete heart as if they didn't know. And someone that isn't {on that level}, the true salvation isn't shown to him. And this is dependent on complete faith that one nullifies his intellect to HaShem, may He be blessed, and he knows and believes that there is no contradiction in any of this, that the salvation arrives through the outcry of man. Even though HaShem, may He be blessed, will not forsake the Jewish people, without question. Nevertheless it is necessary to cry out in a time of distress as it is written "a time of distress" etc. and from that, one will be saved.

When Esther called to "assemble all the Jews who are found in Shushan" (Esther 4:15), they understood that the decree was due to their sin of benefiting from Achashverosh’s banquet. The word הנמצאים (found) is used similarly in Esther 1:5, referring to those who attended the banquet. This word also alludes to Bnei Yisrael, as our sages explain in Bereishis 19:15 "Your two remaining daughters." Through fasting, they repaired their sin and returned to Hashem completely.<br>It is remarkable that the very feast where they sinned also planted the seeds of their salvation, as Vashti's execution during that feast led to Esther becoming queen. This aligns with the teaching that repentance out of love transforms willful sins into merits. Hashem foresaw their complete repentance and thus orchestrated their salvation through the same event.<br>This concept explains Esther's words, “Then I shall go to the king, though it is contrary to the law” (Esther 4:16). Here, the king represents Hashem, and the approach "contrary to the law" signifies that their closeness to Hashem would come through their initial sin. This transformation occurs through sincere repentance, turning their transgression into a means of drawing nearer to Hashem.
The pasuk states, "And every day Mordechai would go and check on Esther" (Esther 2:11). It seems that everything mentioned in the Megillah serves to illustrate the miracles that occurred. It is significant that for four or five years, from the time Esther was taken to Achashverosh's palace, Mordechai visited her daily because she was an orphan and in distress, confined in a foreigner's house. This daily devotion merited the miracle.<br>The phrase “when they spoke to him day after day” (Esther 3:4) regarding Haman's vexation with Mordechai parallels this. Mordechai's consistent visits not only ensured Esther's well-being but also set the stage for overcoming Haman. His daily actions angered Haman and ultimately contributed to the downfall of the wicked Haman.

The Gemara (Shabbos 88b) states that Bnei Yisrael re-accepted the Torah in the days of Achashverosh. Tosefos questions this, noting that they had already accepted the Torah willingly with "Na’ase Venishma." Hashem foresaw their sin with the Golden Calf, causing them to lose the merit of "Na’ase." However, their initial self-sacrifice warranted Hashem forcing the Torah upon them, ensuring it remained even after their sin.<br>The sin of the Golden Calf was influenced by Amalek, who had confused Bnei Yisrael. Thus, erasing Amalek's memory repairs the sin of the Golden Calf. The re-acceptance of the Torah during Achashverosh's time coincided with the obliteration of Amalek's remnants, restoring Bnei Yisrael to their original status of "Na’ase Venishma."<br>This restoration shows that through the defeat of Amalek, Bnei Yisrael could reclaim their original commitment to the Torah, solidifying their relationship with Hashem and reaffirming their willingness to uphold His commandments.

Ki Tisa

Rashi (Shemos 31:13) interprets "אך (only) Keep my Shabbos" to mean that the work of building the Mishkan is not done on Shabbos. The Ramban argues, saying it minimizes Shabbos itself, allowing for transgressions like a bris milah or saving a life. The Chidushei Harim explains Rashi, noting that both the Mishkan and Shabbos elevate creation, but the Torah teaches that the Mishkan's work does not apply on Shabbos. Even weekdays, called mundane, have a hidden aspect of Shabbos. Torah sages are called Shabbos because they remain connected to the source of life from which the six days are blessed. The work of the Mishkan, meant to bring Hashem’s presence, similarly connects to the source. Hence, the 39 actions used in building the Mishkan are the only ones forbidden on Shabbos, as Shabbos reveals the inner mechanism, making further work unnecessary.<br>Before the sin of the Golden Calf, Bnei Yisrael were free from the Satan and Angel of Death, akin to the world to come. After the sin, the Mishkan served as a means to find Hashem’s inner life force in everything. On Shabbos, Moshe returns the crowns of na'aseh v'nishma, reflecting the world to come where nothing is hidden. Therefore, building the Mishkan is forbidden on Shabbos. The word "אך" (only) indicates that on Shabbos, there is no “rust,” only the revelation of Hashem. During the week, the inner light is hidden through work, but Shabbos reveals it.<br>Shabbos gives דעת (knowledge), which means attachment and connection to the inner essence. The wise act with this inner connection, while fools, disconnected from the source, act foolishly. Hashem’s hidden treasure of Shabbos teaches that everything contains Hashem’s light, revealed through Shabbos. Guarding Shabbos allows one to find this light even during the week. “To do the Shabbos” means finding Shabbos in one’s actions through longing for it during the week. Remembering Shabbos involves setting aside something special for Hashem, testifying that all actions are for Him. This is the meaning of “that you shall know that I am Hashem who sanctifies you.” The inner life force in Bnei Yisrael’s actions becomes known through Shabbos, highlighting Hashem’s holiness and separation even in this world.
The Gemara (Beitza 16b) teaches that Shabbos was given in secret. If so, why were the gentiles punished for not accepting it? The answer is that the gentiles knew about Shabbos but didn't know about the reward for keeping it or the extra neshama received on Shabbos. This extra neshama is hinted at in the word וינפש, which can mean: Woe for the nefesh that has been lost.<br>The question arises because וינפש refers to the end of Shabbos when one feels the loss of the neshama. Why is this word used to teach about the extra neshama on Shabbos? The Gemara means that the extra neshama is only realized on Shabbos. Since Shabbos wasn't given to the nations, they can't know about the extra neshama.<br>Therefore, וינפש is appropriately said on Shabbos because it's when we feel the extra neshama. Realizing what we lack during the week can lead to teshuva, drawing Shabbos light into the week. The Ba’al Shem Tov explains that knowing the extra neshama is taken away during the week motivates us not to waste it on Shabbos, aiding in our service of Hashem.

Section 2

(2) Ach.  (Gen. 31:12) "Nevertheless [Ach], you must keep [tishmoru] My sabbaths," and (v.16) "The Israelite people shall keep [v'shamru] the sabbath."  What is this "protection" [reading "sh'm'r" as "protect" rather than as "keep"] that a person must protect Shabbat? Isn't it rather that the person is protected by Shabbat?  "Nevertheless" it is written "et hashabbat" -- he is subsidiary to Shabbat.  [Reading "et" as "with" (and possibly "tishmoru" written defectively as if "tishameiru").  Thus, "the Israelites shall be protected along with Shabbat"; Shabbat is primary, and we are secondary.]  	The idea here is to extend the sanctity of Shabbat into all things.  And in every thing, there is an aspect of Shabbat even on weekdays, but that aspect is conceal ed and hidden on the six days of Creation, and on Shabbat, it is revealed.  And in the time when it is hidden, it needs protection [sh'mirah].  And this is the desire and the longing on the weekdays, that all deeds must be for purposes of Shabbat, to be pleasing [nahat ruah] to HaShem, may He be blessed.  As it says in the literature, that for every action, small or great, there is an elevation on Shabbat if it is done properly.  And all actions must be for purposes of Shabbat, as mentioned above.  And this is the meaning of (v.16) "doing [JPS: observing)] Shabbat" -- that there not be any other doing at all except [the doing of] Shabbat, as mentioned above.  	And we have explained "Nevertheless [Ach]" [you shall keep] My Shabbatot," as our Sages said regarding "'Ach' the gold" (Num. 31:22):  "to remove the tarnish."  See there.  [This statement is attributed to the Sifrei, but is not in the printed Sifrei text.  The statement interprets "Ach" as a limitation -- here, as indicating that the tarnish on the metal implement must be removed before the purification ritual.]  Similarly, the Israelites, when they remove the concealment and the tarnish, there remains the sanctity of Shabbat in every place, as mentioned above.  "[You shall observe the Shabbat, etc.] to know, etc." (Exod. 31:13), for Shabbat provides knowledge to a person.  For clearly the gift of HaShem, may He be blessed, that He gave us Shabbat, included in this is that a person can know and can do Shabbat, as the Sages said (Shab. 10b), "If one makes a gift, etc., he must inform him [beforehand], as it is written (Exod. 31:13), 'that you may know [that I the Lord sanctify you].'"  For "knowledge" [y'di'ah] is being connected and cleaving [as in "Adam knew Hava"], for if the connection and cleaving of the Jews with the aspect of Shabbat had not been included in the gift of Shabbat, then there would not have been any gift at all.
The pasuk (Shemos 31:16) states, "Bnei Yisrael shall guard Shabbos," which is both a commandment and a promise that Bnei Yisrael will always guard Shabbos. It is written (Shabbos 88a) that Moshe returns the crowns of na’ase and nishma on Shabbos, indicating that the sin of the Golden Calf did not affect Shabbos. Thus, Shabbos is a taste of the world to come, free of negative forces.<br>Similarly, Adam’s sin did not affect Shabbos, as he was protected and accepted by it (Pirkei DeRabi Eliezer 19:3). Shabbos is hidden in Hashem’s treasure house, as Hashem told Moshe, “I have a great gift called Shabbos.” This hiding protects Shabbos from the negative power of sin.<br>Shabbos remains untouched by sin, retaining its sanctity and serving as a divine promise and a taste of the world to come. This ensures that Bnei Yisrael can always connect to its elevated spiritual state.
The Midrash (Bereishis Rabba 11:8) says Shabbos complained to Hashem that each weekday has a partner, while Shabbos does not. Hashem replied that Bnei Yisrael would be its partner. This needs clarification.<br>The six weekdays are more hidden because they are sourced in a higher place than Shabbos. Their elevated status requires hiddenness, and their essence is not fully revealed in this world. Weekdays are governed by an angel, adding a layer of concealment. In contrast, Shabbos directly reveals Hashem's glory, connecting this world to its life source in the upper worlds.<br>Shabbos's complaint was about not having a partner that receives from it like other days. Hashem responded that Bnei Yisrael would be Shabbos’s partner, as Shabbos is "between Me and Bnei Yisrael." The glory of Hashem on Shabbos is revealed only to Bnei Yisrael, who then draw life force to the entire world. Thus, the nations receive Shabbos's blessings through Bnei Yisrael, explaining the unique relationship between Shabbos and Bnei Yisrael.

Section 3

5633
(Shemos 31:13) “You shall guard My Shabbos’s” uses the plural expression. This is because everything in the world derives its life force from Shabbos, the point that completes and sustains it. As Rashi explains on Bereishis 2:2, with Shabbos, Hashem's work was completed, indicating that Shabbos completes and sustains all creation. On Shabbos, this life source is awakened in everything, returning all to its source, hence the term "rest."<br>Rashi explains the double expression שבת שבתון (Shemos 31:15) as a restful repose, not a casual rest. This means that while every Jew ceases work on Shabbos, it should not feel burdensome. Instead, one should long for Shabbos throughout the week, anticipating the return to the source of life and rest. This longing is the true meaning of שמירה (guarding or longing for Shabbos), as one eagerly awaits Shabbos to reconnect with their primary life force.<br>The word אך (only) in אך את שבתותי implies that one's desire should be solely for Hashem, the source of life, which we connect with on Shabbos. The phrase לעשות את השבת (to make the Shabbos) means drawing the holiness of Shabbos into all actions during the week, where special protection is needed. This guarding ensures that the sanctity of Shabbos influences every aspect of daily life, as previously explained.

Section 4

5635
(Shemos 31:13) “Speak to the Bnei Yisrael and say: Nevertheless, you must keep My Shabbos’s, for this is a sign between Me and you throughout the ages, that you may know that I Hashem have sanctified you.” This teaches us that one must guard the essence of Shabbos in everything, even during the weekdays.<br>The purpose of creation is fulfilled when Hashem’s creation acts to honor Him, striving to do His will as best as they can, even if they are not sure how. This gives Hashem pleasure. The plural form שבתותי indicates that this principle applies continuously, not just on Shabbos. Shabbos is a sign of the connection between Bnei Yisrael and Hashem, as the Torah, Bnei Yisrael, and Hashem are one. This means Bnei Yisrael are connected to the primary Life source.<br>When Bnei Yisrael elevate everything to its source and connect to Hashem’s inner life force, their own energy is awakened. This is the meaning of לדעת כי אני ה' מקדישכם, “you shall know that I am Hashem who sanctifies you.” The more Hashem’s power is awakened, the more Bnei Yisrael’s power is also awakened. Rashi explains that even the commandment of building the Mishkan does not override Shabbos, teaching us that in every action, even a mitzvah, one must remember the primary intention of fulfilling Hashem’s will without personal gain, only for the sake of Heaven. This brings great praise, as it returns the action to Hashem, connecting and uplifting the doer.
Rashi (Shemos 31:13) explains the double expression שבת שבתון to mean that rest should be reposeful and not casual. We interpret this to mean that casual rest occurs when one has nothing to do and then rests. Reposeful rest, however, happens when a person works hard on a task and then rests upon its completion, achieving true rest. The work is done with the intention of reaching this stage of rest.<br>Similarly, Hashem's "rest" after creating the world in six days was this type of reposeful rest. We learn from this that man's rest on Shabbos should also be of this nature. The pasuk says, “Six days you shall work,” followed by “and on the seventh day rest,” indicating that the work of the week should lead to and fulfill the purpose of Shabbos.<br>All the work done during the week should aim to fulfill Hashem's will, culminating in Shabbos. This concept is supported by the idea that all actions during the week are elevated on Shabbos (See Be’er Mayim Chaim, Shemos 20:11).
The Chidushei Harim explained לעשות את השבת, “To make the Shabbos,” based on the Ramban's explanation of Avraham Avinu asking for a sign about inheriting Eretz Yisrael. The Ramban stated that an action strengthens a promise, making it tangible. Similarly, performing physical mitzvot makes their heavenly roots everlasting.<br>For Shabbos, “to make the Shabbos” means that observing it gives Shabbos tangibility in this world. Although the mitzvah involves not working, this abstention is considered an action, similar to how refraining from muzzling an animal verbally is still an action in halacha. By not working on Shabbos, we actively sustain its sanctity.<br>The phrase לעשות את השבת connects to “as a covenant forever,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael should make Shabbos an eternal covenant by incorporating its essence into all aspects of life, even during the week, as suggested by the plural form שבתותי.
The Gemara (Beitza 16b) teaches that Shabbos was given in secret, as it says, “It is a sign between Me and Bnei Yisrael.” If so, why were the gentiles punished for not accepting it? The answer is that while the gentiles knew about Shabbos, they did not know about the reward for keeping it or the extra neshama received on Shabbos.<br>The idea of an extra neshama is explained in the Midrash (Bereishis Rabba 11:8), where Shabbos complains to Hashem that all other days have a partner, but Shabbos does not. Hashem replies that Bnei Yisrael will be Shabbos’ partner. The days of the week are the energy of creation, as each day has its mazal in Heaven that commands growth. Creation receives from these days, which are upper lights, and since they give to creation, they gain more energy in Heaven. This is the concept of the days having a partner.<br>However, on Shabbos, Hashem ceased creating, and nothing was created on Shabbos. Therefore, Shabbos has no partner because creation does not receive from Shabbos’s light. Shabbos is the neshama (soul) of the days of creation. Bnei Yisrael, being the neshama of creation, depend on them to awaken the life force in everything. Thus, they can receive the light of Shabbos. Shabbos gives to Bnei Yisrael, gaining an extra neshama, which is like a soul for the soul, and through this, Bnei Yisrael channel this energy to the entire creation.

"However you shall guard My Shabbos’s for it is a sign between Me and you" (Shemos 31:13). The pasuk begins with the plural "Shabbos’s" yet continues in the singular "it." Why does it switch?<br>The explanation is that the word "My Shabbos’s" is used intentionally. How can Bnei Yisrael guard Shabbos, given its elevated holiness? Surely, the one who guards should be greater than the one being guarded. The answer lies in the spreading of Shabbos's holiness into each Yisrael. Shabbos leaves an imprint on the heart of every Yisrael who keeps it. This imprint needs to be guarded.<br>This imprint is the sign between Hashem and Bnei Yisrael. Even if the nations of the world keep Shabbos, they will not feel this effect in their souls. However, Bnei Yisrael, who receive an extra soul on Shabbos, must be careful not to damage the light of Shabbos through their actions. This is why they are commanded to guard Shabbos.
The Midrash (Tanchuma Ki Tisa 16) explains the pasuk “And He gave Moshe, upon finishing speaking to him…” After all the time on Har Sinai, Moshe admitted he couldn't fully grasp the Torah, so Hashem gave it to him as a gift.<br>The word ככלותו (upon finishing) indicates that everything depends on the completion of an action. In any mitzvah, a person cannot connect to its source without divine help. By fulfilling the mitzvah, one shows the intention to connect to its holiness, and Hashem then opens the gates of understanding. This understanding comes only at the end of the action, so one who stops midway misses the primary intention.<br>This is why the mitzvah is credited to the one who completes it. The word ככלותו signifies that Moshe merited receiving the Torah as a gift because he did not stop midway but completed everything within his power. Additionally, ככלותו can refer to the soul's longing for Hashem. Since Moshe did everything he could to fulfill Hashem's command, he received the Torah as a gift. Similarly, each person can achieve their unique portion of Hashem's Torah according to their effort, as we pray, "And give us our portion in Your Torah."

Section 6

5637
The pasuk (Shemos 31:13) states, “And you shall speak to Bnei Yisrael... אך את שבתותי תשמורו - only guard My Shabbos’s.” Rashi explains that the word אך - "only," teaches us that the work of building the Mishkan is forbidden on Shabbos. The Gemara (Shabbos 10b) mentions that Hashem told Moshe, "I have a very good gift in My treasure house, it is Shabbos, go and tell them." This is puzzling, as the commandment of Shabbos was already given to Bnei Yisrael. However, our sages explain that when Bnei Yisrael accepted the Torah, they repaired the world to the level it was before the sin of Adam. At creation, Hashem saw that the light was good and hid it, knowing the world was not ready for it due to sin. When Bnei Yisrael accepted the Torah, they received crowns representing this hidden light. After the sin of the Golden Calf, these crowns were removed because they sensed the presence of evil and feared misusing the hidden light.<br>The Mishkan was a means to repair the sin by drawing Hashem’s presence into the physical world through specific actions. Before the sin, Bnei Yisrael were above physical actions, reflecting the concept of na’aseh before nishma. Despite the sin, Hashem comforted Bnei Yisrael by telling them that Shabbos remains as it was before the sin. This is why Shabbos is described as a good gift hidden in Hashem’s treasure house, unaffected by sin. The word אך - "only," indicates that while other mitzvot were affected by the sin, Shabbos remained unchanged.<br>Shabbos was given in hiding, meaning no foreign element can affect it. The nullification of work on Shabbos ensures that the realm of action and sin cannot touch it. This explains the teaching that one who guards Shabbos, even if they have committed severe sins, is forgiven. The sin does not hinder the mitzvah of Shabbos. This was a comfort to Bnei Yisrael, knowing they retained Shabbos as it was before the sin. Shabbos reveals the hidden light, as it will be after the final repair, and strengthens us to carry its light into the weekdays. The Ba’al Shem Tov explains that knowing the light will depart after Shabbos makes one cling to it more, enhancing its impact.
On the pasuk (Shemos 32:19) “And he (Moshe) broke the luchos,” the Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 46:1) states that Moshe connected himself integrally to Bnei Yisrael and said to Hashem: Bnei Yisrael have sinned and I too have sinned; if You forgive them, forgive me too. This is difficult to understand. Furthermore, it is stated that Moshe broke the luchos because he saw the letters flying away.<br>The explanation is that the Torah’s presence depends on the preparedness of Bnei Yisrael, the recipients. The Torah was engraved on the luchos, symbolizing freedom from the evil inclination and death. The engraving on the luchos was a reflection of the Torah being engraved on the hearts of Bnei Yisrael. When they sinned, the letters flew off the luchos because the Torah was no longer engraved in their hearts.<br>However, Moshe did not sin and had the ability to retain the Torah, as Hashem offered to make him a great nation. But Moshe chose to remain with Bnei Yisrael, integrating himself with them. He valued the collective Bnei Yisrael more than the luchos, knowing Hashem’s love for them. This connection caused the letters to fly off the luchos, leading Moshe to break them. By integrating himself with Bnei Yisrael, Moshe actually helped repair and save them. Since Moshe did not sin, his connection to Bnei Yisrael meant that, on a collective level, they did not sin. The Chidushei Harim explained that Hashem’s use of the singular “I am Hashem your G-d” gave Moshe an opening to argue that the command was directed at him alone, not Bnei Yisrael. This unity with Moshe provided an argument for their defense, as their sin caused a fall from this unity, making the command less applicable to them. The primary sin was their fall from unity, making the actual sin less severe.

Section 7

5638
The pasuk (Shemos 31:13) states, “Only guard My Shabbos’s, for it is a sign between Me and Bnei Yisrael.” The word אך - "only," seems out of place. Rashi explains that it teaches us that Shabbos is excluded from the building of the Mishkan, meaning it is forbidden to build the Mishkan on Shabbos. Bnei Yisrael fell from their high level due to the sin of the Golden Calf, damaging their commitment of נעשה (doing). This was repaired through the building of the Mishkan, which purified the 39 melachot, representing all human actions. Through the effort of performing these actions in holiness, one merits to find Hashem’s presence everywhere.<br>The day of Shabbos, however, was not tainted by the sin. Therefore, it is stated (Shabbos 88a) that Moshe returns the crowns to Bnei Yisrael on Shabbos. This is the meaning of אך - "only," indicating that the mitzvah of Shabbos remains pure and untainted in every generation. As it states, “It is a sign.” We explained elsewhere that אך (only) implies purity without sediment, just as gold must be purified by removing any rust. Thus, guarding Shabbos remains clean without needing further purification. This is why Bnei Yisrael must be extra cautious with this mitzvah.<br>Similarly, all mitzvot called אות (sign), like Tefillin and circumcision, reflect the attachment to Hashem. The double expression שבת שבתון teaches that rest should be completely relaxing, not just a temporary stop from weekday work. Shabbos is a preparation for the world to come, a “taste” of it. Therefore, one should train to forget all weekday actions when Shabbos arrives, making it easier to attain true rest in the world to come.
(Shemos 32:15) states, “The luchos were the handiwork of Hashem…” We need to understand the advantage of having the commandments written on the luchos. It might seem that hearing Hashem speak at Har Sinai is greater than receiving the luchos, yet the Torah emphasizes the significance of the luchos.<br>The idea is that the commandments were not only written on the luchos but also engraved on the hearts of each Yisrael, as expressed by “write them on the luach of your heart.” Bnei Yisrael’s commitment of "na'aseh v'nishma" (we will do and we will hear) allowed them to hear Hashem's voice at Har Sinai and aimed to repair the world of action completely.<br>This is the meaning of “the handiwork of Hashem.” Had Bnei Yisrael not sinned, they would have comprehended the Torah on the level of action, and their bodies would have been purified, free from the angel of death and the evil inclination. Now, since we did not retain this level, we must reawaken it through toiling in Torah, focusing on "nishma" (listening to the commandments). As our sages taught, after the sin, Hashem advised Bnei Yisrael to guard "nishma" since they ruined "na'aseh." In the future, when all actions are repaired, the Torah will be given to us on the level of action, fulfilling “the handiwork of Hashem.”

Tisa and Parshat Parah. Mixed items.
The pasuk (Shemos 31:18) states, “And He gave Moshe (the Torah) after forty days…” This teaches that for forty days, Moshe learned and forgot, only receiving the Torah as a gift at the end, bringing salvation.<br>Moshe's intense effort, not eating or drinking for forty days, elevated him to the level of angels. The word ככלותו signifies both completion and intense longing. Moshe's soul reached a state of כלות הנפש (soul's expiration) due to his deep yearning for the Torah.<br>Thus, the pasuk says, “When He completed speaking to him.” Moshe reached a state beyond words, and only then did Hashem give him the Torah as a gift, emphasizing the importance of complete effort and longing before divine assistance is granted.

Vayakhel and Parshat Shekalim
(Shemos 36:5-6) states, “The people are bringing more than is needed for the tasks entailed in the work that Hashem has commanded to be done.” Moshe then proclaimed, “Let no man or woman make further effort toward gifts for the Mishkan,” and the people stopped bringing. The Torah’s detailed description of the extra gifts brought by Bnei Yisrael needs explanation. The tzadikim and wise men saw that the generosity of Bnei Yisrael had spread more than necessary, causing concern that the donations would no longer be given purely for the sake of Heaven. Everything should follow the intention of לשם שמים (for the sake of Heaven).<br>The Ba’al Shem Tov explains that everything has an element of going forth and returning. Through one's actions in service of Hashem, one should feel fear and humility. When a person completes something good, they may become haughty, but by returning to the awareness of standing before Hashem, the action is properly repaired. Moshe and the sages wanted to protect the actions of Bnei Yisrael from foreign intentions. The Sefer Ohr HaChaim addresses the seemingly contradictory statement that their efforts were both enough and extra. He explains that since Bnei Yisrael's donations were given with true generosity, Hashem rewarded them by including the extra in the Mishkan. According to our explanation, the act of holding back repaired and protected the generosity, ensuring it was all for the sake of Heaven.<br>The Chidushei Harim explains the pasuk (Shir HaShirim 7:2), “How lovely are your feet in shoes, O daughter of nobles,” to mean that generosity needs protection, so the desire to give does not spread to other things. This is the meaning of the Mishna (Shekalim 1:1) about announcing the Shekalim and kil’ayim: to remind people that generosity should be focused correctly. Furthermore, the word כלאים (forbidden grafting) is connected to וַיִּכָּלֵ֥א (stopped bringing), indicating the idea of holding back in generosity, as in the rule that the wealthy cannot give more than a half Shekel.
In the name of the Chidushei Harim, on the pasuk (Shemos 35:22): “And the men came above the women” (to bring donations to the Mishkan). This aligns with the teaching that "In the place where ba’alei teshuva stand, even completely righteous cannot stand" (Berachot 34b).<br>The men who sinned with the golden calf brought more fervor than the women who did not sin. Their intense repentance added greater energy to their donations. Teshuva involves redirecting the desire for sin into serving Hashem. By doing so, one transforms the desire into a positive force.<br>Desires not directed toward Hashem teach us how to serve Him. Redirecting these desires returns them to their proper place. This level, achieved by ba’alei teshuva, is beyond the reach of the completely righteous, who lack the experience of intense desire and its transformation.
Furthermore, in the name of the Chidushei Harim, on the pasuk (Bamidbar 28:2): “Command Bnei Yisrael and say to them: the offerings of food due Me, as offerings by fire of pleasing odor to Me, you shall guard to bring in its slated time.”<br>Hashem gives bounty to the entire creation, as it says, “He renews in His goodness the creation of Bereishis, constantly.” However, through the service of Bnei Yisrael (the Korbanot), they draw down extra bounty from Hashem, which is greater than the original bounty. Hashem requests that Bnei Yisrael guard this bounty to be given through the “pleasing odor” (the korbanot) and not merely through “nature.”<br>This is the meaning of “the offerings of food due Me, as offerings by fire.” The bounty Hashem gives to creation should be protected by Bnei Yisrael to be a “pleasing odor.” This is why daily prayers were instituted in place of the korbanot. Through blessings and gratitude, Bnei Yisrael testify that everything is from Hashem, Who constantly renews creation.

Section 2

5636
(Shemos 35:1-2) states, “And Moshe gathered the entire Bnei Yisrael and said to them: These are the things that Hashem has commanded you to do. Six days work may be done, but the seventh day shall be a Shabbos of complete rest, holy to Hashem; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.”<br>This commandment about Shabbos precedes the building of the Mishkan. The Mishkan's construction relies on the unity from gathering together, which brings Hashem's presence “among them” (Bnei Yisrael). The Midrash explains that Hashem said, “I will dwell in them,” not just in the Mishkan, as the Alshich notes in Parshat Terumah (Shemos 25:8). This gathering is the essence of Shabbos.<br>By commanding Shabbos, Moshe effectively gathered Bnei Yisrael. The phrase “These are the things that Hashem commanded” can also refer to the act of gathering. This unity elevates Bnei Yisrael and brings Hashem’s presence among them, earning them the title of Knesset Yisrael.
(Shemos 35:2) “Six days work shall be done.” The six days of the week correspond to the six directions: the four cardinal directions, plus up and down. This represents the gathering of all energies and traits, forming a “hall” for the inner point, which is Shabbos. This concept parallels the building of the Mishkan, as it says (Yeshaya 66:1), “What house can you build for Me?” The Mishkan serves as a physical manifestation of this ingathering, creating a sacred space for Hashem’s presence.
(Shemos 35:5) “Take from you a teruma donation.” (What is the meaning of the word מאתכם - from you?) The explanation is that the energy of Hashem’s presence among us is called את, encompassing all the letters of the Torah from Alef to Tav. This divine energy assists Bnei Yisrael.<br>This point of using Hashem's energy ensures that whoever desires with a complete heart, as the pasuk says, “All the generosity of one’s heart,” will definitely be able to bring the teruma of Hashem.
On the pasuk (Shemos 36:7) “the work was enough...and extra,” the Ohr HaChaim asks how this can be, as "extra" seems to contradict "enough." The wise men realized that the donations to the Mishkan were more than what was truly felt in the hearts of the people. This led Moshe to command that no more donations be brought, for it is better to give a little with true intention than a lot without it.<br>The Torah clarifies that the necessary work for the Mishkan was completed with the right intention. The phrase “the work was enough” indicates that the essential contributions were given with the proper heart. The concern was that bringing more than what was intended could not be used for the Mishkan, as it lacked the necessary intentionality.<br>Additionally, "enough" can refer to the merit of those who donated with their full hearts, indicating that their contributions were sufficient. The term “extra” signifies that not only did they bring enough with full intention, but they also brought more. This dual meaning emphasizes both the adequacy of the contributions and the abundance of the people's generosity. Elsewhere, this concept is explained slightly differently.

Section 3

5637
Vayakhel and Pekudei
(Shemos 35:1-2) states, “And Moshe gathered the entire Bnei Yisrael and said to them...six days work shall be done, etc.” The simple meaning is that Moshe gathered Bnei Yisrael to instruct them about the laws of building the Mishkan. However, Moshe first introduced the laws of Shabbos because this mitzvah truly gathered them together. Through the sin of the Golden Calf, Bnei Yisrael lost their unity. The Midrash explains that the commandment of אלה (these) in our parsha was to repair the sin of אלה in the Golden Calf: “These are your gods, Yisrael.” They fell into disconnection and multiplicity, which was repaired through the Mishkan, bringing together all parts and connecting them to unity.<br>The Mishkan involved the 39 forms of work, representing the source of all actions, returning them to unity. The way to achieve this unity is through Shabbos, a mitzvah never lost from them, even in the sin of the Golden Calf. On Shabbos, they unified at the source of unity. Therefore, the commandment of the Mishkan is preceded by the commandment of Shabbos. This represents the concept of כלל (general rule) and פרט (individual). Each needs the other: Shabbos is the general rule, and the weekdays involve purifying the individual parts, nullifying them to Shabbos. Parshat Pekudei accounts for all the individual parts of the Mishkan, while Parshat Vayakhel connects these parts to the general rule through Shabbos.<br>The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 51:1) applies the pasuk (Mishlei 28:20) to Moshe: “A dependable man (אמונות) will receive many blessings.” The Midrash questions why everything in the Mishkan is explicitly counted in the Torah, given the rule that blessing rests on things that are not counted. However, since the counting was done through Moshe, a dependable man (אמונות), it was still blessed. This teaches that through emuna (faith), which involves drawing and connecting all the different parts to unite them with the klal (unity), even more blessing is showered on all the individual parts.
(Shemos 37:5-6) describes Bnei Yisrael’s eagerness to bring gifts to the Mishkan: “They saw that the nation was bringing plenty...and they proclaimed no man or woman shall bring more, and the nation stopped bringing.” This can be explained in line with the Midrash Tanchuma (Pekudei 11), which states that “And Moshe saw all the work” refers not only to the work of the Mishkan but also to the creation of the world. The building of the Mishkan was meant to repair and complete the creation.<br>Just as in creation, where it says, "Hashem saw all that He had created and it was very good...and it was complete...and He blessed it," so too in the Mishkan, it was through "And Moshe saw all the work...and he blessed them." The Zohar explains that Hashem created the world with the power of the Torah, and the tzadikim sustain the world with the power of the Torah. When Moshe saw that they had repaired all the creatures and the entire creation, he blessed them. The words לעשות אותם mean "to repair," showing that their actions completed and repaired the creation.<br>This parallels the creation where Heaven and earth expanded until Hashem said, "enough." Similarly, Bnei Yisrael brought donations until they were told to stop. The words “the work was enough...and extra” seem contradictory, but they show that donations were meant to be extra until told to stop. This extra was included in the work of the Mishkan. Just as Hashem delayed creating spirits until dusk, showing the world's incompleteness, the Mishkan’s extra donations show that the world’s completion comes through Torah and mitzvos. The tzadikim give the world existence, while negative forces have power due to the world's lack of completion. Bnei Yisrael’s extra donations, though stopped, reflect this idea. The rich must hold back, and the poor must give more than they can, showing humility and reliance on Hashem, who completes their efforts.

Section 4

5638
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 48:6) explains that through the donations to the Mishkan, Bnei Yisrael repaired the sin of the Golden Calf. The reason is that through their generosity, they reconnected with their true good core, as Bnei Yisrael are called “the daughter of nobles”. This generosity is inherent in their essence and inherited from their forefathers.<br>In contrast, the nations of the world, even if they give all the wealth of their house, do not do so with true generosity. Their kindness is often self-serving, as indicated by the phrase “The kindness of the nations is a sin”. Their actions are not for the sake of Hashem. Only Bnei Yisrael are called generous at the core of their souls, as their generosity is genuine and rooted in their essence.

Section 5

5639
“From the parsha of Vayakhel and Pekudei, much has been forgotten by me; I only remember a little.”
The Parsha of Vayakhel begins with the commandment of Shabbos. Even though Shabbos is defined by not doing any work, it is nevertheless what repairs all work. This is because of the concept of "nullifying it, gives it existence." When all work is nullified on Shabbos, this holding back actually gives the work its true existence.<br>This is what Rashi (Shemos 20:9) means when he says, "one’s rest on Shabbos should be reposeful, as if all of one’s work is done." Through Shabbos, one’s work is indeed completed. Shabbos has the power to complete everything that a person stopped doing due to the Shabbos restriction.<br>The parshiot of Vayakhel and Pekudei represent the general (klal) and the specific (prat). Vayakhel is the general principle, embodying the essence of Shabbos when everything becomes one in the secret of unity. This is what is meant by “These are the words that Hashem has commanded,” referring to the gathering mentioned at the beginning, which is the concept of Shabbos. Pekudei, on the other hand, is the specific, detailing the individual elements counted for the Mishkan. The klal (general) needs the prat (specific), and the prat needs the klal.

Section 6

5640
Vayakhel-Pekudei Briefly
(Shemos 36:7) states, “The work was enough for all that was needed to build the Mishkan, and extra.” The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 12:13) explains that the Mishkan parallels the creation, as it says by the Mishkan ותכל (and it was completed), and by creation ויכלו (and Hashem completed). The purpose of building the Mishkan was to repair the realm of action. Before the sin of the Golden Calf, Bnei Yisrael had reached a level of complete perfection, free from physical desires. After the sin, they needed to repair the level of action, which was done through giving from the heart. This hidden point in the soul of each Yisrael, through their donations, repaired everything.<br>The word די (enough) means that their contributions were sufficient to repair all that needed repairing, for all the work of heaven and earth. The word לעשות (to do) connotes repairing. The word והותר (extra) signifies that once nature was properly corrected, the spirit of Hashem rested upon it, bringing blessings from above. This is the secret of the extra soul received on Shabbos, elevating and repairing the entire creation, as explained elsewhere (Yisro תרמ"ה).<br>When the wise men came to Moshe and said the nation was bringing too much, it was because they realized the donations exceeded the true feelings of the heart. Moshe commanded them to stop bringing more because it is better to give a little with true intention than a lot without it. The Taz explains that doing less with full intention is better. The wise men sensed through their holy spirit that the extra was not given with the correct intention, and thus it was not used. This extra allowed for some connection and repair for the nations of the world, as hinted by the Midrash. The smell of the ketoret symbolized that Bnei Yisrael had repaired the world of action, allowing all mankind to come closer to Hashem. This demonstrated the great level of perfection attained by Bnei Yisrael, enabling blessings from above to rest upon them.
“The nation is bringing too much” (Shemos 36:5) refers to the "erev rav," the converts who joined Bnei Yisrael, known as העם. This extra was not used because it came from them.<br>However, the intense longing of Bnei Yisrael influenced the erev rav. Bnei Yisrael's powerful desire created a "smell" that drew the erev rav to donate. This is the idea of the "leftover" explained above.
"And they continued to bring freewill offerings to him, morning after morning” (Shemos 36:3). The primary idea is to give a freewill offering with one's full heart at the start of each day. Each morning, a new desire awakens in the soul of every Yisrael.<br>Our sages (Yuma 75a) explain that the daily gift refers to the manna, which fell each morning along with precious stones. This aligns with the idea of a new desire each day. Similarly, the pasuk in Tehillim (145:15) states, “He satisfies all living creatures with desire,” indicating the spiritual nourishment found in the manna.

Section 7

5641
On the pasuk “the nation is bringing too much” (Shemos 36:5), we have written elsewhere that the sages realized the extra donations were not given perfectly. The desire and understanding often exceed what is accomplished in action. For the Mishkan, they only accepted gifts given with absolute perfection.<br>It states, “One who gives a lot and one who gives a little (are equal) so long as their intention is for the sake of Heaven” (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 1:3). One who gives a lot needs extra protection to ensure it is for the sake of Heaven. The Tur (ibid) seems to understand this as well.<br>The wise builders of the Mishkan ensured their wisdom flowed into their actions, not just remained as thoughts. This is the idea of the pasuk “To think thoughts to do” (Shemos 35:35), meaning action should not be disconnected from thought and understanding.

Section 8

5642
The pasuk (Shemos 35:27) states, “And the princes brought…” The word והנשיאים (the princes) is written without a yud. Rashi and the Midrash explain this was because they were lazy in bringing gifts to the Mishkan, intending to bring what was missing last.<br>This teaches that those on a high level must be especially careful about alacrity (zerizut), as it leads to piety (chasidut). Initially, everyone has zeal in their service of Hashem, but as one ascends to higher levels, they may lose this alacrity, which is a significant deficiency.<br>Therefore, someone on a lower level can surpass them through alacrity. As it says in Mishlei 22:29, “See a man quick in his work, before kings he stands,” meaning he stands before kings because he is first. This is also reflected in “Alacrity precedes mitzvot” (Rosh HaShana 32b). Alacrity enables one to attain higher levels than their current status.
(Shemos 35:5) states, “Anyone whose heart is so moved - (literally generosity of the heart).” The explanation is that one needs to bring the gift with their entire generosity. This means placing all the desires in one's heart into this act of giving.<br>Additionally, through this act of generosity towards the Mishkan, they rectify their entire attribute of generosity. By giving to the Mishkan, they bring with it all the generosity in their heart, as explained above.

From Parshat Vayakhel-Pekudei and Parshat Hachodesh
The Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 48:1) explains the pasuk (Yeshaya 40:25-26) “And to whom will you compare Me…says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high and see, who created these?” All closeness to Hashem comes through nullification and elevation of the lower realms, connecting to Hashem's power. Every part of creation has a spark of holiness, which is its life force and soul.<br>Everything Hashem created is for His sake, as our sages explain, meaning “for His testimony” to testify about Him. The soul and life force in everything testify that nothing can create itself. On a universal level, Bnei Yisrael are the soul and life force of creation, testifying to Hashem's existence, as the pasuk states (Yirmiya 2:3) “Yisrael sanctified it Hashem.” This is the Terumah gift from creation, as the pasuk states (Devarim 32:9) “the portion of Hashem is Yisrael,” and (Yeshaya 43:10) “You are my witnesses.”<br>After the sin of the Golden Calf, the pasuk states “Take from you a Teruma,” and (Shemot 38:21) “The Mishkan of Testimony.” Bnei Yisrael now needed the Mishkan to find the testimony and clarify the G-dly element in everything. Previously, Bnei Yisrael themselves were the witnesses, but now they relied on the Mishkan. The clarity of the testimony is relevant to the brightness of the light of the neshama. Therefore, Shabbos is called “testimony,” as it is the day of souls. Through the Mishkan, the life force in the hearts of Bnei Yisrael was awakened. Our sages state (Shabbos 22b) that the Mishkan is proof that Hashem's presence rests among Bnei Yisrael. Bnei Yisrael were changed, becoming like heavenly angels, drawing down light to the entire world. “He renews in His Goodness, the entire creation every moment,” refers to Bnei Yisrael, who receive the hidden good - the soul of life. It is through Bnei Yisrael that this renewal is drawn to the entire world, as the pasuk states (Shemoth 12:2) “This month is yours.”
The Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 54:4) states, “Many daughters fought valiantly, yet you rose above them,” referring to Moshe who erected the Mishkan. Although Moshe erected it alone, the entire Bnei Yisrael contributed. Their collective efforts enabled Moshe to attain higher levels to complete the Mishkan.<br>Similarly, the Midrash Vayikra (Tanchuma 3) explains, “I have uplifted a youth from the nation” (Tehillim 89:20), referring to Moshe. Just as Teruma uplifts everything, Moshe was the Teruma of Bnei Yisrael. In Shemot 39:33, “They brought all the work to Moshe,” shows that Bnei Yisrael’s preparations allowed Moshe to uplift it all. Thus, while Moshe played a central role, the contributions of Bnei Yisrael were integral, making him the Teruma that uplifted the entire nation.

Parshat Vayakhel-Pekudei and Parshat Hachodesh
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 51:1) quotes the pasuk in Mishlei (28:20), “A dependable man (a man of emuna) will receive many blessings,” and questions why the items in the Mishkan were counted, given the principle that blessing rests on something hidden from sight.<br>The answer, also brought in the Zohar, is that since the counting was done by Moshe, it merited blessing. The explanation is that while material abundance is associated with this world, true unity and oneness are closer to holiness. As explained in the Sefer Hayashar (11th sha’ar), the closer something is to holiness, the less divided it becomes.<br>Through proper emuna, which means connecting everything to its source of unity, even material things in this world can draw divine light. This concept is embodied in the Mishkan, which draws divine light into physical actions. The Mishkan was established on Rosh Chodesh Nisan, symbolizing renewal and unity, achieved through Moshe, who represented the illuminating light of divine connection.

Section 2

5632
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 51:1) quotes the pasuk in Mishlei (28:20), “A dependable man (a man of emuna) will receive many blessings, and one who is in a hurry to get rich will not go unpunished.” The Midrash questions why the items in the Mishkan were counted, as blessing typically rests on things hidden from sight. The Zohar answers that since the counting was done through Moshe, the blessing could still rest on it.<br>The principle is that blessing does not rest on something counted because counting separates each item, making it independent. However, when something is not counted, it remains part of a whole unit, which is always connected to the source of blessing. A man of emuna is drawn to the source, even when performing physical actions, knowing that everything is from Hashem. This awareness allows blessing to rest on his actions, contrasting with someone who is in a hurry to become rich.<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that the term for possessions, נכסים, is related to נכסין (covered), indicating that blessing rests on what is hidden. This concept underscores that true wealth comes from recognizing Hashem's role in providing it. On Shabbos, blessing rests on everything because all things unite and connect to their source, becoming a vessel for blessing. This unity and connection to the source of life enable the blessing to rest, even on counted items.

Section 3

5635
(Shemos 38:21) states, “These are the countings of the Mishkan of testimony.” The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 51:4) explains that it was a testimony that Hashem forgave Bnei Yisrael for the sin of the Golden Calf. The Gemara (Shabbos 22b) adds that it is a testimony that Hashem’s presence still rests among them.<br>The building of the Mishkan was a repair for the sin of the Golden Calf. Before the sin, there was no need for physical work because Bnei Yisrael had exclaimed “na'aseh v'nishma” (we will do and we will hear), nullifying the need for action. After the sin, they needed to purify through the work of the Mishkan by doing Hashem's will “as He commanded.” This was a testimony that they retained their status as Bnei Yisrael, unique to Hashem, despite the sin.<br>The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 51:2) mentions that Moshe asked Hashem what to do with the leftover donations, and Hashem instructed to create a resting place for the first (broken) luchos. This aligns with the idea that the Mishkan testified to their original level before the sin. The seemingly contradictory statement that “the work was enough and extra” is resolved by understanding that the leftovers indicated that Bnei Yisrael had attained a level above the Mishkan. They needed the Mishkan to return to their original status, but once it was built, the extra materials symbolized their elevated state. The leftovers were used to create a resting place for the broken luchos, further demonstrating their restored status.
(Shemos 38:21) states, “These are the records (פקודי) of the Mishkan.” On the level of remez (hinted meanings), this can refer to the mitzvot, which are also called פקודי: “the commands of Hashem are righteous.” It is the mitzvot that draw down Hashem’s presence.<br>The records of the Mishkan are called the Mishkan of testimony because the way to draw Hashem’s presence is through the mitzvot. Each mitzvah is an acceptance of Hashem's dominion, testifying that we are committed to fulfilling His will, our Father and King. Through this testimony, Bnei Yisrael enable Hashem to rest His presence on the mitzvot.<br>Hashem looked into the Torah and created the world. To understand this, we must recognize that creation came from Hashem's supreme power. It is only through Torah and mishpat (law) that physical existence is possible. Everything has its laws according to Torah, giving it existence and connection to Hashem’s will. Just as Hashem created the world through Torah, Bnei Yisrael, by living according to Torah and mitzvot, awaken Hashem's involvement in the world, mirroring the act of creation. This is the meaning of “The Mishkan of testimony,” reflecting the unity of Torah, Hashem, and Yisrael, as taught in the Midrash. This concept is a fundamental principle in the Torah.
(Shemos 39:32) states, “All the work of the Mishkan and the Ohel Moed was completed… and Bnei Yisrael did as Hashem commanded Moshe, so they did.” The Mishkan's purpose was to repair the realm of action. Our sages wrote that all actions performed in the Mishkan are called מלאכה, as they repaired all actions in the world through the Mishkan.<br>The Mishkan is called the Mishkan of testimony because it testifies that Bnei Yisrael revealed that all creation belongs to Hashem. Just as in creation, where it states “and Hashem saw that it was good” for each part and then “and Hashem saw everything that He had made, and it was very good,” followed by blessing, the same pattern is found in the Mishkan. For each part, it states “as Hashem commanded,” and then “the work was completed...and Moshe saw that they had done as Hashem commanded… and he blessed them.”<br>However, this reparation was specifically through Bnei Yisrael, done through Moshe. The Zohar explains that Hashem hid the original light of creation within the acts of creation, as it states “and it was good.” Hashem’s involvement is only in the good, as “Evil cannot abide with You” (Tehillim 5:5). Ultimately, everything brings about good. The righteous merit revealed good, while the wicked exhaust their good in this world or the next. The existence of creation relies on the good within it. Through the Mishkan, Bnei Yisrael revealed the good in action, repairing the realm of action. This is encapsulated in “the work was complete...Bnei Yisrael did so,” indicating that through the Mishkan, they repaired the realm of action as Hashem commanded.

Section 4

Pekudei and Parshat Hachodesh
“These are the records of the Mishkan of testimony” (Shemos 38:21). The Midrash Tanchuma (Pekudei 2) states that the Mishkan is precious and compared to the creation of the Heavens and earth. This is evident in the usage of the word “testimony” in both contexts, as it states, “I bring the Heavens and earth to testify for you,” and the Mishkan is called a Mishkan of testimony.<br>The Mishkan served to repair the entire creation, as the Zohar states, and it hinted at very elevated things, all dependent on Hashem's words. The “testimony” that Bnei Yisrael provide clarifies the truth in this world of falsehood. Testimony is relevant when there is uncertainty, and the Mishkan clarifies Hashem’s presence. The entire creation also serves as a testimony to Bnei Yisrael, revealing Hashem's glory.<br>Rashi (Bereishis 1:1) explains that the Torah begins with Bereishis because “the power of His actions He has given to His nation.” Bnei Yisrael are connected to the source above, the point of renewal. The first mitzvah given to Bnei Yisrael, Rosh Chodesh, is in the source of unity, above nature. This indicates that the entire creation clarifies the strength of Bnei Yisrael, who have the power to reveal Hashem's glory in the physical world. By subjecting their hearts to Hashem, Bnei Yisrael were able to create the Mishkan in this physical world, drawing Hashem's presence into the realm of action. This renewal is evident in all their dwellings, even in a world of separation.
The Midrash (Shemos Rabbah 51:1) quotes the pasuk (Mishlei 28:20), “A man of emuna will have much blessing, but one who is hasty to become rich will not be cleansed.” It explains that the man of emuna refers to Moshe, whose leadership brought blessings, while “one who is hasty to become rich” refers to Korach, who desired more than his due.<br>Hashem, being good, wants to bestow blessings on all creation. However, if the receiver is not faithful, these blessings may lead him to forget Hashem and sin. Hashem’s intentions are for true goodness. Bnei Yisrael, who are attached to emuna, receive blessings and humble themselves, connecting more deeply to the source. Therefore, they can sustain these blessings.<br>“A man of emuna” is drawn to the source and avoids arrogance. Through Bnei Yisrael, abundant blessings come into the world. On Shabbos, when all creation is nullified to its source, it becomes a vessel for blessing, as it states, “and Hashem blessed the seventh day.”

Leviticus

Vayikra



Section 1

5631
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 1:1) explains that the verse “Bless Hashem, His angels” (Tehillim 103:20) refers to people, not just angels. Every member of Yisrael is sent to fulfill Hashem's will and is thus called a "Shaliach" (Messenger) or "Malach" (Angel). Unlike angels, who have no other mission, people must guard themselves to ensure every action aligns with Hashem's will. This is possible because each action contains a spark of holiness, the energy placed by its Creator.<br>When a person ensures that every action is solely for Hashem's will, they can attain the level of a "Malach," focused exclusively on their divine mission. This is the meaning of "עושי דברו" (who do His will) – those who prepare themselves to fulfill Hashem's will in every action can hear His will in everything. These individuals are described as “Mighty in strength” because their primary focus is on the inner energy, the sparks of holiness, which is Hashem's will.<br>This concept is exemplified in Vayikra 1:1, “And He called to Moshe.” Moshe was always prepared to receive prophecy, constantly hearing Hashem's voice, guiding his mission. Like an angel, Moshe was entirely focused on Hashem's directives, embodying the role of a dedicated messenger.
The Midrash states that a Torah scholar without da’as (inner understanding) is worse than a carcass, as even Moshe did not enter the Ohel Moed until he was called. This emphasizes that one can fulfill Hashem's will only through the power of the commandments, as the bracha before a mitzvah states, “He sanctified us with His commandments and instructed us.” The Chidushei Harim explains that the mitzvah itself gives us the strength to fulfill it.<br>A person can be a true messenger of Hashem by remembering their mission in every action, embodying da’as. Chochma (knowledge) alone is just knowledge, but when combined with Bina (understanding) and internalized, it becomes da’as—a deep, internal connection to this understanding. This means recognizing Hashem's presence and life force in every action and thought.<br>Moshe Rabbeinu, as the da’as of Bnei Yisrael, was always ready for Hashem's call, which is why the term ויקרא (He called) is used for him. Moshe’s constant readiness to receive Hashem’s guidance exemplifies his role as a dedicated messenger.
"A person who brings an offering from amongst you” means offering one's internal energy and desire to fulfill Hashem's will. This aligns with “Nullify your will to the will of Hashem.” A korban (offering) is about drawing closer to Hashem by aligning actions with His will.<br>The term מכם (from you) implies that, as the Chidushei Harim explains on the Mishnah (Avot), “If I am not for myself, who is for me,” each person must fulfill their mission. However, this mission should be part of the collective of Yisrael.<br>Thus, while each individual has a unique role, it must be integrated within the greater community, enhancing the unity and purpose of the collective.
The Chidushei Harim, citing the Rav MiPershischa, explained (Menachot 110a) that one who gives a lot and one who gives little are equal if both intend to do it for the sake of Heaven. The Taz (Orach Chaim 1:3) questions this, suggesting that giving more should be better. The Rav of Pershischa responded with a parable: two merchants traveled, one returned quickly, while the other faced delays and arrived much later. When asked about his delay, he replied, “Once I arrived, it didn't matter what happened before.” He did not elaborate further.<br>The explanation seems to be that the ultimate intention and action should be for the sake of Heaven, regardless of whether it is achieved easily or with difficulty. The key is that one's actions help direct their heart towards Heaven. This aligns with the concept that the effort and intention behind an action are what truly matter.<br>This idea is also reflected in the Korban Mincha (the poor person's offering). Once the offering is brought and the person becomes closer to Hashem, the original intention is fulfilled. Thus, there is no difference between giving a lot or a little, as both achieve closeness to Hashem. This is the meaning of “He should direct his heart to do it for the sake of Heaven,” similar to the korban, where one is drawn to the divine life force in everything.
The Chidushei Harim explained the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 2:11) on the pasuk “In the northern section before Hashem” (Vayikra 1:11). The Midrash connects this to Akeidas Yitzchak, emphasizing that the essence of a korban (offering) is the will to sacrifice oneself for Hashem. This hidden intention is referred to as צפונה (north/hidden). This applies even today, meaning there should be a hidden place in one's heart dedicated to Hashem, not openly displayed.<br>This concept aligns with the pasuk “A man who will bring an offering from amongst you” (Vayikra 1:2), implying that one's entire being should be subservient to Hashem, similar to Akeidas Yitzchak. This self-sacrifice also had a practical aspect, as Hashem commanded the physical act of bringing an animal or bird as a korban.<br>On Shabbos, individual korbanot are not offered. This can be explained by the fact that on Shabbos, physical actions (melachot) are already forbidden, directing one's desires solely towards Hashem, akin to the essence of a korban. During the weekdays, however, it is necessary to draw divine light into actions, hence the need for physical korbanot to connect the spiritual intention with the physical realm.

Section 2

5632
"He will bring it on his own will” (Vayikra 1:3). The Gemara (Rosh Hashanah 6a) explains this means a person can be forced to bring his offering until he says, “I want to bring it.” <br>This teaches that if someone desires to be under Hashem's rule, he can ensure he is compelled from Heaven to fulfill this, as long as he wills it. Everything depends on a person's will.<br>

Section 3

5635
Rashi on Vayikra 1:5 explains that the word "Adam" refers to Adam, who did not offer anything stolen. This teaches that a korban cannot be stolen.<br>A person brings a korban from an animal's life force. Why should an animal's life atone for a person? Because man gives life force to all animals, being above them, as stated in Tehillim 8:7, “Laying the world at his feet.” Adam, with the power of speech, influenced all creation. This applies to every generation. However, if an individual is not on the level of a true "speaker" (due to inappropriate behavior), it is considered theft to use an animal for atonement, as even a mosquito preceded him in creation (Sanhedrin 38a).<br>The solution is to nullify oneself to the collective of Yisrael, as a part of the whole is above animals. This is the idea in Vayikra 1:2, “Who will bring from amongst you,” emphasizing the importance of aligning with the community.

Parashat HaChodesh



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Vayakhel-Pekudei and Parshat Hachodesh
The commandment of Vayakhel, gathering Bnei Yisrael, precedes the mitzvah of Shabbos because Shabbos unites everything with ‘the secret of oneness.’ Shabbos aligns all desires and powers with their source, Hashem's inner life force within each person, as stated, “He (Hashem) blew into him a living soul.” This is the concept of stopping on Shabbos to reconnect everything to its source, as explained in the Zohar.<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that before the sin of the Golden Calf, the Mishkan was commanded before Shabbos. After the sin, Shabbos is mentioned first because the Mishkan represents weekday work, drawing Hashem’s presence into mundane activities, while Shabbos elevates everything to its source. Before the sin, mundane work prepared for Shabbos. After the sin, Shabbos supports the weekday work, like building the Mishkan.<br>The main desire of Hashem is for the light of holiness to be present in every action. This is why man is sent into the world. The concept of Rosh Chodesh, the new month, highlights finding newness in every action. When actions are connected to Hashem's inner life force, there is constant renewal. Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh both emphasize this renewal, with Shabbos being the source of life force for the months. Bnei Yisrael's mission is to find the light of Torah in the world, revealing Hashem's light in diverse ways.
The Chidushei Harim on the Gemara (Shabbos 147) recounts the story of Rebi Elazar ben Arach, who went to a place of sweet water and became drawn after them. When he returned and read from the Torah, instead of reading “החודש הזה לכם - This month is for you,” he read “החרש היה לבם - Their hearts became deaf.”<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that it was because the hearts of the multitude were deaf that he misread the Torah. This illustrates the concept that one either overcomes or is overcome by external influences. We can further explain that renewal often follows a period of hiddenness or struggle. It was because “their hearts were deaf” that they reached the renewal of “this month is for you.”<br>This concept is reflected in the exile in Mitzrayim, which led to the redemption and renewal. Similarly, the four exiles clarify that Hashem is the true king. In Nisan, the new year for kings, Bnei Yisrael accept Hashem's kingship. Rebi Elazar ben Arach sought this renewal, as seen in “Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” This connection between Parshat Hachodesh and Parshat Parah highlights the purification that leads to renewal, just as purity comes from separating good from evil. This renewal is achieved through nullifying oneself to Hashem, akin to the concept of the Parah Adumah, which symbolizes becoming like dust and ashes.

“This month is the first of the months of the year” implies that the year requires renewal through the months. Tishrei, the beginning of the year, provides an infusion of existence, akin to the natural creation, which veils the internal life force and renewal.<br>The world's existence comes through a limiting of Hashem's life force, making it appear as if there is nothing new under the sun. The word שנה (year) is related to ישן (old) and שינה (sleep), indicating a lack of internal renewal in nature. However, the beginning of the year, like the mind, has an aspect of sleep, while the months, like the moon, relate to the heart, which remains awake even during sleep.<br>During the exodus from Egypt, Bnei Yisrael received the power of the months to bring light to the year. This concept is reflected in the renewal of the months within the year. Although Tishrei is the year's beginning, like the sun and mind, Nisan is the beginning of the months and festivals, illuminating the entire year. This renewal is hinted at in the mistaken reading “This month is for you” as “their hearts became muted,” symbolizing the opening of hearts and the source of renewal during the exodus.

Year 1887-1888
Regarding the meal offering of the inauguration, which is called the "meal offering of inauguration," and which the High Priest offers every day - it appears that the High Priest experiences renewal every day and elevates from day to day, which is why he brings this meal offering daily. The Gemara questions whether the priests act as agents of God or as our own agents. It is possible that according to all views, the High Priest is an agent of God, referred to as an "angel of the Lord of Hosts." Just as the angels experience constant renewal, day by day, so too does the High Priest. See what I wrote on the portion about Korach, on the verse "Whomever God chooses, he is the holy one" - it further appears that just as it is written about the anointing oil "it shall remain mine," which our Sages expounded to mean it endures forever, so too all the oil placed on the High Priest would miraculously endure forever. I have also recalled that the Gemara in Keritot states that some of the anointing oil appeared like pearls rising and falling on Aharon's beard. This ability was then passed down to all future High Priests. Although the anointing oil itself was hidden away, nevertheless, the illumination received by the High Priest remained for generations, as it is written "it shall remain mine for your generations."
And in the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 8:3), "'This is the offering of Aharon' (Leviticus 6:13) - the offering of Aharon was considered as beloved as the offering of the chieftains, as it is written (Numbers 7:17), 'This was the offering of Nachshon, etc.'" And the idea is that the princes' dedication [of the tabernacle] was so that the enlightenment of the rebirth that occurred with the erection of the tabernacle would remain. For it is written (Numbers 7:2), "And the chieftains of Israel offered (<i>hikrivu</i>, which more literally means, brought close)" - that they felt a coming close in their souls to the Holy One, blessed be He. And the dedication was so that an impression of this would remain for future generations. However Aharon the priest was always cleaving to this rebirth. And this is what Scripture was consoling him with, "Yours lasts forever" - see there in the Midrash of Behaalotekha - to say, that he does not need the dedication, since he feels rebirth every day. This is as it is written (about Aharon), "This is the offering" - and that is as if it is pointing with the finger that this thing does not get old for him. And in fact we see that the tribe of Levi did not volunteer during the dedication of the tabernacle. And at first glance, this is a wonder! For the bringing of their offerings began from themselves, with the advice of Netanel ben Tzuar. If so, why did the tribe of Levi not also participate in this? Hence it appears that the tribe of Levi, which was not involved in the sin of the [golden] calf did not feel excitement about the erection of the tabernacle, like the other tribes did. For their level was above the construction of the tabernacle, just like the Children of Israel were [all] prepared to be before that sin. But behold they themselves are the servants of the tabernacles, so that they are called the vessels of the tabernacle and the temple. But the other tribes did bring offerings, so that the enlightenment of the erection of the tabernacle would remain with them forever. So does it appear to me. 
Regarding the verse "This is the law of the burnt offering..." - a perpetual fire shall remain burning... This is the ultimate purpose of man's service [of God]. Every day, a new illumination descends upon those who serve the Lord, as it says "and the priest shall kindle wood every morning..." This is a renewal of His goodness every day. It is an expression of love, a gift from the supreme kindness. However, an impression from this light must remain in one's heart all day and night without being extinguished. Consequently, all thoughts and musings that arise in the heart need to be burnt away by the passion of this impression. This is the meaning of "it is the burnt offering on its burning pyre," as the holy Zohar states - "an evil thought must be burnt in the fire." The meaning of "on its burning pyre" is to say that no alien thought can arise unless there is first prepared the power and fire to burn it away, as Nachmanides wrote that God does not bring a test upon a person unless he has the strength to withstand it. In truth, the "perpetual fire" is fear [of God], while "the priest shall kindle" is love, as it is written "a thread of kindness is drawn each day - by day God ordains His kindness, and by night His song is with me." This "perpetual fire...on its burning pyre all night" refers to the night portion. This is the order each day, in accordance with how the light of the Torah impacts a person to burn away alien thoughts, for everything is contained in the Torah, which is called "fire." There is an "illuminating fire" - the 248 positive commandments which come from love. And there is a "consuming fire" - the 365 negative commandments which come from fear. The commandment to remove the ashes hints that by burning away the undesirables, one achieves an elevation each day, allowing new illumination to then descend. These corrections are found every single day. For one who truly serves God, it means accepting the Kingdom of Heaven each day through the recitation of the Shema and "You shall love..." It is written "And these words...that I command you this day shall be upon your heart, and you shall speak of them...when you lie down and when you arise" - one must receive this renewal upon arising until retiring at night. "All night until morning," as mentioned.

B'H - from the first days of Pesach, not written in the order of the seder from the first night
In every generation one is obligated see themselves as if they had personally left Egypt, etc, and after, the Haggadah says "and took us out".  And it appears that it is through this that the faith that there is an Egypt in every generation is revealed. And the Maharal wrote that there is a general assumption that every one that was in the coming out of Egypt is  obligated only to see as if they had come personally out of Egypt, see there. And one could say also as above, that it is through belief that one enters into the general assumption, and obviously, in the general assumption that there was a coming out of Egypt for the life-force point [that exists in every Jewish soul], that from there flows life to every Jewish person, and through faith we come to that. And after that [it is possible to] see oneself as if they came out of Egypt. And one knows and believes that the understanding that one has can only exist because of coming out of Egypt. And this is the explanation in the telling of the story of coming out of Egypt, even if we are all wise etc, since even if one is very wise and connected to God, one's life exists so he will know that all this is due to the coming out of Egypt, because in truth it is so, and one needs to clarify this through faith. And 'telling' really is 'clarifying' and 'revealing' since in every generation there is a coming out of Egypt, according to what is happening in that generation, and all this happened in the time of the Exodus. And according to a person's faith as if one came out, it is revealed in one's life, and one can feel the coming out of Egypt of this moment, and one is able to come out from their own constricted place [their Egypt]. 
“Blessed is He that kept His promise...for Hashem calculated (חשב) the end to do (לעשות).” This means that in every physical action, there should be an element of redemption, elevating the physical realm to the level of thought (מחשבה), ensuring one is not trapped in physicality. By drawing thought into action, one brings an end (redemption) to the action.<br>This promise to Avraham at the Covenant of Parts, where Hashem foretold the enslavement of his descendants, was not merely about the suffering. It was a profound promise that through exile, Bnei Yisrael would gain the ability to find the inner divine presence (פנימיות) in every hidden place. Exile (גלות) serves to reveal hidden G-dliness, requiring deep connection (דעת).<br>This covenant is what has protected us across generations, as it strengthens us through every layer of hiddenness, enhancing redemption. Hashem's promise to save us (מצילנו) involves separating holy sparks from difficulties, as seen when Bnei Yisrael left Mitzrayim with wealth, despoiling it of its spiritual sparks.
"Go out and learn, Lavan wanted to get rid of the entire Jewish Nation, and Paroh only decreed to kill the males." The Haggadah explains that the exile in Mitzrayim was ultimately for our benefit. It wasn't just the redemption that was beneficial, but the exile itself served a purpose.<br>Lavan sought to completely uproot the Jewish Nation, and the solution was to go down to Mitzrayim. With Paroh, the exile meant Bnei Yisrael were under his control. Paroh's decree targeted the males, symbolizing those with power and influence, aiming to render Bnei Yisrael powerless, like females without control. However, Paroh did not seek to uproot them entirely, only to subjugate them.<br>Through the descent of our forefathers into Mitzrayim and their eventual redemption, Lavan's evil intentions were thwarted. This is the meaning behind "The Arami (Lavan) wanted to kill my father and we went to Mitzrayim," indicating that because of Lavan, the descent to Mitzrayim was necessary.
"This Matza that we are eating, for what purpose [is it]? To commemorate that our ancestors' dough did not have time to rise before the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself to them and redeemed them."<br>The Ba’al Hatanya explains that matza symbolizes humility, being simple flour and water without rising. Chametz represents arrogance, puffing up and becoming inflated. The revelation of Hashem’s presence kept Bnei Yisrael humble like matza.<br>The Zohar in Pinchas notes that the difference between chametz and matza is a single dot, distinguishing the letters ה and ח. The letter ה signifies humility, recognizing that everything comes from Hashem. When one acknowledges this divine point, they remain humble. However, using it for self-importance turns ה into ח, changing matza into chametz.

(Vayikra 23:4) "These are the festivals of Hashem which you shall proclaim at their appointed times." On Yom Tov, the inner life force of Hashem within all creation is revealed. The Chidushei Harim explained that holiness is both proclaimed by us and calls out to us on Yom Tov.<br>Holiness refers to the inner divine point that sustains everything yet remains separate from physicality. Although Hashem's glory fills the world, it is hidden in the mundane. On Yom Tov, this hidden light is revealed. The Zohar explains that Yom Tov is called “good” because it contains the hidden light reserved for the righteous, who can experience it through their actions.<br>The festivals are times of joy because the source of life for man and creation is revealed, bringing automatic joy. On Yom Tov, we can find the hidden light in everything. The mitzvah for all males to be seen at the Beis Hamikdash means they see and are seen by the inner life force, connecting deeply with Hashem. We pray to be lifted by the blessings of the festivals, connecting our actions to the divine source through Yom Tov's light.

“Had He split the sea but not taken us through on dry land, it would have been enough” (Dayenu, Haggadah). The simple explanation is that the ground could have been muddy, and we are expressing gratitude for the extra miracle of having dry ground.<br>However, a deeper explanation is found in the verse (Shemos 14:22), “And Bnei Yisrael came into the sea on dry land.” The main miracle was that Bnei Yisrael were literally “in the sea,” and yet it was completely dry for them. If Hashem had simply turned the sea into dry land, it wouldn’t be as wondrous, since He has the power to do so.<br>But out of His great love for Bnei Yisrael, the sea remained a sea, while being dry for them. This shows that Bnei Yisrael can transform nature and infuse it with holiness through their actions. This is the essence of “He took us through the sea on dry ground.”
The Zohar frequently questions why Hashem praises Himself so much for taking us out of Mitzrayim, especially since He had already promised our forefathers that He would. This event is mentioned 50 times in the Torah. The Zohar answers that this is related to the "side" of Yovel, the 50 years of freedom, but this explanation needs further clarification.<br>We can explain that the entire exile in Mitzrayim was for our benefit. Hashem promised Avraham that his descendants would leave with great wealth. To maximize this benefit, Hashem allowed Bnei Yisrael to reach the lowest level, the 49th gate of impurity. Had Hashem not taken us out then, we would have been irredeemably stuck. Consequently, our redemption elevated us to the 50th gate of understanding, illustrating the principle that the lower one falls, the higher one can rise.<br>This is the meaning of the verse, “Hashem my G-d, your wonders and thoughts are for us” (Tehillim 40:6). Our deep descent into impurity was ultimately for our benefit, far exceeding the promise made to our forefathers. Instead of just one affliction, there were 50 redemptions, as the Zohar explains. This is why the Torah states, “Bnei Yisrael left Mitzrayim armed (חמשים),” connecting to the concept of 50, as detailed in the Zohar in Beshalach and Tikunei Zohar.
The idea of reading Shir Hashirim on Pesach is because it demonstrates that the entire world is a parable to understand the love we need to have for Hashem. This is the meaning of Shir Hashirim, the "Song of Songs," for through all the songs of this world, we arrive at this ultimate song.<br>However, to receive this message, a person needs to be connected to the parable. It is difficult to connect to this parable, and when we are too attached to this world, we cannot comprehend it properly. Therefore, during Pesach, the time of our freedom, we can learn Hashem's will even from nature, as the inner point becomes revealed, making Shir Hashirim especially relevant.

“Eating of Matza (during Pesach) is optional” (Mechilta Bo Pischa 8). This implies that all year round, it is not optional. As long as a person is bound by and connected to nature, they cannot eat matza, which is plain and unchanged, just as it was created by Hashem's power.<br>On Pesach, the time of our freedom, we experience freedom even within nature. Nature is synonymous with time, and true freedom transcends time and nature. During the exodus from Mitzrayim, a light from above, beyond nature, was drawn into nature. The Chidushei Harim explained that the night of Pesach is called the “Seder” (order), to show that Bnei Yisrael have an order for miracles as well, not just happenstance.<br>This means that even within nature, their lifeforce is connected to the source of life, which is hidden and above nature. Therefore, on Pesach, one can escape bondage and not be subjected to negative forces. Consequently, they can properly accept the kingdom of Heaven and eat matza.

“Idol gods you shall not make…Guard the festival of Matza” (Shemos 37:17-18). Our sages taught (Pesachim 118:1) that one who disregards the festivals, including Chol Hamoed, is as if they serve idols. They also taught (Sifra Emor 9:9) that the juxtaposition of Shabbos with the festivals teaches us that one who guards the festivals is as if they guarded Shabbos, and vice versa.<br>The festivals are given to Bnei Yisrael, as it states, “that you will call them,” meaning even if Beis Din made a mistake in the calculation. Shabbos, however, is fixed and represents the elevation of everything from nature back to its source, above nature. Although the holiness of Shabbos is not dependent on anything in this world, there is a concept of “tosefet Shabbos” (adding to Shabbos) by preparing during the weekdays to connect with Shabbos.<br>The Midrash Shir Hashirim explains, “I am blackened and beautiful,” referring to the days of the week and Shabbos. This means drawing the holiness of Shabbos into the weekdays. Even though we engage in physical work, we can still connect to Shabbos, adding strength to it, which is the idea of “tosefet Shabbos.” The festivals, on the other hand, draw down the light into nature. They are sanctified by Bnei Yisrael, who draw this light to the rest of creation, connecting actions to the source of life. By believing in the divine life force in everything, we remove the “mask” that hides holiness, revealing Hashem's presence in all things. Disregarding the festivals is like serving idols, as it separates the divine life force from nature, which is akin to disregarding Shabbos. Guarding the festivals with emuna connects one to the truth that all life stems from Hashem.

(Shemos 14:2) “Speak to Bnei Yisrael and tell them to return and encamp in front of Pi Hachirot…” Why did Hashem command Bnei Yisrael to return towards Mitzrayim? It seems that the initial redemption from Mitzrayim was due to the merit of our forefathers. Hashem wanted Bnei Yisrael to return and earn a second redemption through their own merit. This is why it states that at the splitting of the sea, Bnei Yisrael were in a state of harsh judgment, as Hashem wanted them to be redeemed on the higher level of “din” (divine judgment) rather than “chesed” (kindness).<br>Bnei Yisrael indeed merited this level of “din” through their belief in Hashem and their return towards Mitzrayim. This is reflected in the verse (Tehillim 40:6), “Your wonders and thoughts are toward us,” indicating that the miracles in Mitzrayim strengthened their faith, enabling them to merit redemption on their own. This explains their fear at the sea, despite Hashem’s promise, because they realized they needed to overcome this test through their own merit and felt uncertain about their strength. This also clarifies their complaint to Moshe about remaining in Mitzrayim, as they believed immediate redemption in Mitzrayim would have combined their merit with Hashem’s promise.<br>The difference between the exodus from Mitzrayim and the splitting of the sea is that the exodus merely allowed them to leave the restriction, while the splitting of the sea completely destroyed it. The exodus was through Hashem’s kindness, but the sea splitting was through Bnei Yisrael’s merit. This is why Dayenu praises Hashem for splitting the sea and taking us through on dry land, as it was Bnei Yisrael’s faith that caused the sea to become dry land. The sea did not split until they entered it up to their nostrils, demonstrating their merit and faith. This highlights the greatness of the miracle, achieved through Bnei Yisrael’s own actions and faith.

“For He has been exceedingly great” (Shemos 15:1) means all human greatness glorifies Hashem. For the wicked, “Before the downfall comes pride” (Mishlei 16:18) shows they are raised high only to be destroyed by their arrogance. The righteous are given greatness to humble themselves and recognize Hashem's kindness.<br>Hashem's greatness is for the sake of greatness itself, as expressed in the double phrase גאה גאה. In the song of Az Yashir, “the enemy said: I will chase” highlights that the enemy's arrogance led to their downfall, as Hashem made the wind blow and covered them, leading to their destruction.
We can further explain the idea of גאה גאה - exceedingly great. Typically, greatness is relative; someone may be greater because they have more of a trait that others also possess, like wisdom. One person may be wiser than another, but both have wisdom. However, Hashem's greatness is incomparable in every single point. There is no comparison to anyone else, making His greatness absolute. This is the essence of גאה גאה.

CORRESPONDING TO FOUR CHILDREN, ETC.  This seems to correspond to the four expressions of redemption, for the redemption was from all four of the exiles [Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, and Rome].  And these questions apply to every Jew.  [Hacham]  With regard to intellectual analysis, since through this means, the evil inclination doubts the hukkim.  And to this, the answer must be prepared in the person's mind -- that carrying out the will of God, may He be blessed, brings greater pleasure (ta'am) and joy than understanding the rationale (ta'am) of the mitzva.  And this is [the meaning of] "There is no after-party following the Pesah" (Ein maftirin ahar haPesah afikoman) -- that the pleasure (ta'am) from the mitzva of matza, even though it has no taste (ta'am), is sweeter to him than dainties (mat'amim).  [Rasha]  The Rasha actually casts off the yoke:  "Why the service (avodah)?"  And his saying "to you" (lachem) means "how can [mere] flesh and blood be of service to God, may He be blessed?"  And in this way, he doubts the supernal caring [hashgaha], as is said in the literature.  And the answer, "For the sake of this" (ba'avur zeh), means that [precisely] by virtue of his being flesh and blood and not having the ideal (kara'ui) intellect, our service is important before Him, may He be blessed, more than [that of] the supernal angels.   [Tam]  The question of the Tam through his simplicity, when the Holy One, blessed be He, provides some enlightenment through His grace, the person is susceptible to becoming conceited, in saying "What's this," and he must recognize that this is only through supernal grace, and this is [the meaning of] "With a mighty hand, etc." -- in the absence of any merit of the person.  [She'eino yodea lish'ol]  And the one who does not know how to ask is in the bitterest exile, for he has no idea at all how to open his mind.  And regarding this, it says "you open it for him" (At p'tah lo).  And for this we give praise, for the redemption from Egypt was in all four types of "exile," collectively and individually, for these aspects are found in each individual Jew.  And they are called "banim" (sons, children) because in fact the "binyan" (structure) is completed through these inquiries into the human mind when he merits to enter the true path and to leave the vanities of this world and their matters. 

Section 5




<b>And even if we were all wise, etc.</b> Regarding that which is written: "how many degrees of goodness, etc". Meaning: that He brought us level by level, until we accepted the Torah, and He brought us into Eretz Yisra'el. Even so, all these degrees are conjoined, the latter to the former. Thus, "how many goodness double and doubled" - that they return from lower to higher too! And so, "that we all were wise, etc" even so, the first miracle of the Exodus from Egypt applies to us. <b>And all who increase in telling of the Exodus from Egypt, behold they are praised</b>. That the story of the Exodus from Egypt brings intellect [da'at / דעת], as is written "So that you will tell in the ears of your child... so and you will know that I am God [viyda'tem / וידעתם]", etc. (Shemot 10:2). And since the Exodus from Egypt is said in the Torah, and the Torah was given to Yisra'el, they are able to awaken the potential of the Redemption, for the Exodus from Egypt comes from potential to actual by means of telling. Like the matter of Torah, written and by mouth, that b'nei Yisra'el renew the reasons [lit. "tastes"] of Torah. And this is their potential by mouth, that since they bring out the words by mouth they reveal the hidden reasons to come to revelation. And so, these tannaim who expounded each plague of the Ten by four and five plagues that they were struck by 250 plageus - all came from the potential of the plagues. That the ten were hidden these plagues, and these were the ones that were brought from potential to actual. And this is the explanation of "expands in telling the Exodus from Egypt" - that they expand and explain the miracles and the plagues by means of tales of the Exodus from Egypt, as explained. And so the final redemption will be when all the hidden things are made clear that are within the Exodus from Egypt, for this redemption includes all the redemptions. And this is what it is written, "to include the days of the Mashiach" - because memory and telling of the Exodus from Egypt bring on the days of the Mashiach. Because at the time of the Exodus from Egypt, there was the Will to be reparation, including as it will be in the future: God and His Name one. But, because the evil Amalek confused b'nei Yisra'el, like it says "who encountered you on the way" (Devarim 25:18). Therefore, they [b'nei Yisra'el] need to remember their [Amalek's] hate forever. Because it caused us all the exiles. Only by means of telling the Exodus from Egypt yearly is the reparation aroused, and we erase his name little by little. Thus it's called an act of night, this Seder, because we need to return and order [lesader / לסדר] the happening of the Exodus from Egypt, to be repaired and ordered - then there will be the Redemption, speedily and in our days, Amen.




Pesach is the New Year for the Festivals. This is because at the very beginning one needs to distance themselves from the Evil Inclination, as is referred to in the Holy Zohar: Matzah is from the language of trial and argument.  On this holiday everyone can leap from their connection to the "Other Side" even if they are not on the level to do so.  After this, they merit Torah.  After that, they merit to bring in the light of the Torah to their inner humanity. "Draw me" (Shir Hashirim 1:4) is on Pesach - which is drawing it in.  The children of Israel are drawn in from the Idol Worship in Egyp, even though they weren't prepared with all their heart.  Thus it happened with a "Strong Arm" in the way that a person is drawn from the womb of their mother in the Midrash.  After this "Let us run" (ibid) on the seventh day of Pesach that they ran into the sea - a willingness to sacrifice their lives.  "The King has brought me into his chambers" (ibid) The chambers of Torah on Shavuot. "Let us delight and rejoice" (ibid) Which is the holiday of Sukkot.

"If the Holy One, blessed be He, had not brought out our ancestors from Egypt, then we, etc."  The idea is according to what is said in Sh'mot Rabba, regarding "he who loves [his son] seeks for him admonition” (Prov. 13:24).  For our Patriarchs were great persons who had the strength to persist through the Egyptian exile, which was the archetype for all of the [subsequent conquering] kingdoms.  That is why the Holy One, blessed be He, brought them shortly after the Patriarchal period, when there was still a trace of the Patriarchs in [the people].  And the subsequent generations would not have been able to reach redemption but for the precedent of the earlier generations, as noted above.  "And this is what has stood by etc."  "This" is the Egyptian exile and the redemption.  All of this was preparation for "each generation, when they stand over us [to wipe us out]."  Therefore, we rejoice in the Egyptian exile also, and we eat maror as a reminder of the slavery, for all of this was to our benefit.

For He has triumphed gloriously.  One should say, "Even though He has triumphed gloriously."  As Rashi said, "however much I may praise Him there will still remain something additional in Him to be praised," as it is written (Exod. 15:11), "awesome of praises [t'hilot]."   And this was their uncertainty, whether to sing, as Rashi said, "it entered his mind to sing, and he actually did so."  This is similar to what I heard from my grandfather, z"l, regarding King Hizkiyah, who, because he failed to respond with song to the downfall of San'heriv, he was not made the Messiah -- he said that His Kingdom, may He be blessed, was apparent, such that they did not have to take any action regarding the miracle.  And thus it says in Shir HaShirim Rabbah (4:8:3), "This has already been made known" (Isa. 12:5); see there on verse 4:8.  However, in truth, one must rouse oneself and sing the song, so that the joy and the love overcome the fear, and this is what is added (Exod. 14:31):  "The people feared, etc.," and nevertheless, "they believed" and they responded to the miracle and sang a song before Him.  And the Israelites had to establish this clearly, that, while "He has triumphed gloriously," He is nevertheless close to His People, and [they had] to refute the evil ones who say that God does not concern Himself with what happens in the world.

On the verse, "Then sang" (Exodus 15:1), Rashi explained that "it entered his heart that he would sing." But the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded from here that the revival of the dead is from the Torah. And it can be said that it is all one: That that which Rashi said that it entered his heart that he would sing, is that they were not able to actualize everything they wanted. For the world was not fit to receive more than these words [which they actually sang]. And that is [the meaning of] that which is written, "and they said, saying." That they said these words, implying that they had still more in their hearts. And it is from this itself that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded that the revival of the dead is from the Torah - so that they will then finish the song, like it was in their hearts. And the general principle is that everything to which a person takes effort in this world in service to the Creator, may He be blessed, is not for naught. There will still be a time that he will complete what he wanted [to do], either in this world or in the future. And that is the hint to the revival of the dead, as mentioned above.

<i>Six days shall you eat matzot and the seventh day shall be an assembly for the Lord, your God.</i> For it is found in the holy Zohar in the chapter [on the verse], <i>The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is His name</i> (Zohar, Beshalach 17:251 on Exodus 15:3), "Rabbi Eliezer began, <i>Therefore the Book of the Wars of the Lord speaks of Vaheb in Sufah</i> (Numbers 21:14), etc." The idea is that the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is Peace [<i>Shalom</i>], but He nevertheless fights with His name. And likewise, all the wars of the Lord are with love [<i>ahavah</i>] in its end [<i>sufah</i>]. And so, too, after all the wars during the exodus from Egypt, there was song at its end. And likewise, after every argument that is for the sake of Heaven, its end is to be preserved (Avot 5:17). And the completeness [<i>shleimut</i>] that comes at the end is testimony that the war was for the sake of Heaven, that it was a war of the Lord. Hence there is love at its end. And the Children of Israel merited this completeness through the power of the Torah; that is why they are called Shulamit [in Song of Songs]. So all the wars of the Children of Israel are peace. And so it is written: <i> I am all peace; but when I speak, they are for war</i> (Psalms 102:7). And its explanation is [that] even when I fight with them, I am peace. And they merit this through the power of the Torah, as it is written: <i>May the Lord grant strength to His people, etc. bless His people with peace</i> (Psalms 29:11). As it is written about the Torah: <i>and all of its paths are peace</i> (Proverbs 3:17). Its explanation is that even the wars that are fought according to the Torah are peace. Likewise is it with <i>Six days shall you eat matzot</i>, for they [represent] the disputes and wars with Egypt; <i>and the seventh day shall be an assembly</i>, which is the grouping together and completeness that happened at the end as a result of these wars. And that was the song on the seventh day of Passover. And that is why it is found in the Midrash that the seventh day of Passover is like Shabbat. And Shabbat is Peace, the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.

With G-d's Blessing Parshat Shemini
In Toras Kohanim (Sifra Shemini 6), regarding the pasuk (Vayikra 9:6) “This is the thing that Hashem commanded that you shall do, and the glory of Hashem will appear to you,” it is explained that removing the evil inclination from your hearts and serving Hashem with a unified purpose will lead to the appearance of His glory. Just as Hashem is One, your service should be solely dedicated to Him. The Chidushei Harim frequently referenced this statement, emphasizing that all actions should align with Hashem's will.<br>The pasuk teaches that every action should reflect Hashem's command, as everything is created for His glory. This inner divine purpose is often hidden and requires effort to uncover. The one who clearly sees this point is called זה הדבר (“this is the thing”), symbolizing Moshe’s clear vision. Bnei Yisrael’s task is to bring this divine light into their actions. Through the service in the Beis Hamikdash, where all actions were elevated to Hashem, the presence of Hashem became clear and rested in the lower world.<br>The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 11:1) on “And it was on the eighth day” explains that the seven pillars in Mishlei (9:1) refer to the seven days of creation. The seven traits of man are the foundations through which holiness is drawn. When all traits are directed towards the inner divine light, they connect to the idea of Shabbos, testifying that Hashem created and sustains everything. This requires Bnei Yisrael’s actions to be done with mindfulness and connection to the inner life force. The counting of the Omer clarifies these traits, as Hashem’s infinite light is given in measured proportions through creation. The revelation of this inner divine light is achieved through our actions, emphasizing the continuous awakening and effort in our service to Hashem.
The Gemara explains that a tereifa (an animal that will die within twelve months) is forbidden to eat, based on the pasuk, “This is the ‘chaya’ (alive animal) that you shall eat.” However, the Torah also states, “this is the ‘chaya’ that you shall not eat.” This seems contradictory because ‘chaya’ (alive) should imply that if it is not alive, it is automatically excluded without needing an explicit command. The Sfas Emes clarifies that ‘chaya’ refers not only to physical life but also to the manifestation of Hashem's holiness within the creature.<br>The life force of Hashem in every part of creation gives it existence. The life force permissible for consumption comes from the side of holiness, categorized as “this is the ‘chaya’ that you can eat.” Conversely, the life force sustaining forbidden animals comes from the prohibition itself. By Bnei Yisrael abstaining from eating them, they fulfill Hashem’s command, and this abstention sustains the forbidden animals. Thus, it is called “‘chaya’ that cannot be eaten” because its life force increases Hashem's glory through our resistance against the evil inclination.
"And Hashem spoke to Moshe and Aharon to say to them” (Vayikra 11:1). This phrase, “to say to them,” is not easily understood.<br>We can explain this based on the teaching of our sages: Rebbe Chananya ben Akashya said, “Hashem wants to increase the merits of Bnei Yisrael and therefore gave them much Torah and many mitzvot.” Rashi explains that people are naturally disgusted by eating insects, yet Hashem made it a commandment to avoid them, thereby increasing our reward for abstaining.<br>Hashem wants Bnei Yisrael’s entire existence to align with the Torah. Even for actions that are inevitable, Hashem wants our intentions to be guided by the Torah. This is why our sages say, “A person should not say: I cannot stand eating pork, rather I can, yet Hashem has commanded me not to eat it.” This means that our actions should be connected to their divine source. The idea of “And you shall be holy” teaches that when a person sanctifies themselves below, they are sanctified from Above. This involves focusing on the inner life force rather than the physicality. Thus, the reason for abstaining from certain actions should be because it is Hashem’s will, making our adherence to His commandments even stronger than personal disgust.

Section 2

5634
(Vayikra 11:2) “These are the animals (Chaya - literally life force) that you shall eat.” Rashi explains that “chaya” means “life” because Bnei Yisrael, being connected to Hashem, are meant to be truly alive. Therefore, they have many dietary laws, unlike the nations of the world who are exempt.<br>There are four levels of existence: "domem" (inanimate), "tzomeach" (plants), "chai" (animals), and "medaber" (mankind). Man rules over all. Among mankind, Bnei Yisrael are chosen for their holy speech—words of Torah. This is why they are called “Adam,” as the power of speech is valuable only when used for holiness.<br>Each level of existence has elements that can be elevated through holy speech, ascending to Heaven. The nations of the world can eat anything because their speech does not ascend, making their food choices irrelevant. The Midrash states that mitzvot were given to Bnei Yisrael to purify nature, meaning they elevate and connect all levels of creation—domem, tzomeach, chai, and medaber—through the mitzvot associated with each.

Section 3

5636
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 11:1) explains the verses in Mishlei 9:1-4, which describe how Wisdom has built her house and hewn her seven pillars, prepared a feast, and sent out her maids to announce on the heights of the town. This signifies that the entire creation was for man, but it is man's responsibility to awaken the inner life force within everything. This is why man was created last.<br>The Midrash interprets the seven pillars as the seven days of creation, with Shabbos being the holiest. Yet, the verse "She has sent out her maids to announce" parallels the distinction between Shabbos and the Festivals, called “days that are called holy.” Shabbos clarifies the truth by establishing the original creative power, while the Festivals draw down revelation from above into this world, highlighting man's unique role.<br>This concept is reflected in “on the 8th day Moshe called Aharon and his children and the sages,” symbolizing the awakening of da’as (inner knowledge) in Bnei Yisrael, which can draw down holiness from above nature into the seven days of creation. This also differentiates a tzadik gamur, who stands on level ground akin to Shabbos, from a ba’al teshuva, who rises from the depths to the heights, as Bnei Yisrael were considered ba’alei teshuva during that period.
In the name of the Chidushei Harim, on the pasuk explaining the reason for Nadav and Avihu’s death, “that was not commanded by Hashem,” we learn that the primary power of all human actions comes from Hashem’s command. One’s entire understanding must be nullified to this divine command.<br>Nadav and Avihu were very righteous and acted for the sake of Heaven, but their actions lacked Hashem’s command. This teaches a Kal Vachomer: if the absence of command led to severe consequences, then fulfilling Hashem’s will, even without understanding the reason, holds immense positive power. The energy to perform mitzvot comes from the desire to follow Hashem’s command, as emphasized in the blessing, “that you have sanctified us with your mitzvos and commanded us.”<br>We can further explain that their sin involved being “intoxicated with wine,” symbolizing their deep understanding of Torah, known as “the wine of Torah.” Despite their great comprehension, actions must align with the king's command. Their mistake was letting their understanding lead them to act without Hashem’s command, hence they are described as entering the sanctuary “intoxicated with wine.” This illustrates that the connection and closeness to Hashem by following His command is far greater than all human comprehension, as stated, “Your beloved is more dear than wine” (Shir Hashirim 1:2).
The Mishna in the first perek of Avot (Avot 1:3) states, "Do not be like slaves who serve their master for reward." It should have said, "Do not serve your master for reward."<br>The intention is that all of a person's focus should be to fulfill the will of his Creator. The Mishna continues, “And the fear of Hashem should constantly be upon you.” This means that every Jew inherently has fear of Hashem, but it requires effort to draw one's heart to this truth and not walk in darkness. By constantly awakening one's heart to fulfill Hashem’s will, one will naturally gain fear of Hashem.<br>This is also how we explain the pasuk (Vayikra 9:6), “This is the word of Hashem that you shall do,” meaning our desire should be solely to fulfill Hashem’s will as He commanded. Through this, “the glory of Hashem will appear to you,” and one will merit the revelation of Hashem’s presence in their heart.

With G-d's Blessing Parshat Tazria-Metzora, Shabbat and Rosh Chodesh Iyar
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 14:1) on the pasuk “Front and back you have created me” (Tehillim 139:5) explains that if a person behaves correctly, they inherit both this world and the world to come. If they do not act appropriately, it is said that even a mosquito was created before man. "Inheriting" this world means drawing a river (נחל) and connection from the source of life force to the hidden aspects of this world. The praise is not just enjoying this world but connecting it to the upper worlds.<br>Similarly, the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 10:1) states, “Everyone of Yisrael has a portion in the world to come,” meaning that even in this world, all actions have an inner part from the hidden light in physical actions. This is the intention of creating man: to repair the entire creation and clarify that all life force is from Hashem. The pasuk “back and front” means man was last in creation but first in Hashem's intention. The perfect person, whose thoughts are connected to the source of life, brings credit to the entire creation. Man was created last to perfect everything.<br>Immediately at birth, external husks that hide holiness come along, so on the 8th day, one must be circumcised. This nullifies all the 7 traits, focusing them on serving Hashem, connecting to the upper worlds, and destroying externalities. This is the idea of being circumcised on the 8th day. This world and the world to come are both called עולם (hidden). The world to come is hidden because it is beyond comprehension, and this world is hidden due to the klipos (husks). Guarding the inner life force in this world allows connection to it in the world to come. This is the meaning of “back and front you have created me,” indicating that man is meant to repair and connect all lower elements to the source of life. The pasuk (Yechezkel 46:1) “the inner gate of the courtyard which faces forth will be closed on the 6 days of the week, and on Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh it will be opened” means that during the week, the inner life is hidden, but on Shabbos and Rosh Chodesh, it is revealed. The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 27:10) explains that millah on the 8th day ensures the baby experiences Shabbos, revealing the inner dimension and allowing overcoming limitations. This nullification turns prohibition into allowance, revealing hidden light even in hidden things, which is the idea of “on the 8th day he will be circumcised.”
The Chidushei Harim explained the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 14:2) on the pasuk, “I will make my opinions known far; I will justify my Maker” (Tehillim 139:14). This refers to Avraham, who “saw the place (of the Akeida) from afar.”<br>Initially, the purpose of the test was hidden from Avraham. Once he withstood the test of the Akeida, he realized that even when he felt spiritually distant, it was for his benefit, revealing hidden holiness. “And he saw the place from afar” means Avraham saw Hashem even in distant spiritual places.<br>Through this, Avraham merited that every Jew has a hidden point of holiness within them, which is acknowledged in the blessing “Magen Avraham.” The pasuk “back and front you have created me” signifies that man can find the original intention of creation even in the distant places of this world, symbolized by “back.”
Rashi (Vayikra 14:4) explains that the metzora brings a cedar tree branch because he sinned by being haughty, and a hyssop to symbolize humility. This raises the question: Why include the cedar, which represents his sin, in the atonement process? The lesson is that true humility must come from recognizing one's greatness. Even when a person achieves a high level and feels justified in being haughty, they must realize that they are as low as a worm. The essence of Hashem’s will is for man to understand that everything comes from Him; without this realization, everything is meaningless.<br>The Chidushei Harim, quoting the Rav of Pershischa, explains the phrase “He elevates the lowly and lowers the haughty.” If Hashem elevates the lowly, why lower the haughty? It is to ensure that when He elevates them, they remain humble. True elevation comes from recognizing that all achievements are due to Hashem. Conversely, haughtiness leads to being cut off from the Source of Life. The Zohar states, “One who is great is small,” meaning true greatness comes from knowing everything is from Hashem. This is why Moshe, despite his greatness, was exceedingly humble, recognizing that all his achievements were due to Hashem.<br>Even though personal desire plays a role in one’s actions, it is indistinguishable from Hashem’s influence. Therefore, one should attribute everything to Hashem and avoid haughtiness over what is not truly theirs. Haughtiness indicates true lowliness. This is the symbolism of the cedar and hyssop in the metzora’s atonement process, teaching that even perceived greatness should be attributed to Hashem.
"You have created your world originally” (Musaf on Shabbos Rosh Chodesh). This can be understood with the words of the Maharal, that in everything there is חומר וצורה (matter and form). The form refers to the internal life force.<br>This is the idea of “front” and “back” in creation. As explained in the Midrash, if a person is meritorious, we say they preceded the entire creation because man was the original intention of creation. If not, even a mosquito preceded them. This means that if one is attached to the pnimius (form within the matter), they are meritorious. Man is above all creation in form but last in physical matter. When attached to materialism, man is truly last, as the mosquito precedes him. Man's creation was intended to be connected to the form.<br>Man can draw down a neshama from the upper world, showing his connection to the pnimius. By directing all energy and will, one can connect to the higher source and bring renewal. This is the idea of the Midrash “front and back you have created me… I make my understanding known far,” describing the connection to the hidden source. On Rosh Chodesh and Shabbos, when creation is renewed, everything becomes elevated and connected to the pnimius, opening up the form from which life force is drawn. During these days, we can connect more deeply to the צורה, the source of life force, the pnimius.

The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 14:1) on the pasuk “You have created me front and back” (Tehillim 139:5) explains that if a person behaves correctly, they are elevated above the rest of creation. If not, it is said that even a mosquito was created before them.<br>Man is the form (צורה) of the entire world, encompassing everything (דצח"מ). When drawn to base matter, man is lower than all creation because his form is holier. Man’s lowliness is more severe because he acts with intellect and will, unlike other creations that act out of instinct. Man's physicality includes all creation, and by perfecting himself, he can draw holiness to all creation. Thus, everything preceded man in creation, but if he merits, he is considered to have preceded all creation.<br>Another explanation of “back and front” is the idea of the positive and negative commandments. Turning from evil (negative commandments) is “back,” while doing good (positive commandments) is “front.” The main goal is for all actions to be connected to their source, Hashem, bringing everything closer to the original intention of creation. This is the meaning of “back and front you have created me.” Man was intended to connect to a place higher than intellect. This is why man’s creation and birth are miraculous, showing Hashem's intention for man to connect to a higher, miraculous source. The pasuk “I will elevate my da’as to far away” (Iyov 36:3) refers to this miraculous, unfathomable place.

With G-d's Blessing Tazria-Metzora, Rosh Chodesh Iyar
The Midrash explains the pasuk “back and front you have created me” to illustrate the creation of mankind. Just as man was created last in the order of creation, so too the laws concerning man's purity were taught after the laws regarding the purity of animals.<br>Every member of Klal Yisrael has a portion in the world to come, as stated “your nation are all holy…the branch of My planting…”. This means that everything in creation has its source in the world above nature. Since Bnei Yisrael have an actual portion in that world, they essentially precede the entire creation. However, Hashem created man to encapsulate all creation, including an animalistic soul. Man cannot comprehend his higher, divine source until he first repairs his natural, animalistic soul.<br>This is the idea of “back and front you created me.” Through first perfecting oneself (אחור), one can comprehend the source of his soul that preceded creation. The Torah of man is explained only after the Torah of animals because, although man has a hidden part from above nature, he cannot reach that revelation without first repairing the "animalistic" nature. Through the power of mitzvot, which are physical actions, one awakens the divine power and nullifies nature to connect to what is above nature. This is why we make a blessing on mitzvot before performing them, indicating that our actions can precede the natural world. After this reparation, man is considered “before” the entire creation, even though he starts from the physical world. These two stages—perfecting the animalistic soul and connecting to the higher source—are comparable to the weekdays (אחור) and Shabbos (קדם), which is a taste of the world to come.
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 1:1-4) explains that the reason the metzora is so called is because he was motzi ra—he brought out evil. In everything and every person, there is good and evil. When these elements are integrated, it says, “Hashem saw everything He made, and it was very good,” which includes the evil inclination. As part of the whole, it is nullified and serves a purpose. However, the challenge is to ensure it stays within its proper context and does not dominate.<br>The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 16:2) states that one who guards his mouth and tongue guards himself from all evil, quoting the story of a merchant who declared, “Who wants to buy life?” and referenced the pasuk (Tehillim 34:13). This teaches that the main life force is internal, and one must guard their mouth from speaking evil. The two birds in the metzora's purification process symbolize the good and evil inclinations, illustrating that when the evil inclination is nullified, it is also considered pure. The purification process involves the bird that is sent away, showing that through nullification and subsequent removal, purity is restored.
"You have created Your world originally, You completed Your work on the seventh day” (Musaf Shabbos Rosh Chodesh). Everything contains a ‘form’ (צורה). Even before creation, everything was conceptualized before Hashem. This צורה is the life force in everything, and we can awaken this energy in nature, which is renewed every month.<br>Shabbos is even higher. On Shabbos, the physical matter (חומר) is nullified, and the צורה becomes the חומר to the part above nature. Therefore, it states, “You completed Your work,” indicating a level of completion where everything is elevated. By perfecting the חומר, we can make it subservient to the צורה and eventually nullify it completely.<br>This concept is reflected in the Mishna (Avos 2:4), “Do His will like your will, and nullify your will to His will.” Initially, one must use different desires to learn and understand their true will, and afterward, one can completely nullify other desires. The Mishna (Avos 2:1) also hints at this, stating, “What is the path that one should go in…the one that brings glory to those that do it.” Ultimately, one should nullify everything to Hashem. Not everyone achieves this high level, but at least one should convert the חומר (matter) into צורה (spiritual form). This is Hashem's will, that man, steeped in physicality, should allow the צורה to overcome, bringing glory to Hashem.

This verse make these afflictions depend upon the skin. This is based on the verse that says: "...the Lord God fashioned garments of skin for the man and his wife and God dressed them." (Genesis 3:21) The Midrash refers to a distinction between the "garments of skin" and "garments of light." It was because of sin that they came to be garbed in this coarse clothing, the skin of the snake. All of corporeality derives from there. Previously, they were in a spiritual state, as is said of the future. At the giving of the Torah, too, Israel were ready for this state. That is why it says of Moses that the skin of his face shone. (Exodus 34:29) He so redeemed "skin" that he was lit up through the shining speculum. But we did not remain at that rung. Therefore, the afflictions reappeared; the Midrash teaches that it was sin that made us again impaired. It is also known, however, that the skin is porous, containing many tiny holes. These allow the light to shine through its "shells." Only sin clogs up those pores, so that "darkness covers the earth." (Isaiah 60:2) That is why "the leprous affliction" is translated [into Aramaic] as <i>segiru</i> or "closing." Now we also understand why the purification rites are assigned to Aaron and his sons the priests; it was they who set right the sin of the Golden Calf.

Metzora



Section 1

5632
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 16:4) explains that the word metzora is connected to the words motzi ra, meaning one who brings out evil. Hashem gave us both a good and an evil inclination, and the presence of the evil inclination does not inherently oppose the service of Hashem, as the Mishna (Brachos 9:5) states that one is commanded to serve Hashem with both inclinations. The issue arises when one takes the evil inclination out of its proper context and follows it, thus becoming a motzi ra.<br>The purification process for a metzora involves two pure birds, symbolizing the two inclinations, both of which are pure in their original state. As we say in the Shacharis brachos, "the neshama that you have given me is pure." Therefore, there is inherent purity within man; the key is to ensure that nothing is taken out of its intended context and source.

Section 2

With G-d's Help Metzora Shabbat Hagadol
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 16:4) explains that the word metzora (one afflicted with tzara’as) is connected to motzi ra, meaning one who brings out evil. Hashem gave us both a good and an evil inclination, and serving Hashem with both does not inherently oppose His service, as stated in the Mishna (Brachos 9:5). The problem arises when one takes the evil inclination out of its proper context and follows it, thus becoming a motzi ra.<br>The purification process for a metzora involves two pure birds, symbolizing the two inclinations. Both inclinations are pure in their original state, as indicated by the Shacharis brachos, "the neshama that you have given me is pure." This shows that there is inherent purity within man; the key is to ensure that nothing is taken out of its intended context and source. Guarding one’s mouth and tongue, as the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 16:2) advises, is crucial to maintaining this purity. The primary life force of a person is in the heart and lungs, and similarly, the primary power of Yisrael is in their speech, which brings out their internal life force.<br>Conversely, the metzora who has “taken out bad from its place” is because one also has an evil inclination which resides in the left part of one’s heart, as it states “the fool's heart is in his left.” When one exhales air from the left, one inhales an air of foolishness. It is the tongue and mouth of a person that connect the air and wind to the soul of a person. This is what is stated in Mishlei 18:21, “Life and death are in the hand of the tongue.” The Midrash further explains that lashon hara is a greater sin than idol worship, adultery, and murder because it opposes the true greatness that belongs only to Hashem. Lashon hara is termed "speaking greatness" because it misleads and corrupts, drawing all of one’s limbs after it, highlighting the importance of guarding one's speech to maintain purity and connection to Hashem.

Section 3

5639
Tazria-Metzora
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 16:4) explains that metzora is related to motzi ra, meaning one who brings out evil. Everything, including man, contains a mix of good and bad. If connected to the source, the good will naturally overcome the bad, as good is stronger. However, we must ensure the bad does not come out of place.<br>Tehillim 34:14-15 states, “Guard your tongue from evil; seek out shalom.” Here, shalom means aligning one's desires with the collective purpose. The metzora's purification process uses living birds and flowing water, symbolizing the need to reconnect to the source. The goal is to return to the source, and being part of the klal allows for necessary reparations.
Rashi (Vayikra 14:34) explains that the metzora’s purification process involves a cedar tree branch, an ezov (hyssop), and a tola’as (worm) thread to symbolize that one who sinned through haughtiness (represented by the tall cedar tree) should lower himself like a worm (tola’as). Why include a cedar tree branch, which represents haughtiness, in the purification process that aims to emphasize humility? The answer is that it is through recognizing and repenting for one's haughtiness that a person can achieve even greater humility. By acknowledging their arrogance and becoming more humble, they can do teshuva and repair the original sin. It is through this process of humbling oneself that one gains atonement.<br>However, if this is so, won't people just sin and then become humble afterward, thinking they can always do teshuva? The truth is that one who has sinned cannot truly humble himself until he has repaired the sin. If someone can genuinely lower himself like a worm and an ezov, he has undoubtedly already repaired the sin, making him an absolute tzadik and a true ba’al teshuva.<br>Similarly, the Torah often provides simanim (signs) for behavior. For instance, the Gemara (Rosh Hashanah 17a) states, “One who forgoes his reckoning with others for the injustice they have caused him, forgoes punishment on all his sins.” If so, why doesn't every sinner just forgo their reckoning and be forgiven? The answer is that one cannot truly attain this level without genuinely repairing the original sin.
(Vayikra 14:34) The pasuk states that when Bnei Yisrael come to Eretz Yisrael, the houses may also be inflicted with tzara’as. It is difficult to understand the message the Torah is teaching us. Rashi explains that the Canaanites hid treasures in the walls of the houses, and when Bnei Yisrael would have to destroy the afflicted walls, they would discover the treasures. However, this explanation raises the question: why did Hashem need to create such a roundabout method involving hidden treasures and house destruction?<br>The affliction on houses is a marvel and a sign of the holiness of Bnei Yisrael, who bring purity to their dwellings. We learn from the pasuk (Chavakuk 2:11) that the walls of a person's house testify against him. If so, then on the positive side, it is imperative for the tzadik to bring a sense of holiness to everything connected to him, including inanimate objects. Bnei Yisrael did this by removing the land of Canaan from impurity and elevating it to holiness, making it Eretz Yisrael, where Hashem placed His presence in the Beis Hamikdash.<br>This is part of the commandment to love Hashem with all your possessions, bringing holiness into everything. This heightened level of holiness makes the houses sensitive to impurity. The good message is that Bnei Yisrael can repair all physical places. This is the hidden treasure: every physical thing contains sparks of holiness. Additionally, the test of destroying the afflicted house was significant, but Hashem ensured they would find treasures so they wouldn't hesitate to purify their dwellings.

Section 4

5646
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 16:4) states that Hashem does not want the wicked to praise Him, as it says in Tehillim 50:16, “to the wicked He says: ‘Why do you speak My praise?’” The primary reason for mankind's creation is to testify about Hashem, as explained by Onkelos: a living being is “a spirit that can speak.” Bnei Yisrael are chosen for this role, as it states, “You are called ‘Adam,’” and “I created this nation, so they may tell My praise.” However, we must first repair ourselves to be fitting vessels to speak words of truth. The affliction of tzara’as is a blockage, preventing proper speech of Torah and prayer, as it says, “Take me out of the confinement of my soul, so that I may praise You” (Tehillim 142:8).<br>The pasuk “this is the Torah of the metzora” (Vayikra 14:2) indicates that the primary purpose of the purification process is to become a fitting vessel for Torah. Even if one cannot delve into Torah properly due to impurities, if the intention is for the sake of Heaven, the light within the Torah will return them to good. The purification process involves the metzora being brought to the cohen, signifying that the sparks of Torah with which the metzora becomes purified bring enlightenment to the cohen. The cohen then recalls the metzora’s plight and goes out to see his affliction.<br>The concept of tzara’as and its blockages is due to physical actions, as indicated by “During the days of the week it is closed.” However, on Shabbos, tzara’as does not have power, and Shabbos is called a “testimony,” allowing us to testify about Hashem. The blockage is opened on Shabbos, reconnecting us to Hashem and allowing us to fulfill our purpose of testifying about His greatness.
(Vayikra 14:34) The pasuk states that when Bnei Yisrael come to the land of Canaan, there will be an affliction of tzara’as on the houses. The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 17:6) explains that this is actually good news because the Canaanites hid treasures in the walls, and through the tzara’as, the walls would be destroyed, revealing the treasures.<br>This signifies that Bnei Yisrael will transform the land of Canaan into Eretz Yisrael, a land sanctified for Hashem. The affliction of tzara’as on houses shows that Bnei Yisrael can repair even places of impurity. Through the Torah's mitzvos, the tzara’as is healed, turning the affliction into something positive. This is hinted at in the pasuk “the affliction of tzara’as will be healed,” indicating that the actual affliction is transformed into a source of healing.<br>The Midrash (Shir Hashirim Rabbah 5:11:5) explains the pasuk “His head is finest gold, His locks are curled, black as a raven” to refer to the laws of ziva and metzora, which seem unpleasant but are sweet to Hashem. At the time of the Torah's giving, Bnei Yisrael were pure from afflictions, but through sin, they became afflicted. However, impurity cannot remain within Bnei Yisrael and is expelled, leading to healing and elevation, similar to how a ba’al teshuva has an advantage over a tzadik. This is the meaning of the pasuk, “I am blackened, but beautiful,” indicating that even though Bnei Yisrael may become impure through exile, they ultimately become more beautiful before Hashem.

Achrei Mot



Section 1

5632
Rashi on the verse “I am Hashem your G-d, whose Kingship you accepted, now accept My decrees,” and similarly in the Gemara, outlines the importance of first accepting the yoke of Heaven and then the yoke of the mitzvot. This principle applies universally to every mitzvah: one's intention should be to accept the yoke of Heaven, as this is the essence of the mitzvah.<br>The severity of Nadav and Avihu's sin, who brought a sacrifice that was not commanded, underscores that adherence to Hashem's will is paramount, even over the reasoning behind each mitzvah. The reasons for mitzvot are provided for our understanding, but our primary motivation should be to fulfill Hashem's will.<br>When a person accepts the yoke of Heaven before performing a mitzvah, they can perform it properly. This is also reflected in the verse, “You shall keep My statutes and laws, which a person shall do and live by them.” "Live by them" refers to connecting to the source of life, the kingship of Hashem. Through fulfilling mitzvot, one draws life into everything, as everything has a mitzvah connected to it.<br>Without this connection, it is as if one is living in death, likened to the wicked who are deemed dead even in life. The future tense of “which a person shall do” implies continuous readiness to do the will of Hashem. This preparedness, which infuses life and joy into a person, is the true meaning of “guarding the mitzvot” — being ever ready to act on Hashem's will.
(Vayikra 18:5) "In pursuit of which man shall live..."<br>Our sages taught (Avos 1:3) “Do not serve Hashem like servants who want to get a reward.” Yet they also said (Avos 2:1) “Consider the loss of not doing a mitzvah.” This might seem contradictory: on one hand, we should not seek rewards; on the other, we should consider them.<br>The reward of the World to Come is not physical but spiritual—finding oneself nullified to Hashem. This concept is beyond our full comprehension, hence it’s called “olam,” implying hiddenness. Just as this world is obscured by falsehood, the World to Come’s truth is hidden because it’s so profound.<br>Thus, when considering the loss of not doing a mitzvah, we realize a mitzvah connects a person to Hashem, the source of all life. "In pursuit of which man shall live" actually refers to this connection, which is the ultimate purpose of mitzvos.<br>Conversely, seeking a reward termed “pras” (related to "prusa,” a piece) implies selfish gain that disconnects one from the source of life, contrary to the concept of living through mitzvos.

Section 2

5635
“You shall not do as they do in Egypt ... nor follow their practices. Keep my laws, by which one shall live.” <br>It is puzzling: if the Torah warns against immorality, why does it link this to the actions of Egypt and Canaan? The intention appears to be that we should not emulate their behaviors. Every action has an external and internal aspect. The roots of all actions lie in holiness, for everything was created for His glory. This internal element is given specifically to Bnei Yisrael. Thus, we should perform all actions for the sake of Heaven.<br>The actions of non-Jews are called “Chok” (laws without reason) because they lack connection to the inner meaning of these actions and adhere only to the external. Bnei Yisrael can perform all actions in holiness through the mitzvot, hence, “You shall do my laws.” By observing mitzvot, one can act differently from the nations.<br>The phrase “by which one shall live” suggests that mitzvot sustain all aspects of life. As our sages taught, each positive commandment corresponds to a specific limb of the body. By dedicating each limb to a commandment, life force from the mitzvah flows into that limb, allowing all actions to be performed in holiness, as implied in “who sanctifies us in his mitzvos."<br>This concept of holiness and completion extends to Shabbat, given solely to Bnei Yisrael. Although the heavens and earth were created in six days, Shabbat completes all creation, as explained by Rashi (Bereishis 2:2). Shabbat represents a sanctified element within creation that transcends physicality, giving completeness and life force to all beings.<br>Therefore, Shabbat is called ‘shalom’ (peace/completion), as it represents the culmination of creation. The foundation of creation is Shabbat, given exclusively to Bnei Yisrael, whose actions are characterized by holiness.
The Mishna states: "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And when I am for myself, what am I? And if not now, then when?"<br>The explanation of the Chidushei Harim is known (See Teruma תרל"ב 1).<br>We can explain further that there are three elements: the world, the soul, and time. These correspond to a person's soul, the entire creation, and time.<br>Everything depends on the individual's self-improvement. When one perfects oneself, everything becomes uplifted and perfected. "If I am not for myself" means that if one does not perfect oneself, who else will do it?<br>"And when I am for myself, what am I?" implies that self-perfection alone is not enough; the entire world also needs uplifting.<br>Time also needs perfecting. Hence, "If not now, then when?" indicates that every moment must be used for this purpose as time is fleeting.<br>When a person realizes that these three aspects—self, world, and time—depend on them, they will not weaken in their service to Hashem.

Section 5

In the verse, 'Like the practice of the land of Egypt' etc., 'my judgements' etc., 'to follow/walk in them'. Rashi explains 'you are not permitted to be exempt' from them. As it's written 'like' the practice, not actually 'the practice' of the land of Egypt. Because the Bnei Yisroel were already a holy congregation and what is the relevance to warn them from acting like these sinners? But the explanation (comes to teach us) that there should not be any act of a Jew that is like/similar to the acts of the wicked that all their acts are for worldliness alone. Rather the Bnei Yisroel need to sanctify all their actions to cleave to the source of the life-force and to take from it life-force. Because the action needs to be only for the purpose that man 'walks' in the service of HaShem (may He be blessed) and simple Jews are directed to eat and drink to add strength in their service of the Creator which is also a general (form of) 'walking'. And what also of the righteous that all their actions are for the sake of Heaven, and so too with every commandment that a person does, it needs to be directed (one should perform it with the intent) that through this (the performance of the commandment) he will come to greater holiness that he could add at all times from one (spiritual) level to the next (spiritual) level. Like (the concept that fulfilment of a) 'commandment brings another commandment'. And it won't be that the commandment was done simply to be discharged from the obligation, rather on the contrary, that through the merit of this, one will receive (the opportunity for) other commandments, as it's written, that the reward for (fulfilling a) commandment is (the opportunity to fulfil another) commandment. And this is what it means 'to follow/walk in them' etc., and to take from them life-force as it's written 'and live (by) them' (or possibly, and life is within them).

Kedoshim



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Acharei-Kedoshim I do not remember the order
The Midrash explains the words “You shall be sanctified” (Vayikra 19:2) as a promise that we will be sanctified. How can a person of flesh and blood become sanctified with Hashem's holiness? This is possible because “I, Hashem, your G-d, am holy.” Once Hashem took us out of Mitzrayim and separated us from other nations, the life force within every Yisraelite is from Hashem, making it possible to be sanctified even in this world.<br>Even though the entire creation receives its power from Hashem, it is through a hidden and limited way (tzimtzum). However, the life force of every Yisraelite is a part of Hashem above. This allows us to be sanctified in all our actions, even within nature. The Midrash states, “And you are exalted forever Hashem, forever Your Hand is above,” meaning that while nature conceals Hashem's light, His power and life force are always present.<br>Rashi notes that this parsha was read at Hakhel, emphasizing the importance of becoming part of the entire klal Yisrael for holiness to rest upon us. Holiness is found in Knesset Yisrael, the gathering of all life forces for Hashem. Through nullification to the Klal, we can become sanctified. Similarly, on Shabbos, the inner life force in everything is clarified and revealed, making it easier to become sanctified. Shabbos gives life to all other days and connects to the life force above nature, allowing us to draw holiness into time and nature. Through mitzvot, which parallel the 248 limbs, we can clarify and reveal holiness in every action. Every action contains Hashem's will, giving it existence and life. As it states, “That man shall do, and live by them” (Vayikra 18:5), meaning the life force of all actions comes from the mitzvot, the will of Hashem.
Rashi (Vayikra 18:3) says that Mitzrayim was the most despicable place, used as the example of inappropriate behavior. This teaches us that in any place where there is more hiddenness of holiness, there is actually more holiness hidden there. The intention of Hashem placing us in such places is for us to remove the hiddenness and reveal the holiness.
"A man must fear his mother and father” (Vayikra 19:3). The Zohar (3:82a) explains that Hashem is the father of Yisrael. Rashi (ibid) further explains that an example of fearing one's parents is not to sit in their place. This concept extends to our relationship with Hashem, as it states, “The entire world is filled with His glory” (Yeshaya 6:3). We must recognize that every action, large or small, is sustained by Hashem’s life force, and we should not "sit in His place" by denying His constant presence and power.<br>This is why the mitzvah of honoring one's parents is followed by “You shall guard My Shabbos.” Shabbos, like parental respect, serves to clarify Hashem’s dominion. On Shabbos, Bnei Yisrael testify that Hashem is the Creator and sustainer of the world.
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 25:1) explains the pasuk “And when you come to the land of Eretz Yisrael and you shall plant a fruit tree” (Vayikra 19:23) by connecting it to the idea that “the Torah is a tree of life to those who hold onto it” (Mishlei 3:18). The Midrash elaborates on how the Torah serves as our guide and protector in this world.<br>The blessing over the Torah states, “He gave us a true Torah and planted an everlasting life in us.” This refers to the written Torah as the “true Torah” and the oral Torah as the “everlasting life” planted within us. The oral Torah brings inner life force into hidden places through our toil in its study, constantly revealing new insights, as it says, “Let her breasts satisfy you” (Mishlei 5:19). The phrase “to those that hold onto it” signifies that even while engaged in worldly matters, one’s desires should remain firmly attached to the Torah.<br>The Midrash further states, “You shall follow Hashem’s ways.” This means that just as Hashem began creation by planting the Garden of Eden, we should also begin with planting when we enter Eretz Yisrael. Our sages (Sota 14a) teach that we must emulate Hashem’s traits. Although Hashem is infinite, each creation contains a spark of His infinite light in a limited form. By engaging in physical actions that also contain this hidden divine spark, we connect to Hashem. This is the purpose of creation: to draw the upper worlds into nature. This is the essence of Eretz Yisrael, as indicated by the commandment to plant, symbolizing our connection to the hidden divine light within everything.

The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 24:4) explains the pasuk “You send Your help from Kodesh, and from Tzion Your support” (Tehillim 20:3) to mean that goodness and blessing come from the holiness of our actions and from Tzion. This is the meaning of “You shall be holy,” to emulate Hashem's holiness.<br>A person achieves holiness through desire and longing for it. In every action, one must hint at the pnimius (inner command of Hashem). Each mitzvah is a ציון (sign) pointing to inner holiness, as it states, “Set up markers for yourself” (Yirmiya 31:2). Through this longing, we can attain holiness.<br>“Holiness” refers to the Torah, and “Tzion” refers to the mitzvos. Mitzvos, though physical actions, are signs pointing to the Torah's command. Through mitzvos, one connects to the holiness within them. Mitzvos draw Hashem's holiness into all actions. On Shabbos, “and He sanctified it” means it brings holiness to all creation. By hint, “Your help from Kodesh” can refer to making Kiddush on Shabbos, and “from Tzion Your support” can refer to the Shabbos meal.
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 25:1) explains the pasuk “And when you come to the land and plant fruit trees…The Torah is the tree of life…” referring to the oral Torah that infuses all actions with Torah's power. “Everlasting life He planted within us” signifies the oral Torah, while “He gave us a Torah of truth” refers to the written Torah. Combining Torah study with daily life (derech eretz) requires significant effort and purification, as stated in Zohar (Terumah 2:128a). This effort merges physical actions with the holiness of their inner life force, since everything contains a life force from the Torah, as “with the Torah, Hashem created the world” (Zohar introduction 1:5).<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that entering Eretz Yisrael was challenging for Bnei Yisrael because it required combining Torah with daily life, unlike in the wilderness where they focused solely on Torah. In Eretz Yisrael, they had to toil in both, representing the oral Torah. This dual effort is the essence of drawing holiness into everyday actions.

The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 24:2) states, “You are elevated on High, Your hand is always above,” indicating Hashem’s constant elevation and holiness. Hashem has given holiness to Yisrael, as it states, “You shall be holy.” Rashi (Vayikra 19:2) explains that whenever we find the commandment of forbidden relations, we also find the command of holiness. This is because forbidden relations protect Hashem’s laws, ensuring everything is connected properly to its place. This brings about holiness, as seen in the marriage declaration “You are מקודשת to me,” signifying exclusive dedication.<br>Bnei Yisrael are uniquely sanctified for Hashem, as it states, “He sanctifies His nation Yisrael.” Holiness extends to all of creation, but it is awakened by aligning one’s actions uniquely for Hashem. Shabbos is holy because all creation is elevated and connects to its source, resulting in holiness. This is the meaning of “And He completed…and He blessed it…and He sanctified it, for on that day He rested.” Every mitzvah has an element of holiness, as it states, “For He sanctified us.” By nullifying oneself to Hashem’s will, like a slave to his master, holiness comes about, giving strength to perform the mitzvah. This is the meaning of “You send Your help from holiness.”<br>After performing a mitzvah, one must internalize its impression, as it states, “from Zion,” referring to actions. The Midrash explains that Hashem’s holiness is above ours. When Hashem created the world, it was in a specific order, with levels that cannot change. However, human holiness can elevate to higher levels, reflecting “Your Hand is always above.” “And you become holy through righteousness” means that Bnei Yisrael’s righteousness, by maintaining everything in its place, awakens holiness from above.

The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 27:1) states that the words of Hashem are true, while the words of man are not. This raises the question of how a person can truly purify themselves in a world of impurity. The answer lies in recognizing that all existence is sustained by Hashem’s words. The world was created with ten sayings, and these divine sayings give everything its existence. By connecting to Hashem’s words, one can tap into the inherent purity and become pure.<br>This concept is illustrated by the pasuk, “Emor Ve’amarta” (Vayikra 21:1), indicating that purity comes through Hashem’s sayings. The Gemara (Brachos 6a) on the pasuk “Hashem affirmed you on this day” (Devarim 26:18) explains that the word "amira" signifies connection. This idea is further elaborated in the context of Sefirat Ha’omer, where we say, “He commanded us to sanctify us.” The exodus from Mitzrayim demonstrated that each Jew can free themselves from other desires and become incorporated with Hashem. Sefirat Ha’omer is about refining one’s traits and drawing Hashem’s life force into them. Hashem is infinite, but His life force is drawn into creation through measured traits. As we accept Hashem’s light into our traits, we purify ourselves from impurities and foreign desires.<br>This process is mirrored in Shabbos and the weekdays. On Shabbos, we reach a high level of nullification to Hashem, and during the weekdays, we draw the life force of Shabbos into our physical actions. This is why the weekdays are called days of work. The command “Emor Ve’amarta” to the Cohanim signifies Hashem bringing us close and enabling us to be included in Him through nullification to Klal Yisrael. The first “speak” refers to this initial closeness, while the continuation “say to them” refers to accepting Hashem’s connection in all traits and desires, leading to purity.
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 26:4-5) explains the pasuk “Day to day pours forth speech,” noting that lower beings need two utterances. Everything receives its life force from the ten utterances, descending from higher to lower levels until reaching physical things. This is the meaning of “Day to day pours forth speech.”<br>The Midrash also states that like a groom who leaves his chuppah pure and returns impure, every day HaShem renews creation, bringing new life into the source of every creation’s soul. Bnei Yisrael need the two utterances, which represent complete acceptance with full devotion of heart and soul to purify themselves and connect to HaShem’s utterances. This can only be achieved through complete nullification to Knesset Yisrael. The Midrash further explains that evil speech prevents purity, emphasizing the importance of guarding one's speech to maintain holiness.
The Mishna in Avos (3:5) states, “One who accepts upon himself the yoke of Torah has the yoke of government and the yoke of worldly matters removed from him.” Yet, the Mishna in Avot (2:2) also states, “The study of Torah with the ways of the world is good.” These two mishnayot seem contradictory.<br>The difference lies in the level of commitment. Accepting the yoke of Torah means completely nullifying oneself to Hashem’s will. This type of Torah study involves toiling to align one’s understanding with Torah and Hashem’s will. When a person has no other external desires, they no longer need the yoke of worldly matters.<br>There is a type of Torah study aimed at understanding how to behave and perform mitzvot, which is called “learning Torah with the ways of the world.” This involves great effort to convert physical actions to good, as explained in the Zohar, Parshat Teruma. However, there is also Torah study aimed solely at nullifying one’s desires to Hashem’s will, without seeking understanding. This is the yoke of Torah, where one’s entire desire is to nullify oneself to something higher. This is what our sages meant by, “nullify your will to the will of Hashem, so that the will of others will be nullified to you,” meaning that nothing is hidden from the person, and the yoke of worldly matters is removed from them.

Section 2

Sefat Emet – Rabbi Yehudah Leib Alter of Ger, translated by Rabbi Arthur Green
“Take unto yourselves the fruit of the goodly tree.” (Lev. 23:40)
Scripture also says: “Tell me the ways to live, to be sated with joy in Your presence.” (Psalms 16:11). Lulav is numerically equal to hayyim (life), Israel desire the true life of their inner selves. This is what it means to be “sated with joy” – the more deeply you take life into your heart, the more you are sated. This happens through the lulav and the species that accompany it. Israel actually point to God, taking in the light of the Sukkah, which is given to them as a gift. When the King invites guests, he gives them what their heart desires. “Whoever invites someone does so with the intent that they eat and drink.”
That is why God says to us: “Take unto yourselves,” meaning that we should choose life for ourselves…Awareness for the whole year comes about on Sukkot, the last of the three “legs” on which the year stands. The mitzvah of Sukkah stands on its own, but the lulav/species represent the awareness that Israel receive and take into the depths of their hearts…5:181

With G-d's Blessing Emor Briefly
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 27:1-2) states that “The words of Hashem are pure.” In the days of King David, children could explain the Torah with 49 facets of purity and impurity, and David prayed for Hashem to guard this Torah in their hearts. The Midrash explains that purity in this world is attained through Hashem's words. The ten sayings of creation contain hidden purity, and it is man's duty to awaken this purity.<br>The pasuk “Silver that is purified clearly” (Tehilim 12:7) means that a person can purify the ‘silver’ in this world. One's mouth is the furnace that purifies the words of Torah, akin to explaining the Torah with 49 facets. The power of Bnei Yisrael lies in their speech, which, when used correctly, purifies the Torah. This is also related to the exodus from Mitzrayim, where the dibur (speech) was in exile, and it was difficult to express pure voice without mixture. The two utterances in the Midrash refer to the double expression in Devarim 27:17-18, representing the written and oral Torah.<br>Hashem gave the Torah to Bnei Yisrael and implanted the power of Torah within them, enabling them to expound and purify Torah. The word “amira” signifies unity and togetherness. During Sefirat Ha’omer, this concept is emphasized, where the period represents our own toil to internalize the Torah's teachings. The letter ע can be exchanged for א, illustrating that garments of light (אור) can be seen as garments of leather (עור), symbolizing the need for purification when in this world. This is the meaning of “purified sevenfold” and “clearly in the land,” emphasizing the need for purification in the physical realm.

Section 4

5635
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 27:1-2) explains that Hashem's promises are guaranteed, unlike those of a human king, which depend on the praise he receives from his subjects. Hashem rewards man based on justice and truth, as He is called a true G-d. Besides the reward earned through actions, there is also a reward guaranteed from the beginning of time because He is the King of the world. Everything in this world was created with Hashem's words (ma’amar), which are the actual reality, unlike human words that merely express desires.<br>The Torah and mitzvos purify the ma’amar, and a tzadik merits the power of the original creation with each action. Just as silver is purified with fire, the ma’amar of Hashem (the reality of this world) is purified through the Torah, which is called fire. When a person toils in Torah and internalizes it, it purifies them. The lower beings with an evil inclination should at least keep both ma’amarot: one is the power of Hashem's ma’amar, and the other is the purification through Torah and mitzvos. This is the difference between humans and angels; angels are great but cannot grow, while humans can purify their actions through Torah and elevate themselves beyond angels.<br>The Midrash praises the children in the days of King David who could explain the Torah with 49 facets of purity and impurity, illustrating that the evil inclination drives a person to greatness. The gates of understanding depend on exiting the gates of impurity, showing that overcoming challenges and purifying oneself leads to higher spiritual levels.
“And I shall be sanctified amongst Bnei Yisrael, I am Hashem who took you out of Mitzrayim” (Vayikra 22:32). Rashi explains that one who sacrifices his life for the sake of sanctifying Hashem’s name should not do so in the hope of being saved by a miracle, for whoever does so does not merit having a miracle performed for him.<br>The reason given here seems difficult. Why not simply state that one must perform a mitzvah for the sake of Heaven, without expecting a miracle? The primary level of sanctifying Hashem’s name is when a person sacrifices himself and merits being saved by a miracle. However, to merit this miracle, one must truly sacrifice himself completely for the sake of sanctifying Hashem’s name, which then brings about the miracle.<br>Indeed, Hashem desires that Bnei Yisrael cause miracles by connecting to the source of miracles. This is the meaning of “I am Hashem who took you out of Mitzrayim.” The main sanctification of Hashem comes when nature is nullified through miracles, making Hashem’s name known. This occurs through Bnei Yisrael sacrificing their lives, thereby nullifying nature for the sake of Hashem.
The Midrash on the pasuk “Man and animals Hashem saves” refers to people who are clever in intellect yet behave like animals. This seems counterintuitive as a praise. (See Chulin 5b, Rashi). The explanation is that a person has two elements: one of man and one of an animal. One needs to serve Hashem with the power of the body, like an ox pulling a yoke and a donkey carrying a load. There is also an element of serving Hashem through understanding His glory, greatness, and fear. However, one can only attain this higher level through first working on the animal traits.<br>One should always consider himself like an animal, meaning that one knows they have not yet toiled enough in the physical realm. As our sages taught (Avot 3:17), “One whose actions are more than his knowledge is like a tree with many roots that cannot be uprooted by any wind.” No matter what level a person attains, one constantly needs to work on their physical, animalistic traits.

Section 5

5636
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 26:1) states, “The words of Hashem are pure” (Tehillim 12:7), while the words of mankind are not pure. The Chidushei Harim explains that even though a human king may sometimes fulfill his promises, he may die, and his words may not be fulfilled. Therefore, his words are not pure. However, Hashem’s words are inherently pure because His sayings are the fulfillment of the action itself.<br>The pasuk continues, “Silver purged in an earthen crucible,” meaning that Hashem’s words start pure but become mixed with impurities when they reach the lower worlds and require purification. This is the mission of man, as explained in the pasuk (Mishlei 27:21), “A crucible for silver, and a furnace for gold, and each man according to his praise.” Just as a crucible purifies silver, a person involved in Torah purifies and clarifies the words through his speech. The Torah has 49 facets, and the soul has many gates. As a person clarifies his understanding, the words of Torah become purified in his mouth.<br>The essence of the soul of a Yisrael is the power from the ten utterances in the creation of Bereishis. The double expression “Emor” and “Ve’amarta” signifies the preparation for repairing the command that every Yisrael establishes in his heart, preparing for new revelations. This concept is also seen in the sefira, “You shall count for yourselves…and bring a new mincha offering,” as explained in the Zohar. The essence of the soul of Yisrael is holy, and this holiness was given by Hashem when He took us out of Mitzrayim. This inner point needs clarification, and through this process, one merits new revelations. The Midrash (Hoshea 10:12) says, “Plow for yourselves a fresh plowing,” indicating that plowing awakens the land to accept seeds. Similarly, the sefira is meant to repair and reveal the inner point in the heart of every Yisrael, bringing potential into actuality and receiving new light. This process is especially relevant during these days of sefira, as our forefathers prepared themselves from the exodus to receiving the Torah, making them ready to hear the words of the Living G-d. This opportunity remains in these days.
Avos (4:16) Rebi Yaakov says: This world is like an entrance hall to the world to come; prepare yourself in the entrance. Our intellect tells us that just as it is difficult for anyone who serves Hashem to bring their heart to the service of Hashem in this world, which is the work of the heart—prayer and Torah for its own sake—it is even more challenging in the world to come to bring oneself close to the source of true service in Gan Eden, which is “to serve and protect it.”<br>However, through doing mitzvos and good deeds in this world, we prepare ourselves to get close to the source of the mitzvos in the world to come. This is the meaning of the pasuk (Vayikra 20:8), “And you shall guard My mitzvot and do them.” By guarding them in this world, we merit to do them in the world to come. Our sages have taught (Eiruvin 22a) that “today is a time for doing them (the mitzvos) and tomorrow (in the world to come) is when we receive their reward.” Nevertheless, even in the world to come, there is an aspect of doing an actual application. This is the meaning of “the reward for a mitzvah is a mitzvah” (Avos 4:2), and as our sages explained, “and I will give you the ability to walk among those that stand.”
Further in the Mishnah in Avot (4:17), it states, “One hour in this world of Torah and good deeds is better than the entire life of the world to come.” We can explain the term שעה (hour or time) as referring to a person's desire. When a person has a constant desire and will to connect to Hashem, it is significant. As R’ Shimon Bar Yochai explained (Zohar 3:288a) in the words “I am to my beloved,” that every day is connected with one knot, indicating constant growth and longing for Hashem.<br>The truth is that the actual desire and longing are not easily attainable in the world to come as they are in this world. Just as our sages explained with the parable of a prince who longs to return to his father's house, the entire mission of the soul sent to this world is to increase the longing in a person's heart to reconnect to his source. This is the idea of “One hour in this world is better than the entire world to come.”

Section 6

5637
With G-d's Blessing Emor Briefly
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 26:4) explains the pasuk “Day to day makes utterances” (Tehillim 19:3) by noting that during the summer and winter months, the day borrows from the night, and the night from the day. They repay each other without enforcement, demonstrating the harmony Hashem created in the universe. This means that the power of the ten utterances with which Hashem created the world descends from level to level, allowing even this lowly world to receive some light. In this world, where externalities oppose holiness, man reveals holiness by overcoming his desires and pushing away evil. There are 49 facets of holiness opposed by 49 facets of impurity, and the powers that come from overcoming these impurities are called “nights.” The phrase “Night to night speaks out” means that truth is revealed and paths are straightened through these struggles, giving nights an advantage over days.<br>The parable in the Midrash explains that negative forces have power from Hashem, who gave the physical forces and the evil inclination control over man. Before they are divided, everything is included in holiness. However, once they leave their source, they appear divided. An upright person can return everything to its source. The principle that something included in the general and specified teaches about the entire principle, meaning individual parts serve the whole. This is similar to the day borrowing from the night, revealing hidden light through individual struggles. Therefore, lower beings need two “sayings”: one for the general principle and one for the individual parts. “You shall say to them” refers to each part in its place.<br>Shabbat and the days of the week represent the general principle and the individual parts. Shabbat contains the source of all days. Similarly, the sefira begins after the exodus from Mitzrayim, when Bnei Yisrael received the source of truth. Subsequently, we need to purify individual parts until they become unified. On Shavuot, we bring two loaves representing the Klal and Prat. This unification is achieved by nullifying oneself and connecting all parts to the source, exemplified by Yosef Hatzadik's dream of tying bundles, symbolizing connection to the source, which is the essence of counting the Omer.
“And I will become sanctified amongst Bnei Yisrael” (Vayikra 22:32). Our sages explain that this means one is commanded to forgo one’s life for the sanctification of Hashem. The primary sanctification of Hashem’s name is specifically “amongst Bnei Yisrael.” <br>This is referred to in the words of our sages (Ta’anis 11a), who say that a person should always see himself as having holiness within oneself. This holiness is only felt when one is prepared to sacrifice one’s life. Additionally, being “amongst Bnei Yisrael” and nullifying oneself to the Klal of Yisrael can also be done through sacrificing one’s life. Our sages (Megillah 23b) teach that many mitzvot are only applicable when there are 10 people.<br>The interaction of Bnei Yisrael is above nature, giving them the ability to overcome it, and nature becomes subservient to them. This is why the pasuk continues, “For I am Hashem that sanctifies you, and have taken you out of Mitzrayim.” By Hashem creating a new world order through taking us out of Mitzrayim, we are able to sacrifice our lives for the sanctity of His name. Rashi and Toras Kohanim state that it is on this condition (that we will sanctify His name) that Hashem took us out. This means that as a person sacrifices himself for Hashem, nature will be nullified for him, awakening the miracles of the exodus.
Regarding the pasuk “And you shall sanctify him (the Kohen)” (Vayikra 21:8), it means that the holiness of the Kohanim depends on the holiness of Bnei Yisrael. Even if a person is not fully holy, the little bit of holiness they attain adds to the overall sanctity, enabling the Kohen to be properly sanctified.<br>Similarly, the pasuk “And the Kohen who is greater than his brothers” (Vayikra 21:10) is explained by our sages to mean that if the Kohen does not have property, his fellow Kohanim must support him. This aligns with the idea that the holiness of the Kohanim is supported by the collective holiness of Bnei Yisrael.

Section 7

5638
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 27:1-2) explains that Hashem's words are pure and eternal, unlike the temporary words of a physical king. The Sfas Emes elaborates on this by discussing the pasuk, “Emor…Ve’amarta,” indicating two levels of telling. Moshe is instructed to tell the Kohanim, who must then convey the message to others.<br>Hashem's words allow us to find purity in every place and state, as His words give existence to everything. It is the mission of Bnei Yisrael to elevate and purify these states. David Hamelech requested special protection for Bnei Yisrael, asking Hashem to guard them as they descend into dark places to elevate them.<br>While Hashem's words are pure at their source, impurities attach to them through the process of descending from level to level (hishtalshelus). This is the meaning of “Emor…Ve’amarta,” indicating that Hashem's words change from stage to stage. This change allows for the mission of perfecting the world, as the original words leave no space for impurity. The Mishnah in Avot 5:1 explains that the world was created with ten utterances to give extra reward to the righteous and extra punishment to the wicked. The Sfas Emes clarifies that the ten utterances represent hishtalshelus, where Hashem's words change and impurities attach, creating opportunities for the righteous to improve the world and for the wicked to err.
The pasuk (Vayikra 22:32) states, “You shall not desecrate My holy name, and I will be sanctified amongst Bnei Yisrael.” This teaches us the commandment of sanctifying Hashem’s name. The Sfas Emes explains that this commandment is ongoing, even if one is not currently being tested in sanctifying Hashem’s name.<br>Our sages teach, “Give over yourself and sanctify My Name,” indicating that fulfilling this commandment requires mesirut nefesh—sacrificing one’s own life or physical desires. The phrase “I will be sanctified amongst Bnei Yisrael” implies that sanctification comes through separation from physicality. Additionally, the Mishnah (Avot 4:4) states that one who disgraces Hashem’s name in private will be punished in public. Conversely, one who sanctifies Hashem’s name in private will attain holiness in public. This hiddenness refers to one’s inner heart’s desires, and by remaining faithful to this ideal, one merits sanctifying Hashem in every action and attaining more holiness.<br>The pasuk begins with “You shall not desecrate,” warning against disgracing Hashem’s name. Our sages explain (Yuma 86a) that disgracing Hashem’s name includes even walking four cubits without tefillin or Torah thoughts. Therefore, one who is exceptionally careful not to disgrace Hashem’s name merits sanctifying it and will withstand challenges if required to forgo his life for this sanctification. This sanctification occurs “amongst Bnei Yisrael,” where holiness is found. Similarly, on Shabbos, when there is unity among Bnei Yisrael, there is sanctification, as it states, “And He sanctified it” (Bereishis 2:3).

Section 8

5639
The Sfas Emes quotes the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 26:1) that explains the uniqueness of Hashem’s words compared to a physical king's words, referencing the pasuk (Tehillim 12:7), “The words of Hashem are pure.” The Sfas Emes elaborates on this using the pasuk in Mishlei (27:21), which compares a person’s praise to the purification of gold and silver in a furnace: “A crucible for silver, and a furnace for gold, and a person according to his praise.”<br>Just as a furnace is designed to purify metals, a person’s primary function is to use their mouth to purify and clarify the words of Torah. The extent to which a person purifies himself determines how effectively they can bring out the words of Torah and prayer. In their source, Hashem’s words are pure and untainted, but as they descend into this world, impurities attach to them. It is the mission of Bnei Yisrael to purify these words.<br>The first 2000 years of creation were a period of תהו (emptiness), serving as a preparation for the 2000 years of Torah. The primary purpose of man's creation is for the words of Torah. The word מהללו (praise) in Mishlei refers to the internal light of one’s heart, as seen in the phrase בהלו נרו עלי ראשי (Iyov 29:3), “The lamp upon my head.” This indicates that the covenant of the lips is essential for purifying and expressing the words of Torah.

Section 9

5640
The Midrash states, "The sayings of Hashem are pure," contrasting this with a mortal king, whose words are fleeting, while Hashem's promises endure forever. Hashem granted purity to Bnei Yisrael, and even if they later fell from that level, the purity remains, especially within the tribe of Levi. This is reflected in the purification of Levi, which is eternal. <br>Thus, purity persists in Bnei Yisrael, but it can only spread to others if they are deserving. When there were informers among Bnei Yisrael, King David prayed for Hashem's protection over the children, indicating that while Hashem's words are inherently pure, the fault lies with the recipients. Despite this, the inherent purity allows for repentance and reconnection with the source of purity within Bnei Yisrael. The kohanim's purity also depends on the general populace's purity, as indicated by the commandment to sanctify the Kohen, showing that the holiness of the nation elevates the kohanim.
I understood from the holy words of the Chidushei Harim, regarding the connection between the verse "And I will become sanctified amongst Bnei Yisrael" and the festivals, that through self-sacrifice to avoid the three cardinal sins (idolatry, murder, and immoral relations), one can attain the holiness of the three festivals, which correspond to these sins. The festivals are termed Holy - 'mikra’ei Kodesh,' and the preparation to receive this holiness involves a readiness for self-sacrifice for Hashem, as expressed in "Venikdashti."

In the parsha of "bread of faces (lechem hapanim), on Shabbat he shall arrange them etc" - and it is written "Come, eat My food" (Prov. 9:5). This is the receiving of the Flow of heaven, that clings to the Upper Root and this is the internalness (penimiut) of the Flow. As it is written in the Holy Zohar regarding the day of Shabbat, that even though manna did not come down on that day, all blessings are dependent on the seventh day, see there (Zohar 2:184a:7). And this is why the bread is called lechem hapanim, it is the internalness of the Flow, as it is written "not on bread alone does a person live, etc, comes out from God's mouth" (Deut. 8:3) - this is Torah. And a hint of this is what is written there: "Face to face did Hashem speak with you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire" (Deut. 5:4) - and here "bread of faces". And the root of the bread from heaven is that it flows from the holy Shabbat to all the days of the week, with the force of the Torah, according to the readiness of the children of Israel that Torah gave to them. And just as there are 53 parshiot in the Torah and in each Shabbat we read a different parsha, this is also true in heaven, see Zohar on Vayakhel. And this is that the Torah, being all made of Divine Names, still has the parsha that changes every week, and every Shabbat has different combination of phrases. This too is hinted by the bread of faces, that on every Shabbat is was set. And according to the 12 loaves that the children of Israel set in order, so too the Flow of heaven continues. And it is written "as face answers to face in water" (Prov. 27:19) and this is an aspect of the Torah, that is Oral and Written. And in our parshe it is written "on the day of Shabbat". There is Shabbat that comes from Above to Below and there is Shabbat that comes from Below to Above, as explained in the Holy Zohar. And therefore the Text said "according to the arranging of the of the bread on the day of Shabbat in a Awakening from Below, so too in the day of Shabbat from Above to Below it will be this arranging, and as it is written in Chagigah 26b "as its arranging is its taking away." And the Torah is a gift to the children of Israel, and according to their level is the Torah's revealing itself to them, since there are seventy faces to the Torah, and "face to face". And on every Shabbat the Flow is renewed through the force of the Torah. ["The One who renews each day Creation with goodness", Bereshit is Torah, which is called good, and regarding Shabbat it is written "it is good to thank Hashem", a hint that every moment a new interpretation is invited] and so too on Shavuot when the Torah was given there are two loaves of bread. And "on every Shabbat" is a level below "twelve loaves", since the Torah is understood and interpreted and gives life and sustenance to every level until this world. And twelve limits and twelve requests that are in the Prayer they are the Lower Supports of the Upper Root, as it is written in different places.

Briefly, because I forgot.
Death and Life are held in the tongue. A coal burns when you blow on it, and extinguishes when you spit on it. [Midrash Rabbah, 33:1, if there was a loaf that was subject to a tithe, and a man eats it before tithing, death is on his tongue, but if he first tithed it and then ate, life is on his tongue.] Certainly there is sacred vitality in every thing in the world, because the world was created with the light of torah. So the torah is called Fire, and the strength of the fire of torah is in each thing. Yet it is concealed inside and bound together as if in a coal. So we must search and find the light of the Torah that is in each thing. And it is in the language, because the essence of people's life-force is the breath that is within, as it is written, "And he breathed in his nose, the breath of life. And this we need to protect--that every articulation should be to the full strength of humanity's life-force. And from this, the life-force within all things awakens and is revealed. But when we act materialistically, it is as if we are spitting on a coal--not using our breath--only using the physical body of the mouth, and so we conceal the internal aspects, as mentioned above. And likewise, the Tevel compliments the Ma'aser, since we set aside a portion from the outset, to clarify that all the life-force comes as a miracle, and so it is the Ma'aser that gives life-force to the rest. The life-force is brought out from the internally concealed, as mentioned above. And if we do not set aside the Ma'aser, it is as if the husk is still stuck to the seed, and the life-force within cannot awaken, as mentioned above. 
is death in the power of the tongue, but if he first tithed it and then ate 
there is life in the power of the tongue
(Vayikra 25:24) “Throughout the land that you hold, you must provide for the redemption of the land.” This means that through a constant desire to connect with Hashem, the inner essence is revealed, leading to redemption. The word "eretz" (land) symbolizes this desire to connect with the source of life in Hashem (See sefer Divrei Emes, Behar, on this subject).

Section 2

5634
The Midrash Rabbah states, "Life and death are in the hand of the tongue...One can blow on the coal and bring out the fire within it, or spit on it and extinguish it." This means that the life force of Hashem is connected to this world like a coal; it is present but hidden. <br>Every creation has an internal point, and through the spirit of Hashem that "He blew into man's nostrils," one can awaken the light of Torah, which is called "fire," present in everything.

Section 3

5635
Rashi asks why the mitzvah of shmita is specifically mentioned in relation to Mount Sinai. He answers that just as the mitzvah of shmita was given with all its details at Sinai, so too were all the mitzvot. This implies that shmita is a foundational mitzvah upon which all others depend, similar to Shabbat, which is considered equal to all other mitzvot and enables their observance. The verse, "When you come to the land that Hashem has given you" (Vayikra 14:34), indicates that Bnei Yisrael's purpose is to elevate everything to Hashem. Their dominion should aim to nullify themselves and all that depends on them to Hashem. Thus, "the land shall rest" during shmita, demonstrating that their labor is nullified to Hashem’s will.<br>Just as a person cannot fully accept the yoke of Heaven while subjected to another, as taught in the Zohar (3:103a), Bnei Yisrael were first freed from Egyptian bondage. Proper acceptance of the Yoke of Heaven must be preceded by subjugation to something else. Initially, the land of Canaan was under Canaanite control, then redeemed by Bnei Yisrael, and finally, it must be solely under Hashem’s dominion. This principle applies universally. The primary purpose of Shabbat and shmita is to testify that Hashem continually sustains creation. He not only created the world but also constantly renews it. Similarly, the Torah and mitzvot given to Bnei Yisrael continuously infuse new life into their hearts to accept and fulfill them.<br>The clarity with which Bnei Yisrael understand this renewal determines their merit in receiving the Torah. The renewal of the world was a prelude to the giving of the Torah, and this concept continues for all generations. Therefore, the mitzvah of shmita serves as a reminder of Hashem's ongoing creation and sustenance, encouraging Bnei Yisrael to nullify their own efforts to align with the divine will. This alignment not only elevates their service but also brings holiness into the world, benefiting all nations through the sanctity of Bnei Yisrael.

Section 4

5636
With G-d's Blessing Behar-Bechukotai
The pasuk (Vayikra 25:55) states, “For Bnei Yisrael are servants to Me, they are My servants.” The duplication can be explained as follows: “Bnei Yisrael are servants to Me” refers to Hashem choosing us, while “they are My servants” refers to our acceptance of the yoke of Heaven. This is similar to Devarim 24:17, “You have affirmed that Hashem is your G-d, and Hashem has affirmed that you are His treasured people.”<br>The degree to which one accepts being Hashem’s servant determines the fulfillment of the verse (Vayikra 25:42), “For they are My servants...they will not be sold into servitude.” This aligns with the Mishna (Avot 3:5), which states, “One who accepts the yoke of Torah will have the yoke of government and worldly matters removed from him.”
(Vayikra 25:20) “And if you shall say ‘what shall we eat in the shmita year, we have not planted..?” The idea of Shabbos and Shmita is one of nullification. This applies on both a national and individual level, requiring one to nullify oneself for the fear of Heaven. Though this fear might seem to reduce one's performance of mitzvot and good deeds, if it is for the sake of Heaven, it will not cause a lack. It is better to have less with the fear of Heaven, for this brings blessings to one's actions. As Tehillim 34:10 states, “Fear Hashem, His holy ones, for those who fear Him lack nothing.” This means both materially and spiritually, there will be no lack due to the added fear of Heaven.<br>This explains the pasuk, "If you say what shall we eat, for we have not planted." Even if actions are reduced due to shmita, the little connection gained through fear of Hashem brings blessings. As the pasuk continues, “I will command My blessing in the sixth year,” indicating that the sixth year represents attachment and connection. Thus, “A little with fear of Hashem is better than much without it.”

Section 5

With G-d's Blessing From Parshat Behar-Bechukotai
On the pasuk (Vayikra 25:20), “And if you say: What will we eat during the shmita years? I will command My blessing, and you will have food for three years,” the Sefer Noam Elimelech explains that it is due to this question that Hashem needs to command a blessing.<br>The question, “What shall we eat?” seems unnecessary since the One who gives life will provide food. However, since not every generation is worthy of miracles, they will ask this question. The answer is, “I will command My blessing,” meaning sustenance will come in a partly natural way, through a blessing. Bnei Yisrael need to understand that nature and miracles are one and the same; the greatest miracle is nature itself. When this emuna is clear, there is no issue being sustained by a miracle, as it is the same as nature.<br>The word נס (miracle) means uplifted, indicating that Hashem’s interaction with us becomes elevated from the natural order and is unique to Bnei Yisrael. The Maharal explains that just as nature follows a specific order, so too does the order of miracles, which is unique to Bnei Yisrael. In generations where miracles occurred, emuna was so strong that nature and miracles were equal, and Hashem responded with miracles accordingly.

Section 6

5638
"And the land shall rest” (during the shemitah year). The Midrash, explaining this idea, quotes the verse “Death and life are in the hands of the tongue.” Man, called a מדבר (speaker), must direct all creation toward Hashem, as everything follows man. The verse “Everything He has placed under his feet” refers to the tongue that drives all creation toward Hashem. Through the power of Torah, Bnei Yisrael use their speech to direct all actions toward Hashem, as the Zohar explains, “You shall speak in them (the words of Torah) when you sit in your house…”. This means that all actions should align with Torah.<br>The Midrash explains the verse “Strong with power to do His will” as referring to those who observe shemita. They are called “doing His will” because by abstaining from work, they nullify their own strength to Hashem’s power, revealing His directive. Hashem directs the world according to His will, but He has given man free choice. By nullifying his own will, man allows Hashem's power to be revealed. Hashem has placed this directive in man's hands, so man must show Hashem’s dominion over himself and the world. By seeing his fields grow wild and holding his peace, man reveals Hashem’s directive. Similarly, on Shabbos, different speech and abstaining from work reveal the divine directive. The laws of the land no longer apply on a de’oraisa level, but in the times of the Beis Hamikdash, even inanimate objects could be elevated to their source. This power was given to Bnei Yisrael at Har Sinai through the Torah, emphasizing the power of speech, as “life and death are in the hands of the tongue.”
The juxtaposition of shemitah and the commandment against overcharging (ona’ah) can be explained as follows: While ona’ah is connected to the principles of shemitah and Yovel—since property sales must consider the years left until Yovel, affecting the price—ona’ah itself is not primarily about shemitah.<br>The core of the prohibition against ona’ah is to foster unity among Bnei Yisrael, as our sages include forbidden speech under this commandment. The mitzvah of shemitah is also rooted in unity; it is not an isolated commandment but depends on the collective unity of Bnei Yisrael. This unity is necessary for the mitzvah to be observed properly, as shemitah applies only when Bnei Yisrael are settled in the land.<br>Just as Shabbos unites everything with the secret of oneness, shemitah depends on the unity of Bnei Yisrael and the sanctification by Beis Din. Unity enables the cessation of work during shemitah. Shabbos, however, is fixed and eternal, bringing unity on its own. The Beis Hamikdash was destroyed due to baseless hatred and the neglect of shemitah and Yovel, both of which reflect a lack of unity.

Section 7


The mitzvah of Shemitah is “The land will rest a Shabbos for Hashem” (Vayikra 25:2). In Parashat Bechukotai, it states, “Then the land will rest and make up for its Shemitah years” (Vayikra 26:34). The purpose of Shemitah is to show that everything is from HaShem. When Bnei Yisrael clarify this through their own free will, the sanctity of HaShem rests upon their actions. However, if they forsake the mitzvah of Shemitah, HaShem is forced to demonstrate His power, showing that everything is His, leading to our exile from the land. The phrase “a Shabbos to HaShem” is only used when Shemitah is observed willingly by Bnei Yisrael, as mentioned above.

Section 8

5640
With G-d's Blessing Behar-Bechukotai
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 33:1) on Mishlei 18:21, “Death and life are in the hands of the tongue,” compares it to a burning coal: blowing reawakens the fire, while spitting extinguishes it. The main advantage of man is his power of speech, which distinguishes him as the highest form of creation. Bnei Yisrael are especially endowed with this power, as stated in Tehillim 147:19, “He tells His word to Yaakov.”<br>The power of speech in Bnei Yisrael can awaken the fire of Torah, likened to a coal. Just as sparks fly from a fire, Torah words can be divided into many languages. The internal life force of Torah spreads through the tongue, with different expressions changing the understanding. Hashem created everything with 22 letters, and their combinations are infinite. Lashon Hakodesh, the holy language given to Bnei Yisrael, is the source of all languages, merited through receiving the Torah, as noted, “Powerful ones who do His will, to hear His Voice.”<br>The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 1:1) describes those who keep Shemitah as “powerful ones.” Unlike temporary obedience, these farmers let their fields go barren and remain silent, showing complete submission to Hashem. This submission to Torah laws, like Shemitah and Yovel, allows Bnei Yisrael to nullify their will to Hashem’s, meriting to “hear His Voice.” Counting the Omer similarly refines one’s traits, leading to receiving the Torah. The Yovel shofar blowing reawakens the energy from receiving the Torah, a practice renewed every Yovel year when its laws apply.

Section 9



Regarding the verse (Vayikra 25:55) “The Children of Israel are servants to Me; they are my servants…” My claim came before [any other claim]. This is still true today, for according to the level at which one accepts the yoke of Heaven, enslavement to governments is removed, as our sages have taught (Avot 3:5), “One who accepts the yoke of Torah, has the yoke of government removed.” There are also roles of servant and child… [The roles of servant and child] parallel the aspects of Torah and commandments, for one who engages in Torah [as a child of G-d] is free. (Avot 6:2) However, everyone must accept the yoke of Heaven and of commandments upon themselves [as a servant]. This is the meaning of the verse, “They are My servants”, as it is written “Israel, in whom I am glorified.” (Isaiah 49:3) It is glorious for G-d when Israel accepts servitude to Him, despite being His children. It is not only praise of Israel, but it is also true testimony to the Creator… There are always levels of servant and child, servant and child, in that the greater one’s grasp of the secrets of the King [as G-d’s child], the more one lowers one’s self to accept the yoke of Heaven as a servant. Consequently, one merits to see and grasp, as a child, and then one returns to being a servant… In Nisan, we become free and receive the yoke of Heaven. All the days of the Sefirah, we are like servants, doing His will, until we achieve seven complete weeks, which is the oath we swore and in which we have stood since Mount Sinai. We then merit on Shavuot to receive the Torah, like children who search through the vaults of the king. However, we then return to being servants, which is Sukkot, when we return and repent on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, and accept the yoke of Heaven anew, which is the glory mentioned above, as the Holy One finds glory in them…Similarly, daily, one accepts the yoke of Heaven [as a servant] in the morning and thereby merits Torah [as a child] according to his level. And at night, one returns to accept the yoke of Heaven. And the level of the “second servant” is greater, as can be understood.

Section 10

5642
The three mentions of “servitude” in the pasuk (Vayikra 25:42, 54) — “My slaves…for Bnei Yisrael are slaves to Me…My slaves” — refer to the three times one needs to accept the Yoke of Heaven daily, as explained in the Zohar, Parshat Balak (3:195b). This is why our sages instituted three daily prayers: “Hashem, open my lips,” symbolizing the nullification to Hashem, with prayer being the service of the heart. Through accepting Hashem's servitude, we merit redemption.<br>The double expression in “Bnei Yisrael are My slaves…My slaves” can be understood in two ways: firstly, it emphasizes that Bnei Yisrael are uniquely Hashem’s slaves, with no other slaves besides them. Secondly, it signifies that no other servitude can be imposed upon them, as indicated by the continuation of the pasuk, “they shall not be sold as regular slaves.” This means that even in exile, true servitude to others will not apply to them. On an individual level, as one accepts the yoke of Torah, the yoke of worldly servitude is lifted.<br>This principle is a kal vachomer: if one is subject to others, they cannot fully accept the yoke of Heaven. Therefore, Hashem first freed us from Egypt to accept His yoke. How much more so, if we accept Hashem's yoke, no other servitude can apply to us. The three mentions of servitude hint at the redemption from the three exiles following the redemption from Egypt, assuring us that Hashem, our Redeemer, will swiftly bring us close. Amen.

Section 11

5643
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 1:1) states that the Shmita and Yovel are associated with Mount Sinai, emphasizing that those who observe the laws of Shmita are powerful in their actions, and the reward for heeding God's words is the Yovel. Shmita commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, while Yovel commemorates the receiving of the Torah. The Zohar explains that Shmita is akin to the hand tefillin, symbolizing the acceptance of the Yoke of Heaven, and Yovel is akin to the head tefillin, symbolizing the freedom that comes from engaging in Torah. Initially, one must accept the yoke of the commandments, as Bnei Yisrael did during the Exodus, and then receive the Torah, leading to a complete spiritual journey encapsulated by the festivals of Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot.<br>The observance of Shmita and Yovel affects not only individuals but also the external order of the world. The phrase "each man shall return to his possession" implies a return to spiritual roots, with everyone entitled to their portion in the Torah. This concept of teshuva, or returning to Hashem, is symbolized by the sounding of the shofar during Yovel, reminiscent of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The Yovel year depends on the collective unity of Israel, applying only when the entire nation dwells in Eretz Yisrael. Counting the Omer from Pesach to Shavuot, observed by individuals, can rectify the neglect of Shmita and Yovel, leading to the restoration of the Temple service.<br>The passage “עבדי אתה ישראל אשר בך אתפאר” (Yeshaya 49:3), highlights the dual role of serving Hashem as both a servant and a son. Serving Hashem with the dedication of a servant, even when difficult, eventually leads to serving Him with joy and love, like a son. This concept applies to daily life through prayer and Torah study, symbolized by the tefillin of the hand (servant) and the tefillin of the head (son). The phrase “גבורי כח” (mighty ones) refers to those who overcome their negative inclinations, achieving spiritual growth. As a nation, Bnei Yisrael endured the exile of Mitzrayim, overcame their inclinations, and gradually attained the level of “those that fulfill His will,” ultimately bringing honor and glory to Hashem.
In Isaiah 49:3, it is written, "For the children of Israel are My servants; in whom I gain glory." The Zohar teaches that those who subordinate themselves to others cannot fully accept divine authority. However, the children of Israel are eternally servants of God. Therefore, we are commanded to always remember the Exodus from Egypt, as it signifies our liberation from bondage and our perpetual status as servants of God. The Midrash further explains that whenever the phrase "For Me" appears, it is mentioned without interruption, indicating that the exile and hardships experienced by the children of Israel are only in the context of being God's children, subject to the domination of other nations. However, the essence of servitude to God cannot be eradicated, as it is stated, "They shall not be sold as slaves are sold."<br>The Torah portion mentions "servants" three times: "My servants. For the children of Israel are My servants." This repetition emphasizes that even throughout the subsequent exiles after the Exodus, the children of Israel have never ceased to be God's servants. According to the Mishnah, when one accepts the yoke of Torah, the yoke of worldly authority is removed. This suggests that the ability of Jewish individuals to accept the yoke of Torah while still under the dominion of worldly powers was granted to us during the Exodus from Egypt. By accepting the divine yoke, we ultimately attain freedom and release from the yoke of earthly authorities, aligning us with the status of God's children and enabling us to heed His words.<br>Circumcision and tefillin were given as signs to signify these matters. Circumcision represents the covenant between God and His children, exclusive to sons and not servants. Tefillin and observing the Sabbath symbolize the servitude of the Jewish people to God. However, tefillin also incorporates the aspect of being God's children, especially the tefillin shel rosh. Similarly, on the Sabbath, we are both obligated to "Remember" and "Observe" as servants. The repetition of the phrase "For Me, the children of Israel are My servants" can be understood by referring to the Mishnah, which teaches that we should serve God solely for the sake of Heaven, not for a reward. After fulfilling our obligations as servants, we are elevated to the position of sons. Even during exile, when we do not always merit the status of sons, we are still regarded as "wise servants," as the entire world serves God. However, the children of Israel are distinguished by being specifically designated as "My servants."

The Midrash on the verse "death and life are in the hand of the tongue" explains: if someone finds a burning coal and blows on it, he brings out the flame, but if he spits on it, he extinguishes it. This coal represents the sparks of the Torah, which is called ‘fire’. As written in the sefarim, the numerical value of "gacheles" (coal) is the same as "Emes" (truth), and the only truth is the Torah. Since everything is made from the Torah, this coal can be found in everything. However, it is in the hand of every Jew to actualize this spark.<br>This is what the verse means when it says, “He blew into his nostrils and man became a living being,” indicating that man has the power to awaken the life force in everything through speech. This is referenced in the command, “If you go in My ways,” which means to toil in the Torah and find its words in every place. The Torah's markings and signals are found everywhere, as the Midrash says, “Statutes by which I carved out the moon.” Therefore, the sanctification of times is given to Bnei Yisrael, as they sanctify the sabbatical and jubilee years.<br>This power was given to Bnei Yisrael when they accepted the Torah, which is why the commandment of shemitah is mentioned in conjunction with Har Sinai. The phrase “in the hand of the tongue” hints that Bnei Yisrael were given the holy language, lashon hakodesh. Before the Tower of Babel, everyone spoke the same language, but after the languages were mixed, lashon hakodesh was given to Bnei Yisrael specifically at the giving of the Torah.

Bechukotai



Section 1

5632
B"H From Parashat B'hukotai
In the midrash "'I have considered my ways.' Every day, I would calculate and say: I am going to this place and that residence, but my legs would take etc." For in every thing and in every place, there exists the life-force of God, may He be blessed. However, while the life-force specifically resides in, and is clothed in, different places in different ways, inside it is all one and the same.  And this is the relevance of the "ways" in the verse, which are normally dangerous -- when the person is referred to [by the midrash] as "going," it means that the person is drawing His life-force, may He be blessed, into every thing and in every place, as described above, through deliberating before every matter.  In this manner, the person can find a true core-point in every thing.  "Your decrees" (eidotecha) means "clarification," for a person must be a witness (eid) to make clear and to testify that everything comes from God, may He be blessed, as described above.  "Synagogues" (batei k'neisiyot) -- the meaning is to bring everyone inside (l'hachnis) the totality, so that no one is left apart from the source of life-force, which gives life to everything, as described above.  The [necessary] will from a person is the true subsuming of all intelligence and knowledge into the will of God, may He be blessed. This, even though initially it comes about through calculation and reasoned analysis. And this is what is meant by "I have considered my ways." Throughout, the goal must be to cleave in this manner to the Supreme Will, to subsume intelligence to Him, though this comes about through knowledge and calculation, as described above.  And this is what is meant by [walking] "b'hukotai" [specifically in those of My laws that are not humanly understandable] -- -- that you should labor in Torah, not with the intent of the studying being to know or to comprehend, but rather so that one can dissolve and be subsumed in Him, as is appropriate, and to desire always to come near to that which one does not comprehend. And this, the constant striving in Torah to nullify oneself and subsume knowledge to that which is beyond comprehension. And in this way, one comprehends more, in order to nullify oneself more. This is laboring in Torah.
The Chidushei Harim explained the Midrash about David HaMelech’s feet taking him to houses of prayer and study, in line with the Mishna (Avot 1:14): “If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if not now, when? Yet when I am for myself, what am I?” Each person has a unique mission that only they can accomplish, and each moment has its specific purpose. However, the phrase "when I am for myself, what am I" indicates that the main goal is to nullify one's work for the sake of Hashem and Klal Yisrael.<br>This explains David's words, “my feet would bring me to the houses of prayer and study,” signifying that even with a specific intention and mission, he reached a state of nullification, allowing him to be directed to the correct place. The connection to the parsha of Bechukotai is that one who seeks not for personal gain but to be nullified to Hashem can only achieve this through nullification to Klal Yisrael.<br>
The Mishna (Avot 5:1) states, “With ten utterances the world was created. And what does this teach, for surely it could have been created with one utterance? But this was so in order to punish the wicked who destroy the world created with ten utterances, and to give a good reward to the righteous who maintain the world created with ten utterances.” <br>There is a difficulty: if it is easier to serve Hashem with these ten utterances, why do we need the reason of rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked? The explanation is that each utterance of Hashem has something uniquely hidden. The righteous, by maintaining the world created with ten utterances, clarify and testify that all life force comes from these utterances. The term “mekayamim” (maintain) is akin to “Kiyum shtar” (validating a document), meaning they testify to the truth of the ten utterances, affirming that everything exists through Hashem.<br>The concept of “ma’amar” (utterance) involves drawing and connecting to the source of life force. As stated in Devarim 26:18, “Hashem has affirmed you,” indicating oneness and connection (see Berachot 6a).

Section 2

5635
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 35:1) recounts that David HaMelech said, “I have considered my ways, and have returned back to your decrees” (Tehillim 119:59). David was indicating that although he had plans to go to various places each day, his feet always led him to houses of Torah study and prayer. This teaches that by thinking of everything one does as for the sake of Heaven, a person infuses their actions with a deeper connection to Hashem. Similarly, accepting the yoke of Heaven every morning aligns one's actions to be good.<br>This is the meaning of the verse (Vayikra 26:3) “If you follow my statutes (Chukim)”, implying that one should accept the yoke of Heaven so completely that they cannot act without first considering if it aligns with Hashem’s will. Initially, everything may seem like a "statute" (something without understood reason), but through acceptance, one merits to understand and feel the purpose of the mitzvot. This acceptance itself is the reward, as stated (Avot 4:2), “the reward for a mitzvah is a mitzvah,” signifying a closer connection to the mitzvah's inner life force.<br>The Torah does not mention the reward of the world to come because it is obvious and self-understood. However, the Torah describes blessings in this world (“And I will give the rains in their time”) as an additional blessing, indicating that everything in this world will align with the Torah and its statutes. This is further explained in the Zohar (1:194a) regarding the phrase “Everything has its time and moment” (Kohelet 3:1), meaning even physicality is connected to its source. As our sages explained (Avot 4:17), “One hour of Torah and mitzvos in this world is better than the entire world to come,” emphasizing that directing and connecting actions to their source in this world is the greatest blessing, achievable only here and now.<br>
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 35:8) states: “Three things are given as a gift: The Torah, the rains, and the constellations.” The Torah is considered a gift because it cannot be comprehended solely through human merit; it is far beyond us and can only be understood when given as a gift. <br>The rains symbolize the reward in this world. Typically, mitzvah rewards are not given in this world, as the righteous are often lacking here, and only the wicked receive their due in this life. However, the Torah promises that Hashem will reward those who trust in Him, making the righteous' worldly rewards a true gift from Hashem.<br>Bnei Yisrael merited this gift by accepting rebuke. Punishments in this world are not justly deserved for spiritual transgressions, but Bnei Yisrael accept them with love to maintain their connection to Hashem. This acceptance allows them to merit the gifts of this world when they do good. Thus, by accepting undeserved punishment, they receive undeserved rewards, reflecting Hashem's wondrous plans and thoughts for Bnei Yisrael.<br>
(Vayikra 26:5) “Your threshing shall overtake the vintage, and your vintage shall overtake the sowing; you shall eat your fill of bread and dwell securely in your land.” This means that the light of the Torah shines into a tzadik’s heart, and with this light, he produces "fruit," having positive effects on everything. <br>Afterward, one must clarify their actions to ensure they are pure and free of any impurities. The extent to which one purifies their actions determines their ability to receive further illumination. This cycle of purification and receiving light continues indefinitely. The verse hints at this process: “your threshing shall overtake the vintage,” where threshing represents the act of clarification and removing the chaff, leading to better outcomes and continuous growth.<br>
(Vayikra 26:8) “And five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand.” Rashi explains that the calculation is not proportionate because the power of many people fulfilling the Torah cannot be compared to just a few. <br>This refers to the actual “chase,” which is fighting Hashem’s battle against Amalek. Every argument must be for the sake of Heaven and as part of Klal Yisrael. These two concepts are connected in the Mishnah (Avot 4:11), “Any gathering that is for the sake of Heaven will prevail,” and (Avot 5:17), “Any argument that is for the sake of Heaven will prevail.” <br>An argument must be conducted with the strength of unity and love for Yisrael and Hashem. This is the idea behind the verse, where a few can chase many, emphasizing the power of united effort in fulfilling Hashem's will.<br>

Section 3

5636
With G-d's Blessing From Parshat Behar-Bechukotai
The Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 35:1) recounts that David HaMelech said, “I have considered my ways, and have returned back to your decrees” (Tehillim 119:59). David indicated that, despite having plans to go to various places each day, his feet always led him to houses of Torah study and prayer. This means that holding onto Hashem's mitzvot requires great effort, and through this commitment, we gain the strength to align our actions and thoughts beyond human comprehension.<br>The understanding of man is limited, as it states, “do not rely on your understanding” (Mishlei 3:5). Thus, David first thought of his ways and then set his feet, illustrating that true understanding of Hashem's ways comes through commitment beyond our intellect. “Your Statutes” refers to Hashem's commands and chukim (mitzvot we cannot comprehend). Human understanding should lead us to fulfill Hashem’s commands and nullify ourselves to His will.<br>Rashi, based on the Toras Kohanim, explains that “If you follow my statutes” means to toil in Torah, as the command to keep the mitzvos is mentioned in the continuation of the pasuk “And you guard my mitzvos.” It is stated, “One should always place himself on the words of Torah like an ox to a yoke, and a donkey to a burden.” This means that mitzvos and good deeds draw everything in the world of action to be elevated through man, who is called a “mehalech” (one who moves forward).<br>Toiling in Torah allows one to draw and elevate all actions and connected things. The ox bearing the yoke symbolizes committing to Hashem's will, while the donkey bearing the burden symbolizes uplifting all parts of creation through man. Therefore, by uplifting actions with the power of the Torah, Hashem promises, “I will give rains in their time,” bringing holiness into the physical world. “And the trees of the field will bear fruit,” as Rashi explains, refers to non-fruit-bearing trees that will also bear fruit, signifying that man has the power to draw life force even into the lowest places.<br>
Rashi explains that the words “and I will lead you קוממיות” (Vayikra 26:13), based on the Toras Kohanim, mean that we will walk erect. Although our sages have taught that one is forbidden to walk erect in haughtiness (Berachot 43b), in the future, when the world is properly repaired, we will be able to receive fear of Heaven even while standing erect.<br>Man was created to walk upright, but the lowliness of this world necessitates bending oneself in submission to receive proper fear of Heaven. This aligns with the teaching in the Toras Kohanim (Sifra Bechukotai 1:3) regarding the verse, “You may think that in the future, we will be together and you will not be afraid of Me; therefore, the pasuk adds ‘I am Hashem your G-d’...” This means that in the future, we will be able to accept the yoke of Heaven without excessive humility. This is the promise that we will be able to walk erect.
"And I will lead you קוממיות - erect” (Vayikra 26:13). The word קוממיות, a double expression, refers to two types of erectness. The form of man in this world is merely a garment for the light of the living soul within. This double קומה signifies that once a person has properly repaired themselves from head to toe, they merit a higher קומה, which hovers above them when their body is fully perfected.<br>The general principle is that “Hashem, the Torah, and Yisrael are all one.” The Torah contains both hidden and revealed aspects, just as Hashem's name is both hidden and revealed. Similarly, the soul of Yisrael has hidden and revealed parts. Through repairing the revealed part, one merits the inner life force hidden within. This is the concept of קוממיות, embodying both the physical and spiritual uprightness.

With G-d's Blessing Bamidbar
The Chidushei Harim explained the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:12), which states that because the tribe of Levi brought themselves close to Hashem during the incident of the golden calf, Hashem chose and brought them closer. Though there were certainly individuals from other tribes who did not sin with the golden calf, Levi’s distinction lies in their proactive response to Moshe's call, "Whoever is with Hashem, come and join me," demonstrating extraordinary commitment and faith.<br>This teaches that the extent of a person's faith and commitment directly influences the divine response they receive. The Midrash (Rabbah 1:1) illustrates that the righteous, through their unwavering belief in Hashem’s kingship and providence, merit to see the hidden light of Hashem. Conversely, the wicked, through their actions, further conceal this inner light, as indicated by the verse, “He prevented from the wicked their light,” which Hashem reserved for the righteous.<br>The Midrash further states that anyone who increases the honor of heaven and minimizes their own honor, the honor of heaven becomes greater, and they too become greater. However, one who increases their own honor at the expense of heaven’s honor, the honor of heaven remains unchanged, and they become smaller. This means that by minimizing their own honor and seeking to reveal Hashem’s sovereignty in all actions, a person enhances both Hashem’s honor and their own. Conversely, when one focuses on their own honor, they obscure Hashem’s presence, diminishing their own honor in the process.<br>The Chidushei Harim elaborates that the command to count Bnei Yisrael in the Torah, despite the Torah being above time, symbolizes the task of bringing the light of Torah and holiness into time and nature. This counting aligns with Hashem’s desire for Bnei Yisrael to cling to their divine root in all actions, symbolized by the concept of the "First" and "Beginning."<br>On Shabbat, everything ascends to its source, reflecting the idea of “lift up the heads” of Bnei Yisrael. Despite their multiplication into 600,000, they remain connected to their root, akin to being weaned from their mother, completely nullified to their source. This concept is encapsulated in the phrase “to their ancestral homes,” emphasizing the connection to the actions of the forefathers, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov.<br>The teaching from the Tana Dvei Eliyahu (25), that one should always aspire for their actions to reach those of the forefathers, underscores the importance of connecting to the source of all life force. Though the actions of different generations cannot be compared, through nullification to the source, pioneered by the forefathers, one’s actions can connect to the divine life force. This is the essence of "to their ancestral homes," striving for every action to connect to the source of life in everything.
The Midrash Rabbah explains why the tribe of Levi was not counted with the rest of Bnei Yisrael: the personal guard of the King is separate and should not be counted with the general army. Therefore, the tribe of Levi was counted separately and from a much younger age. The Midrash says that Bnei Yisrael, who made space for the Tribe of Levi to encamp around the Mishkan, were given a special reward for this.<br>Even though there were certainly individuals in the tribe of Israel who were greater than some of the less righteous Levi’im, one must understand that actions alone cannot change Hashem's will. Every person can nullify themselves to Klal Yisrael by realizing that the main strength of Yisrael comes from Hashem choosing us. While humbling oneself and serving Hashem with toil is fulfilling Hashem's primary will, one should not think that these actions alone bring them closer to Hashem. All human effort is nullified in the face of Hashem's choice of Israel, and thus no one should feel haughty over even the least righteous Jew.<br>In truth, Bnei Yisrael distancing themselves from the Mishkan to make space for the Levi’im was a form of assistance to them. The Levi’im were chosen "from within Bnei Yisrael," indicating that their ability to come close was facilitated by the support of Bnei Yisrael. By making space and nullifying their own will to Hashem's will, Bnei Yisrael enabled the Levi’im to perform their designated work in the Mishkan as chosen by Hashem.
Rabbi Meir expounded on the great gifts of learning Torah Lishma, which means learning Torah for its own sake, to perform it. The word "Torah" means instruction, as the primary purpose of toiling in Torah is to nullify one's own understanding to better grasp Hashem's will. The Midrash compares the Torah to a desert, indicating that one must make oneself ownerless, like a desert, to merit the gift of Torah. The Midrash tells of a prince who was initially rejected by the townspeople but accepted in the desert, symbolizing the need for subjugation to Hashem.<br>This concept teaches that a person should nullify their own will, recognizing that all strength and action come from Hashem. Unlike the nations who acknowledge other powers, Bnei Yisrael are like a desert, having no power other than Hashem. This aligns with the idea of fearing Hashem both openly and secretly. Open fear comes from recognizing Hashem's constant supervision, while hidden fear means internalizing this awareness so deeply that every action is driven by Hashem's strength, like an axe in the hand of a woodchopper.<br>In studying Torah, one should nullify their actions to align with the Torah, doing everything to fulfill Hashem's will. Since Hashem created the world with the Torah, a person can connect to Hashem's energy in every action. By subjugating oneself and nullifying personal desires, one aligns with the inner energy of Hashem, present in every action through the words of Torah. This is the essence of Lishma, learning Torah for the sake of Heaven, as all creation exists to honor Hashem. Ultimately, all creation was made for Hashem's honor, as stated, "For My honor I created it." This underscores the concept of honoring Hashem, and by understanding and internalizing this, one can truly connect with the divine purpose of creation.

Section 2

5632
The Chidushei Harim explained the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:1) that this world is only a parable. The way the parable plays out determines the nimshal (the deeper truth). If a person is aware that all existence comes from Hashem and strives to reveal Hashem’s honor in everything, this awareness and effort will be reciprocated with divine revelation. Conversely, this concept remains hidden from the wicked, who lack emuna (faith), as it says, “Their light is withheld from the wicked” (Iyov 38:15).<br>The verse “If he holds onto my fortress, they would make peace for me; they will make peace for me” (Yeshaya 27:5) implies that drawing life force from the source of life into every action allows for the elevation of everything to Hashem. This dual process—drawing down life force and elevating individual things to the source of life—represents the double expression of peace/perfection.<br>Humanity’s creation serves the purpose of bringing Hashem’s life force and holiness into all aspects of existence. Though the Torah is above time, Hashem’s will is for man to uplift everything to the Torah through his actions. This is reflected in the concept of time (years and months) and place, as well as the detailed counting of Bnei Yisrael, which underscores each person’s unique role in serving Hashem.<br>The counting in the Torah signifies that each individual has a specific task to perform for Hashem, which is the reason for their creation. This teaches that every person’s actions have a direct connection to Hashem. Each generation has its unique role, and as much as a person believes that their actions reach Hashem, they will merit to see and recognize their place.<br>When Bnei Yisrael were counted, it may have seemed difficult for them to understand how each individual could be significant enough to be counted. However, through their emuna, they reached this understanding. The verse “And Bnei Yisrael did as they were commanded” signifies their acceptance and fulfillment of their unique roles, despite the initial difficulty in comprehending their individual significance.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:12) explains that the tribe of Levi was chosen because Hashem says, "Whoever chooses Me, I choose them." The Chidushei Harim elaborates that although many individuals from other tribes did not sin with the Golden Calf, the unique commitment and willingness to fully dedicate oneself to Hashem was found only in the tribe of Levi.<br>Every person has an inner point of truth and a genuine desire to draw close to Hashem. However, this truth is often concealed by other desires. The essential work and effort are to uncover and reveal this inner truth. The Maharal (Derech Chaim 2:48) teaches that every person is created to bring their potential perfection into reality. This is echoed in the Gemara (Megillah 6b), which states, "If one says, 'I toiled and I found,' believe him." This refers to discovering one's inner life force, which is inherently complete and abundant, but requires effort to remove the coverings that obscure the truth.<br>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:20) explains that one who reduces the honor of Hashem and increases his own honor will find that Hashem's glory remains unchanged, but his own honor will diminish. This seems difficult to understand because Hashem's honor is untouchable. The explanation is that when one seeks to draw Hashem's honor towards themselves, they are, in effect, reducing Hashem's honor. Conversely, by minimizing one's own honor, one inherently glorifies Hashem. Thus, failing to draw Hashem's honor into oneself is considered a reduction of His glory, as one's duty is to internalize and reflect Hashem's honor.<br>This teaching underscores the importance of humility and the continual effort to reveal the divine within oneself. By doing so, one not only elevates their own spiritual standing but also enhances the honor of Hashem in the world.
Rebi Meir said, “Whoever toils in Torah for its sake, merits many things” (Avot 6:1). The explanation is that the Torah is the life force of everything. As it says in the Zohar (1:5), “With the Torah Hashem created the world.” However, the light of Torah is clothed in every part of this world.<br>This means that the entire world is essentially expressions of the Torah, as it says, “Hashem is One and His name is One.” Everything is permeated by the oneness of Hashem, for everything is made and exists from the Torah. Therefore, when one toils in Torah for its own sake, it means drawing the light and life of the Torah into everything. Through this, the Torah illuminates every aspect of one's life, allowing one to see and recognize the Torah in everything.<br>The phrase “He merits many things” signifies that while holiness is singular, the world is made up of many parts. Through the power of Torah, one can connect all these parts to the central principle, which is the Torah. This enables the experience of oneness and the recognition of the divine unity in all aspects of life.

Section 3

5633
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:1) explains that the Torah was given in the desert to draw its light even to the most desolate places. The Torah is the life force of everything, and before its giving, there were 2000 years of chaos (Sanhedrin 97a). Through the Torah, Hashem illuminates all places of darkness.<br>The specific timing mentioned in the parsha signifies that time itself can obscure Hashem’s revelation. The counting of each member of Klal Yisrael highlights that each person has a unique role in illuminating the darkness. The life force comes from Bnei Yisrael, who are united as one soul serving One G-d (Vayikra Rabbah 4:6). This unity is reflected in the principle "You shall love your fellow Jew like yourself," which underscores that through the Torah, the inner life force, all of Yisrael becomes one.<br>The separation we experience is just an external garment; Hashem's intention in creating humanity is for each soul to illuminate the physical world. Each physical thing has its unique covering, which is why Bnei Yisrael are counted individually, signifying each person's unique mission.<br>Furthermore, the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:7) teaches that the Torah was given in the desert to show that one must humble oneself like a desert to merit Torah. The Maharal explains that everything has its material and form (Derech Chaim 6:10), and the desert, being without form, symbolizes this humility. One's readiness to accept form, or divine guidance, determines their merit for Torah, the inner life force and true shape of everything.<br>The word "midbar" (desert) also relates to "dibur" (speech), indicating that everything should follow Hashem's commandments. Man must nullify himself to follow Hashem’s directives, as the Zohar explains "vedibarta bam" (speak of them). Tehillim (76:9) states: "the world was fearful and silent," illustrating the preparation for receiving the Torah, where fear and reverence lead one to recognize their dependence on the life force of the Torah.
Avot (6:1) states, “Whoever toils in Torah for its sake (lishmah) merits many things.” This means to toil in Torah to make its name great, as the name signifies its renown in distant places. Similarly, the Midrash interprets the verse from Mishlei (1:20), “In the streets its name will be heard,” as referring to the greatness of Torah.<br>A person must engage in Torah so that its words permeate their heart and guide all their actions. The Torah assists a person in this endeavor based on their desire and dedication. This aligns with the concept of the Oral Torah, where the Torah deeply influences one's heart, leading all actions to align with it. This process continually renews the light of Torah through one's deeds.<br>Our forefathers exemplified this, as their actions are recorded in the Torah, indicating that their deeds were inherently Torah. This sanctifies the name of the Torah, embodying the principle of toiling in Torah for its sake, or lishmah.

Section 4

5634
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:1) compares the giving of the Torah to a king who entered various towns, each of which fled from him until he finally came to an empty town. The remaining inhabitants welcomed him, and he proclaimed that he would build his palace there. Similarly, Hashem came to the sea and mountains, which fled (Tehillim 114:4), until He came to the desert, which accepted Him, and He decided to dwell there.<br>The Midrash illustrates that the Torah brings perfection to creation. One merits the Torah based on their recognition of their own deficiencies and their desire for completeness. It is challenging for individuals with free will to truly acknowledge their shortcomings, which is why the townspeople fled from the king—they refused to confront their own imperfections.<br>However, one who makes themselves like a desert, as the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:7) states, can merit the Torah. This means becoming ownerless and humble, like a desert. This was Bnei Yisrael's preparation before receiving the Torah; they reached a state of midbar—absolute clarity in their deficiencies and a longing for perfection. This awareness extends to all creation, indicating a collective yearning for completion.<br>This state is called midbar, signifying a desire to follow the divine leader. The word midbar is related to dabar, meaning leader, as the Gemara (Sanhedrin 8a) says, "one leader (dabar) per generation."
“Each man by his flag” (Bamidbar 2:2). The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:3) connects the flags mentioned in this pasuk to the verse in Shir Hashirim (2:4), “His banner of love was over me.” One who learns Torah and progresses from one halacha to the next (medaleg mihalacha lehalacha) is proclaimed dear to Hashem. When Bnei Yisrael received the Torah and saw the heavenly angels with their flags, they desired to have flags as well. Hashem promised them that they too would have flags.<br>The simple reason for the flags is so that each person knows his tribe and his place, and to remind each person of their ancestry. The principle here is that Bnei Yisrael, in this world, cannot serve Hashem on the level of the holy angels. However, they can have the constant desire and will to long to do Hashem’s will. This is why the entire Torah and the mitzvos hint at lofty ideas, driving our desire for spiritual heights.<br>The Midrash explains that even though we cannot reach the level of the angels, through their desire and longing, Bnei Yisrael merited flags. This is the meaning of the Midrash comparing the word "degel" (flag) to "dilug" (skipping). Bnei Yisrael can connect to extremely high spiritual levels, sometimes beyond their own merit, because Hashem grants the ability to connect to Him through a deep outpouring of love.<br>This ability is due to the merit of our forefathers, who were a chariot for Hashem’s presence. Hashem blessed them, saying, “thus your children will be.” However, this level is reserved for those who are truly connected to Avraham’s descendants, nullifying themselves to the source of their neshama, and acting in the ways of our forefathers.<br>The Chidushei Harim relayed a teaching from the Rav of Pershischa on the expression (Tana Devei Eliyahu Rabbah 25), “One should always say: ‘when will my actions be like those of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov?’” This does not mean one should foolishly compare themselves to the holy forefathers. Rather, it means one should strive never to be disconnected and ensure that their actions are linked to those of the forefathers. This is the meaning of “under the banners of their ancestral house” (Bamidbar 2:2), indicating that one’s actions should resemble and connect to the deeds of their ancestors, allowing them to grasp their spiritual roots, even if it involves spiritual leaps.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:12) on the pasuk (Hoshea 2:1) states, “The number of Bnei Yisrael was like the sand of the sea that cannot be measured nor counted.” This seems contradictory—if it is a number, it can be counted. <br>The explanation is that the main desire is to continually draw the number onwards to infinity. The source of Bnei Yisrael is 3 forefathers, 12 tribes, 70 souls, and 600,000, but beyond that, there is no number. The purpose of creation is to transform the finite into the infinite, achievable only by being connected to the source of Oneness.<br>We must constantly stay connected to the source of our forefathers, which is the oneness of Hashem. When we multiply in this manner, maintaining this connection, we are not disconnected and thus merit blessings. The blessing is proportional to one’s nullification to the source. The more one nullifies oneself, the greater the blessing, leading to an uncountable multitude.<br>This is the meaning of Hashem’s promise to Avraham, “So your children shall be” (like the sand of the sea). When they connect to their source, they will be innumerable. [See Chidushei Harim Sefer Hazechut Shmot]
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:12) highlights the uniqueness of the tribe of Levi, who brought themselves close to Hashem and entirely sided with Moshe during the incident of the Golden Calf. Consequently, Hashem chose them. Although many others did not sin at the Golden Calf, they lacked the energy to "bring themselves close to Hashem."<br>The explanation is that through one's intense desire to come close to Hashem, driven by wholehearted yearning, one becomes so connected that no sin can interfere. This is the meaning of the pasuk (Shir Hashirim 8:7) “many waters cannot extinguish the love.” The love for Hashem overrides everything, and one's sins do not interfere.<br>Therefore, even though the Tribe of Levi might have considered themselves sinners, their intense desire brought them forward, and Hashem brought them close.
One who toils in Torah for its sake merits many things (Avot 6:1). The Torah is beyond human comprehension, but its inner light is enclosed in its words. Therefore, the Torah we study is a ‘garment’ for the deeper essence of the Torah, as explained in the Zohar (Beha’alotcha 3:152a).<br>This ‘clothing’ serves to increase the glory and name of the Torah. As stated in Yeshaya 42:21, “Hashem desires to show you for His righteousness sake and therefore He magnifies the Torah.” The Torah and mitzvot are an opening to access and reveal the inner Torah. The Midrash Tanchuma (Bechukotai 3) explains the pasuk (Mishlei 1:20), “In the streets its voice is heard,” meaning that the Torah’s influence is broadened through the increased honor given to it.<br>By elevating the Torah’s glory, we bring its power into all of creation through mitzvot and Torah study, as each physical act has a mitzvah attached to it. This spreads the light of Torah everywhere, allowing us to access its inner voice. The Torah given to us enables us to open the springs of wisdom and reveal the inner essence of the Torah through our deeds.<br>“Toiling in Torah for its sake” means to expand the name of the Torah, revealing its hidden light through study and mitzvot. One who engages in Torah increases its glory, which in turn helps them connect more deeply to it. The Rav of Lublin explained that “He merits many things” means the Torah grants the power to overcome all opposition, as the word "zachiti" (merit) can mean "nitzachti" (overcome) (Brachot 1:5).<br>The 48 traits with which Torah is acquired are also through the power of Torah. Acquiring these traits goes beyond mere toil in Torah; it means embodying them. By adopting these 48 traits, one can truly acquire the Torah, creating a dwelling place in one’s heart for the light of the Torah to reside.

Section 5

With G-d's Help Bamidbar
"Your judgements are like high mountains" (Tehillim 36:7). The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:1) explains that inasmuch as a person is willing to draw Hashem's presence into all their actions and not hide them, aligning their deeds with Hashem's will, Hashem's presence will rest upon them. This is because Hashem has given man free choice, making this dependent on the lower realms.<br>The Torah mentions the place and time of Bnei Yisrael's counting to teach us that everything is dependent on Yisrael. This is the concept of עולם שנה נפש (space, time, and soul), and their rectification is through Bnei Yisrael’s service to Hashem. The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:17) states that everything has its limits, yet the number of Bnei Yisrael is like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.<br>The explanation is that Bnei Yisrael give a number and limit to everything, similar to how sand contains the sea (Yirmiya 5:22). The connection of each thing to Bnei Yisrael and the Torah gives them existence. Therefore, there is a “number” for Bnei Yisrael because they draw limited existence to all creation. However, from their own perspective, they do not have a finite number. When counted for no particular reason (as in the time of David), many perished because a finite number is not compatible with them.<br>Hashem commanded Moshe to count Bnei Yisrael because He gives numbers even to the stars (Tehillim 147:4). The pasuk explains the reason for counting them by mentioning the time and place, which highlights the finite energy necessary for the rest of creation.
This book, Vayikra, is named for the arrangement and rectification of all creation according to the Torah, and it is also known as the Book of Numbers. The difference between the Ten Utterances (ma'amarot) and the Ten Commandments (dibrot) lies in their function. An utterance represents the creative force that HaShem placed in the world, where He speaks and creation comes into existence. A commandment, however, signifies HaShem's ongoing supervision and governance over the creation as it exists, ensuring that nothing ever escapes His divine providence.<br>This distinction highlights the unique relationship between Bnei Yisrael and the nations. While all acknowledge that HaShem created everything, Bnei Yisrael understand that HaShem continuously renews and supervises creation every moment. This is the essence of "dibur" (speech). It is also the difference between humans and animals. As our sages say, "You are called 'Adam,'" meaning humans are distinct in their ability to bring their internal potential into action. Unlike animals, which act purely on instinct, humans articulate their thoughts and command actions through speech.<br>Bnei Yisrael are unique in their sacred speech, the words of Torah, which govern all creation. The Zohar states that in Egypt, speech was in exile, but with the giving of the Torah, the world's governance was rectified according to the Torah. This sacred speech, embodied in the Torah, empowers Bnei Yisrael to lead and influence all of creation.
The Midrash explains the verse “Each man by his flag” (Bamidbar 2:2) and connects it to the idea that Bnei Yisrael desired flags, similar to the heavenly hosts. The analogy given is of a wine cellar, and the verse “His banner of love was over me” (Shir Hashirim 2:4). It also references “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the name of HaShem our G-d” (Tehillim 20:8).<br>HaShem established various levels and hierarchies in the higher worlds, enabling attachment and the flow of divine energy to all creations and nations. However, Bnei Yisrael are directly attached to HaShem Himself. Our sages say, "The forefathers are the chariot," meaning their connection to HaShem is beyond the chariot. Bnei Yisrael desired to be connected to their supreme source, unlike other nations who seek vitality for themselves. Bnei Yisrael wish to nullify themselves to HaShem.<br>HaShem fulfilled their desire by giving them flags, symbolizing the higher realms in the heavens. The flags are a reflection of divine letters (the letters of HaShem’s name), as indicated by the four flags corresponding to divine attributes in sacred texts. This was in the merit of the forefathers, whose actions for their descendants ensure that when Bnei Yisrael follow their ways, they are aided by their merit.<br>The Midrash also notes that while some chose not to draw near, the forefathers brought themselves close to HaShem. Consequently, their descendants are drawn close even without explicit choice, due to their forefathers' merit. This is the meaning of “by the signs of their ancestral house” (Bamidbar 2:2), indicating a connection and continuation of the forefathers' ways. The phrase “His banner of love was over me” (Shir Hashirim 2:4) signifies that Bnei Yisrael can connect to levels beyond their own through their longing and desire, granted by HaShem’s love for them.
In Avot 6:2, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says, "Every day a heavenly voice goes out from Mount Horeb, lamenting the disgrace of the Torah, saying: 'Woe to the creatures who insult the Torah.' It also states, 'A beautiful woman without taste is like a gold ring in a pig's snout,' and 'There is no free person except one who engages in Torah study,' and 'From the wilderness, a gift, and from the gift, Nachaliel...'"<br>This voice is the essence of the Ten Commandments, described as "a great voice that did not cease" (Devarim 5:19), which continues to reach Bnei Yisrael. As it is written, "the Giver of the Torah," indicating an ongoing act. Since this voice is directed specifically at Bnei Yisrael, if they do not prepare themselves to receive it, it is considered an insult to the Torah. This is the meaning of the analogy "a beautiful woman without taste," as Bnei Yisrael are uniquely suited to the voice of the Torah.<br>Even though there are many obstacles to drawing oneself closer to the Torah, it is said that through one's yearning for and desire to follow the Torah, it is given as a gift. Subsequently, one can become even more connected to the Torah, making it their inheritance, as the verse states, "From the wilderness, a gift, and from the gift, Nachaliel."<br>This teaching emphasizes the ongoing nature of receiving the Torah and the unique relationship Bnei Yisrael have with it. Their preparation and desire are crucial for fully embracing and inheriting the Torah, transforming it from a gift into a personal and eternal inheritance.<br>

Section 6

5636
In the Midrash Tanchuma (Bamidbar 1:1), it is emphasized that the Torah specifies the exact time and place of Hashem's revelation to Moshe as a testament to His deep love for Bnei Yisrael. This notion of time and place holds profound significance.<br>Bnei Yisrael were created to clarify and testify to the existence and unity of Hashem, as expressed in the verse from Yeshaya (43:10): "You are My witnesses." The Midrash elaborates that if Bnei Yisrael are not His witnesses, then, metaphorically speaking, Hashem's presence is not as evident in the world. Just as witnesses in legal matters are rigorously examined with seven interrogations—regarding the day, place, and other details—Bnei Yisrael must illuminate the oneness of Hashem in every facet of the world.<br>This mission involves the process of clarification (בירור) and repair (תיקון) in all places. The days of the week and Shabbat illustrate this concept: Shabbat is called a testimony (שבת סהדותא איקרי), and the weekdays are the period of examination and preparation. The quality of one's observance during the weekdays determines the clarity and power of the testimony on Shabbat, as reflected in the saying, "Whoever prepares on the eve of Shabbat will have food to eat on Shabbat."<br>The detailed account of the time and place of Hashem's communication with Moshe in the Torah underscores that every aspect of Bnei Yisrael's existence is meticulously linked to specific times and places. This is essential for the rectification (תיקון) of the world (עולם), time (שנה), and soul (נפש).<br>Bnei Yisrael, embodying the soul of the world, are tasked with rectifying and illuminating the timing and positioning of all things in our world. Through their dedicated efforts, they fulfill this sacred responsibility, ensuring that the presence and unity of Hashem are evident in every aspect of creation.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:12) offers a profound explanation regarding the counting of Bnei Yisrael. It references the promise to Avraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars, despite his initial despair about having children. Hashem revealed to Avraham that he and his descendants would transcend the influence of mazal (astrological destiny). Instead, they would be blessed with countless offspring, as numerous as the stars.<br>This blessing of countless descendants is rooted in the concept of nullification to the source and the ultimate oneness of all things. Philosophers have long pondered how the singularity of Hashem can be the source of multiplicity. The answer lies in Hashem's unlimited nature, demonstrating that through nullification to Hashem, multiplicity can emerge from oneness. Even though there may be many parts, they are all ultimately part of a unified whole.<br>Avraham exemplified this idea. Known as "one" (אחד היה אברהם), he was not supposed to have children according to his mazal. Yet, he was blessed with countless descendants precisely because of his nullification to Hashem. This concept applies equally to the descendants of Avraham—the people of Bnei Yisrael. The verse "והיה מספרם אשר לא יספר" ("their number will be a number that cannot be counted") indicates that through unity with Hashem, Bnei Yisrael can receive the blessing of infinite multiplicity.<br>The blessing and increase come from nullification to the source of oneness. Philosophers question how multiplicity can arise from the singular oneness of Hashem, and the answer is that Hashem, being all-powerful, made it so that multiplicity emerges through nullification to oneness. This demonstrates that despite the various divisions and increases, everything is rooted in a singular unity.<br>Avraham, representing the sustenance of the world (as derived from the phrase בהבראם—created with Avraham), was initially shown by his mazal that he would not have children, questioning how multiplicity could come from his singularity. Hashem blessed him with the promise that his descendants would also be numerous and beyond counting, indicating that through their unity with Hashem, they would be blessed with infinite increase. This is the essence of the promise "כה יהי' זרעך" ("so shall your offspring be"), reflecting the blessing of countless descendants rooted in their unity with the divine oneness.
Tehillim 20:6 says, "We will rejoice in Your salvation and be strong in the name of Hashem." The Midrash connects this to our parsha, Bamidbar 1:2, which states, "To count by the names" (במספר שמות). This teaches us that each individual among Bnei Yisrael has a unique name. The Chidushei Harim, based on the Zohar in Shemos, expands on this idea, explaining that there are 600,000 names representing the entire nation of Yisrael, paralleling the 600,000 letters in the Torah. This is because the entire Torah encompasses the names of Hashem, and the 600,000 names reflect the 600,000 souls of Bnei Yisrael.<br>Thus, the pasuk in Yeshaya 43:7 holds significance: "Whatever is called in My name (Hashem) is created for My glory." This refers to Bnei Yisrael, who bear the responsibility of glorifying the name of Hashem. Consequently, there is a command to count and acknowledge each person by their name. Each individual must embrace their responsibility and establish a connection with their unique source.<br>This explains why the subsequent parsha discusses the flags of each tribe. According to the Midrash, Bnei Yisrael desired flags similar to those of the angels. The angels' sole purpose is their unique mission, as they are completely dedicated to Hashem, and their existence exemplifies the glory of Hashem. Similarly, once each member of Bnei Yisrael recognized their individual mission, they aspired to have flags that would magnify the name of Hashem.<br>The flags symbolize the unique roles and missions of each tribe, just as the angels are identified by their specific tasks and dedication to Hashem. Bnei Yisrael, by recognizing their unique names and missions, sought to manifest this individuality in a way that would honor and glorify Hashem. The counting by names and the subsequent establishment of flags reflect this deep desire to connect with and express their divine purpose, ultimately enhancing the collective sanctification of Hashem’s name.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 4:20) states that when someone uplifts the honor of Heaven and diminishes their own honor, the glory of Heaven increases, and their own honor also grows. The Sfas Emes questions why someone would desire an increase in personal honor and what purpose it serves. The answer is that any recognition or glory a person receives in this world is ultimately meant to elevate the honor of Hashem. Therefore, when an individual fulfills their mission of reducing their own honor, they are granted even greater honor as a reward. By continuously diminishing their own honor, they greatly amplify the honor of Hashem.<br>Conversely, if someone uses honor solely to enhance their own reputation, that honor works against them and becomes detrimental. As a consequence, that honor is taken away from them.<br>The Rebbe of Lublin provides further clarification on this matter. He questions why the Midrash needs to explicitly state that when one increases the honor of Heaven, the honor of Hashem is indeed increased. Isn't this an obvious outcome? The Rebbe explains that some individuals may mistakenly believe that if they, as Torah scholars or individuals of high stature, degrade their own honor to uplift the honor of Hashem, it would somehow limit God's honor. However, the Rebbe assures that since their ultimate intention is to increase the honor of Heaven, even though they may appear to be trivializing their own honor, they will undoubtedly succeed in their mission.<br>Thus, the principle is that the more one nullifies their own honor for the sake of Hashem's honor, the more they are prepared to receive honor. This honor is not for self-aggrandizement but to further elevate the honor of Hashem. Therefore, their own honor increases so that they have more to diminish, thereby continually increasing the honor of Heaven.

The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:12) explains how Avraham, despite seeing in the stars that he would not have any children, was told by Hashem to observe the sky. Hashem assured Avraham that the same constellation indicating his lack of offspring would now show that he would indeed have children.<br>The key idea here is that although the souls of Bnei Yisrael are connected to a higher spiritual realm beyond the physical world, they are bound by the limitations of their physical bodies and the natural laws governing this world. However, Hashem was teaching Avraham that when the soul of an individual Jew is elevated, and similarly when there is a collective spiritual elevation on a national level, they have the power to elevate the entire world and transcend the constraints of nature.<br>Despite everything being influenced by mazal (astrological destiny), the Jewish people have the ability to rise above and surpass the influence of mazal. This is why we are sent to this world: to bring about change and elevate the world around us.<br>This understanding sheds light on the verse from Hosea 2:1, which states that "the number of Bnei Yisrael will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted." It means that the number of the Jewish people will be elevated to such a degree that it becomes ‘no number’. This may seem contradictory—how can a number be both absolute and unlimited? The answer lies in the concept of unification and oneness with Hashem. By nullifying ourselves to the infinite nature of Hashem, we transcend the confines of numbers and become boundless.<br>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 1:1) further illustrates that the righteous individuals who constantly direct their life force and energy towards Hashem receive a reward where Hashem directs and influences all of nature and time for their benefit. The general concept is that the notion of "number" pertains to the details and complexities of this world, which require rectification. On Shabbat, however, everything is unified, and the notion of "number" dissolves into the infinite. This is also discussed in the Midrash, which states that the phrase "until they cannot be counted" refers to the world to come. In the world to come, the concept of "number" will be completely rectified, as Shabbat itself serves as a glimpse into the unity that will be experienced in the world to come, the ultimate source of oneness.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:6) offers an interpretation of the verse (Devarim 32:10), "He found them in a deserted wilderness," suggesting that before Bnei Yisrael received the Torah, the world was in a state of emptiness, described as "תהו" (tohu), meaning void or chaos. This concept indicates that Bnei Yisrael recognized their own lack and need for something greater, making them worthy of receiving the Torah.<br>The Maharal expands on this idea by proposing that the substance (חומר) of an object has the potential to take on a form (צורה) based on its level of desire or longing for perfection. In other words, an object's earnest aspiration to achieve its fullest potential determines the form it ultimately assumes.<br>This concept is mirrored in the creation narrative, where there was initially a state of nothingness, described as "תהו," followed by the emergence of light. Similarly, the Torah was given in the wilderness ("מדבר") to emphasize the importance of recognizing one's own wilderness-like state, devoid of form, and in need of fulfillment.<br>There are four stages of objects in this world: inanimate (דומם), plants (צומח), animals (חי), and humans (מדבר, which also means "those that speak"). Even though Bnei Yisrael were at the highest stage as humans, they acknowledged that the greatest attainment was complete alignment with the will of Hashem. This idea is expressed in David's prayer in Tehillim 131:2, "If I have not made my soul quiet like that of a suckling child" (אם לא שויתי ודוממתי), which Rashi compares to a child relying entirely on its mother for sustenance. David humbles himself, becoming like an inanimate object ("דומם") or one who is silent and relinquishes his own desires, choosing instead to be completely guided by Hashem.<br>This represents the concept of a true "מדבר" (one who speaks) who, despite possessing the ability to communicate, willingly assumes the qualities of a wilderness ("מדבר") and wholeheartedly follows Hashem's direction. The verse in Devarim continues with "יצרנהו," referring to the form and shape, which pertains to the concept of the flags. The flags provided each person with a precise understanding of their place and life mission, serving as clear indicators of the source and essence of the Jewish people.<br>This idea is also alluded to in the phrase "ויתילדו על משפחתם" (and they were born according to their families), which underscores the connection to a child mentioned earlier—a child that is utterly dependent on its mother. This connection highlights that by recognizing their dependence and nullification to Hashem, Bnei Yisrael elevate themselves and the world around them. They transform the wilderness into a place of divine revelation and fulfillment, reflecting the ultimate unity and oneness with Hashem.<br>
In the Mishnah (Avot 6:1) that deals with studying Torah for its own sake, it states, "He merits many things, etc." What does it mean "for its own sake (לשמה)"?<br>It is known that the true value of the Torah cannot be comprehended by anyone. However, the Torah that we have is the garment of the Torah. Through a person's engagement with this Torah, the inner power is awakened. This is the essence of the power given to Bnei Yisrael, who are capable of awakening the root of the Torah. Just as the life force of a person is a garment for the power of the soul, which is a divine part from above.<br>This is what is meant in the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 2:13), "And there will be a number among the Children of Israel, like the number counted in the Torah." Meaning, just as the Torah has letters, words, and is countable, nevertheless, the root of the Torah is not encompassed by all these. Similarly, the souls of the Children of Israel, although in this world they have a number, their root is above number. The holy books state that the 600,000 souls of Bnei Yisrael correspond to the 600,000 letters in the Torah.<br>This is the reward for studying Torah for its own sake: one merits these good attributes because all these attributes are rooted in the souls of Bnei Yisrael. The only way to bring them out from potential to actuality is through engaging in Torah study, as it is written, "In the streets she gives forth her voice" (Mishlei 1:20). Through exertion, the inner power of the Torah spreads into the garment, and the garment connects with the inner aspect. This is called "for its own sake" (לשמה) because the name of something is the spreading of its energy, similar to “a good name that spreads far and wide” (Tanchuma Vayakhel 1).<br>Similarly, the phrase, "Like the fragrance of good oils, your name is like flowing oil" (Shir Hashirim 1:3) indicates that there are things whose rectification can only come through receiving the scent of the holiness of the Torah. This means that even if certain aspects cannot be fully grasped, their connection to the Torah's holiness still brings about their rectification. This concept is elaborated elsewhere (See Yisro תרל"ח).

Shavuot



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Help Shavuot. Not written in order. First night
The Gemara (Brachot 88a) says, "The earth feared and was silent." If it was afraid, why was it silent? And if it was silent, why was it afraid? The explanation is that at first, it feared, and in the end, it was silent. This refers to the revelation at Sinai. Reish Lakish explains that Hashem made a condition with creation: if Bnei Yisrael accept the Torah, the world will continue; if not, it will return to chaos. The earth feared until the Torah was given, and then it was calmed. <br>The explanation of the Gemara is that the initial fear led to the eventual calm. Reish Lakish's question was not just why there was fear, but why there was silence if there was fear. The answer is that the fear was necessary for the calm. Hashem's condition with creation was essential to prepare for receiving the Torah. By making creation dependent on Bnei Yisrael’s acceptance of the Torah, it ensured that the nature of creation would not oppose this acceptance. Thus, the initial fear allowed Bnei Yisrael to receive the Torah, leading to the calm.<br>This principle applies to each mitzvah. Preparation through initial fear leads to love and connection to Hashem during the mitzvah. Fear ensures that one does not spoil the mitzvah and can perform it as Hashem wills. This is the meaning of "You shall guard" (fear) and "You shall do" (love). Guarding oneself through fear prepares one to fulfill the positive commandments with love. The negative commandments prepare for the positive ones, as it says, "Turn from evil and do good." This is why the verse says, "The land feared and was silent." Repairing this world requires fear to precede love. This is the concept of "remembering" (connection to the inner life force) and "guarding" (fear to stay within boundaries). The Gemara explains that Hashem said "zachor" and "shamor" simultaneously because Moshe did not change Hashem's words. The commandment to Klal Yisrael, once perfected, involves "guarding" as preparation to accept holiness. One who guards themselves and their desires for Hashem's sake also merits the level of "zachor." In Devarim, Moshe explained how Bnei Yisrael could achieve the level of "zachor" through "shamor."

In Bamidbar (28:27), it says, "And on the festival of new fruit, you shall bring a new mincha offering." The Torah teaches that Hashem created the world with the Torah, meaning the inner life force of everything in creation originates from the Torah. As it is stated, the Torah is called "Reishis" (the beginning). During creation, this inner power was hidden, but it was revealed on the day the Torah was given, reconnecting everything to its source. This is reflected in the phrase "face to face Hashem spoke to you," where the internal essence (pnimius) was revealed.<br>The Gemara (Shabbos 88b) explains that with each word of the Ten Commandments, the entire world was filled, and each word split into 70 languages. This shows that the life force of the Torah permeated all of creation when Hashem revealed Himself. The Ten Commandments correspond to the ten sayings with which Hashem created the world, where a ma’amar (saying) is hidden, and a dibur (commandment) is revealing. The main aspect of receiving the Torah is this revelation, as the Targum translates "And Hashem came down on Mt. Sinai" to mean "Hashem revealed Himself on Mt. Sinai."<br>Shavuot is called the "day of the first fruit" because everything became connected to the concept of the first revelation, resulting in renewal. Our daily prayer acknowledges that "He renews in His goodness the creation of the world," where "goodness" refers to the Torah. On Shavuot, this renewal is more revealed, even nullifying the evil inclination by showing that its life force also comes from the Torah. This is symbolized by the two loaves waved on Shavuot, representing both the heavenly bread (Hashem's kindness) and the earthly bread (our good deeds). The Gemara (Pesachim 68b) states that "everyone agrees that on Shavuot one also needs 'lachem' (physical enjoyment)," as the giving of the Torah is a revelation in this world. The Maharal explains that the evil inclination exists only because the Torah can nullify it; without this potential, it would not have been created.

As written above, the Gemara (Rosh Hashana 27a) explains that both words of "zachor" (remember) and "shamor" (guard) the Shabbos day were said by Hashem simultaneously. The idea of "guarding" is to protect oneself from transgressing the negative commandments, to stay within boundaries, and to be prepared to fulfill the mitzvot. The "remembering" stage comes after Bnei Yisrael have completed their preparation through "guarding."<br>The Gemara states that this simultaneous expression was something that a mouth cannot say and an ear cannot hear. However, Bnei Yisrael were able to hear it because they were completely nullified to the source of life at that time. The Chidushei Harim explains that they saw the voices, indicating an experience beyond regular senses. Through the power of the Torah, their physical limitations were removed, allowing them to perceive what is normally imperceptible by nature.<br>Similarly, our sages use physical parables to make the Torah understandable, enabling the physical ear to hear its deeper meanings. The Torah is enclothed in physical terms, which allows us to grasp its profound secrets. This unification of the hidden and revealed aspects of the Torah is reflected in the simultaneous expression of "zachor" and "shamor." The Torah's inner essence (pnimius) is embedded in human life, while the "guarding" pertains to the external observance in this world. Through Hashem's expression, which reveals this inner power, everything is guided by the pnimius, unifying the hidden and revealed, allowing us to perceive both aspects.

Section 2

5633
From Yom Tov Shavuot briefly summarized as I remember
The Torah is the life force and the reason for the existence of creation. The phrase “Blessed is He that says and does” from Pesukei Dezimra refers to the creation of the world through the "ten expressions." “Who decrees and fulfills” pertains to the commandments that sustain the world.
When Bnei Yisrael received the Torah, they feared for their lives and asked Moshe to speak instead of Hashem. The pasuk (Shemos 20:17) states, “Moshe spoke to the nation and said, ‘Do not fear, for Hashem has come to test you, and so that His fear will be upon you, so that you do not sin.’” This seems contradictory: Moshe says not to fear but then emphasizes the importance of fear. The explanation is that fear is necessary to prevent sin, but one must also serve Hashem with love. Even if one feels distant due to sin, the pasuk “His banner of love was over me” (Shir Hashirim 2:4) shows that Hashem's love allows one to draw closer. Hashem acknowledges that even though Bnei Yisrael were far from Moshe's level, their sincere desire to get closer would be accepted.
The Gemara (Shabbos 88a) explains that when Bnei Yisrael received the Torah, Hashem lifted the mountain like a barrel above them and declared that if they did not accept the Torah, they would be buried under it. This act of compulsion serves as a major excuse for not fulfilling the Torah’s directives. Our sages explain that at the time of receiving the Torah, there was freedom, as the inner life force of nature was revealed, subjecting all of creation to Hashem's will, similar to the future when His name will be one.<br>When Hashem descended on Har Sinai, it was a revelation of the life force in every part of creation. This is indicated by the phrase “And Hashem came down on Har Sinai,” which Onkelos translates as “Hashem revealed Himself.” The entire creation was aligned with its source, and every part of creation initially thought Hashem was speaking directly to it until He specified, “who took you out of Mitzrayim,” clarifying that He was addressing Bnei Yisrael. This demonstrates that Hashem is the life force of all creation, but His dominion is revealed through Bnei Yisrael.<br>The clarity of life force at the time of the Torah's giving meant that sin was impossible, as nature itself prevented disobedience. This is the meaning of “Hashem lifted the mountain above them,” signifying that the revelation left no room for free choice to sin. The excuse for not following the Torah arises because Bnei Yisrael did not know that the revelation would later be hidden. Therefore, it is a mitzvah to recall the day of standing before Hashem at Har Sinai, representing the ultimate revelation. However, Bnei Yisrael reaccepted the Torah during Purim when they saw miracles within nature and realized that nature is merely a cover, with the Torah being the inner life force of everything.
The Gemara (Pesachim 68b) states that R’ Yosef would enjoy the Shavuot meal, saying, “If not for this day, there would be many Yosefs in the market.” This seems difficult because, without the Torah, there would be no Yosefs at all. The explanation is that before the Torah, the good was hidden. The Torah's revelation separated and clarified the good from the bad.
Regarding the Reading of the Book of Ruth on Shavuot:
This is really about the Oral Torah. The Kadosh Barukh Hu wants the children of Israel to expand the Written Torah through their deeds--for we know that the deeds of the righteous are “Torah”. Through the deeds of Boaz and Ruth, a scroll was produced by Divine Guidance. 
It is written “And Elohim said...saying”, meaning: the children of Israel said words like these to themselves. It’s also written “who gave us a Torah of truth, and within us, planted eternal life”--this refers to Oral Torah,  the unique quality of Torah which is Israel’s. They have a unique intellectual approach to understand secrets within the Torah which are hidden and not explicit within the Torah itself. 
This itself is the matter of Boaz, whose name means Bo Oz--strength within him--that is to say, he had deep faith in the words of the Sages who explained “an Amonite--excluding an Amonitess”. He had no doubt in the matter, like Ploni did who said “lest I endanger my inheritance”. On the contrary! He was ecstatic to show that the interpretation of the Rabbis was the Torah given on Sinai. 
“Trust in the Sages” is the foundation of Oral Torah, and this is what is meant by “Truth and Trust”. Written Torah is explicitly exoteric. Yet, it is the will of the Divine that in this downcast world, Israel achieve ‘truth’ by way of ‘trust’.
The ego gives itself over to remove that trust from a person. It makes it seem in one’s eyes as though they are alienated from Hashem Yisbarakh, and tells them that it is arrogant to even try to seek Hashem Yisbarakh in silent prayer, and the like. But the truth is the exact opposite! Seeking God at all fosters the fear of Heaven. 
One should contemplate to see that it is in no way disgraceful to contemplate the trivialities of the world for “the entire world is filled with His Presence”. How could someone be ashamed of pondering that what is His true desire?
Now what emerges is the reason that Israel wished to hear the first two commandments from God Himself: to believe the truth of God as the lifeforce of every human being. As it says “I am the Lord your God”--literally, all of your lifeforce. That’s why it is addressed to the second person singular, for the innermost life force of every Jew is is the same point which gives life to all of creation as it is says “You ‘give life’ to all things”. Thus our Sages taught: A person should always see themselves as if the Holy Presence abides in one’s insides.”, for a holy person should be able to uncover the holy presence within themselves. A person doesn’t create something new by some sort of deed, rather she reveals the innermost life force within her as it says “And He breathed into his mouth life breath”. If a person can believe in this life force, to not forget about it,  and always strive to cleave to the root of this life force, they can merit the “truth by means of trust”, mentioned above. 
One should believe that as the Holy One said “Let there be light”, that the light can shine one more day. Just as God said “I am the Lord your God”, there is a divine life force in every Jew.

This holiday is called the Festival of Shavuot (Weeks) based on the oath (<i>shavuah</i> that they swore and remains, from [the experience] at Mount Sinai. And this is by way of a true sacrifice of the self - as they said, the soul of the Israelites departed. It is like they said (Weekday Siddur, Aleinu), "To You every knee will bend, every tongue will swear" - before a man is created, he is made to take an oath. And likewise when he departs from the world, he sees the Divine Presence, as it were, and is negated to Him, may He be blessed - and that is the oath. And so too was the revelation of, "I am the Lord, your God," at Mount Sinai; and that is why their souls departed. And that is why they are also able to properly accept the yoke of His Kingdom, may He be blessed, today on this festival. And we have already written in another place that the Festival of Pesach and of Shavuot [correspond to] the aspect of the hand tefillin and the head tefillin. The acceptance of the Kingdom of Heaven on Pesach to subjugate the body and the animal spirit is the aspect of the hand tefillin - to subjugate [physical] strength; but on Shavuot, it is the head tefillin. It is as they said (Berakhot 6a:19), "'And all the nations of the earth shall see, etc. the name of the Lord is called upon you' (Deuteronomy 28:10) - this is [a reference to] the head tefillin." It is to subjugate the mind and the intellect to Him, may He be blessed. So too is the order: First one must abnegate himself without complete knowledge; afterwards we merit to know that this is the Torah and the purpose of the three holidays. This is according to the order that our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 15a:1): One should relieve himself, wash his hands, don tefillin, recite Shema, and pray - this is the complete [acceptance of] the Kingdom of Heaven. So too is the matter more generally of the three holidays and Shemini Atzeret, which is [associated with] the aspect of prayer. That is why the two breads are on Shavuot, as it is stated (Psalms 9:5), "[Wisdom says,] Come, eat my bread." The hand tefillin and the head tefillin [correspond to] the aspect of, "man and beast You deliver, O Lord" (Psalms 36:7). For the hand tefillin [corresponds] to the aspect of the Oral Torah, the arousal of man; and afterwards he merits the flow of knowledge from the Heavens, [corresponding to] the aspect of the Written Torah.

Concerning the issue of "zachor" and "shamor:" "Shamor" is the holiness that descends on Shabbat. And we must be vigilant to avoid violating this aspect of Shabbat's holiness. This aspect of Shabbat--the holiness that descends from above--is the aspect of Shabbat regarding which it is written that we must "guard" the mitzva of Shabbat. But "zachor" refers to the holiness that the Jewish people draw into the Shabbat, adding to its holiness by renewing the day and reciting the Shabbat prayers.  And this (i.e., the "zachor" aspect of Shabbat) is a higher level. But our sages taught that anyone who has "shmira" also has "zechira." This is because one who "guards" the Shabbat will ultimately merit the higher level of "remembering" the Shabbat.

5664. ...
From the holiday of Shavu'ot. 
They established [reading of] Ruth on Shavu'ot, to say that, by means of B'nai Yisrael being chosen through the Giving of the Torah, they are instruments to draw near the converts, because B'nai Yisrael are called the First of His Crop which is the fruit for which everything was created. This is as it says (Gen. R.), "B'reishit -- for the sake of Israel which is called 'reishit.'" The meaning is that "reishit" is the beginning and the inner essence, as it says (Prov.), "The 'reishit' of wisdom is the awe of God." Therefore it is called the Day of Bikkurim, when the fruit is ripe. But B'nai Yisrael "are excepted from the generality in order to teach to the entire generality" (Sifra, principles of R' Yishma'el), as it will be in the future (Zeph. 3:9), "For then I will make the peoples pure of speech, etc. [so that they all invoke Adonai by name and serve Him with one accord]." And then (Eccl. 7:8) "The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it" [see Ruth 3:10]. And in truth, according as B'nai Yisrael elevate from the nations, they are themselves exalted even more. And this itself is the meaning of putting "na'aseh" before "nishma," for B'nai Yisrael understood this, that they were chosen in order to draw everyone near, and they said (Ex. 24:7), "Everything that Adonai has spoken we will do." It is written here "na'aseh" and it is written there (Gen. 1:26), "Na'aseh adam," as it says (Gen. 12:5) "the souls that they had made," which Onkelos translated "that they had subjugated to the Torah", and it is through this that "we will hear." As it is with the particular -- as the improvement [tikkun] of the deeds, in order to draw each physical deed close to the spirit so that the soul shines in the person -- so it is in general -- as the improvement [tikkun] of K'lal Yisrael to draw near from the nations, so that the Torah shines in them. It is written (Micah 7:20), "You will give truth to Ya'akov, hesed to Avraham," for B'nai Yisrael are in truth God's portion and His Torah, but it is also part of the aspect of Truth to do hesed, to bring near those who are far off and who come for the sake of Heaven: "truth to Ya'akov" is the Torah, "hesed to Avraham" is that we should draw close also from the descendants of Lot -- Ruth the Moabite....

With G-d's Blessing Naso
(Bamidbar 6:2) “When a man or woman explicitly (yafli) utters a Nazirite vow” means to separate oneself from worldly matters. Even if involved in worldly matters, one can connect to the source, the internal life force, which is called “pele” (wonder). As it says in Tehillim 72:18, “He does wonders (niflaot),” meaning Hashem provides this concept even in physical matters. The Rama (Orach Chaim 6:1) explains the blessing “umafli la’asot” as Hashem combining the spiritual soul with the physical body.<br>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 10:1) states, “His thighs are pillars of marble,” referring to Hashem’s longing to create the world. The creation is based on chochma, bina, and da’as, allowing one to connect to Hashem’s internal life force. On Shabbos, everything is elevated, recognizing their source and longing to be nullified to Hashem, bringing Hashem pleasure from creation.<br>The Midrash explains that through chochma, bina, and da’as, one overcomes the physical world's interference. Chochma is nullifying oneself to Hashem, realizing His greatness. Bina deepens this understanding, helping one naturally avoid sin. Da’as brings chochma and bina into every action, as it says, “In all your ways, know Him” (Mishlei 3:6). This leads to knowing the internal power of Hashem in creation. On Shabbos, it says, “to know (lada’at) that I am Hashem who makes you holy,” meaning all creation becomes nullified to Hashem. The Midrash teaches that one can connect to Hashem’s highest level through longing and desire, connecting to the inner life force, and ascending higher and higher.
The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Bamidbar 5:7) “He shall confess his sin and make restitution,” noting that this commandment of repentance and confession is specifically mentioned regarding theft. This is because every sin is a form of theft. If one realizes that Hashem is the owner and sustainer of everything, they would not sin.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:7) says, “I praise Shalom—peace, for it is the vessel that can contain blessing.” On Shabbos, it says “He blessed it,” referring to Shalom, the internal life force that gives completion to everything. This is Shalom, the point that gives life to all. The priestly blessing (Bamidbar 6:25-26) says, “Hashem shall deal graciously with you (ya’er panav)… and give you peace.” Panav (His face) refers to the pnimius, the internal aspect, as in “Face (panim) to face” (Devarim 5:4). This means being connected to the source of life.<br>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 11:7) says that Hashem generally does not show favoritism, but He does to His nation, who bless Him even for small amounts of food. The Chidushei Harim, quoting the Rebbe of Pershischa, explains that this ‘favoritism’ is because Bnei Yisrael bless Hashem for even a small amount, valuing it as coming from Hashem. Since they show this appreciation, Hashem reciprocates.<br>Bnei Yisrael are always connected to the internal source of life. They value the source of food from Hashem, focusing on the pnimius rather than the amount. Hashem shows favoritism by not considering occasional sins, knowing their true desire is to connect to Him. This level of favoritism applies to those who constantly nullify their external desires to be attached to the internal life force.

The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 10:1) explains that from the word ויכולו, we learn that Hashem longed to create the world. Although this desire is specifically mentioned regarding Shabbos, it applies to the entire creation. The explanation is that Hashem's will was to connect the entire creation and its actions to His will. During the weekdays, this will is cloaked in actions, while on Shabbos, it is clear without the need for action.<br>Therefore, the weekdays act as pillars connecting Hashem's will to action, while on Shabbos, all actions cease, leaving pure desire without action. The nullification on Shabbos renews this desire, preparing for the upcoming weekdays.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 11:7) addresses the pasuk “Hashem will be gracious to you,” questioning how this aligns with the idea that Hashem does not show favoritism. The Midrash answers that Hashem shows favoritism when Bnei Yisrael do His will. This seems puzzling—if we are doing His will, why do we need favoritism?<br>The explanation is that Hashem does not need to honor anyone because He is the King of Glory. However, when a person has a point of pnimius, they recognize and carry the ‘face’ of Hashem. The term “panav” (His face) indicates that the person reflects Hashem’s life force. This small bit of pnimius gives a person the power to finish their mission with divine help, as our sages taught, “If Hashem does not help him, he cannot manage.” Therefore, when Bnei Yisrael do Hashem’s will, He shows graciousness by recognizing their inner desire and helping them complete their work. This is the blessing “Hashem shall show you graciousness,” meaning that even our small efforts are valued by Hashem. The Zohar (2:184b) adds that Hashem combines even our imperfect intentions into action, highlighting His graciousness.

Section 3

5635
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 10:1) explains that the word ויכולו signifies Hashem's longing to create the world. During the weekdays, the primary objective is to ensure that all actions are for the sake of Heaven, not to get attached to physical actions, but to long to transition to the aspect of Shabbos. This longing awakens Hashem's desire towards us.<br>This desire culminates on Shabbos, as the Midrash explains from ויכולו that Hashem longed for creation. Through this longing, we attain chochma and binah, aspects of Shabbos, and da’as, which applies to the weekdays. This is symbolized by the “sockets of gold” on which the six days of the week are established, and it is reflected in the three Shabbos meals that sustain everything.<br>The Chidushei Harim also explains the pasuk “on the sixth day they will prepare” (Shemos 16:5) to mean that rejoicing in anticipation of Shabbos is the preparation that awakens the light of Shabbos.
"May God show you favor." The Midrash asks (Bamidbar_Rabbah.11.7): but doesn't the Torah elsewhere say Hashem does not play favorites, אשר לא ישא פנים ולא יקח שוחד? Answer: this verse applies when we do God's will, and this verse applies when we don't. Sfas Emes asks: but when we're doing God's will, why would we even need favoritism? Answer: it means may God count a little as if it were a lot. (A Midrash (Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.10) also says, in connection with our verse, that Hashem says, "My people show extra favor to Me! I said to recite a blessing when they eat to satisfaction, but they recite a blessing even on an olive-size morsel of food." So you see this is what it means to show extra favor: rejoicing in the tiniest opportunity and counting it as significant.) And it depends on how the person sees it. If a person rejoices at being able to do God's will even in a small way, then God too finds that mitzvah immensely precious. This rejoicing is an expression of the person's innermost essence. And this is what it means וישם לך שלום. Shleimus, completeness, is that innermost point of truth, whose radiance, even the tiniest ray, contains its everything. God is called Shalom; that means God is the completeness of all that exists. When our focus is God's will, that means we're focusing on that innermost point of a mitzvah which is its everything. It's shleimus. The size of a mitzvah is irrelevant when you focus on this essence, on doing God's will. 

Section 4

5636
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 7:1) explains the pasuk “And they shall send out of the camp any leper or zav” (Bamidbar 5:2) based on the pasuk “The dross having been separated from the silver” (Mishlei 25:4). To receive the Torah in a pure state, Hashem healed everyone from illnesses. However, after the sin of the Golden Calf, the illnesses returned. When they built the Mishkan, Hashem commanded Moshe to send out anyone who was a metzora or zav to attain spiritual purity.<br>This can be further explained in line with the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 10:1) that Hashem longed to create the world. The primary existence of the world is the longing that creation has to connect to their creator. However, other attractions and desires from negative forces obscure this longing. On Shabbos, all negative forces are repelled, and the purity of longing is revealed, giving the world its existence. The command to “send out of the camp” symbolizes the ability of every Jew to purify and remove impurities, aligning with the intention to connect purely with Hashem.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 6:1) states, “It (the Torah) is more precious than pearls,” meaning more than the Cohen Gadol who enters the inner chambers on Yom Kippur. The Torah is called “Reishis” (the first), as it has the completeness to repair everything, even external matters. As the pasuk states, “In the streets, it raises its voice” (Mishlei 1:20), referring to places where the Torah reaches the lowest places to uplift them. This widening of the Torah is more precious than the inner chambers and the beginning, as it perfects the externalities and brings them to the pnimius, elevating the lower levels to the very beginning.<br>Therefore, it states, “The Torah of Hashem is perfect” (Tehillim 19:8), as it encompasses everything and “restores the soul.” The Midrash explains that when Hashem spoke to Bnei Yisrael on Har Sinai, their souls departed. The Torah protested, saying, “Is there a king who marries off his daughter and then kills his family?” Hashem then restored their souls. This illustrates the Torah's perfection in drawing the lowest elements to the beginning.
The Mishnah in Avos (1:15) states, “Shamai says make your Torah permanent, say a little and do a lot.” This can be understood in line with the Mishnah (Avos 3:9), “One whose actions are greater than his understanding, then his understanding will persevere.” This principle suggests that each detail of learning should result in more action than understanding.<br>“Say little and do a lot” means that one's learning should lead to the reparation of the soul, which is more significant than the learning itself. “Make your Torah permanent” implies that by bringing Torah into action, it becomes enduring. As explained in Avos (3:17), one who has more action than understanding is like a tree with strong roots. The Torah then becomes “his own Torah,” as Rashi in Tehillim (1:2) explains, it becomes personal after toiling in it.<br>“All that Hashem said we will do” signifies bringing Torah to the state of action. Additionally, מעשה (action) can be understood as the nullification of the body to Torah, as in the expression גט מעושה (a forced bill of divorce). All bodily actions need to be done correctly, making the reparation of the world of actions precious to Hashem. This is the idea of “A pure Olah that is made on Har Sinai,” where the Torah was inaugurated into the realm of action.

Section 5

5637
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 10:1) explains that from the word ויכולו (Bereishis 2:1), we learn that Hashem longed to create the world. Although this word commonly refers to the completion of creation, the Midrash interprets it as expressing Hashem’s longing, paralleling the verse in Shir HaShirim (7:11), “Upon me is His desire.”<br>The deeper understanding is that it is within the power of the lower realms, specifically humanity, to awaken Hashem’s desire. The sequence in Bereishis 2:1-2, where it is written, “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished... And on the seventh day, Hashem finished His work,” indicates that the completion of creation was influenced by the actions and desires of the lower realms.<br>This concept is encapsulated in the verse from Shir HaShirim, “Upon me is His desire,” signifying that Hashem’s longing for us is contingent upon our own longing and desire to connect with Him. Our yearning and actions can awaken and draw down the divine desire, illustrating the reciprocal relationship between the divine and the human.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 11:7) addresses a seeming contradiction. On one hand, it states (Bamidbar 6:27), “Hashem will look favorably on you.” Yet elsewhere (Devarim 10:17), it says Hashem is impartial. The Midrash explains that when Bnei Yisrael fulfills Hashem's will, He looks favorably upon them. However, the question remains: how can He judge us favorably if He is impartial?<br>The explanation is that acting favorably (לפנים משורת הדין - beyond the letter of the law) is itself part of the law. The principle “With the measure a person uses, they will be measured” applies here. When Bnei Yisrael serves Hashem with simplicity and without selfish motives, purely to fulfill His will, the reward is that He will look favorably upon them. This concept is rooted in the idea that “He is merciful upon all of His creations” (Tehillim 145:9). Hashem's mercy is awakened because we are His creations, and He knows our true inner essence, the divine life force within us. This causes Hashem to have mercy upon us.<br>However, this mercy is dependent on our actions. When we recognize that everything is Hashem's handiwork and live with the fear of Hashem, the divine part within us becomes more apparent. It is through our efforts that Hashem's mercy is brought about. The Talmud (Sukkah 49b) states that one who fears sinning has "chein" (grace), causing grace to be found before Hashem, as it says, “He will give you grace” (Bamidbar 6:25). Therefore, Hashem has mercy upon the inner divine life force within us.<br>The term ישא (He shall find favor) also relates to the idea of kindling a fire, as in the Mishnah (Rosh HaShana 2:2), “משיאין משואות” (they would burn fires). This means awakening the fiery enthusiasm within the hearts of Bnei Yisrael, comparable to “the flame of Hashem” (Shir Hashirim 8:6). This is the essence of the Mishna (Avot 2:4), “Make your will like His will, so that He will make His will like your will.” Making your will like His reveals Hashem’s will within us without interference, leading to the revelation of our inner divine essence.
In Avot 1:1, it states, "Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua." While the Torah was given to all of Israel, there are two aspects to Torah study: individual effort to understand the Torah and a special quality that allows sages and leaders to gain insights beyond human intellect. This dual nature highlights the importance of faith in the sages (אמונת חכמים), foundational to Torah observance. The Mishnah emphasizes that ancestral teachings, inherited from Sinai, should not be questioned based on personal reasoning.<br>The Gemara (Pesachim 49b) interprets "מורשה" (inheritance) as "מאורסה" (betrothed), signifying that personal effort and commitment are necessary for Torah study. The phrase "prepare yourself to study Torah, for it is not an inheritance for you" (Pirkei Avot 2:12) applies to individuals, indicating that effort is required. However, for the collective of Israel, it is "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob," implying a communal legacy. By integrating into the collective, an individual can also merit a share in this inherited portion of the Torah, combining personal effort with communal inheritance for deeper understanding.

Beha'alotcha



Section 1

The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 15:2) explains that the mitzvah of lighting the Menorah is for the benefit of Bnei Yisrael, not Hashem. The mitzvah is likened to a candle, while the Torah is compared to an actual source of light. Mitzvot act as conduits, drawing the light of the Torah into the world of action, thus preparing for the light that is the Torah. By performing mitzvot, which are Hashem’s commands, one connects to the spiritual essence within these actions, as all creation was made through the Torah, and mitzvot sustain this light.<br>This concept of “making the Torah great” is achieved by bringing the light of Torah into the world through mitzvot, which is the essence of the Oral Torah. It is within human ability, through mitzvot, to draw the light of the Torah into all actions, as stated, “It is close to you in your mouth and heart to do it.” The word "Behaaloscha" (when you light the Menorah, literally “when you lift up”) signifies that through mitzvot, corresponding to different parts of a person, one clarifies that all creations are vessels for Hashem’s inner light, uplifting and connecting everything to its root.<br>This also connects the seven lights of the Menorah to the seven days of the week, symbolizing the connection of nature to its divine source. The phrase “toward the face of the Menorah the lights will shine” refers to the days of the week facing Shabbat, the light of the seven days. The Chidushei Harim explains that Hashem told Aharon his mitzvah of the Menorah would last forever, as the central candle remains alight, even in hidden places like the Mishkan.<br>When there is light from this hidden place, as on Shabbat and Yom Tov, it illuminates hidden aspects, including the light of the Menorah. The mitzvah of the Menorah endures because its main purpose is to bring the light of the Torah into the physical and hidden parts of the world. Even though the actual light may not be visible, it always exists, connecting everything physical to its inner source. This is the essence of the Ner Ma’aravi (the Western Light), symbolizing the connection of all things to the inner light. Aharon worked to bring this light into the physical world, as the Midrash states, Hashem does not need the light for Himself; it is to elevate Bnei Yisrael by bringing the light of Torah into the darkness.
Rashi (Bamidbar 11:4) explains that when the mixed multitude complained, “Who will give us meat?” they indeed had their own meat but were looking for an excuse. If they had meat, what excuse were they seeking? The phrase התאוו תאוה, “They had a craving for a craving,” implies they had no natural desires, having reached a level above nature and being free from the evil inclination after receiving the Torah. They felt it would be correct to have a desire to bring greater pleasure to Hashem by overcoming it and eating meat in holiness.<br>This is why they complained, “Our souls are dry,” indicating they couldn't fulfill the commandment of serving Hashem with “all your soul.” The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 2:37) explains this means serving Hashem with every part of one's soul, nullifying all desires to Hashem. They were on such a high level that they were above these animalistic desires. However, Hashem was not pleased with their approach. A person should avoid bringing themselves into a state of test, even if it could lead to a higher spiritual level, as it may be partly for their own benefit rather than purely for Hashem's will.<br>A person who truly fears Hashem and wants to serve Him properly is content with serving Him in simplicity. Hashem gives tests to allow us to ‘earn’ our reward because “one who eats from someone else is embarrassed to look into the other's face.” However, when Hashem's will is that we do not have to earn it, and He removes the desire, seeking to bring oneself into a state of test is partly for one's own benefit.
The Mishnah in Avos (2:4) states, “Make your will like His will…” Clearly, a person should prioritize Hashem’s will over their own. However, this can be understood to mean that in every action a person does for their own sake, they should align it with Hashem’s will, making it for the sake of Heaven. By doing so, every action will be for Hashem’s sake rather than personal benefit. This aligns with the continuation: “So that He will make His will like your will,” implying that one's will should always aim to fulfill Hashem’s will.<br>The end of the Mishnah, “nullify your will before His will,” suggests that when performing Hashem’s will, personal desires should not mix with the intent, not even for personal gain. Though one should feel joy in doing a mitzvah, the primary reason should be solely to fulfill Hashem’s will. Therefore, personal desires should be completely nullified to the intention of doing Hashem’s will.<br>Rashi’s comment on Aharon, “And Aharon did so,” illustrates this concept. Aharon lit the Menorah exactly as Hashem willed it. How can a human fulfill Hashem’s will precisely? By completely nullifying personal desires and acting solely to fulfill Hashem’s will, it is considered as if one did exactly as Hashem willed. Our sages teach that a good intention is combined with action. Thus, one must be prepared with their entire desire to fulfill only Hashem’s will.

Section 2

5633
Rashi (Bamidbar 8:2) explains that Aharon is commanded to keep the fire by the candles of the Menorah until they light up on their own. This teaches that while everything in creation has a life force from Hashem, it is up to man to awaken this flame and excitement for serving Hashem. Through a person's will and desire, they can awaken the will in anything under their control.<br>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 15:14) explains the verse in Mishlei (24:21), “My son, fear Hashem and the king,” as a command to make one's good inclination king over the evil inclination. Everything in this world was created to glorify Hashem. When a person properly accepts Hashem’s sovereignty, everything in nature becomes subjected to them. This is because Hashem’s dominion is placed on each thing through the person, and all creation naturally follows whatever can draw it to display Hashem’s dominion. Even the evil inclination seeks to be subjected to the righteous against its will.<br>Moshe was able to use kingship in this world because he completely nullified himself to Hashem, with nothing separated from his service. The continuation of the verse in Mishlei, “Do not mix with shonim,” refers to those who believe in two powers. When a person is unaffected by opposing forces and unites the powers of above and below, recognizing that everything is for Hashem’s glory, they clarify Hashem’s dominion through truth and faith.<br>When a person acts for the sake of Heaven, intending to glorify Hashem, they awaken the truth, and everything connects to its source in Hashem. This is the meaning of “beha’alotcha” (when you lift up the candles), signifying that everything is a vessel for the light within it. Man can uplift this light to its intended purpose of glorifying Hashem. This also applies to the days of the week, which correspond to Shabbos. On Shabbos, the forces of Heaven and Earth are unified, clarifying that everything is part of Hashem’s oneness.
Avot (2:4) states, “Make your will like that of Hashem, so that He will make His will like your will.” This advises on perfecting one’s desire. When one connects their will to a mitzvah and good deeds, their desires become linked to holiness and Hashem. This attachment ensures that even when faced with other desires, one remains connected to Hashem. The ingrained holiness protects these desires from becoming corrupted, enabling one to uplift all desires to Hashem.<br>One must believe that even foreign desires can be for the good, helping to form a true desire to serve Hashem. Learning from these desires how to properly fulfill Hashem’s will allows one to elevate all desires to Hashem. This could explain the phrase (Bamidbar 11:4) “They desired a desiring,” as Bnei Yisrael were so removed from physical desires that they desired to have a desire. However, this was considered a sin because Hashem wanted them to serve Him differently at that time.<br>For us, through faith, we must uplift all our desires to serve Hashem, transforming even foreign desires into a unified will to serve Him.

Section 3

5634
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 15:8) explains the verse "Even darkness does not darken for You" (Tehillim 139:12), illustrating that Hashem does not need external light. Instead, our mission is to uncover the hidden light He placed in the world to honor Him. This differs from a parable where a king uses his servant's vessels; in our case, everything belongs to Hashem. Our responsibility is to discover His concealed light within our surroundings.<br>Rashi explains that the mitzvah of kindling the menorah involves allowing the flame to rise independently. This signifies that Hashem created a primordial light, and our task is to connect and unify all elements at their source, allowing the light to naturally radiate. We do not generate the light ourselves; our actions elevate the individual parts towards the light.<br>The verse "The house of Yaakov will be fire, and the house of Yosef a flame" (Ovadia 1:18) conveys a similar idea. Rashi explains that a fire needs a flame to spread. The Torah, representing a fire that transcends nature, is associated with Yaakov, while Yosef harmonized diverse elements, igniting the fire of Yaakov in distant places. Our service involves elevating all components towards Hashem, acknowledging that true comprehension eludes us. The Chidushei Harim further explains that fire emits light through its connection to the wick, and the stronger the connection, the brighter the light.
The Mishna in Avot (2:4) states, "Make His will like your will, so that He will make your will like His will." This can be understood through Rashi's comment on Aharon, who "did as he was commanded," indicating that Aharon did not change personally while performing the mitzvah. Aharon was chosen to bring light to Israel and the world through kindling the menorah, yet he remained unchanged. If he had changed, it would imply a change in the mitzvah itself, as Hashem commanded it to be done as he was.<br>This concept highlights the importance of השתוות (equanimity), a trait praised in sacred texts. Rashi derives this from the Torah's wording, "And Aharon did it so," instead of "And Aharon kindled them" (ויעל), teaching us that Aharon performed the mitzvah without internal change. The effectiveness of a mitzvah depends on the individual carrying it out. Thus, "Make His will like your will" implies engaging in actions without arrogance, always prepared to nullify one's will to Hashem's and perform tasks without personal change.<br>Hashem repays each individual precisely, even though He is infinitely elevated. When bestowing life, abundance, and blessings, it must be limited (צימצום). However, a person performing any action should completely nullify their desires, carrying out the task without personal change. This willingness to nullify personal will eliminates the need for change, even if the physical body is distant from the mitzvah's sanctity. Likewise, Hashem executes His will without change. May Hashem grant us the merit to faithfully fulfill His will.

Section 4

5635
Rashi explains that when the Torah states "And Aharon did it so," it means that Aharon did not change. This can be understood in two ways. Firstly, it suggests that Aharon did not become haughty. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as Aharon consistently performing the mitzvah of kindling the menorah with the same intention and enthusiasm throughout his life. Often, people start new endeavors with great excitement, but over time, that enthusiasm wanes. It is crucial to seek new ways to maintain that initial excitement, as the first excitement is the most preferable state. Aharon's unwavering commitment is praised because he always maintained that initial enthusiasm.<br>By preserving this initial excitement, one can gain new insights. As the pasuk in Devarim (11:13) states, "If you will surely hear," Rashi explains that this means by paying special attention to things one is already familiar with, it will lead to new and deeper insights.
The Sfas Emes explains the story of the asafsuf, who were on a lower level than Moshe. They believed they needed external desires to serve Hashem properly, which is why they were dissatisfied with the manna and desired meat. Moshe, being on a completely different level, required the seventy elders to unify these lower desires for serving Hashem.<br>In understanding the asafsuf's desire for meat, we can refer to the Mishna in Avot (2:4), "Make His will like your will, so that He will make your will like His will." Initially, Hashem created man perfect, without the need for new ways to serve Him, just as the rest of creation does His will. However, sin disrupted this connection, mixing in external desires. By abstaining from sin, one can return to the truth. Moshe Rabbeinu was completely separated from worldly desires, unlike Bnei Yisrael, who at the giving of the Torah, were affected by sin and thus desired external excitement. Their intention was for the sake of Heaven, recognizing they were not on Moshe's level, who did not need external desires. Moshe was like an illuminating light (aspaklaria hameira), not requiring external desires. People are made up of Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshama. The lower levels (Nefesh and Ruach) need external excitement, effective through abstaining from sin, while the completely pure (like Moshe) do not need these externalities.<br>The Midrash states that when Moshe was challenged by the asafsuf, Hashem instructed him to gather seventy elders. These elders, referred to in the singular tense, symbolize unity in Heaven, but on Earth, they unified all desires for good. Moshe, being above this level, did not need the seventy elders to unify desires correctly. "Make His will like your will" means aligning one's will with Hashem's without externalities, enabling direct reception of Hashem's blessings, like the manna received in Moshe's merit. However, Bnei Yisrael complained about the manna, saying "our souls are dried up" (נפשנו יבשה), indicating their lower soul levels couldn't connect directly to Hashem's higher will, requiring external excitements through the seventy elders.<br>The Mishna's continuation, "Nullify your will," refers to the negative commandments, suggesting that by nullifying one's desires, one merits Hashem removing the spirit of impurity. This leads to Hashem nullifying the will of others to align with one's will. Even though the asafsuf's intentions were for the sake of Heaven, their actions were considered a sin because they should have trusted Hashem. Through emunah (faith), they could have connected to the higher level of Ruach, as emunah brings a person to truth.

In the verse (Num. 12:7), "Not so with My servant Moses; he is regular [ne'eman] throughout My household."  This is difficult -- the two clauses are inconsistent, for, with respect to the first clause, where is there mentioned any lack of regularity/faith [emunah] in other prophets? Actually, the idea is that all of the [other] prophets had to change when prophesying, by divesting themselves of materiality, and becoming like a new creation, as it is said, "When prophecy rested on them, their faces would glow like torches, etc."  If so, prophecy does not attach to them intrinsically.  But for Mosheh Rabbeinu, a"h, the opposite is true -- when he needed to speak with them [i.e., the people], a veil would be placed in front of his face, and he would have to alter his attire, while when the prophecy spoke through him, it would be from his actual appearance, as it is written (12:8), "with him I speak mouth to mouth."  And this is what is called "regular" [ne'eman].  And thus, they [the other prophets] did not have to separate from their wives as did Moshe Rabbeinu, a"h, as it is said (Zohar), "Moshe Moshe [Exod. 3:4] has no break" [no p'sik; contrast Gen. 22:11, Gen. 46:2, and I Sam. 3:10], for the Moshe of the lower realm is the Moshe of the upper realm, "the man of God" (Deut. 33:1).  But the other prophets were attached to their supernal source only at the time of prophesying.


Sh'lach



Section 1

5631
The Midrash discusses the concept of a shaliach mitzvah, someone sent to perform a mitzvah who gives their nefesh (soul) for their mission. The Chidushei Harim often said that anyone fulfilling the mitzvos of their Creator, sent to this world to do His will, is also a shaliach mitzvah. The Midrash questions why Hashem commanded Moshe to send the spies if it was not pleasing to Him. The answer is that Hashem made it a mitzvah to give the spies a way to be saved by acting according to His will, not their own.<br>By nullifying their personal desires and focusing solely on Hashem's command, the spies could have succeeded. This idea extends to all mitzvos: when a person nullifies their own will and acts purely to fulfill Hashem's will, they are giving their nefesh in their mission. The messengers Yehoshua sent to spy on Yericho exemplified this by acting as jug merchants, symbolizing the need to nullify personal desires and be vessels for Hashem's will.<br>This Medrash teaches that life in this world is fraught with dangers and emptiness, and the way to navigate it is through mitzvos, which connect us to Hashem's inner life force. This concept is akin to Shabbos, where one must connect their actions during the week to the inner life force that Shabbos represents. Bnei Yisrael's mission was to bring the light of the Torah into nature, integrating the spiritual into the natural world. The Zohar explains that one who toils in the Oral Torah becomes integrally connected to it, making the Torah a natural part of their life. This is the essence of the spies' mission: to draw the light of the Torah into the natural world, finding the hidden light within creation.
The Midrash explains that the heart and the eyes are the "spies" of the body, leading it to sin: the eye sees, the heart covets, and the body commits the sin. This underscores the importance of being continually drawn to the pnimius (internal essence) of the world, rather than being swayed by external appearances. One should nullify their own will to Hashem and focus only on what He commands, which is the life force within everything.<br>The sin of the spies was due to a lack of emuna (faith). It appeared to them that they were not capable of conquering the land, and indeed, they did not enter at that time. However, had they believed and nullified their own assessments to Hashem's will, they would have overcome natural limitations. This is akin to Hashem telling Avraham to leave his astrological predictions and trust in Him.<br>The pasuk "that you shall remember" refers to being drawn and connected to the internal life force of the mitzvot. It implies that remembering is about connecting deeply to the essence, and through this connection, one can fulfill the mitzvot. A person must realize that despite feeling unworthy or incapable due to sins or lowliness, this perspective is external and driven by the Yetzer Hara. One must believe in their ability to perform mitzvot with Hashem's help, recognizing that their life force comes from Hashem and is inherently connected to the Torah and mitzvot, which are the life force of the entire world.
The Mishnah (Avos 3:1) says, "Akavya ben Mehalalel says: Look at three things and you shall not come to sin. Know where you come from…from a putrid drop…” Despite the elevated nature of the soul, as every Jew recites daily, “The soul you planted in me is pure,” this teaching emphasizes the humble origins of the body to foster humility and nullification to Hashem. Recognizing that the body is from a “putrid drop” helps one realize that their existence depends entirely on the neshama provided by Hashem, leading to a deeper connection to the source of life. <br>This understanding prevents sin, as one's life is aligned with the divine life force from Hashem. The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 17:6) compares this to a drowning person holding onto a lifeline, illustrating that the Torah gives life to those who recognize their dependence on it, as it is a “tree of life” (Mishlei 3:18). By understanding that one's life is not self-sustained but entirely dependent on Hashem, one can attach themselves more firmly to the Torah.<br>Similarly, the commandment “Do not follow your eyes and heart…so that you shall remember” (Bamidbar 15:38-41) teaches that by not pursuing one's desires and recognizing that all comes from Hashem, one can achieve true closeness and adherence to the mitzvot. This realization enhances one's ability to fulfill the mitzvot, as the awareness of Hashem's life force encourages a deeper commitment to His commandments.

Section 2

The Midrash (Tanchuma Shlach 1) states that there is nothing more dear to Hashem than a messenger who is sent to perform a mitzvah and forsakes his own life to fulfill the mission. The Chidushei Harim teaches that we are all messengers sent by Hashem to fulfill His mitzvot in this world. The only way to draw Hashem's holiness into this world is through the efforts of Bnei Yisrael. By performing mitzvot, which are likened to candles, we illuminate our actions with the power of the Torah, recognizing that every action contains a mitzvah.<br>To succeed in this mission, one must first "give their soul" for the task, meaning they must gather all their desires and focus solely on fulfilling Hashem's will. Even in physical actions, by clarifying and genuinely desiring to fulfill Hashem's will, one can be saved from the negative influences of this world. This was the intended solution for the spies. When Bnei Yisrael demanded to send spies, Hashem turned it into a mitzvah to save them, but they needed to nullify their own will and act solely to fulfill Hashem's command.<br>The Midrash praises the mission to do a mitzvah even more than the mitzvah itself because the intention, preparation, and desire to fulfill Hashem's will are paramount. By giving up one's own desires, one can succeed in their mission. This teaching is timeless; when one removes their physical desires and seeks Hashem's honor in everything, they can uncover the hidden light in all things, as explained in the Zohar regarding the command to "send for yourself."
The Midrash (Menachos 43b) teaches that the pasuk "And you shall see them and remember all the mitzvos of Hashem" (Bamidbar 15:39) means that one who is careful with the mitzvah of tzitzis will merit seeing the Divine Presence. This "seeing" refers to perceiving the glory of Hashem inherent in everything, as it states, "the entire world is filled with Your glory" (Yeshaya 6:3), though it is hidden. Through nullifying one's desires to Hashem, symbolized by wrapping oneself in tzitzis and focusing on seeing Hashem's glory, one can perceive His precious light.<br>This concept is echoed in the phrase "Let us see Your glory, and You will show us its secrets, that are said in whispers," referring to the hidden light within everything. By nullifying personal desires for Hashem's sake, akin to earthenware (which has no value except for its use), one can reveal this inner light. This is the meaning of "what is said in whispers." The phrase "And you shall see it" refers to the sign within everything that testifies to Hashem's presence. All the hosts of heaven and earth are His army, testifying to His dominion, though hidden in this world.<br>The pasuk continues, "And you shall remember all the mitzvos of Hashem, and you shall do them, and not follow your hearts and eyes, so that you shall remember…" (Bamidbar 15:39-40). The fulfillment of mitzvos should be with the intention of connecting to Hashem and remembering that we are created to fulfill His will. "Do not follow your heart…" means to remember to connect to Hashem. One can intellectually despise worldly desires, but our sages teach not to say "I cannot stand pork," but rather "I can, but my Father in Heaven decreed against it." This aligns with "Do not follow your eyes…so that you shall remember." The idea of "And you shall be holy" means that separation from physicality is to connect to Hashem, as the pasuk concludes, "Who took you out of Mitzrayim."

Section 3

With G-d's Help Shlach
The Midrash (Tanchuma Shlach 1) and Gemara teach that one cannot travel on a boat within three days before Shabbos, except for a mitzvah. This is because a shaliach mitzvah (messenger for a mitzvah) is beloved by Hashem for dedicating his nefesh (soul) to succeed in his mission. The Chidushei Harim explains that the three days before Shabbos are a time for preparing for Shabbos, and engaging in a mitzvah also falls under this preparation.<br>All of creation and actions are for the honor of Hashem, and man is created to draw everything towards holiness. Bnei Yisrael are sent into this world to prepare for the future revelation of Hashem's glory. Just as the days of the week prepare for Shabbos, our actions in this world prepare us for the ultimate revelation. One who dedicates all his actions for Hashem’s will, nullifying his own desires, can succeed in his mission and remain connected to holiness even while engaging in mundane matters.<br>This was the lesson with the spies. Although sending spies was not initially Hashem's desire, He agreed to it as a mitzvah to give Bnei Yisrael an opportunity to succeed. If the spies had nullified their own will and acted solely to fulfill Hashem's command, they would have succeeded in their mission. Similarly, in all worldly matters, Hashem allows physical actions that may seem contrary to His will, but by dedicating these actions to Hashem, one can succeed in elevating the physical to the spiritual and fulfilling Hashem's purpose in this world.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 15:1) explains that the spies were sent quietly (חרש), and they pretended to be earthenware sellers (חרס). The Chidushei Harim explains that earthenware vessels only become ritually impure from the inside because their value lies in what they contain, not in the vessel itself.<br>This teaches that a person must nullify their externalities and focus on their inner purpose: to do Hashem's will. The body is merely a vessel for holiness, meant to honor Hashem. As the Midrash on the pasuk (Yeshaya 40:8) "Grass withers, flowers fade, but the word of Hashem prevails forever" suggests, everything contains a spark of holiness covered by externalities. By nullifying these external aspects and dedicating oneself to Hashem's will, the divine word is revealed.<br>In this world, Hashem's leadership is hidden, and it appears as if everything runs independently. However, by nullifying oneself to Hashem's guidance and desiring that all actions be under His providence, this divine leadership becomes more evident. The true dominion of Hashem encompasses everything, but it is often concealed. Through nullification, the hidden becomes revealed, aligning with the idea that "the word of Hashem prevails forever."
The Midrash (Tanchuma Shlach 2) explains that although the spies were handpicked and initially righteous, they are referred to as fools for speaking badly about Eretz Yisrael after their 40-day expedition. It seems that sending the spies was not in vain; it was necessary to send them specifically. Despite their failure, their mission paved the way for the successful sending of spies in the days of Yehoshua, enabling the eventual conquest of Eretz Yisrael.
The Midrash (Yalkut Shimoni 750:3) explains that Moshe said the mekoshesh (who violated Shabbos) sinned because he lacked the reminder of tefillin on Shabbos. Hashem then commanded the mitzvah of tzitzis, which applies even on Shabbos. This is puzzling since Shabbos itself is a ‘sign’ like tefillin. However, mitzvos involving physical actions, like tefillin and tzitzis, can awaken a person more effectively than the inherent holiness of Shabbos, which is fixed. These mitzvos bring holiness into the physical realm. As the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 17:5) states, everything contains a mitzvah, fulfilling the pasuk (Yeshaya 42:21) that Hashem glorified His Torah. Thus, Hashem gave mitzvos to help bring the holiness of the Torah into all aspects of life.

Section 4

5635
The Midrash (Tanchuma Shlach 1) states that a shaliach mitzvah (someone on a mission to perform a mitzvah) is very dear to Hashem and can even override Shabbos. This explains why Hashem commanded Moshe to send the spies, transforming their mission into a mitzvah to counteract Bnei Yisrael's lack of faith. Had the spies nullified their own desires to Hashem's will, they would not have spoken ill of Eretz Yisrael.<br>Fulfilling a mitzvah with known reasoning can be challenging because it might not be performed solely for Heaven's sake, unlike a חוק (a mitzvah without known reasoning). The spies' mission was particularly difficult due to its origin in a lack of emunah. However, given the high level of that generation, they should have nullified their understanding, as they did when they proclaimed נעשה ונשמע.<br>The Midrash highlights the importance of nullifying one's will to Hashem's will, even in mitzvah performance. This strong desire to fulfill Hashem's command protects one through the power of the mitzvah. All mitzvos aim to repair the world by attaching holiness to every action, guiding one to do Hashem's will. This concept is reflected in the prohibition against traveling three days before Shabbos unless on a mitzvah mission, which ensures one remains mindful of Shabbos, paralleling how we should conduct all worldly interactions.
The Midrash (Tanchuma Shlach 3) quotes Yeshaya 40:8, “Grass withers…but the word of Hashem is everlasting,” comparing it to a king who promised a gift to a person who died and then transferred the promise to the person's son. Similarly, Hashem promised Eretz Yisrael to Avraham and fulfilled it through his descendants.<br>This can be explained by the Gemara's discussion about King David, who asked to be tested but regretted it when he failed. The forefathers were on a higher level and did not need Hashem's help, as it states "go before Me" (Bereishis 17:1), whereas David needed divine support, "David strengthened himself in Hashem" (Shmuel 1:30:6). David aimed to emulate the forefathers but required Hashem's assistance.<br>Similarly, the spies likely spoke truthfully about their inability to conquer Eretz Yisrael based on their merits. Hashem intended to help them miraculously, fulfilling His promise to the forefathers. However, the spies wanted to achieve it on their own, emulating the forefathers' level. Their error was not accepting Hashem's method and trying to act independently of divine assistance.
"...each one (of the spies was) a chieftain among them" (Bamidbar 13:2). It would seem more accurate to say "from them" instead of "among them." Additionally, there were other chiefs like Nachshon and his peers. However, there are different types of leaders: external and internal. Here, it was necessary to send individuals whose actions genuinely represented Klal Yisrael. Thus, "among them" indicates that these spies were deeply integrated and truly representative of the people.
The Midrash compares the mistake of the spies to a queen whose maidservant claimed to be more beautiful and loved by the king. The queen replied, "Wait until morning when the king returns, and he will show who he truly loves." Similarly, the difference between the righteous and the wicked, and between those who serve Hashem and those who do not, will be revealed.<br>One who serves Hashem properly is assured a portion in the world to come. The truly righteous overpower negative forces and straighten their path, while those less righteous must navigate many crooked paths before eventually straightening their ways. The tzadik is closer to Hashem, whereas those further from the king are more susceptible to negative forces.<br>One must strengthen their faith and rebuff the evil inclination by saying, "The morning will come, and the king will show who He truly loves." The pasuk (Malachi 3:18) teaches that Hashem ensures no one is left behind. Even though the spies were called wicked, Hashem did not completely eliminate Bnei Yisrael. They eventually entered Eretz Yisrael after many trials and battles, repairing their ways. This illustrates that sin can delay one who serves Hashem, but ultimately, they will reach a straight path.
The Midrash (Tanhuma Shlach 15) states, "And you shall see them (the tzitzis) and remember all the mitzvos of Hashem." This is compared to a drowning person who is thrown a rope to hold onto; as long as he holds on, he remains alive, but if he lets go, he loses his life.<br>The explanation is that since the pasuk (Bamidbar 15:38) says, "And you will see it and remember all the mitzvos," it implies that every Yisrael has an inner divine spark, referred to as "a light that shines for the righteous." By performing mitzvos, one can remember and connect to this hidden light, as remembrance itself is a form of connection. The instruction “do not follow your eyes” emphasizes the need for protection, as the eyes see, the heart desires, and the body sins.<br>One must constantly view themselves as a person drowning in the sea, surrounded by negative forces and inclinations. Recognizing this danger and firmly holding onto the mitzvot of Hashem leads to true remembrance. This deeper level of remembrance (למען תזכרו) is intrinsic and does not require an action, unlike the initial "see and remember." This intrinsic remembrance is only possible when one is free from physicality, achieved through the original remembrance facilitated by the mitzvos.

Section 5

5636
With G-d's Blessing From Parshat Shlach Briefly
The Midrash states that one should not set sail within three days before Shabbat unless for a mitzvah. This concept of setting sail symbolizes embarking on a new path in serving Hashem, reflecting the idea that "all paths are dangerous." The three days represent three levels, where the first three stages are considered connected (lavud), but beyond them, one faces danger.<br>The advice is to act as a shaliach mitzvah, a mission for a mitzvah, which provides protection. This was the case with the spies; their mission was dangerous, so Hashem commanded Moshe to send them as shlichei mitzvah. If their intention had been purely for Heaven's sake, they would have been protected. The Torah uses the word "לאמר" (saying) to indicate that Moshe should tell them this was a mitzvah.<br>This principle applies to our journey in this world, where every path is spiritually perilous. To be safeguarded, one must always act with the intention of serving Heaven and be prepared to give their soul for their mission.
The pasuk states that Calev, filled with a different spirit, would enter Eretz Yisrael (Bamidbar 14:24). This raises the question: why is a new reason needed for his reward? Since he did not sin, he should not be punished. The truth is, this generation was not ready to enter Eretz Yisrael, which Moshe recognized from the episode with the spies. Their sin was speaking evil about the land, leading to the punishment of not entering it. Without this sin, they might have at least seen the land, as Moshe did. However, Calev, who opposed the spies and risked his life, was rewarded with entry.<br>Furthermore, the inability to enter the land was also linked to the sin of the Golden Calf. Calev needed a unique reason to enter, while Yehoshua, who was not involved in that sin, did not require the same promise and was naturally excluded from the punishment.
The Midrash explains that the mitzvah of tzitzis teaches us that everything in this world can be uplifted to holiness. Tzitzis, attached to a person's clothing (the external level), symbolize connecting all aspects of life to Hashem. The four corners of the garment represent the gathering of all directions towards their divine source, and the techelet thread serves as the connection to the internal purpose of everything.<br>The word "tzitzis" is linked to "vayatzetz tzitz," meaning a seed blossoming, symbolizing that a tzadik, through his pure intentions, can bring out the hidden divine spark in everything. This mitzvah, though external, is dear to Hashem because it elevates even the most distant aspects of life. The command to remember all mitzvot and not follow one's eyes underscores this idea. The mitzvah is not fulfilled if the entire tzitzis is techelet, highlighting that its true purpose is to elevate all parts of life towards their divine source, Hashem.

Section 6

5637
The Midrash explains that a person who embarks on a mission to perform a mitzvah is very precious to Hashem because they are willing to sacrifice their own desires for the sake of fulfilling Hashem's will. This concept of sacrificing one's life means forgoing personal desires when carrying out Hashem's commandments. As the Mishnah in Avot (2:4) states, "Nullify your will to His will." When a person genuinely desires to fulfill Hashem's will more than engaging in worldly actions, other external desires are nullified during the performance of the mitzvah.<br>This idea is reflected in the phrase, "With You, I have no other desire," meaning that when a person is focused on doing Hashem's will, all other desires become secondary and are nullified. By properly fulfilling mitzvot with the right intentions, one can correct and repair everything. This was also the issue with the spies. Bnei Yisrael wanted to send spies, and Hashem also commanded them to send spies. The contradiction can be resolved by understanding that Hashem's command was to send spies for His purpose, while Bnei Yisrael had their own selfish reasons.<br>If the spies had been willing to sacrifice their own desires from the start, their personal agenda would have been forgotten, and they would have explored the land solely because of Hashem's command. By doing so, they would have corrected their original selfish intent to send spies.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 16:3) compares the gift of Eretz Yisrael to Bnei Yisrael to a king who promised his devoted servant a gift, but upon the servant's death, gave it to his son. Similarly, Hashem promised Eretz Yisrael to our forefathers, and when they passed, it was given to Bnei Yisrael. The Sfas Emes notes that while our forefathers earned the right to Eretz Yisrael on their own merit, Bnei Yisrael received it through the promise made to their ancestors, not solely on their own merit. Initially, Bnei Yisrael were worthy of the land after leaving Mitzrayim and receiving the Torah, but the sin of the Golden Calf distanced them from this merit. Despite their shortcomings, Hashem wanted to fulfill His promise to the forefathers, but the spies failed to see this and thought they couldn't merit the land.<br>The pasuk states that they spied out Eretz Kana'an, which was under Kana'an's dominion. The spies should have understood that when Bnei Yisrael entered, the land would transform into Eretz Yisrael, revealing its goodness. The Midrash's analogy of "Grass withers, flowers fade" signifies that these illusions are temporary, and Hashem's word endures forever. The spies' fear of the mighty nations and Amalek, despite witnessing daily miracles, stemmed from their belief that they needed to inherit the land peacefully and without war. Joshua's conquest in a later generation involved different circumstances. Initially, Hashem led Bnei Yisrael on a roundabout route to avoid war, fearing they might return to Mitzrayim. This generation was meant to inherit the land without conflict, but their sin and Amalek's influence disrupted this plan. Had they strengthened their emuna, they could have overcome this test, as Hashem's power is boundless.

Section 7

5638
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 16:1) explains that one should not set sail within three days of Shabbos to avoid ruining Shabbos due to the unfamiliarity with the sea. However, if one is traveling to perform a mitzvah, it is permitted. This teaches that each mitzvah contains an element of Shabbos, connecting and returning the action to Hashem, its source. When the spies left to scout the land, they left the protection of the clouds of glory, akin to leaving Shabbos for the weekdays. Yet, through mitzvot, one can access the essence of Shabbos even during the week.<br>This concept of a shaliach mitzvah (a messenger on a mitzvah mission) is significant. The Torah is the body of illuminating light, the essence of Moshe Rabbeinu, while mitzvot are sparks of this light, commanded by Hashem. Moshe sent the spies, and as his messengers, they carried his protective light. Had they fulfilled their mission properly, they would have brought this Torah light into Eretz Yisrael, eliminating exile. This principle applies to each person: performing mitzvot correctly awakens the power of Torah, embodying the restfulness of Shabbos. The Midrash, quoting "Grass withers… yet the word of Hashem lasts forever," clarifies that the inner holiness within Bnei Yisrael and each individual is eternal. A person must expand this inner point, aligning all actions and external aspects towards it. Despite their sin, the internal point remained intact, allowing for teshuva and reconnection to the sustaining source. This concept is further elaborated in the Midrash.
In the verse "Do not fear the people of the land, for they are our bread" (Bamidbar 14:9), it implies that the sustenance of our souls in this world comes from the concealment present in it. We need to rectify our actions through this concealment, which gives us existence in this world. The essence of Bnei Yisrael is in the world to come; thus, when a person rectifies everything, they transition to the next world. Therefore, one should not despise the significant toils they undergo in this world, as these challenges are part of their mission to correct and elevate themselves.<br>The Chidushei Harim explains that "they are our bread" and "their shadow has departed" (sar tzilam) means that the power of the Sitra Achra (forces of evil) is merely an illusion, like a shadow with no substance. Those who strengthen themselves to engage in spiritual battles see that the evil is only a shadow. The sin of the spies was their failure to submit to Yehoshua and Calev. Despite the great test, once they saw Yehoshua and Calev declare "sar tzilam" and overcome the illusion, they should have strengthened themselves and recognized the truth. Instead, they clung to their initial fears and were punished. Similarly, each person must strengthen their faith, believing that evil is only a shadow. By observing the righteous prevailing against the evil inclination and nullifying themselves to the righteous, they can cling to their actions and achieve spiritual success.
The Midrash explains the mitzvah of tzitzit by stating that "Or Zarua" (light is sown) refers to Hashem planting the light of Torah in the mitzvot that a person fulfills. It is challenging to understand how physical acts of mitzvot can awaken the soul, as implied by the verses "So that you may remember" and "You shall be holy." However, each mitzvah has a root in the soul of every Jew, corresponding to the 248 organs and 365 sinews, which align with the 613 commandments. By performing the mitzvah, the illumination of this root within the soul is awakened.<br>The body is merely a garment for the soul's inner essence. After death, a person is clothed in an upper, primary garment. The body acts as an intermediary, or even a blockage, between the soul and this upper garment. One must yearn for this upper garment. The tallit symbolizes this garment, as fulfilling mitzvot creates a garment for the soul in the world to come. The preparation of this garment through mitzvot corrects and refines the soul. The verse "And you shall see," "And you shall remember," "And you shall not turn away" teaches not to turn after the physical body. By distancing oneself from physicality, one can remember the inner essence, awakening the soul hidden within the body, and thereby attaining holiness. This concept is further elaborated elsewhere.

Section 8

5639
Shlach Briefly
Our sages provide several reasons why Bnei Yisrael were delayed in entering Eretz Yisrael and spent 40 years in the wilderness. This raises the question: if it was predetermined they wouldn't enter before the sin of the spies, what changed?<br>The truth is that Kohelet 7:1 states, "There is nothing new under the heavens," implying that below the heavens, events follow natural laws and timing. However, above the heavens, Hashem's will is not bound by time. Bnei Yisrael's level in the wilderness was above time, enabling them to potentially enter Eretz Yisrael before the natural time.<br>The spies' sin was recognizing that, according to natural laws, it wasn't the right time to enter, which was true. However, they should have had emunah in Hashem's ability to transcend these limitations. Yehoshua and Calev emphasized this by stating, "The land is very good... if Hashem wants us, He will bring us to the land," meaning that Hashem could elevate them above natural constraints, allowing them to enter the land despite it not being naturally prepared.
According to the Zohar (3:158a), the spies gave a negative report of Eretz Yisrael because they feared losing their positions as leaders. However, considering they acted as messengers of the people, it seems unlikely they acted solely out of selfish interests. <br>To clarify, Bnei Yisrael at that time represented the "heads" of the nation. They were the first generation to leave Mitzrayim and receive the Torah, and subsequent generations continued this spiritual legacy from head to toe, as explained by Rabbi Akiva in Mishnah Sotah 9:15. This first generation held the highest spiritual level. Entering Eretz Yisrael would entail a spiritual descent and losing their status as the "heads." Naturally, those in prominent positions find it challenging to relinquish their elevated status, similar to a soul's difficulty in descending into this world against its will (Avot 4:22).<br>Nonetheless, they should have submitted themselves to Hashem's will, setting aside personal desires. This would have fulfilled the Mishnah's teaching (Avot 4:17) emphasizing the superiority of an hour of repentance and good deeds in this world over the entirety of the world to come. We have elaborated on this concept elsewhere (see Sfas Emes Shavuot תרל"ה).
The concept of tzitzit, as explained in the Midrash, is that Hashem planted sparks of light in the world for the tzaddik to uplift. The 613 commandments are rooted in a person's soul, corresponding to 248 positive commandments and 365 negative commandments. Through the fulfillment of practical mitzvot, these inner spiritual powers are awakened.<br>The idea of tzitzit is to attach them to the corners of a person's garment, symbolizing the external actions performed by the body. The tzitzit on the four corners represent gathering and connecting these actions to prevent them from spreading under negative influence. This mitzvah helps a person properly connect with their internal spiritual elements, integrating their actions with their inner soul.

Section 9

5640
The Midrash states that one should not set sail within three days of Shabbat unless it is for a mitzvah. This world’s vanities are likened to "many waters," as it is written, "Many waters cannot quench love" (Shir HaShirim 8:7). The ship symbolizes one's connection to Hashem, which helps one stay afloat in this world without being overwhelmed. However, approaching holiness poses a risk when entering impure places, symbolized by the three days before Shabbat. This concept applied to the spies, who were holy and close to the Ark, representing Hashem's presence traveling three days ahead. Their mission to Canaan thus posed a spiritual danger.<br>Nevertheless, performing a mitzvah can sustain one even in darkness, provided the intention is purely for Hashem. A mixed intention negates this protection, as our sages explain that selfish motives invalidate the mitzvah’s safeguarding power. The Zohar notes that the spies had a slight selfish intention, which compromised their protection. For people of such high stature, even a subtle selfish motive is significant. The Midrash's statement, "A flower withers... yet the word of Hashem is everlasting," supports this idea. Bnei Yisrael entered the land due to Hashem's promise to the forefathers, but the spies wanted to feel they had earned it themselves, reflecting a broader national sin of seeking self-merit.<br>This desire for self-earned merit led to their negative report about Eretz Yisrael. Yehoshua and Calev, however, emphasized reliance on Hashem, urging the people not to rebel. Their faith contrasted with the spies’ selfish motives, which was a form of rebellion. The Zohar explains that the spies wanted to be "heads" with their own reasoning, but Eretz Yisrael, like the Oral Torah and Emunah, requires nullifying personal desires and understanding to merit it. This underlines the importance of selflessness in spiritual missions.

Korach



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Korach
The Zohar says that Korach argued against the concepts of Shalom (peace) and Shabbos. Shabbos is considered the name of Hashem, as Hashem is called Shalom because He is the source from which all creation draws its life force. This source, called Shalom, signifies perfection and completion, which comes from Hashem who sustains everything. The Zohar states that Hashem does not sit on His throne until everything is unified in the secret of oneness, which is achieved on Shabbos when all creation is uplifted and unified in this point of oneness.<br>The secret of oneness is the internal life force within all creation, rooted in a single point called the secret of oneness. This oneness must be integrated into everyday actions and workdays. As stated, "to make the Shabbos," means to draw the light of Shabbos into the weekdays. If Hashem does not sit until this oneness is achieved, it implies that no person can come closer without nullifying themselves to the collective unity of Bnei Yisrael. Through this nullification, one can connect to the root and life force of everything.<br>Korach's argument was based on the belief that each person should merit their own level and service of Hashem independently. However, Hashem's will was for Bnei Yisrael to have one Cohen Gadol and one altar, linking everyone through the holy leader of the generation. Each person's work should be nullified to the collective. Korach claimed that everyone is holy, but the Zohar clarifies that holiness is an inherent state, whereas purity is achieved through effort. Hashem chose Aharon and his descendants to be inherently holy, a gift from Hashem, through which holiness is drawn to all of Klal Yisrael.<br>Moshe's retort, "What is Aharon?" emphasized that Aharon's greatness lay in his readiness to receive Hashem's holiness without change, attributing nothing to his own strength. Korach's jealousy stemmed from misunderstanding the nature of divine service, believing it was based on individual merit. Had he understood that no one could approach Hashem's service without divine selection, he would have seen the importance of nullifying oneself to the collective. This understanding is crucial because if merit were based solely on individual actions, no one could achieve the service of Hashem.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:1) brings the pasuk "A brother offended is harder to win over than a defended city” (Mishlei 18:19) in regard to Korach. Korach sinned and rebelled with the very power he gained through Moshe, who had bestowed holiness upon Klal Yisrael. Korach took this power and rebelled, as the pasuk states “And Korach took,” meaning he separated himself and took for himself (Zohar 3:177a).<br>Someone who is completely nullified to Hashem’s power has nothing to take for himself. By separating himself, Korach lost his greatness. Each person needs to strengthen themselves with the life force from Hashem, as it states, “his strength is in Him” (Tehillim 84:6) and “If they would hold My fortress, they will make peace with Me” (Yeshaya 26:7). Through this, one clarifies the inner life force and connects to Hashem, the source of life, which is the idea of Shalom and Shabbos.
Jealousy (desire and honor) remove a person from this world” (Avos 4:21). This idea is exemplified by Korach, whose jealousy of Aharon led to his downfall. One who is connected to the inner life force is automatically connected to all of Klal Yisrael because, at our essence, everyone is unique and has an individual role. This uniqueness eliminates the concept of jealousy. This is explained in the Gemara (Shabbos 31a), where a convert asked Hillel to teach him the whole Torah while standing on one foot. Hillel responded that the essence of Torah is “love your fellow as yourself,” and the rest is commentary. The core of the Torah is to be connected to the internal life force, which is the Torah, as all creation came from the letters of the Torah. Hashem created the world with the Torah.<br>The Sfas Emes, citing the Chidushei Harim, explains that Yosef’s instruction to take his bones from Egypt symbolizes being connected to the internal life force, as Yosef was shomer habris (guardian of the covenant). The opposite is jealousy, described as “rotting of the bones” (Mishlei 14:30). The main idea is to be connected to the internal life force, as it says, “so that you shall remember” (referencing the mitzvah to not follow one's eyes).<br>When connected to this inner point, all actions and times become unified, as they stem from Hashem, who is above time. This is what the convert meant by learning the Torah on one leg, symbolizing the integration of unity and connection into daily actions. Hillel’s response emphasized loving all of Bnei Yisrael. In contrast, jealousy disrupts this unity and cannot exist in a state of concealment. The solution is to connect to the elevated, hidden points of this world.

The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:14) quotes the pasuk “A brother offended is harder to win back than a fortified city” (Mishlei 18:19) in regard to Korach, who sinned with the Torah, which is called עוז (strength). The Zohar (3:177a) says Korach argued against Shalom, and the world cannot survive without Shalom. Shabbos is also called Shalom, representing the oneness of Hashem. Even though creation introduces separateness, Hashem’s oneness is the source of everything.<br>The philosophers question how oneness can produce separateness, but the world gains its existence through Shabbos and Torah. By nullifying their actions to follow the Torah, people unify everything. This is like the angels of fire and water making peace to fulfill Hashem’s will. Similarly, tzadikim who nullify their desires for Hashem’s will sustain the world. The mitzvah of Shabbos, where people refrain from work, brings Shalom and sustains the world. This Shalom uplifts all creation to the source of oneness, the Torah, which is called עוז.<br>Shalom and Shabbos are the “Cities of strength,” preparing for the Torah. Therefore, the Torah was given on Shabbos. The Mishnah in Avos (5:17) states that arguments for the sake of Heaven will prevail, as different understandings unify under Hashem’s will. During the week, individual work can lead to arguments, like those between Hillel and Shamai. However, if done for the sake of Heaven, these actions are uplifted on Shabbos. Conversely, arguments not for the sake of Heaven, like Korach’s, do not lead to unity and remain in disharmony, becoming separated and lost. If Korach’s intentions were truly for Heaven, he would have recognized the truth and changed his mind.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:14) quotes the pasuk "A brother offended is harder to win back than a fortified city" (Mishlei 18:19) in regard to Korach. Moshe’s response to Korach, “Is it not enough that you have been set aside by Hashem to serve as a Levi? Therefore you and your group have banded together against Hashem” (Bamidbar 16:9), shows that Korach's jealousy led him to rebel against Hashem. Korach failed to recognize that his holiness and position came from being part of Klal Yisrael, chosen by Hashem. Instead, he believed it was due to his own merits, leading him to covet Aharon's position.<br>Korach claimed, “The entire nation is holy,” while Moshe countered, “The one that Hashem chooses is the one that is holy.” Both statements are true: there is holiness on both a group and an individual level. The group needs the individual, and through Hashem's chosen leaders, holiness is drawn down to the entire group. The nation is holy because they all received the Torah. However, Korach forgot that this holiness primarily comes through Moshe and Aharon, who sanctified the people.<br>The expression “and Korach took” indicates that Korach attributed his status to his own achievements rather than recognizing it came from Hashem through Moshe and Aharon. This led him to separate himself from the true source of his strength, leading to his rebellion. This is the meaning of the Midrash's use of the pasuk: Korach, by separating himself, lost the primary strength that came from being part of Klal Yisrael and argued against the leaders chosen by Hashem.

Section 3

5636
The Mishna in Pirkei Avos distinguishes between arguments for the sake of Heaven, which will last, like those of Hillel and Shamai, and arguments not for the sake of Heaven, like those of Korach and his band, which will not endure. There are two ways to serve Hashem: through din (judgment), where a person aligns their actions and merits success, and through chesed (kindness), where a person merits Hashem's kindness beyond the letter of the law, preventing haughtiness and improper behavior.<br>Aharon embodied the attribute of chesed, while the Levites represented din. The world cannot exist solely on din, as Hashem saw when He created the world, He combined din with rachamim (mercy) to sustain it. The world is inherently imperfect and requires Hashem’s involvement. This is symbolized by the northern side of the physical world being left open, showing the world cannot exist on its own. Hashem completes the world, and Shabbos, called shalom (peace), elevates everything to its root and beginning, making the world a complete vessel for blessing.<br>Korach's argument was solely based on din, rejecting the necessity of chesed, which led to his downfall. Moshe's response, "Is it not enough that you have been set aside as a Levi?" indicates that Korach's belief in meriting kehuna (priesthood) through din was flawed. The Levites' role was due to Hashem's kindness, not their own merit. By seeking the priesthood through din, Korach ignored the essential role of chesed, making his argument unsustainable. This is reflected in Moshe's use of "mekem" (from you), emphasizing that their current role and any further aspirations depend on Hashem's kindness, not solely on their actions.
Simply, we can explain that the correct service of Hashem teaches us that the more one becomes great, the more one appreciates something small. Moshe, who was many levels above Korach and his band, understood the preciousness of being part of the tribe of Levi, a role given by Hashem. In contrast, Korach and his followers raised themselves above the rest of Bnei Yisrael and accused Moshe and Aharon of self-elevation. Moshe showed them that despite his high level, he valued every level, big or small, in Hashem's service, which is why he attained such greatness. Korach and his followers, on the other hand, immediately disregarded their given service and demanded more.
(Bamidbar 16:11) “And what is Aharon that you complain about him” means that Aharon, known as the ‘man of kindness,’ is able to receive kindness properly. This is reflected in the pasuk, “I give them a service that is a gift, and the foreigner who shall come close will die.” Aharon’s role is entirely a gift from Hashem, meaning no selfish motivations can stand in this position. Therefore, any foreigner (selfish motivation) will be rejected. However, someone seeking greatness by right must be extremely cautious and combine their efforts with many supplications for mercy from Hashem.
Moshe Rabeinu requested that Korach and his crew be punished by a new creation (the earth swallowing them), rather than existing punishments from creation. This needs explanation. Could they not have been punished with existing methods? Our sages (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:8) explain that Korach, who was clever, saw through prophecy a great lineage in his children and thought this meant he was destined for greatness. However, Korach knew that if he strayed far from the correct path, his sin would leave a stain on his descendants, preventing their greatness. Every sin leaves a mark for generations, as stated, “He visits the iniquity of the parents on their children” (Shemos 34:7). Yet, Korach's children attained a high level, indicating they did not inherit his sin.<br>Therefore, Korach had to fall to destruction while still alive, ensuring his children did not inherit his sin. This required a change in the natural order. Korach did not consider that the entire creation would change for him, leading him to believe he was correct in his argument against Moshe. The Ba’al Haturim hints at this, explaining that the punishment would not pass to Korach's children, as it states: “He visits the iniquity of the parents on their children.” This is why the Torah specifies, “And they were lost from the nation” (Bamidbar 16:33). Usually, when someone dies, their children inherit their place, and their energy remains among the nation. However, since Korach and his crew fell to Gehinnom while alive, their actions were completely removed from the nation.

Section 4

5638
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:14) uses the pasuk "A brother offended is harder than a fortified city" (Mishlei 19:18) to describe Korach. The main purpose of everything is the Torah, which is called עוז (strength). All of man’s intellect and effort in serving Hashem and fulfilling mitzvos are methods to connect to the Torah and merit divine assistance. Hashem, being the strength for those who trust in Him, leads one to this connection through good deeds and effort.<br>Korach, despite being a servant of Hashem and very wise, relied solely on his wisdom and deeds, which was considered a rebellion against Hashem. Moshe, known as a man of G-d, brought the Torah from Heaven and acted directly from its source, which naturally led to opposition in this world. Aharon, chosen by Hashem to be the vessel of service, was inherently holy. Korach, however, focused on externalities, mocking Moshe’s instructions and failing to understand the deeper, divine source of mitzvos.<br>This misunderstanding is evident in Korach's challenge about the techelet strings. He failed to grasp that mitzvos are rooted in the holy Torah, which is hidden from human understanding. Korach's reliance on external actions and his separation from the divine source led to his downfall. The Zohar states that Korach argued against Shabbos, which symbolizes nullifying oneself to Hashem. The Mishna in Avot (5:17) contrasts arguments for the sake of Heaven (Hillel and Shamai) with those not for the sake of Heaven (Korach). Even though Shamai focused on strict judgment, they nullified themselves to the Torah, allowing their arguments to endure. Had Korach nullified himself to Moshe and the Torah, his argument might have prevailed. Aharon’s staff blossoming was a divine sign of his chosen status, showing that true elevation comes from divine choice, not just personal merit. Moshe’s statement, “And what is Aharon?” emphasized that Aharon’s greatness lay in his complete submission to Hashem’s will, embodying peace and love. Moshe’s statement, “And what is Aharon?” emphasized that Aharon’s greatness lay in his complete submission to Hashem’s will, embodying peace and love. As the Mishnah (Avot 1:12) describes him, “One who loves peace, and chases peace, who loves the making, and draws them to Torah”. Aharon had nothing else, he was plainly a vessel prepared to receive blessing from Above, in whichever way that were to come out. For Hashem knows to choose those that will stand before Him and perform His service.

When Korach argued against Aharon's leadership, Moshe responded, "In the morning, Hashem will choose who is for Him." This implies that Hashem makes a new choice of Bnei Yisrael and their leaders each day. Just as Bnei Yisrael accept Hashem's dominion daily, He chooses them in return, as stated in the pasuk (Devarim 27:17), "You have chosen Hashem today, and He has chosen you."<br>Each day, a "thread of kindness" rests upon Bnei Yisrael, symbolized by Aharon, who was always ready to be a vessel for their sake. This is reflected in the mitzvah of tzitzit, representing the thread of kindness and the concept of Aharon. The thread of techelet in the tzitzit, given in the merit of Avraham, symbolizes the unblemished part of a person. Even if the entire garment is techelet, the thread is still necessary to show that perfection is unattainable without this kindness. Korach's argument, dressing his followers in techelet garments and claiming everyone is holy, was countered by the need to nullify oneself to Hashem's will.<br>Before putting on Tefillin in the morning, we first wear tzitzit to awaken kindness. The pasuk (Tehillim 37:8) states, "How precious is your kindness (tzitzit), and in the shade of your garment, we will find shelter," reflecting this practice. Tefillin and tzitzit parallel Moshe and Aharon, with Aharon as the light (tzitzit) and Moshe as the truth (tefillin). The pasuk (Tehillim 43:3) says, "Send your light and your truth, they will guide me," symbolizing the reliance on their merit. Moshe used the idea of morning light to show the world's dependence on Aharon. Aharon's staff blossoming signifies that only someone chosen from the beginning can awaken the divine force. The pasuk "Praiseworthy is one who is chosen, and one who comes close" differentiates between inherent chosenness and coming close through deeds. Aharon was chosen and brought close once Bnei Yisrael repented from the Golden Calf. Korach's argument stemmed from the tribe of Levi's innocence in the sin, while Aharon was involved. To counter this, the pasuk repeatedly states Aharon's chosenness by Hashem. For the Levites, it states "to be brought close to Him" and "He brought you close," implying closeness through actions. The Midrash's reference to the tribe of Levi being chosen actually refers to the Kohanim. Moshe's statement, "Whoever is chosen, his staff shall blossom," signifies that Aharon was especially chosen from the beginning.
The Mishna in Pirkei Avos distinguishes between an argument for the sake of Heaven, like that of Hillel and Shamai, and an argument not for the sake of Heaven, like that of Korach and his clan. This distinction is puzzling because Korach's sin in arguing with Moshe was a serious offense. The Mishna seems to imply that Korach's only issue was that his argument was not for the sake of Heaven.<br>It appears that Korach could have been a partner with Aharon, similar to the partnership of Hillel and Shamai. Just as in heaven there is fire and water, yet Hashem makes peace between them, so too with Bnei Yisrael, who are a vessel for bracha (blessing). The word "kli" (vessel) is an acronym for Kohanim, Leviim, and Yisrael, indicating that each has a specific mission. However, the prerequisite is nullifying themselves to Hashem, which brings about the perfection of these opposing forces.<br>Since Korach and his followers did not originally intend their argument to be for the sake of Heaven, they sinned and were lost. This is what is meant by "and Korach took"; he did not argue for the sake of Heaven but for himself. Moshe's response, "In the morning Hashem will make known what is His," means that each person should clarify whether their intentions are truly for the sake of Hashem or for selfish reasons. Even though Korach was wise, Koheles warns not to praise oneself with one's wisdom. True wisdom is knowing and intending for the sake of Hashem.

Section 9

5643
Moshe tells Korach (Bamidbar 16:9-11), "Is it not enough for you that you have been separated as Levi’im,... and Aaron; what is he?" Our sages teach that when the pasuk says "And Korach took," it means that he actually took something for himself. The Mishnah in Avot (5:10) states that a pious person shares what is theirs, while a wicked person believes everything is for their own benefit. This teaches that each member of Bnei Yisrael helps the other, and the tzadik attributes their good deeds to the merit of others, unlike the wicked who think the world exists for them.<br>Korach and his assembly displayed haughtiness, while Aharon did not respond, believing his service was powered by the community. Moshe's statement, "Is it not enough for you?" means that the Levi’im’s service, based solely on their own merit, is insufficient. It is through the merit of Moshe and Aharon that they are sustained. The Kohen Gadol's service is through complete self-nullification to Hashem. Our sages say that one who withholds speech during disputes sustains the world, as it states, "The earth hangs upon nothingness." This means the world depends on someone who, like Aharon, considers themselves as nothing.<br>When the Torah states "in the morning, Hashem will make known His choice," it means Aaron's righteousness was only revealed after the argument. This dispute was a test for both Korach and Aharon, with Aharon passing and Korach failing. The dispute had to occur but should have been for the sake of Heaven, as stated in the Zohar regarding "Let there be a sky." After this, Aaron was elevated, similar to Avraham Avinu after his test: "Now I know." Therefore, Moshe told them it was unfitting to be jealous of Aharon because his power lay in his self-nullification. Seeking the priesthood is inappropriate, as it is only given to those who do not hold themselves as anything.
The pasuk states that Moshe said to Korach (Bamidbar 16:5), "In the morning Hashem will make known who He chooses." Our sages explain that just as Hashem distinguished between morning and evening, so too He has chosen Aharon (Bamidbar Rabbah 18:7). Korach was a great man, as our sages taught, he was one of the carriers of the Aron. Nevertheless, there are different elements in the service of Hashem: action and speech (Zohar 2:128a). The Zohar in Terumah explains that one who is pure can merit service through action, but serving through speech requires extra help from Heaven. This level was unique to Aharon the Kohen, who renewed the world each day through the service in the Beis Hamikdash.<br>Moshe used the future tense "The one who Hashem will choose" to indicate that each day has a new path in serving Hashem. The Midrash explains that each day Hashem introduces new halachot, as it states, "new utterances have come from His mouth." One who truly fears Hashem merits this level and is shown new paths each day. Even those not on such a high level, like us in our generation, can reveal what is renewed in Heaven through true fear of Hashem. In the time of the Mikdash, this was all revealed, especially through Moshe and Aharon, on whom the entire world relied. This is the idea of "Your kindness and truth have guided me," referring to Moshe (truth) and Aharon (kindness). Aharon's greatness was his ability to draw down a new light into the world each day.<br>Moshe compared it to "morning" to show how each day testifies to Aharon's rightful position. The commandment of lighting the menorah (Bamidbar 8:3) states, "And Aharon did it so." Rashi explains that this teaches us he did not change, but it also means no two days were the same, as Aharon drew down a new light each day. This is why the Torah uses the word כן, indicating that the lighting draws a new light. There are two elements: action and speech. Action in Torah is internal, while service in the Beis Hamikdash repairs everything as it should be, requiring a unique gift from Heaven. Nowadays, without the Beis Hamikdash, we cannot repair the element of action properly. This is why Moshe used the word "morning," referring to the world's existence dependent on the Kohen Gadol. The Midrash connects Korach to "A brother who has separated from a fortified עוז city" (Mishlei 18:19). Torah, the internal element, is called עוז, and the Kohen's reparation is the fortified city with Torah and peace. The proof of the staff blossoming demonstrated that the Kohen Gadol can repair the exterior world and draw everything towards Hashem, as it states, "Planted in the House of Hashem, in the courtyards of our God, they flower" (Tehillim 92:14).
The Gemara (Sanhedrin 109b) explains the words "in their community My presence shall not rest" as referring to Korach's clan. Although they united against Moshe and Aharon, their intention was not for the sake of Heaven, so their unity did not help them. The power of unity, which can achieve oneness and awaken the strength of Yaakov, is unique to Bnei Yisrael.<br>The Mishnah in Avot states that an argument for the sake of Heaven will endure, meaning it reaches the source and awakens complete oneness. However, concerning Korach, it states "in their community My presence shall not rest," indicating their lack of true unity.<br>Korach claimed the entire nation is holy, and it is true that through unity, Bnei Yisrael can awaken holiness, as stated in Devarim 33:5, "And the King is elevated when everyone gathers together." However, true unity requires unique assistance, which is the role of Moshe and the Kohen Gadol. When others attempted to unite without them, they failed.

Section 10

5644
The Midrash compares Korach to "a brother who has separated from a fortified city" (Mishlei 18:19). This "fortified city" symbolizes the inherent power of Bnei Yisrael as a unit, stemming from their willingness to accept the Torah. This power is not from their own might but is a special blessing from Hashem. This level of unity affects even the realm of reality and is particularly influenced by Aharon the Kohen Gadol in the Mikdash. When Bnei Yisrael said, "Na'ase venishma" (we will do and we will hear), they understood that preparing to receive the Torah required first repairing the realm of action.<br>The Zohar explains two levels in the service of Hashem: one affecting the internal realm (pnimius), coming from the power of the Torah, and one affecting the external reality (מילא), achievable only through fear of Hashem. The Gemara (Shabbos 31b) also alludes to this, stating that fear of sin must precede knowledge. One who has Torah but no fear of Hashem is like one with inner keys but no outer keys—unable to enter. Fear of Hashem repairs the external reality, a higher level of מלה דקיימא בעובדא (word that exists in reality). Hashem created the world so we should fear Him (Kohelet 3:14).<br>The Gemara in Shabbos (ibid) says it is a pity to make a fence around a courtyard when one doesn't even have a courtyard. Each person has their own mission and place (מקום), repairable through actions, akin to a dwelling place or body perfection. Once done, they become a fitting vessel to receive Torah. Korach was punished with the ground swallowing him up because, despite his wisdom and role as a carrier of the Aron, he had no place or existence in the world. The pasuk (Mishlei 6:23) states, "A mitzvah is a candle and the Torah is light." Mitzvot, like candles, hold the light, giving it existence. Korach's argument against tzitzit and mezuzah, mitzvot that repair one's garment and dwelling place, aimed to elevate everything. However, he mocked the idea, saying if a garment is entirely techelet, it shouldn't need techelet tzitzit. Korach's claim that "the entire nation is holy" implied everyone could merit leadership, misunderstanding the need for post-Golden Calf reparations in the world. Aharon had the special power of perfection as a gift. The Ketoret was used to distinguish Aharon from Korach's 250 followers, representing the connection between lower and upper worlds, which Korach lacked. The pasuk (Mishlei 27:9), "Oil and Ketoret gladden the heart," symbolizes understanding (oil) and the Torah (Menorah). Korach had understanding but lacked the connection to the Ketoret, necessary for reparation of the external reality and one's dwelling place, as indicated by the phrase "for generations to come."
The Mishnah (Avot 5:17) states that an argument not for the sake of Heaven will not endure, exemplified by Korach and his assembly. Korach's argument could have been legitimate if it was for the sake of Heaven. However, the Mishnah clarifies that Korach acted for selfish reasons, as indicated by the pasuk, "And Korach took," meaning he acted for his own gain. True success and completion require divine assistance, and one who relies solely on their own resources will fail, as it states, "He makes peace in the heights."<br>The pasuk (Yeshaya 57:19) says, "Shalom, Shalom to those that are far and near," indicating two ways of serving Hashem: through distancing and through closeness. Both require help from Heaven. Those who distance themselves, considering themselves lowly, need divine assistance to avoid becoming too distant. Conversely, those who draw close to Hashem out of love and truth may seem haughty, but if done for the sake of Heaven, they receive divine help to maintain humility.<br>This concept of "Shalom to those far and near" means Hashem accepts all who serve Him sincerely and helps them find the right balance. Aharon exemplified this by being hesitant to approach the altar, showing his humility. In contrast, Korach pushed himself forward excessively, as Moshe pointed out, "Is it a small thing that you have already been chosen?" The key is that actions must be for the sake of Heaven, and Hashem will create peace and balance between them.
After Korach's rebellion, each tribe placed a staff in the Mikdash. Aharon's staff blossomed, indicating his selection as Kohen Gadol. The Torah states, "His staff blossomed amongst their staffs," symbolizing that true productivity in serving Hashem comes through the unity of Bnei Yisrael under the Kohen's leadership. The Tzadik's impact arises from harmonizing collective energies, transforming potential into reality. While everyone serves Hashem, not everyone bears spiritual fruit.<br>The verse (Yeshaya 3:10) states, "Say to the Tzadik that it is good, for he shall eat the fruit of their labor." This teaches that everyone is indebted to the Tzadik, as he brings their energies into manifestation, allowing them to partake in the fruit of their labor. The staff's episode provided solace to Bnei Yisrael, showing that each individual has a unique connection to the actions of the Kohen Gadol.<br>The Rav of Pershischa explains that the staff's blossoming symbolizes different roles and contributions. Just as a tree has branches and blossoms, each person in Hashem's service contributes uniquely. However, the Kohen maintains the primary position, ensuring that everyone's efforts are unified and brought to fruition.

Chukat



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Parshat Chukat
The Zohar (3:179b) distinguishes between “This is the chok of the Torah” and “This is the Torah.” Chok refers to the Oral Torah, as the essence of the Torah is beyond human comprehension and needed to be brought down to us. Chok implies engraving the Torah into our hearts and actions through practical application. The Chidushei Harim explained that the Oral Torah integrates the light of the Torah into every action, as the words of Torah are engraved into the body. Everything in the world contains a hidden light of Torah, as Hashem created the world with Torah. Our task is to reveal this hidden light through our actions.<br>The word חקת (chok) also means fixed, as in “Make your Torah fixed” (Avos 1:15), implying that Torah knowledge should be firmly established within us. The Gemara (Berachos 35b) says the early pious ones made their Torah primary and their work secondary, and both succeeded. This means they focused on learning from every action, doing everything for the sake of Heaven, thereby finding the hidden light of Torah. This is why it says “their Torah,” as toiling in physical actions according to the Torah is called “The Torah of man” (Rashi on Tehillim 1:2). By making Torah the primary focus, the physical is elevated and connected to its spiritual source.<br>Isaiah 40:26 says, “Lift up your eyes and see who created all this,” implying that even things that seem distant from holiness are sustained by Hashem's power. The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 19:1) says, “Who can bring purity from impurity? Only Hashem,” indicating that by nullifying oneself to the source, one can purify even impurity. Through repentance, one seeks to return to the source, recognizing that all life force comes from Hashem. By nullifying oneself to the source, impurity is pushed away. Even though the physical world seems separate, it is all created by Hashem, and it is His will that it remains hidden.
The primary reason for sinning is the removal of the kingdom of Heaven from oneself. If a person truly understood that all life comes from Hashem and that they are merely an instrument in His hands, they wouldn't sin. Thus, haughtiness is akin to idolatry. By achieving humility and recognizing this truth, the sin is automatically erased, as genuine repentance is necessary for true humility.<br>This humility is the fear of Hashem that precedes everything. The Gemara (Shabbos 31a) compares this to storing wheat with a small amount of soil to preserve it, indicating that fear of sin preserves one's good deeds. The preservation of any mitzvah requires the fear of Hashem mixed into the action, ensuring it is performed properly. Just as the soil in the wheat is not considered an overcharge because it preserves the wheat, fear of Hashem, even if it slightly limits the mitzvah's action, ensures its proper fulfillment.<br>This is essential to know, as it aligns with the teaching that one who does a lot and one who does a little are equal if both have intentions for the sake of Heaven (Brachos 5b). The focus should be on performing mitzvot with the proper fear of Heaven, ensuring their lasting value.

Section 2

5632
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 19:1-2) states, "Who can make pure from impure, for example, Avraham from Terach? Who made all these? Was it not the One of the world? Hashem said: 'I have carved a statute, I have decreed a decree... one cannot transgress my decrees... This is the Chukas of the Torah... the words of Hashem are pure.'" The Midrash is not merely teaching that Hashem's expressions are pure, for Hashem and His messengers are inherently pure. Rather, it means that Hashem's expressions purify man. Just as the red heifer purifies not by itself but by Hashem's decree, so too, the expressions of Hashem purify everything by reconnecting it to its source. The entire world is created through Hashem's expressions, although their inner life force is hidden.<br>The solution is to reflect on "Who commanded this? It is Hashem's decree." This awareness reveals the hidden life force in everything, connecting it back to Hashem. There are two wonders in the world's existence: the power of negative forces to oppose Hashem's expressions, and the power given to Bnei Yisrael to draw down Hashem's expressions into the hiddenness of this world. This allows everything to reconnect to Hashem through mitzvot. By contemplating this, one returns everything to its source, bringing purity. This is the essence of a statute (חוקה), as it is carved into the world's nature, sustaining it through Hashem's expressions.<br>The concept of חק (statute) also implies sustenance, as it provides life force and blessings, connecting everything to its source. Man's purpose is to draw this life force into everything through careful reflection. The idea of carving out writing is used when it goes against the nature of the thing, much like "a black fire upon a white fire." This power comes from the Torah, hidden in every physical action, and is also called a חק. Through this understanding, man can draw the life force into all aspects of existence, ensuring that everything remains connected to its divine source.
(Bamidbar 21:18) "The well which the chieftains dug, which the nobles of the people started with maces, with their own staffs. And from Midbar to Mattanah." The Chidushei Harim explains that the well symbolizes the Oral Torah, which each person must find within themselves, revealing the hidden light of the Torah. The chieftains represent those who master their inclinations.<br>The nobles symbolize those who focus their generosity and desires solely on Hashem, allowing them to uncover hidden light everywhere. Maces represent the statute (חק), the divine power in everything. Man must protect this inner life force and adhere to divine rules to perceive the light.<br>Finally, staffs symbolize trust in Hashem. Spiritual attainment comes through reliance on Hashem, who aids in everything. This trust leads to Mattanah—a gift from Hashem.
Rashi (Bamidbar 19:2) explains that the nations of the world and the evil inclination taunt Bnei Yisrael by questioning the logic behind certain mitzvot. Therefore, these mitzvot are called חוקה, meaning we are not permitted to question them. The answer to the nations' taunts lies in understanding that while there is a reason for every חק, it can only be comprehended after accepting the mitzvah without needing a reason.<br>This acceptance without understanding is what Hashem desires. The degree of faith in performing the mitzvah without understanding determines how much one will eventually understand its reason. The reasons for mitzvot are spiritual and not physical; thus, distancing oneself from physicality allows one to perceive these reasons. The Midrash (Tanchuma Chukas 4) illustrates this by stating that children pure from sin could expound on 49 levels of Torah.<br>On Shabbos, the hidden reasons of the mitzvot are more revealed, as Shabbos embodies the taste and reason of the weekdays. This is why we request, “He shall reveal to us the reason” during Shabbos prayers. Shabbos allows for the inner essence of everything to be revealed, aligning with the idea that “those who taste it (Shabbos) merit life.” During the week, our efforts should aim to elevate our understanding and connection, culminating in the revelations of Shabbos.

(Bamidbar 19:2) "This - זאת is the Chok of the Torah." The Midrash explains that only Hashem can transform impure to pure and bad to good. The Chidushei Harim explained that the word זאת refers to the dominion of Heaven, as nothing else in the world can be described as זאת—its essence is the energy given by Hashem. The general rule is that everything contains Hashem's life force, and every Jew has a portion in the Torah, which is accessed through fear of Heaven. When one realizes that their existence is solely from Hashem and connects to this point (זאת), it awakens their inherent portion of the Torah.<br>This is the essence of זאת חקת התורה: the fear of Heaven is the mark of the Torah within a person. To connect to this, one must first nullify external forces. This ties to the idea of "Who can make pure from impure, the world to come from this world." The world to come does not arise from this world directly but rather through the preparation in this world by nullifying worldly distractions. By doing so, one reveals the hidden divine power within, transforming impurity to purity.<br>The world to come is called so because it follows the preparatory actions of this world, achieved through nullification of desires. The Midrash's statement "Only One (Hashem) can do so" signifies that after nullifying one's desires, the hidden life force emerges, unifying everything. This is the essence of תשובה (returning to Hashem), where even the body becomes repaired, as explained elsewhere.

The mouth of the well was created on Erev Shabbos, symbolizing a blend of Shabbos with the weekdays. The verse (Mishlei 5:15) "Drink water from your cistern and liquid from your well" contrasts still water in a cistern with flowing water from a well. Every Jew possesses a divine spark, a life force from Hashem, and it is our mission to uncover this inner point. Aligning all actions with this divine purpose is our primary task. This is reflected in "Drinking waters from your cistern," representing weekday efforts, while on Shabbos, it is "liquids from your well," symbolizing the emergence of new light and the additional soul received on Shabbos.<br>The verse "The well that was dug by chiefs" (Bamidbar 21:18) refers to tzadikim, who control their desires. "Dug by nobles of the nation" implies a deeper search for the flowing spring. Tzadikim initiate this quest for renewal, and each person, through their generosity and desire, can uncover even more. The term "with the staff (במחוקק)" signifies that every desire has an effect, and one must trust in Hashem. True desire requires reliance on Hashem's assistance, symbolized by "with their stick - משענותם," which represents trust in Hashem. The verse continues, "and from the Midbar a gift," indicating that actions guided by Hashem's direction merit the gift of Shabbos, a special treasure hidden in the preparation of the weekdays.<br>Preparation for Shabbos involves purity and holiness. According to the Zohar, purification stems from impurity when one seeks to become pure, while holiness is achieved by avoiding actions that lead to impurity. Both methods involve nullification to Hashem's oneness. The verse "Who will give purity from impurity, is it not One (Hashem)?" demonstrates that Hashem created both to show that nothing is separate from Him. Through nullification to Him, one can attain purity, exemplifying His unity. This is the realm of the weekdays. On Shabbos, Hashem sanctifies it, renewing the spiritual life force from the world above, as illustrated by "the mouth of the well."
"This is the Torah: 'A man who dies in a tent...'" (Bamidbar 19:14). Our sages (Brachos 63b) teach that one must be willing to sacrifice everything for the Torah. While we are commanded to "live by them" (Vayikra 18:5), we must be ready to give up our lives to avoid the three cardinal sins: immoral relations, murder, and idol worship. The degree of our self-sacrifice for the Torah reflects its importance to us.<br>The Midrash and Rashi (Bamidbar 23:9) state that worldly rewards for Bnei Yisrael do not reduce their merit in the world to come. This is because their main focus is the spiritual, not the material. The more one prioritizes the world to come, the less worldly benefits affect their ultimate reward.<br>Hashem benefits the world through nature and the good deeds of Bnei Yisrael (Chesed L'Avraham 6:24). The wicked, who focus on this world, receive their reward here, reducing their merit in the next world. Conversely, Bnei Yisrael, through their good deeds, do not see their heavenly reward diminished by worldly gains. This underscores the value of aligning actions with divine will.
The pasuk in Tehillim (69:14) states, "And for me, my prayer should come at an auspicious time." This verse is recited during the Mincha prayer on Shabbos, an auspicious time. Our sages (Brachos 8a) explain that an auspicious time occurs when the community prays together. Thus, the verse can be understood to mean that communal prayer creates an auspicious time.<br>Hashem sometimes desires Bnei Yisrael to take the initiative in creating this desire, known as "Ra'ava dera'ava," the desire of desires. This signifies Hashem's wish for Bnei Yisrael to awaken this desire within themselves. On Shabbos, when Hashem takes pleasure in Bnei Yisrael's acknowledgment of His creation and rest, this desire fuels spiritual energy for the upcoming week.<br>As Shabbos ends, one should yearn to maintain the connection with Hashem and pray not to be separated through the mundane activities of the week. This parallels informing someone of our intentions before an action, emphasizing the desire to remain connected.

Section 5

According to Midrash Rabbah 19:6, Hashem revealed the secrets of the Parah Adumah (red heifer) to Moshe, but for everyone else, it remains a 'Chok,' a decree beyond logical comprehension. The reasons for mitzvot transcend natural understanding. Sinless children could explore the Torah from 49 perspectives, revealing its hidden secrets. Moshe, deeply connected to the written Torah, was granted these secrets, while for others, it remains an enigma.<br>The commandment to "bring forth to you" (Bamidbar 19:2) signifies bringing our understanding to the tzadik, who transcends nature. By submitting to the tzadik, Bnei Yisrael can grasp the deeper reasons behind the mitzvot. Through submission to the tzadik, we can collectively understand the mitzvot's underlying reasons, transcending natural limitations and accessing higher spiritual insights.
The passage in Tehillim (136:19-20) states, "To Sichon, king of the Emori, forever is your kindness, and to Og, king of Bashan, forever is your kindness." The Chidushei Harim explains that these praises are recited for generations because Sichon and Og represent the primary forces opposing Bnei Yisrael's service to Hashem. Sichon symbolizes thoughts (machshava) and is countered by the Tefillin of the head, while Og represents power (Edrei being linked to "arm") and is countered by the Tefillin of the arm.<br>The passage continues, "He gave their land as an inheritance, forever is His kindness, an inheritance to Yisrael, His nation, forever is His kindness." The division into two praises highlights the significance of Bnei Yisrael infusing holiness into these lands. These lands, controlled by negative forces, were challenging to conquer. Bnei Yisrael's travels infused holiness into these places, making them deserving of the inheritance.<br>This concept is also expressed in Tehillim 111:6, "The power of His creation He revealed to His children, to give them an inheritance of the nations of the world." Hashem created the world and its opposing forces so that Bnei Yisrael, through their efforts to purify and reveal holiness, would ultimately merit their eternal reward.

Section 6

5636
Rashi states that the nations and the evil inclination mock Bnei Yisrael, questioning the reasons for mitzvot like the Parah Adumah, calling it a 'Chok' (decree). The answer is challenging because if it truly has no reason, why does it matter what others say? <br>In truth, there is a reason, but it can't be understood until one's body is refined. From a physical perspective, there is no apparent reason for a Chok. However, those who believe will eventually understand. Torah works oppositely from the physical world, where desire follows taste. In Torah, action precedes understanding, and through mitzvot, one eventually perceives their true sweetness. Only those detached from worldly desires can taste this holiness.<br>Moshe, called a man of G-d and separate from this world, could understand the Parah Adumah's reason, while for others, it remains a Chok. Believers who perform mitzvot without understanding will eventually grasp their reasons. The Medrash says Hashem makes pure from impure, highlighting that separation from this world leads to the world to come. The toil on erev Shabbos symbolizes guarding one's desires from worldly mix. Shabbos, a day of rest and pleasure, reflects this purity, and those who protect their spirituality during the week will taste the holiness of Shabbos and the world to come.
When there was a plague of poisonous snakes, Hashem commanded Moshe to make a copper snake and place it on a banner. When someone was bitten, they would look up to the copper snake and be healed. The Mishnah (Rosh Hashanah 3:8) asks why looking at the snake is necessary, since the snake neither kills nor heals. The Mishnah answers that when Bnei Yisrael looked upward and directed their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they were healed.<br>However, this raises a question: why use a copper snake at all? Wouldn't looking up to Heaven be sufficient? The deeper understanding is that the snake indeed possesses healing power, as explained by the Ramban (Numbers 21:9). Hashem's way is to sweeten something bitter with something bitter. Normally, if one is bitten by a dog, looking at a dog is harmful. Here, Hashem made it so that looking at the snake would heal. The true intention is that even when engaged in physical healing, one should recognize that it is Hashem who heals, not the snake.<br>This teaches that even when distant from higher spiritual realms and immersed in physicality, one should still direct their heart to Heaven. By doing so, one shows a desire to transcend the physical world and connect with Hashem. The command "Make a (copper) snake ('seraf') for yourself" alludes to the inner fire and excitement to connect with Hashem.
The pasuk (Bamidbar 21:18-20) states, "...from Midbar (desert) to Matana (gift), and from Matana to Nachli'el (inheritance from Hashem), from Nachli'el to Bamot (high place), from Bamot to Gai (valley)." The Gemara (Eruvin 54a) interprets this as a spiritual journey: one who humbles themselves like a desert will receive the Torah as a gift, then as an inheritance. If one becomes haughty (Bamot), Hashem will lower them (Gai).<br>This final part seems different and raises the question of why it is included in the song, which denotes closeness and joy. It reflects Bnei Yisrael's stages: submitting to Hashem, receiving the Torah as a gift, and then as an inheritance, which strengthens them. However, this can lead to haughtiness and sin. After receiving the Torah, Bnei Yisrael sinned and lost their crowns but later repented. This inclusion in the song highlights their journey and the importance of repentance and repair, making them stand even stronger.<br>This concept is supported by the saying, "In the place where those who repent stand, even the completely righteous cannot stand." Moshe's name is omitted from this song because he did not sin and was the most humble. The Rav of Pershischa explains, "He lowers the haughty and raises the lowly," meaning Hashem lowers the haughty to raise them afterward while they remain humble. This aligns with the idea that true elevation comes after humility and repentance.

Balak



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Parshat Balak
Rabbi Meir teaches that whoever possesses a good eye, a humble spirit, and a moderate appetite is a disciple of Avraham, while an evil eye, a haughty spirit, and an insatiable appetite mark a disciple of Bilam. The disciples of Avraham enjoy this world and inherit the world to come, as it is said: “I will endow those who love me with substance, I will fill their treasuries” (Proverbs 8:21). In contrast, the disciples of Bilam inherit Gehenna and descend into the nethermost pit (Psalms 55:24). The question arises: why are they called disciples of Bilam when his negative traits can be found in any fool without study?<br>Bilam's so-called humility was a facade; he claimed he could not transgress Hashem's word even for a house full of silver and gold, but this was to elevate his own importance. His humility was merely a means to achieve greater haughtiness. This is what is meant by his description: "one who falls with revealed eyes," indicating that his humility was a strategy to gain more honor. In contrast, the righteous, who have a truly humble spirit, seek only to be connected to the life force of Hashem, recognizing that all existence derives from Hashem. Their actions are always aimed at connecting to this divine source.<br>The continuation of the Mishnah explains that the disciples of Avraham inherit this world and the next. The word "inherit" is linked to "flow," as their proper actions in this world align it with its divine purpose, creating a flow to the world to come. This world is like an entrance hall to the next; by elevating worldly matters to holiness, one can reveal the hidden light of the world to come. Both worlds are interconnected; the holiness hidden by worldly desires here can be revealed, granting insight into the spiritual realm.<br>Bilam's disciples, however, misuse even their good traits for self-aggrandizement, leading to their inheritance of Gehenna. Despite being a prophet, Bilam tainted his good deeds with sin, bringing bad into good, and thus inherits eternal damnation. This misappropriation of holiness results in experiencing Gehenna even in this world. In contrast, Avraham's disciples, by aligning their actions with Hashem's will, naturally possess a good eye and inherit true spiritual rewards.

Section 2

5632
With G-d's Blessing Balak I do not remember the order
(Bamidbar 22:5) “Behold the Nation that has left Mitzrayim, behold they have covered the ‘eye’ of the land.” This refers to the perception focused on physicality. Bnei Yisrael enlightened the world to see the internal, spiritual essence in everything, nullifying the external view that, through a physical lens, seems to oppose holiness. In truth, this opposition is merely a cover, a trick to obscure the real truth. Bnei Yisrael's holiness and revelation of Hashem nullified this deceptive power, which angered Balak and Bilaam. [See what we have written later, וירא.]
(Bamidbar 24:7) “Water shall flow from their branches-מדליו.” Our sages explain (Nedarim 81a) “Be wary of the children of the poor, for it is from them where Torah comes forth.” This refers to true subjugation to Hashem, likened to a bucket-דלי, which draws water from a well. As our sages explain, it can descend to a low place, symbolizing humility. The lower the bucket goes, the more water it can draw. Similarly, the vessel to draw the living waters of Torah is through nullification to the source. By nullifying one's desires to Hashem's will, one connects better to the source and draws forth Torah. This is akin to השקה, where impure water becomes pure by connecting to pure water.
The Chidushei Harim explained the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 20:18): Bilaam said to Hashem, wouldn't it be better to be served by all 70 nations rather than just Bnei Yisrael? Hashem replied that the simple, dry menachot offerings from Bnei Yisrael are more precious than the many offerings of the nations. This is because the nations seek to cause friction between Bnei Yisrael and Hashem. Even though all nations give their strength to Hashem and are ultimately nullified to Him, their offerings are not genuinely wanted. As our sages explain (Baba Basra 10b), whatever good the nations do is for their own gains.<br>This is evident in Bilaam's words of subjugation: "If Balak were to give me a house full of silver and gold, I cannot transgress the words of Hashem." His humility was a facade for his haughtiness. The negative forces humble themselves to gain through trickery. In contrast, Bnei Yisrael seek elevation to be closer to Hashem and truly submit to Him. The ultimate desire of Bnei Yisrael is real submission and true humility, wanting to remain spiritually low and connected to Hashem.
Regarding the verse (Micah 6:5), “My nation, remember what Balak…and Bilaam plotted against you,” the Gemara (Berachot 12b) states that our sages wanted to include the parsha of Bilaam in the Shema prayer. This is because a person must always strengthen their service to Hashem and believe that even though negative forces oppose holiness, they are ultimately nullified to Hashem’s will. This is only true when one follows the path of truth.<br>Bilaam was forced to bless Bnei Yisrael against his will, similar to how the evil angel is compelled to say Amen. This principle applies at all times to Bnei Yisrael, who face wicked plans against them. It is in this context that we pray, “swiftly thwart their counsel.”
(Bamidbar 22:2-3) "And Balak saw…and Moav became very afraid for they (Bnei Yisrael) were very numerous." The verse states (Tehillim 31:2) “How numerous is Your goodness.” The Zohar (3:88a) explains this refers to the hidden light, the source of all goodness, reserved for the righteous in the world to come. Hashem hid the light of Torah in creation, as it says (Bereishis 1:31) “And Elokim saw all that He had created and it was very good,” which our sages interpret as referring to both the angel of death and the evil inclination.<br>Our mission is to find this hidden light, revealing the truth and subjugating everything to Hashem. Bnei Yisrael in the wilderness generation illuminated this hidden light wherever they traveled. When Balak saw this, he was forced to witness the clear revelation of Hashem's dominion. For someone as wicked as Balak, this was like a "covering of the eye," as he said (Bamidbar 22:5) “Bnei Yisrael are covering the eye of the land,” indicating that the wicked cannot face the truth.<br>Moav was very afraid, referring to the ultimate goodness of Hashem, because Bnei Yisrael were about to reveal and clarify everything as it should be, signifying the ultimate revelation of Hashem. Before entering Eretz Yisrael, Bnei Yisrael's preparation involved connecting deeply to this hidden light. This is linked to the concept of Eretz Yisrael being the central point of the world, as explained in the Zohar Vayera (1:108b).

Section 3

5633
(Bamidbar 22:5) "Behold, the Nation that has left Mitzrayim has covered the 'eye of the land.'" Bilam's statement to Balak can be understood in two ways. One interpretation is that Bnei Yisrael are covering up the natural perception of the world, showing that everything seen is actually the inner life force of Hashem. They reveal that there is no such thing as nature; it is all an expression of Hashem. When Bnei Yisrael left Egypt, they enlightened the world, revealing Hashem's holiness everywhere, which angered the nations because it exposed their errors.<br>Another explanation is that Bnei Yisrael have the duty to protect the inner point of Hashem's kingship that rules everything. Hashem's supervision is hidden in everything, and this needs protection. As much as one guards the inner energy from being used for physicality, it will be protected from foreign interference. The evil eye of the nations can only affect the holiness of Bnei Yisrael if they fail to guard this inner energy. Balak's words to Bilam, "they have covered the eye of the land," mean that Bnei Yisrael have revealed Hashem's true supervision. <br>Both explanations converge on the idea that guarding the inner life force from misuse elevates it back to its divine source, nullifying externalities and making everything holy. This is what angered Balak and Bilam; they wanted Bnei Yisrael to leave Egypt and follow their own path without amending and uplifting physicality, which would destroy their existence. Yet, despite their efforts, Bnei Yisrael continued to camp opposite them, symbolizing their role as the nemesis to such negativity.

Section 4

5635
The Midrash states that it is preferable for the wicked to be blind, as their evil gaze brings harm to the world. It continues to explain that Hashem gave Bilam prophecy so that the nations of the world could not claim that Hashem distanced them. However, when Hashem gave Bilam prophecy, he brought great destruction to the world.<br>We must understand what Bilam was thinking when he attempted to curse Bnei Yisrael, knowing they are Hashem's chosen people. Balak accused Bnei Yisrael of covering the eye of the land, implying they were not sharing the light they received from Hashem with the world. In truth, Bnei Yisrael were chosen to conceal the strength of holiness, allowing Hashem to bestow the hidden bounty reserved for the righteous. The light was hidden to prevent it from being misused by the wicked and to protect it from being tainted.<br>Bnei Yisrael serve as a partition, preventing the wicked from accessing this bounty. This exclusivity is beneficial even for the wicked, as they receive some benefit through Bnei Yisrael. Without Bnei Yisrael, this good would not exist in the world. This concept is similar to Shabbos, given exclusively to Bnei Yisrael, symbolizing the need to protect and hide the light from misuse. Balak and Bilam did not realize that their accusation was a reflection of their own actions, as they were preventing the light from spreading. Hashem intended to show through Bilam that the nations could not blame Him for distancing them. Choosing Bnei Yisrael was beneficial for the nations, as it allowed them to access the light indirectly. Hashem even provided them with a prophet, Bilam, but his actions led to further destruction, as seen in his advice to the daughters of Moav to seduce Bnei Yisrael.
“And Balak replied and said, I cannot transgress the will of Hashem, and now, stay here tonight and I will tell you what He says etc.”<br>The explanation is that initially, Balak was haughty, believing he had the power to act. When he saw that Hashem would not permit him to go, he pretended to be humble. His response was not genuine humility but a tactic to achieve greater stature. This is the meaning of his words “stay here with this,” referring to the power of his feigned humility.<br>In truth, Balak acted as he wished. He was allowed to go because, as stated in Iyov 12:23, “He exalts the nations and destroys them.” The wicked receive their reward for any humility or good deeds in this world because their humility is not genuine but a means to gain reward and further haughtiness. True humility is being genuinely humble before Hashem. There is also humility in actions intended to achieve true humility, which is also good.

Section 5



Section 6

5639
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 20:2) explains on the verse “And Balak saw” that it is preferable for the wicked to be blind, as their eyes bring harm to the world. This is evident from Balak's words, “They have covered the eye of the land,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael hid the power of holiness to prevent it from being tainted by the wicked. This concealment was ultimately for the benefit of the wicked, as their sight brings about negativity for themselves and the world. Balak's anger stemmed from seeing Bnei Yisrael illuminate the hidden light of holiness wherever they traveled, which he perceived as a threat. The wicked cannot bear to face the truth, and thus Balak's frustration was due to Bnei Yisrael's efforts to repair and sanctify even the lands of Moav and Midyan.<br>The Midrash highlights that Bnei Yisrael's concealment of holiness was a strategic protection against the negative influence of the wicked. This concealment aligns with the concept in Yeshaya 20:22, where Bnei Yisrael are advised to hide until the anger passes. Bnei Yisrael have both hidden and revealed aspects, akin to the Torah and Hashem. The wicked's inability to see the true essence of Bnei Yisrael is a testament to the effectiveness of this concealment. Balak's desire to curse Bnei Yisrael's lower level, while overlooking their divine essence, underscores the importance of this protective concealment. The phrase “No harm is in sight for Yaakov” signifies that Bnei Yisrael's holiness is shielded from the wicked. Despite mingling among the nations, Bnei Yisrael maintain their distinct identity, dwelling alone and not being counted among the nations.<br>The anger of the nations, as reflected in their frustration with Bnei Yisrael's concealment of holiness, ultimately highlights the righteousness of Bnei Yisrael's actions. By hiding the holiness, Bnei Yisrael protect it from being corrupted by the wicked. This dynamic is further illustrated by the concept that Bnei Yisrael transcend the natural order, aligning with Hashem's higher purpose and maintaining their sanctity even in the face of external challenges. This is seen in Bilaam’s observation that “Hashem their G-d is with them, and their king’s acclaim in their midst,” recognizing both the divine element above nature and the lower order. Thus, Bnei Yisrael's actions of concealment and sanctification serve to preserve their unique relationship with Hashem and their mission in the world.

Section 7

5640
The Midrash explains that Hashem did not want the nations to complain that they were distanced unfairly. Initially, Hashem's dominion was over all creations. Later, Bnei Yisrael were distinguished and elevated towards Hashem due to their good deeds and those of their ancestors, creating a shift in spiritual levels. This did not harm other nations; rather, Bnei Yisrael's elevation brought hidden goodness and holiness to them, as stated, “The Rock, perfect in His work.”<br>When the nations claimed, "The nation that has left Egypt has covered the eye of the land," they meant that Bnei Yisrael received all the holiness. This complaint is false, as the holiness that nations experience is due to Bnei Yisrael's exalted level. Had the nations sincerely committed to serving Hashem and subordinated themselves to Bnei Yisrael, they would benefit greatly. Bnei Yisrael are willing to bring all nations closer to Hashem if they genuinely desire it.<br>Because Bnei Yisrael's service to Hashem is so elevated, their reward is primarily in the World to Come, as it is written, "Today, to do them." However, their immense holiness also brings light and a holy spirit to all nations, giving them a share in everything, which results in rewards in this world as well. The Midrash states that in this world, nations receive blessings only through Bilaam, demonstrating that the nations should acknowledge their benefit from Bnei Yisrael's holiness.

Pinchas



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Pinchas Brief summary of main points
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 21:1) explains that Pinchas deserved to be elevated to the priesthood due to his actions. However, this seems difficult since Pinchas was already a Cohen. The explanation lies in the different levels of priesthood. A Cohen represents love and kindness, and as the Tanya explains, love of Hashem comes through fear (yirah). The priesthood was a gift to Aharon's descendants, but Pinchas earned it by right through his zealous act on behalf of Bnei Yisrael, ensuring it remained in his family forever.<br>The pasuk “He displayed his passion for me among them” (Bamidbar 25:11) means Pinchas acted not for personal gain but for the benefit of Klal Yisrael. His actions showed that even though Bnei Yisrael sinned, there was someone among them to take vengeance, calming Hashem's anger. Moshe did not kill Zimri because the deed needed to be done by a simple Jew within the community. This also explains why Pinchas was not previously nominated as a Cohen; the action required someone not yet a Cohen to later earn this status through his righteous act.<br>The Midrash further explains that the priesthood was initially intended for Shem but was given to Avraham due to his yirah (fear of Hashem). Avraham combined yirah with ahava (love), achieving a higher level of completeness (shalom). This concept is mirrored in Yerushalayim, where yirah and ahava unite. Similarly, Pinchas, through his zealousness, achieved the level of love and kindness, embodying the attribute of Aharon, who loved peace and acted on behalf of the entire Jewish nation.
The meaning of a korban (offering) is to bring everything back to its source, clarifying that it is all from Hashem. This concept extends to daily prayers, which replace the daily korban (Brachos 26b), as we request everything, big and small, from Hashem and praise Him, demonstrating that everything is from Him. This process brings everything closer to its source. On Shabbos, there is an additional korban and prayer, the Musaf, teaching us that even when we merit greater attachment to Hashem through our own efforts, we must realize that this too is only from Hashem.

Matot



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Matot Briefly
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 22:1) says that to take an oath using Hashem’s name, one must possess the traits of our forefathers, known as “those that fear G-d.” This means being connected to Hashem by connecting to Torah scholars. Our forefathers were fully absorbed with fear of Hashem, making even their mundane actions mitzvot.<br>The Midrash emphasizes “if you have within you these traits,” indicating an internal work. Every action should be connected to the inner life force from Hashem, which is the primary meaning of “internal fear of Hashem.” Clinging to Hashem is achieved not through separation from physicality, but by uplifting every physical action for the sake of Hashem.<br>Moshe spoke these words to the heads of the tribes, symbolizing the inclination of everything towards its internal mechanism and drawing it back to its source. The forefathers are the source, and the heads of the tribes connect Bnei Yisrael to this source. An oath or vow is an expression of one’s inner desires, ideally aimed at mitzvot. However, one who has not reached the level where their mundane actions are solely for the sake of Heaven may still need to be compelled through an oath or vow.
The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 22:7) explains that the three primary gains in this world—knowledge, might, and wealth—lead to greatness if given as gifts from Hashem. However, if they are 'grabbed' by the person, they lead to downfall. Although everything is from Hashem, the key is the person's acknowledgment that all they have is from Him. This awareness reveals the internal life force of Hashem in everything. Conversely, when someone grabs for themselves, thinking it is their own strength and might, they hide Hashem's power within everything.

Section 2

5632
The Midrash quoted by Rashi explains that Moshe's prophecy differed from other prophets. While others used the phrase כה ("so says Hashem"), Moshe also used זה ("this is the word of Hashem"), indicating a more direct and clear prophecy (אספקלריא המאירה). The question arises: why is Moshe's prophecy still considered unique even when he uses כה, like other prophets?<br>The answer lies in the purpose of prophecy. The expression כה is used to bring enlightenment to dark places where absolute clarity isn't possible, only through hints and allegories. This lower level of prophecy applies to this world, where everything hints at something higher. Moshe's level of זה was above nature, in a place of pure divine light without darkness. Bnei Yisrael experienced this at the giving of the Torah, but lost it after the sin of the Golden Calf.<br>On Shabbos, Moshe returns our crowns received at the giving of the Torah, indicating revelation and clarity. The Zohar states that Shabbos is called a testimony, as Bnei Yisrael testify that Hashem created and sustains everything. Shabbos represents the level of זה, while the weekdays represent כה, where actions are done for the sake of Heaven even though the truth is hidden. Shabbos depends on the weekdays; through the emuna of כה, one merits the clarity of זה on Shabbos. To reach the level of זה, one must direct all traits exclusively to Hashem's service. The Chidushei Harim explains that שבועה (swearing) incorporates all seven traits for Hashem, leading to the level of זה. One should not think that if the truth isn't clear, their effort is false. Every Jew has a true will to serve Hashem, and toiling to reach this point, even through imagination, is considered absolute truth. This world requires actions based on belief to reach true clarity. This concept is encapsulated in the verse, "I have sworn and I will fulfill it" (Tehillim 119).

Masei



Section 1

With G-d's Blessing Masei Briefly
The Chidushei Harim explained the mistake of confusing Batzra for Betzer. The Gemara (Makkot 12a) states that in the future, Hashem will take vengeance on the guardian angel of the Romans, who mistakenly seeks refuge in Batzra, thinking it is a city of refuge like Betzer. This angel makes three mistakes: confusing the names, thinking cities of refuge protect willful murderers, and believing they provide refuge for angels. One who kills inadvertently loses their place, as the pasuk says, “The land shall not atone except with the blood of the one who spilled it” (Bamidbar 35:33). Hashem provides a place of exile called Betzer, symbolizing the strength Hashem gives for refuge. The Torah is also a place of refuge, as the Gemara explains “Betzer in the desert” is juxtaposed with “This is the Torah.” One who realizes they have sinned and lost their place can be saved through the Torah, but only if they nullify themselves to Hashem. If someone believes they have their own place, the city of refuge does not protect them. Batzra, symbolizing self-attributed strength, does not provide refuge, as protection is only for those who realize they have no place of their own.

With G-d's Blessing Matot-Masei
The Torah records Bnei Yisrael's travels as "the goings out of their travels" because some places only exist through distancing from them, similar to how worldly things exist through their nullification. These travels are significant because leaving such places grants them mention in the Torah, giving them purpose and existence. Each person must remember to do everything for Hashem's sake, as this gives their actions existence, whether positive or distancing from negative actions. The Midrash criticizes the Tribe of Gad and Reuven for "grabbing for themselves," highlighting that true existence comes from subjugation to the Torah. When secondary things are kept secondary, they have a reason to exist, but making them primary negates their purpose.

Section 3

5633
“These are the travels and the goings out…and these are their goings out in accordance with their travels” (Bamidbar 33:1). The language is switched from the beginning to the end of the pasuk. This can be explained by connecting the travels in the wilderness to the exodus from Mitzrayim, suggesting the exodus is completed only at the end of all the travels.<br>With each stage of travel, Bnei Yisrael distanced themselves further from Mitzrayim until they reached Eretz Yisrael. Similarly, a person's desire to separate from physicality should be to connect with Hashem and achieve purity of heart, not out of disgust for the physical world. Hashem made physicality attractive so that man's actions are for the sake of Heaven. This explains “their goings out for their travels,” meaning they leave physicality for the sake of their spiritual journey. As one travels and gets closer to Hashem, they complete the process of separating from physicality, and each step aids the other.
The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Bamidbar 34:2): “Instruct the Israelite people and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as your portion, the land of Canaan with its various boundaries.” A person must accept upon themselves to always be subservient to Hashem, never forgetting Him for even a moment. Even though one knows they are not on that level, the acceptance and desire must be genuine. This good intention will help them at least somewhat.<br>It seems we can add that Hashem knew there would be remnants of the Canaanites, yet His will was for Bnei Yisrael to accept upon themselves to completely uproot them. Our Sages explain that when they crossed the Jordan River, they committed to this. Even though some Canaanites remained, in the future, everything will be corrected with Hashem's help, through the proper acceptance they took upon themselves.

Section 4



Section 5

5635
Moshe wrote down the travels of Bnei Yisrael because these journeys represent the detailed extraction from the 49 levels of impurity they encountered in Mitzrayim. Each travel stage was a specific step in their spiritual repair. Including the 7 camps they returned to, there were 49 stages in total, paralleling the 49 levels of impurity.<br>This highlights Moshe’s greatness, as he guided Bnei Yisrael through all these stages from Mitzrayim to Eretz Yisrael, even though he didn't need it for himself. Similarly, each person of Yisrael, called מהלך (one who moves), must remember all the stages they went through from the beginning of their journey to achieve true humility. We see this with Yaakov Avinu, who, when leaving Lavan’s house, recalled his original journey and stated, “For with my staff I crossed the Jordan.” He remembered all he had endured over the past 20 years without forgetting his initial level, which brought him to true humility.

Section 6

5639
(Bamidbar 34:2) "This is the land that falls to you as an inheritance." The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 23:5) tells us Hashem showed Moshe every future generation, including leaders, judges, the righteous, and sinners. The Canaanites never perceived Eretz Yisrael's spiritual essence. Bnei Yisrael's preparation upon entering the land brought down its spiritual concept to the physical realm. As our sages taught, the Beis Hamikdash above is directed over the Beis Hamikdash below, and similarly, Eretz Yisrael and Yerushalayim have hidden spiritual elements.<br>“This is the land” refers to the spiritual energy Hashem showed Moshe. Bnei Yisrael are the “borders” within which holiness spreads. Through the 12 tribes entering their borders, the land becomes an inheritance, enabling holiness to permeate it. Hashem commanded not to leave any Canaanites because the spiritual essence of the land cannot tolerate their impurity. On an individual level, as one prepares the Torah in their heart and soul, Hashem brings about holiness proportionately. As our sages taught, one should always feel as if there is holiness within their body.

Section 7

5642
With G-d's Help Matot-Masei
The pasuk (Bamidbar 33:1) “These are the journeys of Bnei Yisrael who left Mitzrayim…” indicates that their journeys were dependent on leaving Mitzrayim. It is known that these places needed spiritual correction, which was achieved by Bnei Yisrael traveling through them. The 42 stops plus the 8 they backtracked on total 50, paralleling the 50 times the exodus is mentioned in the Torah, as the Zohar states.<br>Mitzrayim was the primary source of impurity, and Bnei Yisrael needed to go through these places individually to repair them. The Midrash explains that these areas were elevated by hosting Bnei Yisrael. The pasuk implies that the places themselves also left Mitzrayim, as Bnei Yisrael took with them the sparks of holiness that were in Mitzrayim, needing to purify these sparks in each journey.<br>This is further explained in Elazar the Cohen's words to the warriors returning from Midyan: “The ones who are coming to battle,” not “returning.” After the general battle (Exodus) with Midyan, there was a second, individual battle to repair the holy sparks they collected. This is why they purified Midyan’s vessels, paid taxes, and gave extra donations. This second battle is referred to as “those that come to war.”

Section 8

5643
The Midrash (Tanchuma Masei 1) questions whether one can transgress Shabbos to escape danger. This idea is linked to Bnei Yisrael's journeys in the wilderness, where they fought off negative forces, as it states: “And when the Aron was lifted…stand forth Hashem and your enemies will scatter” (Bamidbar 10:35). These journeys were the source of the entire exile we now experience, implying that Bnei Yisrael must constantly repair these places.<br>At that time, due to the holiness among them, Bnei Yisrael were able to nullify the external negative powers in those places. This is hinted at in the pasuk (Devarim 8:15) “places of snakes and scorpions,” yet it was (Bamidbar 9:23) “By the word of Hashem they encamped, and by the word of Hashem they traveled.” Even while escaping, they maintained calmness and did not have to transgress Shabbos. The Gemara (Shabbos 31b) explains that since they disassembled the Mishkan with the intention of rebuilding it elsewhere, it was still considered like building it in the same place because it was all done by Hashem's command.<br>Traveling usually disrupts rest, but their travels were also with calmness. The Midrash hints that despite the dangers, Hashem did not let them run away in haste. Their journeys were compared to the weekdays, and the camping to Shabbos, as they moved from level to level. This teaches that each person should elevate themselves from Shabbos to Shabbos through the 50 Shabbosim of the year, paralleling the 50 campings of Bnei Yisrael in the wilderness.

Deuteronomy

Devarim



Section 1

5631
The Midrash discusses how the words "אלה הדברים" (These are the words) have a unique significance, emphasizing that the Torah gives life to all of creation since Hashem created the world with the Torah. The Torah's words elevate other languages, which are generally removed from holiness and more physical. Lashon Hakodesh (the Holy Tongue) precisely defines each item's essence, unlike other languages that are mere conventions. Therefore, Lashon Hakodesh is uplifting, while other languages are profane.<br>However, when the Torah is written in other languages, these languages gain an element of holiness and become closer to sanctity. The Torah's words free these languages from their physicality, as the law allowing Torah to be translated uplifts them. This is reflected in the blessing that Hashem will give beauty to Yephet, indicating that even the Greek language can become a vessel for the Torah. Through the internal essence of the Torah, external aspects are also brought closer to holiness.
The Midrash discusses why Moshe Rabbeinu said he was "not a man of words" at the burning bush, even though he spoke perfectly well to Hashem. The explanation is that speaking to Paroh and conveying Hashem's holy words to someone as lowly as Paroh was not feasible before the Exodus and the giving of the Torah. As the Zohar states, Hashem's words were in exile at that time. However, later in Devarim, Moshe expounded the Torah in 70 languages, elevating them with the light of the Torah and making them holier.<br>This concept is embodied in Mishna Torah, where Moshe repeated and deepened the teachings of the Torah, infusing Bnei Yisrael with its holiness. The Midrash queries why Moshe focused on rebukes, explaining that "rebuke" means to internalize. Moshe's words were direct and forceful, like a king's decree, meant to be internalized and obeyed. He spoke to all of Yisrael, bringing the light of the Torah even to places where they had sinned, providing life and healing through its words.<br>The Chidushei Harim explains that Moshe translated the Torah into 70 languages to counter the 70 nations and their levels of impurity opposing holiness. This allowed Bnei Yisrael to connect to the Torah even in exile under foreign powers. In the future, when everything is connected to its source, there will be no lameness or speechlessness, symbolizing complete spiritual healing. Through the power of the Torah, languages are healed and uplifted from impurity, as explained above.
On the verse "Any matter that is too difficult for you, you shall bring to me and I will hear it," the Ramban explains that if a person is troubled by something and cannot understand it, they should remove their personal pleasure from it. By doing so, they will discern if it aligns with Hashem's will, as the truth will become clear. This teaching is also brought by the Ba'al Shem Tov and was heard from the Chidushei Harim.<br>"Bringing it to me" means connecting the matter to its internal life force, which is Hashem. Each Jew has an element of Moshe Rabeinu, which helps clarify the truth. Difficulties are external, caused by concealments. When one connects to the internal life force, there is no concealment, only clarity.
The haftorah begins with a rebuke of Bnei Yisrael, comparing them unfavorably to an ox that knows its master, whereas Bnei Yisrael do not. The Sfas Emes asks how this can be, as Bnei Yisrael constantly pray and bless Hashem. The criticism, however, is that Hashem desires Bnei Yisrael to reveal His dominion over all creation.<br>In the time of the Beis Hamikdash, daily korbanos brought all creation closer to Hashem, and even the nations were humbled before Him. Jerusalem was called a "faithful city," reflecting the entire world's connection to its true source. The criticism is that Bnei Yisrael do not make Hashem's dominion known to the world. The term "ידע" here means to "make known," emphasizing the need for Bnei Yisrael to actively reveal Hashem's rule. The sefer Ohr Meir explains that one who acts with a deep connection to Hashem's internal power will have Hashem's spirit in all their actions, pleasing the entire world.

Section 2

5633
The difference between Moshe previously saying to Hashem, "I am not a man of words," and now saying "These are the words," is that it is only now that Moshe’s words can truly penetrate Bnei Yisrael. This is achieved through the proper use of "lashon" (speech), as the way speech is used gives meaning to the words.<br>Lashon hara (evil speech) harms three people—the speaker, the listener, and the subject—affecting even those far away. Conversely, good speech has an even greater positive impact, reaching distant places. Moshe, representing the collective consciousness of Bnei Yisrael, needed to ensure his words could reach and resonate with everyone.<br>When speech comes from a place of inner truth, it can transform everything for the better. For instance, Moshe used the same word "Eicha" (how), yet in his context, it had a positive connotation about Bnei Yisrael, whereas other prophets used it negatively. This demonstrates the power of speech when used correctly.

Section 3

5634
The Sfas Emes distinguishes between the "lashon" (language) of the Torah and the "ma’amar" (utterance) of the Torah. The ma’amar represents the inner meaning, while the lashon is an external garment that explains this inner meaning. This distinction allows the Torah to be written in different languages, as the external language can serve as a healing garment (marpe lashon) for other languages.<br>As the Torah is expressed in more external ways, it also opens up the internal flow (ma’ayan pnimi) of the Torah. This is reflected in the verse "Drink water from your own cistern, and flowing water from your own well." The "cistern" (bor) is the Torah and holiness each person receives from Hashem. By using this light and focusing on spirituality and avodas Hashem, one merits to access a flowing wellspring (ma’ayan) of fresh water.<br>Therefore, only after Bnei Yisrael traveled through the desert and elevated all the places, Moshe was able to clearly explain the Torah to them, like a wellspring opening up. This is signified by "Moshe began to explain this Torah."
The Gemara Yerushalmi (Yuma 1:1) states that any generation in which the Beis Hamikdash is not rebuilt is as if it has been destroyed in their days. This does not imply that earlier generations were unworthy or that the generation in which it will be rebuilt is superior. Rather, each generation must contribute through their Torah and mitzvos to the ongoing process of rebuilding the Beis Hamikdash, as reflected in the continuous prayer "Boneh Yerushalayim" (He who builds Jerusalem).<br>Therefore, any generation that does not contribute at all to its rebuilding is as if it has destroyed it in their days. On an individual level, each person must recognize that their actions contribute to the rebuilding of the Beis Hamikdash. By accepting the yoke of Heaven and engaging in mitzvos, they assist in its construction, as "everything assists in the King's construction."
The verse "An ox knows its owner... but Israel does not know" underscores a key issue. Although humans possess da’as (knowledge), which sets them apart from animals, this da’as can be misused, leading to greater faults. It's crucial to use our da’as properly to avoid such pitfalls.<br>There are two stages in serving Hashem. The first stage is performing Hashem's will naturally, like all of creation. The second stage is serving Hashem with awareness and understanding, recognizing our free choice and still choosing to serve Him. This higher level can lead to greater spiritual heights but also greater lows if misused.<br>The navi's complaint is that Bnei Yisrael, with their chochma (wisdom) and da’as, failed to use these gifts properly, making them worse than animals, who naturally follow Hashem. Bnei Yisrael neglected this higher level of service. This explains the Mishna in Avot: "Rabbi says, What is the right path a person should choose? One that is tiferet (glorious) for the doer and brings tiferet from others." The first stage, "tiferet for the doer," refers to naturally doing Hashem’s will, like nature. The second stage, "tiferet from others," refers to serving Hashem with free choice and understanding, enhancing one's spiritual experience.

Section 4

5635
The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 1) states that a sefer Torah can be written in any language, unlike Tefillin and Mezuzot. The Midrash explains that the words of the Torah heal the tongue. All 70 languages have some connection to the Torah but have spread out in different directions. These are called "lashonot" (languages), akin to a spring flowing into smaller rivers. Bnei Yisrael were given the main spring. Through the power of the Torah, they can draw from these tributaries and heal them, allowing the languages to flourish.<br>These languages are like short rivers confined by their borders. However, the light of the Torah nullifies these limitations. This is similar to Shabbos, which is described as "an unlimited border." Moshe explained the Torah in 70 languages so that Bnei Yisrael could spread its light even into these limited rivers. This is also reflected in the verse, “The greatness of His deed He told His nation to give them the inheritance of the nations.” Although Hashem could have immediately given all lands to Bnei Yisrael, the primary gift is their ability to draw these separated rivers back to their source in the Torah.
(Devarim 1:23) “And it was good in my eyes” (to send spies to Eretz Yisrael). The question is asked, why is this mentioned in the rebuke that Moshe is giving Bnei Yisrael? It seems that this too is a reason for rebuke, for Bnei Yisrael had actually caused it to appear a good idea in Moshe’s eyes! This is apparent from the pasuk (Devarim 1:12), when Moshe says: “How can I carry the burden of the nation on my own?” Rashi explains that Bnei Yisrael were elevated over and above their judges (their leaders were held accountable for the actions of Bnei Yisrael if they were able to prevent them). Therefore, when Moshe was the leader, the sin of the nation also affected him, which is why he appointed chiefs.<br>Here it states that they all came together in a mixture (in an unorganized and disrespectful fashion). Therefore, when they all came asking to send spies, they actually caused Moshe to think it was a good idea. This is something each person needs to know: their actions reach the leaders above and below! This awareness should cause a person to guard their actions properly.
Moshe mentioned the sins of the previous generation in his rebuke because each generation needs to repair the sins of the ones before them. Just as they inherit the merits left by the previous generation, they also inherit the responsibility to rectify their sins. This is the idea behind “visiting the iniquity of the parents on their children.”<br>Therefore, Moshe reviewed all the sins so that they could be subsequently repaired. This is also why it is said that any generation in which the Beis Hamikdash is not rebuilt is as if it was destroyed in their days. If we would repair the previous sins that caused the destruction, the Beis Hamikdash would be immediately rebuilt.
In the fortieth year, Moshe clearly spoke all the things that Hashem commanded him. The Gemara (Avoda Zara 5b) states that a person does not fully understand the mind of his rebbe until 40 years. During the wilderness period, Moshe's words were gradually drawing Bnei Yisrael closer, but they did not fully comprehend them. Now, after 40 years, they were properly close to him, allowing Moshe to speak “all that Hashem had commanded.”<br>Therefore, Moshe reviewed the entire Torah with them, which is why it is called משנה תורה (a repetition of the Torah). According to the Chidushei Harim, Hashem would teach Moshe the Torah and they would then revise it together. Moshe could not fully comprehend Hashem's words to the same extent as Hashem, so they revised it to align Moshe's understanding with Hashem's intent. This ensured that Moshe’s comprehension was as close as possible to Hashem’s.<br>Similarly, Bnei Yisrael could not fully grasp Moshe's understanding. Therefore, Moshe revised the Torah with them to match their level of comprehension. Despite this, it is stated that “All that Hashem commanded” means they now reached the level of understanding of their Rebbe. This is the idea of אלה הדברים (these are the words), indicating a new and superior level of communication compared to the previous 40 years.

With G-d's Blessing Vaetchanan Shabbat Nachamu
The Midrash discusses the ten different types of prayer, which the Sfas Emes explains are methods to reach true tefila (prayer). The actual term "tefila" is not included among these types, indicating that true tefila is a higher state. The Midrash mentions that having correct intentions during prayer is a sign of achieving true tefila. This may seem puzzling, as correct intentions should constitute tefila itself. However, true preparation for tefila also comes as a gift from Hashem, as indicated by the verse "prepare their hearts," meaning that the ability to pour out one's heart to Hashem is itself a divine gift.<br>The languages or types of prayer are preparatory steps, such as shouting or expressing bitterness, leading to true tefila. Rashi and the Midrash note that even tzadikim (righteous individuals), despite their merits, prefer their prayers to be accepted as a free gift from Hashem. The Kotzker Rebbe questioned why tzadikim, who are not owed anything by Hashem, request gifts. The explanation is that all expressions of tefila are ways to reach true tefila, and tzadikim, through their righteousness, reach this stage through their preparations. They seek to approach prayer not based on their good deeds but as a gift from Hashem.<br>Moshe's use of the term "ואתחנן" (I beseeched) highlights this concept, indicating that his beseeching was a preparation for true tefila. The verse "A man arranges his thoughts, but what he says depends on Hashem" (Tehillim 16) further illustrates that while one can prepare for tefila, the actual prayer is dependent on Hashem. Those who reach the level of pouring out their hearts to Hashem pray solely for the sake of heaven, often forgetting their initial requests, and instead, Hashem guides their words to request what they truly need. This underscores that true tefila is a divine gift, achieved through sincere preparation and humility.
The Midrash on "Shma Yisrael" quotes Tehillim (73): "Who do I have in heaven, and on earth, I desire nothing besides You." This means that just as in heaven, there is no one but Hashem, so too on earth, one should desire only Hashem, reflecting the teaching of the Ba'al Hatanya.<br>The verse implies having no desire other than for Hashem. "With all your heart" means recognizing that every feeling and desire stems from Hashem, nullifying our will to His. We should be like an axe in the hand of the chopper, fully guided by Hashem.<br>"Hashem is one" means that He is the only true existence, and everything in the world is an extension of Him, though hidden. Therefore, our love for Hashem should permeate every feeling and aspect of our being, as everything is truly Him.
The Midrash teaches that after reciting the Shema, one should proceed to the Shemone Esrei prayer. This highlights that while idols may seem close, they remain unresponsive, whereas Hashem, though seemingly distant, is always near and responsive when we call upon Him.<br>This concept means that through our prayers, we draw closer to Hashem and reveal hidden spirituality, leading to Hashem revealing His glory to us. The Shemone Esrei following the Shema emphasizes Hashem's oneness and existence, allowing us to establish a connection with Him through our prayers. The clarity of this connection determines the acceptance and efficacy of our prayers.<br>Reciting the Shemone Esrei after the "geula" (redemption) blessing following the Shema signifies that redemption comes from recognizing Hashem's presence even in challenges. By acknowledging this truth and the redemption from Mitzrayim, we affirm that all difficulties are sustained by Hashem. This understanding allows us to request the revelation of Hashem's presence through our prayers, bringing redemption. Similarly, mentioning the Exodus during Kiddush on Shabbat emphasizes that Shabbat embodies redemption, testifying that everything is sustained by Hashem's life force.
The Midrash cites the verse from Tehillim (69:14), "And I am a prayer to You in an auspicious time," illustrating that the gates of prayer (Tefila), like those of a Mikva, can be open or closed, while the gates of repentance (Teshuva) are always open, resembling the unceasing expanse of the sea.<br>Tefila involves gathering all one's desires towards an inner point, representing Hashem's life force, known as "Avodah Shebalev" (service of the heart). However, Teshuva is about reconnecting to a higher source from which one's life force is drawn, beyond the reach of sin. This higher source, the will of Hashem, is always accessible and cannot be tainted by sin, requiring complete attachment and nullification to it.<br>While Tefila awakens one's internal connection, it can be hindered by sin. In contrast, Teshuva, which involves returning to an untainted higher source, remains perpetually open. Thus, through Teshuva, one can always reconnect to Hashem, regardless of past transgressions.

Section 2

5632
The Midrash provides a sign indicating true prayer - if one has focused their heart, etc. And in the section "Who is a great nation," it states that Hashem is distant yet near, etc. It connects redemption to prayer, [explaining] that prayer is heard, etc. This is because without intent, it is not considered prayer at all. The explanation is that one must be directed and draw themselves close to prayer, becoming affected and transformed through this prayer. This is what is meant by "in all our calling to Him" - for Hashem is close to a person commensurate with their calling and the person's drawing close to Him. It is like the reflection in water, etc. <br>This is the juxtaposition of redemption to prayer. Through knowing and remembering that everything is from Hashem, and nullifying oneself to the root and source of life that is from Hashem, this is a redemption that every Jew has - the redemption from Egypt and all other exiles. Even though Hashem redeems and elevates the person to higher levels, the person must remember the origins of it all. As it states, "Your eyes saw my unformed substance" - meaning to be considered in His eyes as when one was just an unformed body, without any form or motion at all. Through this, Hashem has mercy on the person and draws close to them, as mentioned above. This is the meaning of "You have begun to show Your servant" - from here they learned to begin all praise of the Omnipresent, to remember the origins and root of everything, as mentioned.<br>

Section 3

5633
With G-d's Blessing Vaetchanan Shabbat Nachamu
The Sfas Emes emphasizes that the primary idea of tefillah (prayer) is having the correct intentions. While tefillah is often motivated by personal needs, the highest level of tefillah is when one prays for the sake of the tefillah itself, rather than solely for personal requests. Even if a person begins praying with their own needs in mind, they should shift their focus to the glory of Hashem. By doing so, one is more likely to have their requests answered. This concept is exemplified by the type of tefillah called "Bitzur," which arises from personal difficulties but connects the individual to the essence of tefillah, leading to divine response.<br>To understand the importance of starting Shemoneh Esrei with praise for Hashem, we must recognize that while certain decrees may be upon a person, Hashem's infinite mercy and humility allow for these decrees to be changed through prayer. This is beyond our comprehension but is demonstrated by Moshe Rabbeinu, who continued to pray to enter Eretz Yisrael despite knowing he couldn't. This shows deep faith, illustrating that nothing is impossible for Hashem. As stated in Brachos 10a, "Even if a sharp sword is on a person's neck, he should not hold back from requesting mercy." By beginning tefillah with praise, one can merit having their prayers answered and decrees changed.<br>The concept of Hashem's humility, despite His sovereignty, teaches us how we should act, connecting to His ways. Our daily tefilot testify that everything comes from Hashem, and we must request everything from Him, awakening a merciful and auspicious time that renews the world's life force. The Midrash explains that prayer times are auspicious (Devarim Rabbah 2:12), and by including personal needs in the daily prayers, one can bring about an answer. This is why prayers are recited both in the morning and evening, and why silent prayer should not be loud, as doing so indicates a lack of emuna (faith). Hashem knows our hearts and understands our needs without us needing to explicitly state them.
The Haftorah (Yeshayahu 40:6-7) states, "A voice says, 'Cry out.' And I said, 'What shall I cry?' 'All people are like grass, and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.'" This passage conveys that everything in this world contains a spark of Hashem. This divine spark is the "voice" that emanates from everything for the sake of Hashem, even though we cannot hear it externally. However, once the external husks fall away—representing the physicalities of this world—the word of Hashem is revealed, embodying the primary internal essence of everything.<br>A person must believe that their primary life force comes from this divine spark. Man was created to elevate everything to its source of life force by performing all actions for the sake of Heaven. The Zohar explains that one's evil inclination can be compared to iron, which, when burnt in a fire, becomes part of the fire, and its hardness dissipates. Similarly, through the fire of the Torah, one can nullify the strength of the evil inclination. The more a person understands that there is no place devoid of G-dliness, the more it helps to nullify externalities.<br>Additionally, wicked thoughts, representing the evil inclination, are there to be repaired by removing them from one's mind, thereby rectifying negative thoughts. This is related to the idea that "There are many thoughts in the heart of man…but the plan of Hashem will endure" (Mishlei 19:21). When a person removes these wicked thoughts, it brings them closer to Hashem and the good inclination. The Midrash explains that Hashem is near and far, meaning one can bring oneself close to Hashem's life force, which resides within every individual of Bnei Yisrael.

Section 4

5634
The Midrash states that part of the mitzvah of tefillah is to pray three times daily: evening, morning, and afternoon. Furthermore, the Gemara explains that one should always first praise Hashem before beginning their prayers. Although it might seem that the primary purpose of tefillah is to make requests to Hashem for one's needs, our sages teach that the set prayers at specific times are even more precious to Hashem. The main purpose of tefillah is to draw new life force into nature and time. The idea of starting tefillah by praising Hashem is based on the concept that everything was created for His glory. Within nature, Hashem's dominion is not evident, and it is man's role to uncover and organize the creation to testify to His sovereignty. As a person aligns their thoughts and being with the praise of Hashem, they can influence all of creation to follow suit. This is why daily blessings, praises, and Pesukei DeZimra are instituted—to organize and clarify the creation, renewing the source of life force that transcends time and nature. This renewal is particularly significant at key changes in time: evening, morning, and afternoon.<br>This concept is also linked to the idea of redemption before the Shemoneh Esrei prayer. By correctly organizing one's thoughts and revealing Hashem's glory, a form of redemption occurs, as the divine life force is freed from its concealment in nature and time. This is why we mention the exodus from Egypt daily, symbolizing a continuous revelation and redemption. The extent of this redemption correlates with one's efforts and abilities. This principle is reflected in the idea that "if you listen to the old, you will merit to hear the new," indicating that through revealing what we can, we gain further insight and revelation. <br>Shabbos and the weekdays exemplify this concept. During the six days of creation, Hashem's work parallels the praise of Hashem in tefillah. Similarly, our work during the week involves organizing the natural world. Shabbos, however, represents tefillah and renewal, bringing a new light from the upper worlds and a taste of the world to come. The preparation and praise during the week lead to redemption and tefillah on Shabbos. This is why on Shabbos, mentioning redemption before tefillah is not required, as Shabbos itself embodies this energy. Weekday prayers, through personal effort and heart alignment, reveal Hashem's glory, fulfilling the verse, "it is you, Yisrael, in whom I (Hashem) become glorified." The Midrash concludes that correct intention in prayer ensures that the source of redemption, the divine life force, is revealed and prayers are answered.

Section 5





The prayer of Moshe our teacher peace be upon him to enter the land and was not answered positively. It seems that it was to elevate all the prayers of the Children of Israel that weren't able [the prayers] to go up. All those ineffective prayers had a fixing needed, and this happened through this prayer. And it was all with a certain measure, since Moshe our teacher peace be upon him sacrificed his life for the Children of Israel and even this request of going up to the Land of Israel was also only for the goodness of the Children of Israel. Because he knew that if those prayers did not make it in, the Children of Israel would destroy their own ways, as it is written "if while I am still living etc" (Deut. 31:27). Therefore, this prayer was helpful to the Children of Israel, even if his request was not responded positively, the prayer was not for nothing, God forbid.

Section 6



Section 7



Section 8



(Deuteronomy.5.19) "The Lord spoke those words to all of your congregation." The word 'all of' seems superfluous. The implication: 
This verse applies to all congregations, whenever Jews gather, in all times. As the Sages said, (Pirkei_Avot.3.6) "When ten sit together and occupy themselves with Torah, the Shechinah abides among them." 
This reality came into being at the time the Torah was given. As it says (Deuteronomy.4.10), "Gather the people to Me that I may let them hear My words" -- this was the needed preparation and illumination so that every gathering of Jews for all generations has the ability to awaken those words. As it says (Deuteronomy.5.19, see Targum): "A mighty voice that never stopped." 
Just as the 'Ten Utterances' form the foundation and structure for all of Creation, so too the Ten Commandments are the foundation and structure for all the future of the Jewish People. The only difference is that the 'Utterances' were by the will of the Creator alone, while the Commandments were also by the readiness of the Jewish People, when they said "We will do" first, before "We will hear," and gave their lives for the glory of His blessed Name. Accordingly, today, as well, this power is awakened by man's readiness. 
Similarly, within the individual person, when he gathers all his powers to submit willingly to God, he is included under 'all of your congregation.' Thus we find (Pirkei_Avot.3.6) "And how do we know that even if one [sits and studies, the Shechinah is present]."

Section 9



Explanation of “and you shall love”: “Whom else have I in heaven?” The philosophers raise a difficult: how is it appropriate to command love? But the truth is that B'nei Yisrael have in their core a connection and deep attachment to the One God. And that is what meant by what’s written “Whom else have I in heaven?” He is the Source; only below are their other wills. And through the daily acceptance of the yoke of heaven, “And having You, I want no one on earth.” And through this we can awaken love in this world as well. 

Section 10



Section 11



Section 12



Section 13



The verse says (Deuteronomy.6.5-6) "You shall love the Lord your God... And these words shall be upon your heart." Sifri and Rashi explain: "What is this love? By taking these words to heart, you will come to recognize the Holy One blessed be He, and cleave to His ways."
This means: this love is the Torah, and the Holy One has ingrained these words into each Jewish soul. As it says (Deuteronomy.5.19), "The Lord spoke these words to all of your congregation... a mighty voice that *never stopped*." For all time, every Jew has the ability to find in his heart words of Torah. As it says (Megillah.6b) "If someone says to you 'I have struggled and I have found success,' -- believe him."
This is *the fire of love* of which it says (Song_of_Songs.8.7) "Many waters cannot quench the love." As we find (Sotah 21a), "A sin extinguishes a mitzvah, but does not extinguish Torah." (The Sages (Vayikra_Rabbah.2.3) similarly expounded the verse (Jeremiah.31.20) "A darling child to Me is Ephraim... whenever I just speak with him" -- "sufficient is My Speaking that I placed within him.") And it says (Jeremiah.23.29) "My words are like fire, declares the Lord."
This Torah that God gave us is testimony that He loves us, as it says (in the blessing before the morning Shema) "Who chooses His nation Israel with love." And with this power we can find love in our hearts for God's blessed Name.
This love is not dependent on anything, as it says (Deuteronomy 7.7-8), "Not because you are more numerous than all the nations did the Lord want you and choose you... but by the Lord's love for you." That means it is love that is unconditional -- it is simply (Deuteronomy.32.9) "for the Lord's portion is His people."
We find that in a time of sinning it says (Jeremiah.12.8), "She raised her voice against Me, therefore I rejected her" -- the hatred is only by cause. When the cause becomes canceled, the hatred disappears. The love, in contrast, is intrinsic, absolute. So it says (Hoshea.14.5), "I will love them freely."
In the haftarah ('Comfort, comfort My people') it says (Isaiah.40.6-8), "What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass." The Sages teach (Perek Shirah 1.49) that the fly declares this when Jews are not occupied with Torah. And the response: "Grass withers, flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever!" For no sin can extinguish Torah.
Sins cause the love to be hidden temporarily. But ultimately, "Grass withers, flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever." 

Eikev



Section 1

5631
The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 3:1) explains the verse “And if you obey my rules” using the analogy of a candelabra made of joints. Rashi, citing the Midrash (Tanchuma Eikev 1:1), explains the verse in Tehillim (49:6), “The sins of my heels do I fear.” David feared the small sins that people tend to overlook. Hashem created the world so that man can connect and uplift all of creation to Him, as stated, “I created everything for My honor.” The word תשמעון (obey) implies a deeper level of hearing, to perceive the divine light within everything. Bnei Yisrael must ensure their actions are connected to this inner light, drawing Hashem’s word from every aspect of creation.<br>This concept applies especially to the easy mitzvos, which one performs regularly. Each action should be for the sake of Hashem, as everything contains a mitzvah to either do or abstain. The heel, representing the lowest level, is more hidden from Hashem’s light. Hashem’s ultimate desire is for everything in creation to be connected, from the highest to the lowest levels. Therefore, one must be cautious with small mitzvos just as with great ones. This is like the candelabra made of joints, where connecting all parts completes it. The purpose of creation is for everything to glorify Hashem, and mitzvah (commandment) is rooted in the word צותא (connection).<br>The Gemara (Berachot 33b) discusses the verse, “What does Hashem require of you? Only to fear Him.” It asks why fear of Heaven is presented as something easy. The Gemara explains that for Moshe, it was easy. The Sfas Emes teaches that fear of Heaven is a preparation for attaining love and connection to Hashem. Fear of Heaven must precede love. This proves that everything is in Heaven’s hands, except for fear of Heaven, which is closest to man and therefore easier. A person must realize that fear of Heaven becomes easier with greater desire, progressing step by step. For Moshe, perfect in his traits, it was easy, akin to borrowing a readily available item. This also explains the requirement of making 100 blessings daily, as it demonstrates that our entire life force is in Hashem’s hands, and we bless Him for everything, great and small.
The Midrash Tanchuma (Eikev 5:1) explains “All of the commandment that I command you today” (Devarim 8:1) by linking it to Mishlei 4:22, “They (the words of Torah) are life to him who finds them.” The word למוצאיהם (finds them) can be read as למוציאהם (expresses them), meaning Torah must be verbalized, not just understood. Additionally, “All of the commandment” teaches that one must complete a mitzvah, as it is credited to the finisher.<br>The life force of everything comes from Torah and mitzvos. More toil in Torah brings more life force, connecting one to the source of life. Mishlei 7:1, “Keep my mitzvos with you,” means each mitzvah leaves a bit of closeness to Hashem. Perform mitzvos not out of habit, but with connection to their inner part.<br>“All the commandment” (Devarim 8:1) implies extracting maximum gain from a mitzvah by accessing its inner energy. Devarim 11:13, “You shall hear תשמעו my commandments,” suggests mitzvos produce a sound. Each mitzvah is connected to a specific limb and reminds the person to perform it. However, the mitzvah’s voice is heard in proportion to one’s desire to connect to its inner part.
Each member of Bnei Yisrael experiences rest on Shabbos, free from the week's subjugation to the evil inclination. This rest serves as a reminder of the exodus from Mitzrayim, symbolizing our liberation from negative forces. It provides a taste of the world to come, as our sages explained.<br>For those who do not yet feel this rest, they should approach Shabbos with a sense of generosity and faith, acting as if their work is complete for the sake of Hashem. Through this act of emunah (faith), one can achieve a rest of truth and faith, genuinely believing in the rest Shabbos provides.<br>By fostering this emunah, one can ultimately experience the true rest that Shabbos offers, leading to a complete and perfect rest, as described in the prayer: "a rest of love and peace, a rest of truth and faith, a complete rest that you desire."

Re'eh



Section 1

5631
The Chidushei Harim explained the verse (Devarim 11:26), “See, I give to you today the blessing and the curse,” as follows: Deep within each Jew is the inherent ability to discern and choose only the blessing, unaffected by the physical world's pull. This is reflected in the daily blessing, “Who gives understanding to the rooster,” signifying the ability to distinguish between good and evil.<br>The Midrash further states that Hashem commands us, “And you shall choose life,” teaching that anything Hashem commands becomes a reality. Therefore, from this verse, one can draw the strength to always choose good and choose life.
The Midrash on the blessings and curses teaches that the curses should be read continuously, without interruption. This means not being repulsed by rebuke or making it thorny. Hashem's intention is not to curse but to prompt repentance, turning curses into blessings.<br>The Zohar echoes this: accepting suffering with love and returning to Hashem transforms it into "sufferings of love" (יסורים של אהבה). This aligns with the pasuk, “See, I have given you the blessing and the curse,” showing that it's within our power to convert curses into blessings. The Midrash advises not to view curses as separate from blessings. Instead, understand that curses are meant to lead to blessings through repentance, integrating them into the path towards good.
The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 4:4) states that Hashem said, "My candle - The Torah is in your hands, and your candle - your life is in My hands." Everything in this world has a life force from Hashem, but this inner life is hidden. It is the duty of Bnei Yisrael to reveal this inner life through mitzvos. Each action has a mitzvah connected to it, either a positive commandment or a negative one, elevating everything to Hashem.<br>This is the meaning of "my candle is in your hands," as man must illuminate these hidden places, as if they are imprisoned, until he overcomes and brings light to the darkness. This point is the blessing itself, as mentioned in “I give you today the blessing and the curse.” When one connects to this inner point, it becomes evident that it is a blessing.<br>The command "see" means to nullify oneself to this point. Similarly, on Shabbos, Hashem blessed the day, meaning the concept of Shabbos is to be nullified and included in the source where the blessing resides. Our sages taught that Shalom (peace) is the vessel that holds blessing. This point from Hashem gives everything existence and is called Shalom, which signifies the completeness of all creation.

Shoftim



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing Shoftim. Not written in order. Briefly
The Chidushei Harim explains that the pasuk, "You shall place judges and watchmen at all your gates that Hashem your G-d gives you," teaches that any spiritual opening or awareness gained through effort is ultimately a gift from Hashem.<br>One must guard moments of strong desire and will, considered 'gates' to the inner self, ensuring they remain dedicated to Hashem and not diverted by the yetzer hara. Actions should be done with mindfulness, not out of habit.<br>The more one maintains calmness and acknowledges everything is from Hashem, the more they will experience spiritual openings. As Zemirot states, "I will sing songs to enter the openings," meaning that praising Hashem removes obstructions and allows entry into these gates. This is the purpose of Pesukei Dezimra before prayer, to dispel the yetzer hara and prepare for sincere tefila.
"Tzedek, tzedek tirdof" ("You shall surely pursue righteousness") teaches that the quest for righteousness and truth is endless. Even when one attains a level of truth, they must seek deeper understanding, as Hashem's signature is truth. True righteousness involves becoming wholly dedicated to Hashem. The word "emet" (truth) spans the Hebrew alphabet, symbolizing its foundational nature. The Rav of Pershisca emphasized that righteousness must be pursued truthfully, without deceit. While "sheker" (falsehood) is unstable, "emet" has a solid base, showing that only truth endures.
Before battle, the kohen would say "Hear Yisrael, you are coming to battle, do not be afraid." Rashi explains that even if the only merit we have is reciting "Shema Yisrael," it is enough to save us. This means that recognizing Hashem's Oneness—that everything is from Him—is crucial.<br>When this belief is firmly established, no force can oppose it, as the negative forces only gain power from our lack of emuna (faith). This concept was demonstrated during the exodus from Egypt, where Hashem revealed that even the hidden aspects of exile were under His control, as translated by Onkelos: "I will be revealed."<br>Similarly, in Tehillim 27, "When the war arises against me, in this (בזאת) I trust," refers to the idea that nothing exists without Hashem's life force. The term זאת (this) symbolizes this awareness, guiding everything from Hashem.
Rashi explains that one who is scared due to sins should not go to battle, as his fear could affect others. The Chidushei Harim states that being fearless indicates forgiveness, as distancing from sin brings one closer to Hashem. The Sfas Emes clarifies that true fear of Hashem means one cannot imagine their past sins, as they are removed from their consciousness. This is shown by Sara, who denied laughing at the prophecy due to her complete teshuva.<br>True teshuva transforms a person, making them unable to comprehend their past sins. Even minor distractions during mitzvot show a lapse, but if one fears this, they should not go to battle, as true repentance removes any connection to the sin.
Whenever there is a time considered a time of closeness to Hashem, such as during Elul or seudas shlishis, it signifies a unique opportunity for individuals to bring themselves closer to Hashem. Although Hashem transcends time, these moments are special from our perspective, allowing us to connect with Hashem through genuine inner desire.<br>Hashem is always willing to connect with us, reflecting our efforts like water reflects an image. When we realize our holy spark is buried in physicality and awaken a heartfelt desire for closeness, this stirs great kindness from above. The more we awaken mercy within ourselves, the more divine mercy is aroused in response.

Section 2

5632
"You shall put judges and watchmen at all your gates" refers to personal growth, emphasizing the need to monitor what enters and leaves oneself. One must always measure their feelings and actions, whether large or small, with true judgment. The "judges" signify the intellect, while the "watchmen" represent control, ensuring that one's intellect and knowledge are subjected to Hashem's command through fear of Him. By using true judgment and deep understanding (da'as), one can reach a level where their knowledge is nullified to Hashem's will.

Section 3



Section 4




"When you go out to battle and see a greater nation than you, do not fear them, for Hashem your G-d is with you, who took you out of Mitzrayim." The Ohr HaChaim explains that "from you" means the power of negative forces comes from one's actions. The Sfas Emes adds that remembering Yitzias Mitzrayim, which prepared for all exiles, helps us draw on this redemption anytime. Mentioning the exodus daily helps awaken this redemption. A person exempted from battle due to sin teaches that feeling in battle means one has the power to fight. David HaMelech's words, "If a battle rises against me, in this I trust," imply that recognizing a battle shows one has the strength to overcome it.

Section 5



Section 6



The Ohr HaChaim explains that when facing a greater force, the negative powers stem from one's own actions. However, the pasuk reassures that Hashem is with you. The Sfas Emes elaborates that feeling discomfort and struggle in battling negative forces is a positive sign, indicating that Hashem is not allowing a person to remain in their sins. These battles in mitzvot and prayer serve to repair sins. Similarly, the exile in Mitzrayim was beneficial, as it allowed Bnei Yisrael to rectify their sins. Through the exile, they repaired all the sins within their souls, as explained in the holy books.

Ki Teitzei



Section 1

5631
The verse "When you go out to battle your enemy and Hashem your G-d will give him into your hand and you will capture his captives" can also refer to the internal battle against the yetzer hara (evil inclination). In everything, there is a hidden life force from Hashem, and it requires effort and struggle during the weekdays to uncover this point. Reaching Shabbos reveals that Hashem sustains everything, as Bnei Yisrael testify to the creation of the world, sustained by the Ten Sayings.<br>However, during the weekdays, this requires a battle. The revelation one receives on Shabbos is proportional to the effort put in during the week, as stated, "One who toils on erev Shabbos will eat on Shabbos." Erev Shabbos represents the mixture of Shabbos' holiness within the weekday. One must recognize that even the strength to overcome the yetzer hara is from Hashem, as the verse states, "He will give him into your hand." Despite appearing as if one triumphs through personal effort, it is Hashem who assists.<br>The concept is that every good action and mitzvah involves both the action and returning it to Hashem, acknowledging that it is all from Him. Even if one works hard and achieves great things, the mission is incomplete without returning it to Hashem, recognizing His role. This is what "capturing a captive" means: realizing that all success is from Hashem and returning that acknowledgment to Him, completing the mission.
Rashi explains that the Torah permitted taking a captive woman in battle to prevent unlawful actions. Allowing this mitigates the temptation, reducing the influence of the sitra achra (negative force). As Tanya (Chap 8) notes, forbidden actions tie a person to negativity, but permitted actions lessen this hold.<br>By following the Torah's allowance, a person can eventually disconnect from the negative aspects of the action, symbolized by Rashi's comment that one will eventually hate the captive woman. This approach is more manageable than doing teshuva for forbidden actions. Permitted actions enable connection to holiness, whereas forbidden actions require a purification process.<br>The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 6:3) highlights that Torah and mitzvos connect a person to Hashem. Performing actions for the sake of heaven elevates even the physical aspects of mitzvos. Similarly, mundane actions can become mitzvos when done for the sake of heaven, aligning with the commandment to be holy (Kedoshim tihyu) and to guard one's eyes.
The Midrash on the commandment of sending away the mother bird highlights that, although the mitzvah demonstrates Hashem's mercy, one must perform it because it is Hashem's commandment, not merely out of recognition of His kindness. The Gemara (Brachot 33) supports this, stating that if one says, "Just as You are merciful on the mother bird, be merciful on us," they are silenced. This is because it implies that Hashem's commandments are based on human logic and kindness, rather than divine decrees.<br>People asked the Sfas Emes how the commandment could be based on Hashem's kindness when the Gemara suggests it is only a decree. He explained that Hashem's traits (middos) involve tzimtzum, where infinite concepts are brought down to a physical level. This allows humans to connect to Hashem through physical actions, though the essence of Hashem remains incomprehensible. A gezeira (decree) is a piece cut from the original source, not an act of mercy in its earthly form, though its heavenly source is full of compassion.<br>Therefore, while the mitzvah's source is in heaven and rooted in kindness, our limited human comprehension perceives it as a decree. This is why one cannot invoke Hashem's mercy by referencing the mother bird's mitzvah; our understanding is confined to what Hashem has revealed through tzimtzum, making the mitzvah a decree rather than an act of mercy in our perception.
The pasuk (Devarim 23:10) commands how to act modestly during battle, emphasizing protection during impurity. The Torah says, "ונשמרת" (you will be protected), rather than "ושמרת" (you shall protect yourself), implying that the act of going to battle itself provides protection. This applies both to national battles and individual battles against the yetzer hara (evil inclination).<br>The Sifri explains that one should go to battle with the entire camp, which Chazal interpret as the limbs of a person. This means gathering all one's desires and soul to devote to Hashem's will. By doing so, one is automatically protected ("ונשמרת"), as there is no room for confusion or distraction from the yetzer hara. This advice is also given by the Ba'al Shem Tov.<br>The pasuk continues, "Hashem your G-d goes among you" (מתהלך), indicating that it is within our power to awaken the divine life force within our soul. Chazal teach that one's heart should not see anything impure, emphasizing the importance of not thinking or seeing anything not focused on Hashem. This aligns with the commandment "you shall be holy" (קדושים תהיו).

Section 2

5632
The Midrash on the pasuk in Mishlei (1:9) states, “The mitzvot are a beautiful wreath (לוית) for your head.” The word לוית can also mean to accompany, indicating that mitzvot connect everything to Hashem. Rashi explains that the Torah permitted marrying a captive woman because otherwise people would transgress. One might ask why Hashem didn't simply remove the desire altogether. The answer is that permitting it helps release a person from the desire to do evil. The term אסור (forbidden) also means tied up, as sins can bind a person to negativity.<br>By allowing this action, the Torah helps a person see it objectively. They can then decide that if it were forbidden, they wouldn't do it, thus disconnecting from the Yetzer Hara. This principle applies to any worldly activity: if one resolves not to engage in it unless it aligns with Hashem's will, they avoid becoming overly attached to the physicality of the action.
The Midrash states that Hashem didn't reveal the rewards for most mitzvos, except for the easy mitzvah of sending away the mother bird (shiluach haken) and the difficult mitzvah of honoring one's parents, both rewarded with long life. This raises the question: why should an easy and difficult mitzvah have the same reward? The answer is that people naturally desire to perform difficult mitzvos more, as the Midrash suggests that if rewards were known, people would only pursue the difficult ones for greater reward. Therefore, fulfilling an easy mitzvah is actually more challenging due to the lack of apparent reward, making their rewards equal.

Section 3

5633
The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 6:3) on Mishlei 1:9 explains that mitzvot accompany us in all we do. The mitzvot Bnei Yisrael perform are accepted by Hashem due to the chein (grace) of the Creator's work, as it states, “And Hashem saw all that He made, and it was very good.” This chein sustains the world and our purpose is to awaken this divine desire.<br>Each mitzvah reveals the chein within everything. The 248 positive commandments correspond to the 248 limbs of the human body. When a limb performs a mitzvah, it becomes an acquisition of Hashem, testifying that its purpose is to fulfill His will. This brings out the chein and aligns with the Mishnah's teaching that everything Hashem created is for His glory. By accepting the yoke of Heaven, one becomes Hashem’s possession. When this chein is awakened, one is saved in all matters, as seen with Moshe Rabeinu, who sought to find favor (chein) in Hashem's eyes. This chein exists in everything and needs to be activated through our actions.
(Devarim 23:24) “Guard what comes out of your mouth” emphasizes the importance of guarding one’s speech. The mouth is the innermost limb, expressing the inner breath and essence of a person, thus requiring extra protection. The mitzvah of learning Torah serves to protect the mouth. Each mitzvah corresponds to a specific limb, and Torah study, which applies day and night, parallels the constant need to guard one’s speech. The root of man’s life force lies in the inner breath, and guarding this breath (speech) is fundamental to all actions.<br>Speech distinguishes humans from other creatures, as indicated by Onkelos’ translation of “a living being” (Bereishis 2:7) as “a speaking spirit.” This unique capability should be dedicated to Hashem. The creation of speech is a wondrous gift, meant to praise Hashem, as it states, “They will tell my praise” (Yeshaya 43:21). While it may be challenging to express oneself perfectly before Hashem, one should at least guard against improper speech.

Section 4

5634
The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk “When you will go out to battle” (Devarim 21:10) to mean that when a person experiences some freedom from the evil inclination, it is the ideal time to fight it. This aligns with the command regarding Amalek: “When Hashem gives you rest from your enemies, wipe out the memory of Amalek” (Devarim 25:19). Demonstrating hatred for the evil inclination during these moments shows true resolve. By doing so, “Hashem will place them in your hands.”<br>The Zohar Chadash explains this battle as one against the evil inclination, fought with the power of the Torah: “I have created the evil inclination, I have created the Torah its antidote” (Kiddushin 30b). Rashi (Devarim 21:11) similarly notes that the Torah addresses combating the evil inclination. The Torah, being lofty, is hidden from most but is presented in these words to empower us against the evil inclination, which confuses us with baseless imaginations. The neshama, however, has a solid base and can clarify the truth from these imaginations. The Torah uses these examples to aid us in this struggle.<br>“And you will take a captive” refers to reclaiming the sparks of holiness taken by the evil inclination. Recognizing that we are created with two inclinations for Hashem’s glory, the true path is to use moments of clarity to feel embarrassment for wasted time, avoiding haughtiness. This embarrassment leads to deeper repentance and repair of past transgressions. During the weekdays, when confusion from the evil inclination is strong, one should feel embarrassed for being distant from the concept of “Shabbos.” This humility, brought about by the nullification of time, helps one merit the level of Shabbos, as stated in the Zohar, בראשית spells ירא שבת בשת (fear of Shabbos and embarrassment).
Regarding the pasuk “She has called out” (Devarim 22:24), it implies that one who can call out for help (to Hashem) and does not is considered sinning willfully, for Hashem hears everyone's prayer. Even if one feels they cannot call out, if they are prepared to do so with all their heart, Hashem hears them, as it states, “Before they call out, I will answer.”<br>Such a call is heard even more. Our sages explained that the scream of the neshama leaving the body is like a scream that goes from one end of the world to the other. This is because the desire to resist and scream, even if not physically possible, makes the scream resonate everywhere. When one can actually scream, it eventually stops, but a scream in potential is “heard” everywhere. This is similar to the verse “A stone will call from the wall” (Chavakuk 2:11), where resistance is considered shouting.<br>The Ramban questioned why the girl should be punished if she did not have the understanding to call out. Yet Hashem grants understanding to those prepared to call out. In the case of a girl raped in the field who did not call out, she is not punished because there was no one to hear her. However, the implication is that there is some level of sin for not meriting to actually cry out.
“You shall not see your brother's lost ox... you shall surely return it to him” (Devarim 22:1). This can be interpreted to mean that if you see your friend straying from the correct path, you should help return him to it. The word שור (ox) can also mean “looking” or observing. Thus, if you observe a negative action, it needs to be corrected.<br>The way to do this is through personal repentance. Holy texts explain that whatever one sees is a reflection of oneself. Therefore, when you see negativity in someone else, it implies a need for your own repentance. This act of repentance will, in turn, inspire your friend to repent, as indicated by the phrase השב תשיבם (you shall surely return them).<br>Klal Yisrael is one entity; when one person tarnishes their holiness, it affects the whole. As our sages say, if one merits, he receives his portion and that of his friend in the world to come. However, one must return what is lost to its rightful owner. The phrase “That is lost from him, and you find it, You shall not hide yourself from it” means you should not ignore your friend's loss of holiness due to sin. It should be unbearable to see a friend lose their share of holiness.
"When you go out to battle, protect yourself from all evil… There shall be an area for you outside your camp where you may relieve yourself" (Devarim 23:11-13). This can be understood as advice on how to repair one’s actions. Even if one feels unable to correct all their actions, everyone in Yisrael has good deeds. One should gather these few good points and protect them from being tainted by evil. Through these small merits, one gains power and a handle (יד) to influence even areas outside their immediate scope. A mitzvah brings along another mitzvah.<br>Tehillim 37:16 states, "The little that the tzadik has is better than the abundance of the wicked." The evil inclination works through abundance, adding many small sins. The tzadik repairs this by valuing the little good they can do for Hashem. By deeply connecting to these small merits, one can ultimately repair everything else appropriately.

Section 5

5635
The Midrash explains that even if a baby is born circumcised, we still draw a drop of blood to commemorate Avraham Avinu's covenant. This is hinted at in the Torah with the double expression “Himol yimol,” indicating two types of bris. Although the baby lacks a foreskin, each member of Bnei Yisrael has an intrinsic connection to the Torah and mitzvot, which awaken their inner chein (grace).<br>Avraham fulfilled the Torah even before it was given, as his name’s numerical value equals 248, representing the 248 limbs and positive commandments. Similarly, the baby, despite not having a foreskin, still requires this second form of bris to awaken the mitzvah's holiness. This is the significance of the double expression “himol yimol.”<br>When we say in blessings, “who has sanctified us with his commandments,” it refers to two aspects: the intrinsic holiness within a person and the commandment from Hashem. The Midrash also explains that Bnei Yisrael and Hashem testify about each other. The phrase “they are a crown of pearls (לוית) upon your head” implies that mitzvot accompany a person. This means that in Heaven, Bnei Yisrael have this chein, and it is through performing mitzvot that this chein is awakened.
“And your camps will be holy, for Hashem your G-d goes amongst you in the midst of your camps” (Devarim 23:15). The Chidushei Harim explains that the “camps” refer to the limbs of a person. Hashem going amongst the camps refers to the holy spirit within each member of Yisrael. The extent to which one purifies their soul, which is the external layer, allows for the holy spirit of Hashem to spread more fully throughout the person.
“You shall not see the lost article of your brother… rather you shall return it to him, and so you shall do for any lost article that you may find” (Devarim 22:1-3). Our sages explained that if a tzadik merits in the world to come, he will receive his own portion and that of a wicked person who lost his (Chagigah 15a). This principle can also apply in this world, where the wicked may lose their merits through sin, and the tzadik gains those merits. This explains why sometimes a tzadik finds extra help in his good actions beyond his own deeds.<br>However, the Torah commands us to pay attention to this and “return the lost article to the rightful owner.” The pasuk states, “It shall remain with you until your brother demands it back,” meaning that when the wicked repent, the tzadik must return those merits to them. The double expression השב תשיבם (you shall surely return them) teaches that when the tzadik realizes he has gained beyond his effort, he should repent, which in turn inspires the wicked to have thoughts of teshuva. The lost merits of the wicked thus cause the tzadik to repent and elevate himself. Additionally, in the world to come, if the tzadik, with a “good eye,” wishes to return the lost merits to their rightful owner, it can positively affect both the tzadik and the repentant wicked person.
“An Ammonite and Moabite cannot marry into our nation, for they did not come out to greet you with bread and water, and they hired Bilam to curse you” (Devarim 23:4-5). The connection between these two reasons is difficult to understand: if they tried to curse us, what is the significance of not greeting us with bread and water?<br>Rashi (23:9) explains that one who causes another to sin is worse than killing him. The mission of Bnei Yisrael is to repair and bring all nations closer to Hashem, as will happen in the time of Mashiach. Therefore, every nation must have some connection to Bnei Yisrael. However, their essence is often repulsed by us, requiring special reasons for their connection, like Edom being our brothers or the Egyptians, in whose land we dwelt.<br>Regarding Ammon and Moab, had they come out to greet us with bread and water, it would have shown a level of nullification to Bnei Yisrael, establishing a connection. Since they did not, they demonstrated complete disconnection and sought ways to harm Bnei Yisrael. This immense negativity impacted Bnei Yisrael, who are the primary purpose of creation. While all nations were wicked, those with some nullification to Bnei Yisrael could join after three generations and did not negatively affect us as much. Ammon and Moab, having no connection, could impact us more negatively. Therefore, both reasons given are part of the same idea.

“When you go out to battle and Hashem gives them into your hand, and you will take a captive” (Devarim 21:10). The Midrash explains that mitzvot accompany a person, and each part of creation has an element that gives Hashem enjoyment, as stated, “And Hashem saw everything that He created and it was very good.” This goodness sustains the world and is the purpose of creation. This inner beauty, or chein, is the secret of Shabbos, which is also described as “very good.” The tzadik embodies this chein, being the point of goodness that Hashem is pleased with and the foundation of all worlds. Mitzvot connect us to this chein.<br>Even negative forces and the evil inclination have an element of chein, which is why Hashem allows their existence. The phrase “very good” also refers to the evil inclination. When a person overcomes negativity, this inner goodness is revealed and purified. This is the idea of “taking a captive,” where the point of holiness taken captive is restored, revealing Hashem's glory. When Hashem gives victory, it symbolizes teshuva and Shabbos, where everything returns to its rightful place.<br>After overcoming the evil inclination, one needs extra protection, as the force from captivity now resides within the person. This is why Shabbos requires extra protection, as it states, “He spreads His Sukkah of Shalom upon us.” The focus should be on teshuva, as distancing from the inner point of holiness originates from Adam Harishon's sin. Through teshuva, one repairs these parts, merits to overcome the evil inclination, and ensures lasting purity, preventing future sin.
The Sifri explains that the phrase “When you go out to battle against your enemy” means one should only go out to battle with a camp. This refers to spiritual battles against the evil inclination. When fighting one's inclination, it should be done by placing oneself within the entire Klal Yisrael. The intention should be for the success of the entire nation of Bnei Yisrael in Hashem's battles. The community's strength depends on the individual, and by being part of the community, one gains the collective power of the entire community.<br>Additionally, our sages explain that the word מחנה (camp) refers to all the limbs of a person. This means one should engage in battle with all one's limbs. Each individual part contains the power of the entire being, as man is called “a small world.” By aligning all of one's 248 limbs and gathering them with the intention of being part of the Klal, one can truly integrate into Klal Yisrael.
The pasuk (Devarim 23:5) states, “If you see your brother struggling with his load, you shall surely help him.” This teaches that one merits to perfect and uplift oneself in proportion to the effort one places in helping others. This is the idea of “נושא בעול עם חבירך” (carrying the yoke with your friend). By doing so, הקם תקים עמו can be understood as: You will be uplifted together with him. This reflects the concept that the help one provides to others also contributes to one's own growth and rectification.
The pasuk (Devarim 23:5) states that the nations of Ammon and Moab cannot marry into Bnei Yisrael because “they hired Bilam to curse you, and Hashem refused to listen to Bilam and turned the curse into a blessing.” The question arises: what does Hashem not listening to Bilam have to do with distancing ourselves from Ammon and Moab?<br>While it is true that mentioning Hashem's miracle and kindness is appropriate, we can further explain that turning the curse into a blessing may mean that the curse rebounded onto Ammon and Moab. This idea is hinted at in the Sifri. Since they wanted to curse Bnei Yisrael and Hashem protected us, the curse flipped onto them, as stated, “Those that curse you, I will curse” (Bereishis 12:3).<br>The mechanism of a curse being turned into a blessing can be understood by the concept in Parshat Re’eh: “See, I am giving you a blessing and a curse…” (Devarim 11:26). The blessing and curse each have their place, and the presence of the blessing neutralizes the curse. Just as during the crossing of the sea, there was light for Bnei Yisrael and darkness for the Egyptians. When Ammon and Moab's curse couldn't affect Bnei Yisrael, who were blessed, it rebounded onto the cursers themselves. This concept is understood by those who delve deeply into it.

Section 7

5637
The Midrash explains that mitzvot accompany a person in all their actions. Since Hashem chose Bnei Yisrael, they inherently possess chein (favor) in His eyes. However, it is through Torah and mitzvot that this chein is awakened, connecting a person to the source of their soul, where this favor is most potent.<br>The Midrash further explains that even if a baby is born circumcised, he still needs to have a drop of blood drawn. This act, though seemingly redundant, is necessary because mitzvot elevate us. The mitzvah commemorates the covenant of Avraham Avinu, symbolizing that through mitzvot, Bnei Yisrael connect to their root of oneness and favor in Hashem's eyes. This is the essence of the "Bris-covenant of Avraham Avinu."<br>Based on this, there is no difference between easy and difficult mitzvot, as both ultimately connect to the soul's source. The Midrash illustrates this with the 'easy' mitzvah of sending away the mother bird, which promises a long life. The Gemara explains that the reward refers to the world to come. The concept of "lengthening one's days" means that mitzvot connect to the eternal source, referred to as "a day that is always long."
The pasuk (Devarim 23:25) states, “When you come into your friend's vineyard and eat his grapes, you shall not put them in your own vessels.” This is understood as referring to an employee who may eat the grapes he is picking. The Sfas Emes explains that this can also be seen as a metaphor for one's intellectual engagement with Torah. The "eating of the grapes" represents the pleasure derived from delving into Torah. However, one's focus should be on learning to better serve Hashem, not merely for intellectual pleasure, which is alluded to in the prohibition of “putting in one’s vessel.”<br>The purpose of Torah wisdom is to teach us how to serve Hashem. When a person is fully immersed in this purpose, they merit true understanding. This is the idea of “when you come to your friend's vineyard,” symbolizing complete immersion in Torah study. By doing so, one aligns with the mitzvah of “You shall not muzzle an ox on the threshing floor” (Devarim 25:4). This mitzvah teaches us how to serve Hashem: just as we allow an ox to eat wheat, food meant for humans, so too can one elevate their animalistic soul and material possessions through service to Hashem, benefiting from "spiritual food." This process allows one to uplift and momentarily transcend the physical realm, each person according to their level. Thus, the Torah guides us not only in intellectual pursuits but in how to elevate our entire being in service to Hashem.

Section 8

5638
The Midrash explains that the reward for mitzvot is not revealed because if people knew the specific rewards, they would focus only on the highest-reward mitzvot and neglect the rest. Hashem wants us to perform all mitzvot. This is likened to a king who wanted his garden planted with various trees but did not disclose the payment for each tree. Only after planting did he reveal the appropriate reward for each. When asked why he didn't reveal the payments beforehand, the king explained that he would have only gotten the most valuable trees and not a complete garden.<br>Hashem revealed the reward for only two mitzvot: honoring one’s parents (the hardest) and chasing away the mother bird (the easiest). The reward for both is a long life, showing that both easy and difficult mitzvot can connect us to Hashem and fulfill the ultimate goal of our service in this world. Mitzvot enable us to find favor in Hashem’s eyes and connect to His essence, which is the ultimate goal. This connection is symbolized by Shabbos, bringing Hashem pleasure, as it states, “And Hashem saw everything that He created and it was very good.” Mitzvot allow us to link the weekdays to Shabbos, the source of the Torah, described as “a tree of life for those who hold onto it.” The root of the Torah is upheld through mitzvot, which are its branches.<br>While each mitzvah has a different reward, Hashem's primary will is for us to connect to the Torah through mitzvot. This connection supersedes the details, making no difference between easy and difficult mitzvot in their ultimate purpose. Each mitzvah, regardless of difficulty, can bring a person to the root of the Torah and the ultimate goal. This is reflected in the pasuk from Mishlei, “She does not chart a path of life; Her course meanders for lack of knowledge,” meaning that the rewards of mitzvot are not revealed to ensure a diverse and complete spiritual practice.
The pasuk (Devarim 22:4) states, “If you see your fellow’s ass or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it; you must raise it together.” This teaches that when a person trains themselves to not ignore the losses or struggles of others, whether physical or spiritual, they develop the strength to help recover what was lost or lift the burden. This applies even more to one's own shortcomings; when one cannot tolerate their own flaws, they will be motivated to overcome them and be saved.
The pasuk (Devarim 23:24) states, “You shall guard what comes out of your mouth, and you shall do as you vowed.” This means that accepting a commitment creates an effect, and guarding one’s speech ensures those words have power. Our sages explain that Beis Din can force someone to fulfill certain obligations. Similarly, when a person sincerely accepts the correct path but struggles against the evil inclination, they will be helped from Heaven to overcome it. This is still considered free will because the person chose to change and be forced to do good, thus being rewarded for their desire to follow the right path.

Section 1

...Year 5631 (1870-1871)
...b"H
In the midrash Tanchuma "this day, Hashem, etc, commands you to do the decrees etc let us sing etc bow and kneel etc Moshe our teacher, peace be upon him, saw that in the future there would be no more first fruits, and so he established prayer etc" (Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Tavo 1:1). My master, my father, my elder, my teacher, my rabbi may his memory be for a blessing said that the explanation [for this midrash] is that prayer is also giving the first/best to the Holy Blessed One every day, just as the first fruits, see there (Pri Tzadik, Ki Tavo 9:1). Yet an explanation of the pertinence to "this day" is still needed. And in the midrash and in Rashi they explained: "this day[the mitzvot] should be in your eyes as new every day." And is it possible that a person would desire to make mistakes even if in truth there is no renewal, Heaven forfend? Yet, a person has the power to renew everything, since obviously there is in every thing the aspect of renewal, behold, the Holy Blessed One renews Creation continuously every day, and the explanation is that continuously means every moment. And also, there is no thing that doesn't have Liveness from the Holy Blessed One, and the Point from God forever, and so it can't become old since God's words are alive and flow constantly. However, when darkness covers the face of the land the external husks hides the Flowing Point. And this is why it is written "there is nothing new under the sun", and this is nature and this world, that hide the renewal. However, a person has the strength to illuminate the Point from the darkness, and this is why it is written "this day the One commands you to do" - meaning, to find the aspect of "this day" which is the uncovering and revealing the light, in the aspect of Mirror of Light. This is also true within an action, which can be what hides said Point. And this [revealing the Point] is done through mitzvot, since "a mitzvah is light" (Prov. 6:23), since a mitzvah is a physical action and it contains the Liveness of the Holy Blessed One, in the command to do it, in the strength of a person to cling oneself to the Hidden Light through the action of doing a mitzvah, as explained above and as I wrote in other places. And what is written "the decrees etc" which is to say through the mitzvot of the Blessed One, you are given strength to find the aspect of "this day" also in an action. And this is also the aspect of Shabbat, since it is written "to make the Shabbat" (Exodus 31:16). And the explanation of my grandfather, my elder, my teacher and rabbi, of blessed memory, [on the verse] "faces east" (Ezekiel 46:1) is as the issue that is written "the children of Israel came first in thought", see there (Chiddushei HaRim on Torah, Eikev 4:4). And it is as we explained above, that on Shabbat the Source and the Root from which New Aliveness continuously flows to all creatures is revealed. And one could also say that this is the explanation for "they are crowned with new souls" (Siddur Sefard, Shabbat Eve Maariv, Shabbat Eve Maariv 3), that the Aliveness is renewed in the souls of the children of Israel. And the explanation of "to make the Shabbat" is that we need to bring the aspect of renewal from the Shabbat to the days of making [ie, the week] as it is written in Sha'ar haKedusha, see there, and also as it is written in other places, that on Shabbat one opens the other days of the week through the aspect of Shabbat, as explained. And according to what a person sorts out and clarifies Aliveness in every thing, and in that person's eyes they are like new, truly Renewal is revealed to that person, and this is what is written: If you listened [shamo’a] to the old,  then you will listen [tishma] to the new (Berakhot 40a), since given that one believes that there is an aspect of the Holy Blessed One hidden in every thing even in the most external, then one merits to reveal the internal, as we explained. And so too "we will bow and kneel" - meaning, bowing is one's desire to surrender, and kneeling, is a nif'al verb, which means that according to the will, truly one merits to reveal the truth, to surrender to the real, real truth.
In the name of the Chidushei Harim Za"l, on the pasuk "לא עברתי" (I did not transgress your mitzvot), the Gemara explains it refers to the mitzvah of blessing on separating the teruma, and "לא שכחתי" (I did not forget) means mentioning Hashem's name in the bracha. Brachos on a mitzvah are always made before performing the mitzvah, as the Gemara learns from the word "לא עברתי," interpreting "עובר" as preemptively. However, this seems difficult since "עובר" usually means past. Logically, one might think to make a bracha after fulfilling the mitzvah to praise Hashem for the opportunity of doing it. But the way of Bnei Yisrael is to give thanks to Hashem before everything, as a method of someone who has not forgotten Hashem.
In Devarim 29:3, Moshe says, “And Hashem has not given you a heart to comprehend and ears to hear.” Rashi, quoting the Midrash, explains that when Hashem said, "If only their hearts would remain like this," Bnei Yisrael should have responded, "Give us such a heart." This seems puzzling because, at the giving of the Torah, Hashem spoke to Bnei Yisrael "face to face," and everyone was healed, so they did have the ability to comprehend, hear, and see.<br>The true will of Hashem is that Bnei Yisrael should internalize the ability to see and hear His word in every aspect of life, both small and large. At the giving of the Torah, there was a revelation, but Hashem desires that we discern His presence even when it is hidden. The term "לב לדעת" (a heart to know) implies the ability to discern and connect with inner feelings, but the external world often hides this discernment, similar to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which mixed good and evil.<br>Moshe hinted that Bnei Yisrael should have prayed for him to enter Eretz Yisrael, which indicates they lacked proper da'as (knowledge). The sin of the spies showed a preference for theoretical understanding in the wilderness over practical mitzvot in Eretz Yisrael. Moshe wanted them to achieve a level of da'as where they could see Hashem's presence even in hidden, practical aspects of life. If they had understood this, they could have entered Eretz Yisrael and integrated this deep comprehension into their daily actions.

Section 2

5632
The Midrash (Tanchuma 1) explains that Moshe Rabeinu instituted daily prayer in place of bikkurim (first fruits). The Chidushei Harim notes that bikkurim symbolize giving the first and best to Hashem, similar to how daily prayer, the first part of our day, supports us throughout. The pasuk “I command you today” (Devarim 26:16) emphasizes daily renewal by connecting to our source, where constant renewal occurs, as stated, “He renews in His goodness constantly the creation of Bereishis.”<br>Recounting the exodus from Mitzrayim daily also connects us to our source. Each person must remember their humble beginnings and acknowledge Hashem's role in their journey. When we entered Eretz Yisrael, we were to remember that Hashem took us out of Mitzrayim and brought us to Eretz Yisrael. This personal exodus applies to everyone, and we are commanded to remember it daily. These reminders connect us to the source, fostering renewal and a deep connection to Hashem.
The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 7:2) explains “Praise is a person whose entire ‘hearings’ are to me” as always being prepared to hear Hashem’s words. Every creation contains Hashem’s words, and our mission is to uncover this inner light. Even when one uncovers depth, one should remain humble and recognize there is always more to learn, as alluded to by the plural "דלתותי" (doors). The word דלת (door) is related to דלות (poorness), teaching that humility opens the door to deeper understanding.<br>For a Jew, with a soul constantly hearing Torah, this means being aware of this inner hearing. The double expression שמוע תשמע implies hearing what is already being heard within. Additionally, the Midrash likens this to a mezuzah fixed in place, symbolizing a person always being ready to hear Hashem’s words without distraction. By being constantly prepared, one will merit hearing Hashem's words when the time is right. This is the meaning of “Praise is a person whose entire ‘hearings’ are to me”—being always ready to receive and hear Hashem’s words, and nothing else.

With G-d's Blessing Tavo Briefly, mixed items
When bringing Bikkurim, one declares, "בערתי הקודש מן הבית" (Devarim 26:13), meaning "I have removed the holy from my house." The focus seems to be on removing it from the house, rather than giving it to the Kohen and Levi. The Sefas Emes explains that separating Terumot and Maasrot represents dedicating the first part to Hashem, thereby connecting everything to the inner divine point.<br>This concept applies to a person's general approach: one's chochma (wisdom) and mind, the elevated and primary part, should be devoted to Hashem. The phrase "The hidden things are to Hashem" (Devarim 29:28) implies that one's elevated chochma and desires should not be used for physical matters, but separated for Hashem. By not placing chochma into physicality, one can elevate and connect the physical to a higher realm.<br>The Chidushei Harim explains this regarding Shabbos: even though the physical externalities do not become elevated, they "allow" the inner elements to be elevated. This is the meaning of "בערתי הקודש מן הבית"—the word בערתי can also mean "to clarify." By realizing that one's physical actions are separated and elevating one's mind to be sanctified to Hashem, one adds more power to holiness. Through not bringing chochma into physicality, the elevated chochma will shine into all one's actions.

Section 4

5634
The Midrash explains that Moshe saw Bnei Yisrael would not have the mitzvah of bikkurim in exile, so he instituted daily prayers. The Chidushei Harim explains that bikkurim symbolizes giving the first of everything to Hashem, just as prayers are offered at key times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening). The success of what follows depends on the beginning, as it says, “The end is good when it follows a good beginning.” This principle applies to any new stage in life, not just Rosh Hashanah.<br>Every beginning requires extra protection because it is inherently vulnerable. Additionally, those starting something new need protection from becoming haughty. The solution is accepting Hashem’s sovereignty, connecting to Him, and dedicating the beginning to Him, recognizing everything is His. This is why the mitzvah of bikkurim was commanded immediately upon entering Eretz Yisrael.<br>This concept also applies to individual things called "reishis" (firsts), such as the Torah and challah. The parsha of bikkurim is placed next to the parsha of Amalek, who are also called "reishis goyim," whose end will be eradication because their beginning is bad. Our sages teach that a year whose beginning is humble will be successful, emphasizing that humility and subjugation to Hashem ensure endurance. Any enlightenment that brings humility and embarrassment will last.
“And Hashem has not given you a heart to understand, eyes to see, and ears to hear until this day” (Devarim 29:3). This is puzzling because the generation Moshe addressed was the “generation of understanding” who received the Torah. The Sfas Emes explains that the pasuk does not say “Hashem has not given you understanding,” but refers to the physical elements: the heart, eyes, and ears. At Har Sinai, Bnei Yisrael were on an elevated level, disconnected from their bodies. When they entered Eretz Yisrael, they needed to repair their physical beings.<br>Hashem gave Bnei Yisrael two elements: the Holy Torah, which teaches how to transcend physicality, and Eretz Yisrael with the Beis Hamikdash, which elevates physicality to holiness. This duality is seen in “When you come to Eretz Yisrael and plant fruit trees.” This perfection of the body was lacking before entering Eretz Yisrael. In exile, we have the Torah but lack the Beis Hamikdash, so we must nullify physicality through Torah to perfect our bodies.<br>We request these two elements in Shemona Esrei: “Build the Beis Hamikdash and give us our portion in Torah.” These correspond to the covenants of Bris Milah (physical) and Tefillin. On Shabbos, we have Milah and Shabbos, paralleling the Oral and Written Torah. Shabbos represents Eretz Yisrael and the Beis Hamikdash, allowing the perfection of the body and the attainment of an extra neshama, illuminating the neshama in the body.

Section 5

5635
“Today Hashem is commanding you” (Devarim 26:16). The Midrash Tanchuma explains that each day the words of Hashem should feel new. The idea of finding renewal in each day depends on a person’s individual work. There are three primary elements: עולם (space), שנה (time), and נפש (soul), all interdependent. The renewal of life force in one's body is proportional to the soul's energy within it, affecting time and the world.<br>The commandment of bringing Bikkurim embodies this renewal, as does praying three times a day, which replaced Bikkurim. Similarly, the mitzvah of remembering the exodus from Mitzrayim fosters a sense of renewal. Bnei Yisrael only reached their destined place after going down to Mitzrayim to purify it. This concept applies to all creation, such as the Orlah law, where fruit is not eaten for the first three years to allow for purification.<br>Bringing the first fruits and recalling the exodus redeems the fruit from negative forces, allowing it to attain holiness. The commandment of Bikkurim is adjacent to the commandment to wipe out Amalek. Bikkurim symbolizes giving the first to Hashem, while Amalek represents the opposite, being called ראשית גוים (the first of all nations). Before encountering Amalek, Bnei Yisrael purified creation to be subjugated to holiness. Amalek created his own “reishis,” an illusion from negative forces, which does not last, as indicated by “his end will be lost” (Bamidbar 24:20).
The Midrash explains the double expression “If you shall surely hear” (Devarim 28:1) to mean that one should enter fully into the Beis Hakneset and not remain at the door. This teaches that when one experiences a spiritual awakening it mirrors an opening at the source of one's soul. Therefore, one’s focus should be on deepening this initial opening, which will lead to further spiritual openings. This is the meaning of the double expression שמוע תשמע, indicating that one hearing will lead to another, deeper hearing.
The Chidushei Harim, citing the Rebbe Mi’Peshischa, explains the pasuk “And Hashem has not given you a heart to understand… until this day” (Devarim 29:3). Despite experiencing lofty levels and many miracles, since these were not through a natural process, they were only temporary. However, once the Torah was completed and Bnei Yisrael instituted it through their actions, it became an everlasting Torah for generations.<br>This is the great merit of Bnei Yisrael in receiving the Torah. The Torah is infinite, as it states, “It is hidden from the eyes of all living” (Iyov 28:21). Bnei Yisrael merited to "clothe" the Torah through their actions, creating a garment for the Torah. This garment is the study of Torah and the performance of its mitzvot, making the Torah accessible and everlasting.<br>This idea is also reflected in the pasuk “You have chosen Hashem today” (Devarim 26:17). Through the ten utterances of Hashem in creating the world, Bnei Yisrael made an entire Torah, paralleling the Ten Commandments. This transformation of divine utterances into a living Torah for generations signifies the permanence and accessibility of Torah through the actions and commitment of Bnei Yisrael.
The Midrash (Tanchuma 1) explains that the person who brings the Bikkurim requests on behalf of the entire nation, “Look down from your holy place and bless your nation Yisrael…” Although this prayer is associated with bringing tithes in the third year of shmittah, it is fitting to connect it with Bikkurim. This is because all the mitzvot of tithes and offerings depend on the first mitzvah, Bikkurim, which is called “reishis.” Therefore, the commandment and prayer for Klal Yisrael follow the mitzvah of Bikkurim.
“And all these blessings will come upon you and reach you” (Devarim 28:2). The idea is that sometimes a person cannot immediately receive the blessings bestowed upon them. Hashem guards these blessings, as every good deed generates blessing. When the person is ready, Hashem will give them the blessings, either in this world or the next. This is the meaning of “and they will reach you.” [I believe I heard this idea from the Rebbe Mi’Parshischa].

Section 6

5636
The Midrash states that just as a mezuzah remains fixed at the doorpost, so too must a person remain “fixed” in the beis midrash. The double expression "דלתותי" (doors) teaches that one must enter a door within a door. Every new opening or inspiration also opens up negative powers, as “sin crouches at the opening.” Therefore, a mezuzah is needed at the opening, as the Zohar explains that the word mezuzot can spell זז מות (move and die), indicating the importance of always remaining vigilant at the opening.<br>The solution is to be in a door within a door, like a double seal protecting food from contamination. When a person attains a new level of understanding, they must be careful not to become haughty. Instead, they should realize they are still just at the ‘opening.’ The true ‘opening of the heart’ is recognizing one's lowliness and Hashem’s greatness, understanding how far one is from the truth. These two openings, symbolized by the letter “dalet,” can be seen in the name of Hashem, with the mezuzot representing the jot between the dalet.<br>If one's openings are correct, it brings about teshuva, opening the inner force and banishing negative forces. This is the meaning of “those who find Me, find life.” The double expression אם שמוע תשמע (if you shall surely hear) signifies that each hearing should lead to a new hearing. One must always be prepared to gain higher levels, hear more of Hashem’s words, and nullify oneself to Hashem’s goodness. This constant readiness protects from negative forces. This idea is also reflected in the Mishnah, “Return the day before you die,” emphasizing the need for continuous self-protection against the evil inclination.

Nitzavim



Section 1

5631
The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Devarim 30:12), “It (the Torah) is not in the Heaven, that you should say ‘Who will go up and get it for us...for it is close to you.’”  A person who truly desires with all their heart to connect to the Torah would seek it out even if it were in Heaven. As Rashi explains, if it were up in Heaven, we would need to go and get it. For such a person, the Torah is indeed close. Everything depends on the person's effort. When one toils to seek out the Torah, they realize it was never far from them. However, without effort, it will always seem distant.
“I call on the Heavens and earth to testify” (Devarim 30:19). Rashi explains that just as the Heavens and earth consistently follow their natural order, we are commanded to behave properly. This comparison seems challenging since the Heavens and earth lack free choice, unlike humans influenced by their evil inclination. However, the natural order is to follow Hashem and His commandments. Man, with the additional challenge of a negative inclination, can still naturally be drawn to the good if he overcomes this drive, just like the rest of creation.<br>This concept clarifies Tehillim 62:13, “To you Hashem is kindness for you repay man according to his deeds.” The Gemara (Rosh HaShana 17b) questions if this implies kindness or judgment. The answer is that when a person does good, it is due to Hashem. By choosing to avoid the evil inclination, a person awakens the inner goodness implanted by Hashem. Therefore, all good deeds are ultimately the kindness of Hashem.
This is the true answer to the Rambam's question: How can a person be commanded to love Hashem, and similar commandments dependent on feelings? The love of Hashem is ingrained in every Jew's heart. One must avoid getting drawn into desires that misdirect this love towards negativity, which covers up the point of truth. By guarding this point, a person naturally draws everything to Hashem with their entire heart and soul.

The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Devarim 31:28), “...and I will make the heavens and earth bear witness against them.” This is because Bnei Yisrael clarify and rejoice in the inner essence of creation, testifying that everything is the power of Hashem. This concept aligns with Shabbos, called a testimony. When one says “Vayechulu” on Friday night, he becomes a partner in creation, affirming that everything is Hashem. The truth is that as one realizes this, nothing remains hidden. The souls of Bnei Yisrael are above nature, and hence nature cannot truly conceal this fact.<br>This is the meaning of (Devarim 29:9), “You are standing here today before Hashem your G-d,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael, as the source of life force, stand directly before Hashem. They are the first step through which everything descends. Rashi (Devarim 29:12) explains that Hashem told the parsha of Nitzavim after the curses to console Bnei Yisrael, whose faces had turned pale. Hashem reassured them, saying that just as the day turns from dark to light, so too will He bring light to them. This aligns with the idea that Bnei Yisrael, being the initial conduit for divine light, have the power to transform everything.<br>The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 8:1) states, “everything is created in its time,” meaning the beginning of the spreading of life force from Hashem into the realm of time. The Zohar elaborates on this (Zohar 3:58a) with the phrase “And he shall not enter at any time,” referring to the sanctity of timing in divine service. This concept is mirrored in the act of standing in prayer, as in “Atem nitzavim” (Devarim 29:9). When one acknowledges and humbles himself before Hashem, he aligns himself with Klal Yisrael, who are always standing before Hashem, nullifying himself to divine will.

Section 2

5633
The Chidushei Harim explained Devarim 31:28, “…I will make the heavens and earth bear witness against them,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael clarify that all creation is from Hashem. The Midrash uses the word “Nitzavim” (standing) to liken Bnei Yisrael to a target, similar to a warrior aiming at a beam, signifying that they were created to guard and nullify external forces. The term “Nitzavim” also refers to protectors, as in Shmuel 2 (8:14), “He stationed garrisons (nitzavim) in Edom.”

Section 3

5634
The Gemara (Chagigah 3a) explains that children were brought to hear Moshe’s final words “to give reward to those that brought them.” If there is no direct benefit to the children, why reward their bringers? The answer is that even though children may not gain conventional understanding, they can receive a spiritual light through the Torah. Everything requires human effort, but Hashem has promised that the Torah will never be forgotten from our mouths, meaning each Jew can find the light of Torah and prayer within themselves.<br>Man can only initiate actions, but Hashem completes them. This applies to mitzvot and human effort, all stemming from Hashem. The Mishna (Avot 4:2) states, “the reward for a mitzvah is a mitzvah,” meaning that Hashem enables a person to perform a mitzvah as a reward for their desire and effort. The difficulty with bringing children is resolved by understanding that the parents' effort and desire to involve their children in Hashem’s service earn the divine light for their children.<br>This concept extends to simple people in Bnei Yisrael who lack proper understanding and desire. By nullifying themselves to those greater than them, they benefit from the tzadik's influence. Similarly, anyone with a strong desire should channel it towards the collective good, valuing communal achievements over personal ones. Through this, Hashem accepts their desire as part of Klal Yisrael. This deeper understanding of “to give reward to those that bring them” aligns with these principles, as deeper insights reveal themselves to those with understanding.

For the Month of Elul



Section 1

5631
With G-d's Blessing
During times of closeness, such as Elul or seudas shlishis, the 13 attributes of mercy are awakened, as Hashem’s mercy is drawn in measure. Hashem’s infinite mercy is too overwhelming to feel, so it must be limited for us to receive. Specific times allow us to connect to this mercy. The level of connection depends on how much one nullifies their own will and acts within boundaries. As it says, “The Nation, I am a wall,” through this, one can bring the light of Torah and Hashem’s mercy into a measure that can be received, enabling connection to Hashem, even though He is infinite.

Section 2

5632
Parshat Shoftim
The Chidushei Harim explained that the month of Elul is represented by the words לו (to Him) and לא (not), as it says in Tehillim (100), "We are His," but it is written as "We are not." These concepts are intertwined: the more we nullify ourselves ("not"), the more we belong to Hashem ("His"). When one is haughty, Hashem says, "I cannot dwell with him." By nullifying oneself and seeing everything as nothingness, and focusing all desires on Hashem, one naturally becomes closer to Him, as reflected by the verse, "like water reflects a face."<br>Elul is also the new year for tithing the flock, symbolizing our animal soul. Each person must uplift their animal soul to Hashem through self-nullification and opposing their desires. This aligns with the idea of serving Hashem with both inclinations, good and bad. This concept is also seen in "shoftim" (judges) and "shotrim" (watchmen): judges represent the mind and Torah study, while watchmen represent controlling the body.

Section 3

5634
During mincha on Shabbos and the month of Elul, these are times of mercy. Although Hashem is above time and unchanging, the change occurs within the time itself. These periods are called "times of closeness" because they can receive divine will and bounty from beyond time. On Shabbos, when Hashem bestows blessings for the entire week, time connects to something beyond it. Similarly, Elul, just before the new year, is a time when even in this world, one can connect to the eternal.<br>The Midrash explains that while other nations focus on personal gain when they receive blessings, Bnei Yisrael desire Hashem’s will more than the material benefits. They seek to connect to Hashem's will. All desires during the week depend on the will cultivated on Shabbos. Therefore, mincha on Shabbos is called "the desire of desires" because it is the source from which all other desires stem.

Section 4

5640
Shabbos being a sign between Hashem and Bnei Yisrael. Hashem is content with Bnei Yisrael testifying to Him, as it says, "This nation I have created to say my praises" and "You are my witnesses." Out of their goodness, Bnei Yisrael turn all creation toward Hashem. However, during these times of closeness at the end of the year, one must connect everything to its upper root.<br>Throughout the year, we become tainted by sins due to the influence of evildoers. Therefore, we need to focus on saving ourselves first, as in the principle "your life comes first." This is why Elul's focus is different from the rest of the year. "Ani ledodi" (I am to my beloved) is unique to Elul, emphasizing separation from the world and focusing solely on Hashem.<br>This is hinted at by Elul being the new year for tithing the flock, indicating that all worldly matters have a higher purpose. Man has a role in repairing the world, but during Elul, one must distance oneself from worldly matters to fulfill "I am to my beloved." We must remember that we are created solely to serve Hashem. In Elul, we achieve "I am to my beloved," and through this, we merit "my beloved is to me" in Tishrei, which brings life and holiness for the entire year.
The month of Elul is a time for repentance, preceding Rosh HaShana, when we proclaim Hashem’s dominion. The Zohar (3:108:1) explains that one who is bound by negative forces cannot fully accept the yoke of Heaven. Therefore, during Elul, we must free ourselves from these influences to accept Hashem’s yoke. This is symbolized by the zodiac sign Virgo, representing pure service to Hashem. Similarly, the command to destroy Amalek before the mitzvah of bikurim (first fruits) signifies removing obstacles to fully dedicate our lives to Hashem’s service.

5647-5648
Our sages explained that the month of Elul is hinted at in the pasuk (Shir Hashirim) “I am to my beloved and my beloved is to me.” The first luchos were given with an awakening from Above, while the second luchos resulted from Bnei Yisrael coming closer to Hashem, making them last forever. The first luchos were given with loud noises, but Hashem said there is nothing better than tznius (modesty) for the second luchos. The original intention of the first luchos was to repair the entire world, allowing all nations to exist through Bnei Yisrael's energy. However, Amalek's wickedness caused the sin of the Golden Calf, and the second luchos were given quietly, meant exclusively for Bnei Yisrael. This is reflected in the phrase “I am to my beloved,” indicating a singular, exclusive relationship.<br>The month of Elul is designated for generations as a time to draw closer to Hashem. During the 40 days before receiving the second luchos, Bnei Yisrael repaired their sin, opening the gates of repentance and prayer. The pasuk states, “Hashem is close to all who call upon Him sincerely.” The Midrash clarifies that Hashem is close to those who call upon Him sincerely, but the Chidushei Harim explained that even those who do not call sincerely benefit, as the sincere prayers uplift the prayers of simpler people. <br>Thus, in all generations, the accepted prayers of our forefathers allow our prayers to be elevated and connected to theirs, including those of Moshe Rabbeinu. This continuity ensures that even our modest prayers are lifted and heard through the legacy of our ancestors.
The primary idea in the expression “I am to my beloved” is that each Jew should realize they are created exclusively to serve the one who created them, with no other purpose or reason to exist. Although everything Hashem created is for His glory, the uniqueness of Bnei Yisrael is that everything in the world is created for them, and they, in turn, are created to serve Hashem. This concept is reflected in the words of our sages: "They were created to serve me, and I am created to serve my master" (Kidushin 82b).<br>This is the meaning of the pasuk “And we are to Him,” written with an alef (meaning “we are not”) but read with a vav (meaning “to Him”). Essentially, nothing is for us; everything in this world exists for us to utilize in serving Him. This aligns with “we are His nation and the flock that He grazes.” The Tana Devei Eliyahu compares one who toils in Torah to an animal plowing in the field, signifying that just as an animal realizes its sole purpose is to serve its master, so too should a Jew understand their purpose is to serve Hashem.<br>The prophet’s words, “An ox knows its master,” further illustrate this. Bnei Yisrael are described as having the intelligence of humans but placing themselves like animals, symbolizing the nullification of their own will to Hashem's will. They understand that their existence is solely “to their beloved.” Similarly, “My beloved is unto me” signifies that Hashem created and limited Himself into this world for His name to be known and revealed here, all for the sake of Bnei Yisrael, who are called Reishis. Before Rosh HaShana, when the world is renewed, we must clarify that all creation is for Bnei Yisrael, whose purpose is to fulfill Hashem's will. Therefore, in the month of Elul, each person should separate themselves from worldly vanities and prepare to serve Hashem exclusively.
The sign of the month of Elul is the virgin, symbolizing an inner purity in the soul of Yisrael that remains untouched by external forces, as described in Shir Hashirim 4:12: “A locked-up garden, a sealed fountain.” This pure point is referenced in “I am to my beloved,” indicating an unbroken connection to its divine source, always guarded for Hashem’s sake. While this point is not always easily accessed, Elul is a special time when Bnei Yisrael are awakened to return to Hashem, drawing closer to Him. This reciprocal relationship is expressed in “My beloved is unto me,” highlighting the unique divine attributes, such as the thirteen attributes of mercy revealed to Moshe after the sin of the Golden Calf.<br>The Chidushei Harim explained that this concept is also reflected in the blessing “Magen Avraham” (Shield of Avraham). The holy covenant of circumcision, marked in our flesh, distinguishes us from all other creations. This is hinted at in the saying, “How great is the mitzvah of circumcision, for 13 covenants were made upon it.” By safeguarding this holy sign, the thirteen attributes of mercy are revealed. Thus, during Elul, the connection between “I am to my beloved” and “My beloved is unto me” is strengthened, as Bnei Yisrael’s return and dedication to Hashem reveal these divine attributes.<br>In Elul, each person should strive to connect with this inner purity, recognizing it as a time of spiritual awakening and closeness to Hashem. By doing so, they align with the unique blessings designated for Bnei Yisrael, reinforcing their bond with the divine and fulfilling their purpose in creation.

With G-d's Blessing Rosh Hashanah
Each person has a holy spark, a "neshama" of life within them. Throughout the year, our sins and physicality can cover this inner point. On Rosh HaShana, we pray to renew this life force within us. This idea is reflected in the first tablets, described as "cheirus" or freedom, free from forgetfulness. However, due to our sins, this was lost. Each year on Rosh HaShana, we strive to renew this sacred point. During the Ne'ila prayer, we ask to be sealed in the Book of Life. This ensures that the renewed life force within us remains pure and does not spread inappropriately.
The Gemara records that the malachim asked Hashem why Bnei Yisrael don’t sing Hallel on Rosh HaShana. The Sfas Emes explains that this question arose from the malachim, but Bnei Yisrael understand that since it is a day of judgment, it is not appropriate to say Hallel. Despite this, one should still be prepared to sing Hallel on Rosh HaShana, as it is inherently a joyful day, even though this joy is hidden. This concept is reflected in the idea of "on the place where ba’alei teshuva are standing, even complete tzadikim cannot stand," and the notion of "ratzo veshav"—running back and forth. Bnei Yisrael, being on the level of ba’alei teshuva, can discern and conceal the true joy of the day by navigating this back-and-forth dynamic. In contrast, the malachim, who exist on a single level, require everything to be revealed and thus wish to say Hallel. However, Bnei Yisrael recognize that the joy of the day remains hidden.
When we blow the shofar on Rosh HaShana, Hashem transitions from the seat of judgment to the seat of mercy. Our primary intention should be to encourage Hashem to sit on the seat of mercy. It is not beneficial for humanity to keep Hashem in the mode of judgment. Therefore, the prayer recited before the shofar blowing requests that Hashem show mercy upon us. When we genuinely make this request, Hashem is filled with mercy for us.
The Midrash tells us that in Yaakov’s dream of the malachim climbing the ladder, Hashem also told Yaakov to climb the ladder, but he did not believe and did not climb. The Sfas Emes explains that Yaakov wanted to remain aloof from the idea of the ladder, which represents nature and gradual ascent. Yaakov desired Bnei Yisrael to be on the level of the first luchos, with no forgetfulness or sin, completely above nature.<br>In our prolonged exile, we exist in the merit of Avraham and Yitzchak. The Gemara (Shabbos 89b) explains that in the future, Yitzchak will save us from Hashem’s accusation against us for our many sins. This is because Yitzchak’s self-sacrifice at the akeida brought the concept of the ladder's stages into nature and the judgment of this world, which was created with judgment.<br>This concept has been explained elsewhere that Bnei Yisrael will inherit the gates of their enemies. This promise ensures that Bnei Yisrael will precede all their enemies in any gates and openings. Similarly, Hashem said to Avraham, "you did not spare your son." The word חשכת (spare) shares the same root as חשך (darkness), meaning even the darkness and judgment are drawn into the merit of Bnei Yisrael. This gives us the ability to transform the attribute of judgment into one of mercy and kindness.

With G-d's Blessing Rosh Hashanah Briefly
Rosh Hashana embodies the concept of tefila. There are four mitzvos that we fulfill daily: Shma, tefilin, tzitzis, and tefila. These correspond to the four letters of Hashem's name. This parallel extends to the mo’adim (festivals). Pesach represents tefilin: "With an outstretched arm, He took us out of Mitzrayim." Shavuos corresponds to Shma: "This commandment that I have given you today." Sukkos parallels tzitzis: "In the shadow of the corner of Your garment we were protected." The Yamim Noraim (High Holy Days) align with tefila.
The Gemara in Rosh Hashana (11a) states that everything in creation was created with the knowledge and desire to be created. Therefore, it is imperative for us to prepare properly before Rosh Hashana, as our level of preparation and desire during these days determines the renewal of life we receive. Rosh Hashana is when the renewal for the entire year is given.<br>Bnei Yisrael are the primary da’as (knowledge) of creation, as it says, "atem keruim adam." The world was created for Yisrael. However, the phrase "Bishvil Yisrael shnikre’u reishis" (for Yisrael who are called reishis) indicates that it is not merely for Yisrael, but because of our connection to reishis (the beginning). This connection to the source and oneness is crucial. This is why all of creation comes before Hashem "Kivnei Maron," to grant each individual their unique life force according to their knowledge and situation.
Rosh Hashana is when the moon is covered, unlike other festivals where there is a revelation, as it says "yaira’eh," and the Gemara explains that the way a person sees is how he will be seen. This revelation brings joy to the festivals, as they are called "moadim l’simcha," and the Hallel is recited, symbolizing this revelation. As explained elsewhere, the purification on festivals involves removing external garments, for we cannot come to the gate of the King in sackcloth.<br>On Rosh Hashana, although this revelation is hidden, the shofar brings about a form of revelation. Chazal explain that since the shofar comes as a remembrance, it is as if it penetrates the deepest covers, akin to being inside the holy of holies. This hashgacha (divine providence) within the hiddenness comes through fear, as opposed to loving-kindness. The Zohar states that seeing is associated with loving-kindness, while hearing is linked with fear. <br>On this special day, the shofar serves a dual purpose. There is a mitzvah to hear the shofar, allowing us to hear the awakening from Heaven that comes on this day. Additionally, the sound of the shofar ascends to Heaven, and Hashem hears the sound of His people's shofar with kindness.
In the Rosh Hashana Amidah, in the bracha of Malchius, we say "Aleinu leshabeach." This tefila was instituted by Yehoshua when Bnei Yisrael first entered Eretz Yisrael. At that time, Bnei Yisrael were filled with a desire to rid the land of idol worship and establish the world under Hashem's kingdom. Had we completely destroyed the seven nations as commanded, Eretz Yisrael would have been properly repaired, benefiting the entire world. However, because we were lax in this commandment and left remnants of the seven nations, this led to the prolonged exile where we need to mingle among the nations of the world.<br>It is for this reason that we proclaim, "And so place Your fear on all the nations, and they should all make a circle to serve You." This commitment signifies our return to Hashem for our original sin of allowing these nations to remain. By reciting "Aleinu," we awaken the original good intention to rid the world of idol worship, assuring us that the end will be better than the beginning.
On Rosh Hashana, each being comes before Hashem "Kivnei Maron." As it says in Mishlei, "the King's smile means life." It is through this divine "seeing" that we all pass before Him, receiving life. Just as in creation, when Hashem saw that all was good, it granted existence to creation; similarly, each year, this "seeing" is reawakened to renew the world's existence. The primary focus of this seeing is that Bnei Yisrael reaccept the Torah, which is called "tov" (good).<br>Therefore, we blow the shofar on this day, symbolizing the acceptance of the Torah at Har Sinai, to show that our primary desire for life is to fulfill the Torah. This act awakens this merit Above, ensuring its fulfillment in this world. This is the essence of Teshuva—renewing our days as of old, as Hashem originally intended, for the intention of Yisrael and the Torah preceded the creation of the world.<br>In the beginning, man was placed in Gan Eden to serve and guard it, but through sin, he was banished. With the acceptance of the Torah, his status was reinstated, but it was lost again with the sin of the Golden Calf. This status was once more reinstated with the first and second Beis Hamikdash, yet these too were taken from us.

Shabbat Shuva



Section 1

5634
Shabbat Shuva Parshat Vayelech
“Return Yisrael until Hashem your G-d for you have stumbled in your sins” (Hoshea 14:2) is directed at every Jew. Despite sinning greatly, one must believe that the core essence of their soul remains intact. This is supported by the teaching that a person only sins when a spirit of foolishness enters them, indicating that sin is an external influence, not a reflection of their true self.<br>The pasuk emphasizes returning to Hashem, signifying reconnecting with one's pure essence. Real teshuva involves returning to the divine spark within. On Shabbos, this reconnection is easier because all of creation is elevated. During the week, creation operates through intermediaries, but on Shabbos, everything reconnects directly to its source.<br>Our sages teach that the hidden light from creation was only concealed after the first Shabbos, even though Adam sinned before Shabbos. This implies that even those who have sinned can connect to this hidden light on Shabbos. As the verse states, “Your entire nation are all righteous,” and “Light is sown for the righteous.”
The Gemara states that teshuva out of love converts intentional sins into merits, while teshuva out of fear does not. The Sfas Emes questions the difference if both types of teshuva return actions to their source. However, true teshuva requires love. The pasuk (Hoshea 14:5) says, “generously I will take them back in love,” and Rashi explains that Hashem loves them even if they are unworthy. This shows that love can be endeavored and reciprocated based on one’s efforts.<br>A person who longs to return to Hashem, even without knowing how, will find that Hashem reciprocates with love. Thus, someone who does teshuva out of fear will be brought closer by Hashem, who endeavors to love them. However, one who returns out of love is on a higher level, as no extra effort is needed from either side.<br>This concept applies to the Ten Days of Repentance and Shabbos Teshuva. On Shabbos, teshuva is done out of love, while during the weekdays, it is done out of fear. This distinction highlights the different qualities and impacts of teshuva based on the underlying motivation.
The Chidushei Harim quoted the Rav of Pershischa on the pasuk, “You will say that it is because Hashem is not in me that all these problems have come upon me.” He explained that such thoughts are considered a sin because every Jew must believe that Hashem is with them.<br>However, there is some truth in this statement. When Hashem's presence rests upon a person, no foreign power can harm them, as the pasuk states, “They will see that the name of Hashem is called upon you and they will fear you.” But when a person loses trust and says, “Hashem is not with me,” it invites suffering from external forces.<br>This parsha teaches us to strengthen our trust in Hashem and believe that He resides among us. This belief brings about a revelation of His name and protects us from any harm.

Yom Kippur is a day of forgiveness and pardon, in general and in particular; and there is forgiveness for the sin of the golden calf on it. As they, may their memory be blessed, said about the verse, "however on the day when I take account of them, I will take their sin into account" - that there is no accounting in which the sin of the calf is not included. And the reason is because all sins were caused through it afterwards. And likewise - the positive trait being greater - there is no forgiveness that does not have forgiveness of the sin of the calf in it. For also all of the repentances that the Children of Israel always do are all from the power of the repentance and the forgiveness of the generation of the desert. This is as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, that that generation was not fitting for that sin, but it only [happened] to teach [the concept of] repentance. Hence anytime that the Children of Israel repent, it arouses the merit of the generation of the desert. And each year, a little of he sin is erased; until in the future the whole sin will be rectified, and the Children of Israel will merit to be what they were worthy to be before the sin, as it is written (Psalms 82:6), "I said you were powers (<i>elohim</i>, here being understood as angels)." And hence on Yom Kippur, they are like angels; and that is a sign that they will be holy beings in the future. And the Children of Israel fast with joy, to say that they look forward to returning to that earlier level, such that we will not need eating or drinking, but rather just to be nourished from the luster of the Divine Presence like angels. And since we remember the valor of the generation of the desert by way of forgiveness; hence the commandment of Sukkot is after Yom Kippur. As it is written (Jeremiah 2:2), "I accounted to your favor the devotion of your youth" - the merit of the generation of the desert (who dwelled in huts). Since it is through sin that merit was extinguished, and it is through repentance that merit becomes aroused again. This is as Rabbenu Yonah, may his memory be blessed, wrote in Shaarei Teshuvah on the verse (Hoshea 14:3), "forgive guilt, and accept what is good." See there.

Ha'Azinu



Section 1

The pasuk (Devarim 32:2) “My teaching will flow like rain” signifies that each member of Bnei Yisrael has an inner life force that needs to be awakened through Torah. Just as rain awakens the earth's potential to produce, Torah awakens the inner potential of man, who is called Adam, derived from "adama" (earth). This inner energy is the concept of the Oral Torah, as it is written, “the eternal life is planted in us,” referring to our ability to produce fruit, such as mitzvot and good deeds. This parallels the relationship between the heavens and the earth, where rain (Torah) descends from the heavens to nourish the earth (our actions). Bnei Yisrael have both the written Torah (heavens) and the Oral Torah (earth).<br>Bnei Yisrael are compared to the earth, sustaining creation and clarifying Hashem’s kingdom. By doing so, they unify the heavens and the earth. Even though Hashem’s actions are perfect, Bnei Yisrael’s role is to ensure their actions and thoughts align properly, awakening their inner life force. Hashem gives each person the necessary holiness and purity, but it is up to them to actualize it. The Gemara states, “If one says I toiled and found—believe him,” meaning the person found the potential within themselves. Hashem’s actions are perfect; it is man who must align himself properly. Just as creation multiplies when in the correct place, man must connect to his proper place to serve Hashem.<br>Shabbos exemplifies this concept, bringing blessings and awakening the inner life force by aligning man with his correct place. When one accepts Torah in their heart, they connect the heavens and earth, producing fruit and awakening their creative power. This is reflected in the pasuk, “light is sown for the righteous,” referring to the light of Torah. The Gemara explains that the word “ya’arof” (flow) also implies killing if one learns Torah not for its sake. The true power of Torah is to awaken the inner Torah in one's heart, achievable only with proper intention.
Rashi (Devarim 32:1) explains that the Heavens and earth were called to testify because they will carry out the reward or punishment, similar to how a witness in Beis Din carries out the punishment. The primary testimony of Heaven and earth is that their power depends on the service of Bnei Yisrael. The Mishna in Avot (6:10) states that Hashem has five possessions: Heaven and earth, the Torah, Bnei Yisrael, etc. Just as Bnei Yisrael connect the Oral Torah with the Written Torah, so too must the possession of Heaven and earth be connected by Bnei Yisrael serving Hashem. Without this service, Heaven and earth have no cause for existence. The reason "the hand of the witnesses must strike first" is because one who sees a sin must remove it, as nature cannot exist when Hashem's will is not carried out. Thus, it is nature itself, the Heaven and earth, that execute the punishment.
The Tur (Orach Chaim 581) quotes the Midrash that the days between Yom Kippur and Sukkot are free from sin because Bnei Yisrael are occupied with the mitzvot of sukkah and lulav. Consequently, the counting of sins only begins on the first day of Sukkot. The Turei Zahav questions why the days of preparation for Sukkot would be greater than Sukkot itself when the mitzvot are actually performed.<br>However, this concept is understandable because preparation for a mitzvah can have more power and benefit than the mitzvah itself. Firstly, the performance of a mitzvah is temporary, while preparation requires constant effort. The pasuk “you shall guard them and do them” suggests that guarding oneself to be ready for a mitzvah at any moment is essential. Guarding oneself from worldly distractions ensures one is prepared to fulfill Hashem's mitzvot, and the greater one's purity, the better the mitzvah is performed. Through guarding, one merits fulfillment and protection from evil, as it says, "one who guards the mitzvah will know no evil."<br>Furthermore, who can perfectly perform a mitzvah with all the correct intentions? The desire and preparation to perform the mitzvah according to Hashem's will, and the joy in preparing for it, are very important. This can be learned from the concept that "thoughts of sin are worse than the actual sin." If negative thoughts have such a strong impact, then positive thoughts and desires to fulfill Hashem's commandments are even more powerful and protective, preventing one from sinning.

Sukkot

Simchat Torah is a preparation for the whole year, to be regular in Torah [study]. It is as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said, "[Thousands of scholars died] because they did not recite the blessing over the Torah first." And that is why Simchat Torah is at the beginning of the year, so that a person should contemplate the greatness of the Torah, since it is the words of the living God. And through the desire and joy in clinging to the Torah, there remains afterward a clinging from the occupation with Torah [study]. It is as it is written in the Midrash, "<i>This is the blessing</i> (Deuteronomy 33:1), that there be a blessing on the Torah before it and after it." And likewise, even merchants, who are not always occupied with Torah the whole year, nevertheless fix it in their hearts, and it becomes difficult to separate from the words of Torah, because of the joy [<i>simchah</i>] at the beginning of the year. This assists him not to completely forget it, even when he is occupied with other things. And it is written, <i>Rejoice, Zevulun, in your going out</i> (Deuteronomy 33:18). But it is difficult, as why should he rejoice in this portion? Rather, it is good advice: That through the joy before he goes out for trade, he is thereby guarded upon his going out. And that is why Simchat Torah is at the beginning of the year, as mentioned above.

Sukkot 5637
In the verse (Lev. 23:43), "In order that [your future generations] may learn that I made [the Israelites] live in sukkot," and the verse (Jer. 2:2), "I remembered to your favor the lovingkindness [hesed] of your youth [... How you followed Me in the wilderness]," the general idea of the matter is that in Nisan Hashem brought us out of Egypt, and it was through Hashem's lovingkindness alone, as it is written (Ezek. 16:7), "And you were naked and bare."  However, Hashem wanted that this lovingkindness be through the merit of good deeds of the Israelites, so that it would endure forever.  And so it is written (Ps. 62:13), "The lovingkindness is yours, Lord, for You will repay each person according to his deeds."  The meaning is that the Holy One, blessed be He, engineers through His lovingkindness that the person merits this lovingkindness on his own, through his or her own deeds, for everything is ultimately attributable to the Cause of all causes.  And this happened afterwards in that the Israelites traveled into the wilderness and merited the clouds of glory.  The meaning is that the fact that they merited this through their own deeds removes the Accuser from B'nai Yisrael; "One who eats what is not his, feels ashamed [to look in the face of his benefactor]" (Yerushalmi, Orlah 1:3), but one who merits through his own deeds is honored.  And see what I have said below [in another piece from Sukkot the same year].  And this matter appears every year.  At Pesah there is the exodus from Egypt through Hashem's lovingkindness.  And afterwards, at Rosh Hashana, a person is judged with regard to whether he has repaired his deeds the lovingkindness.  For all of Hashem's lovingkindness is so that a person will repair his deeds by means of the lovingkindness.  And when he merits by right, the lovingkindness winds up being repaid, even according to the criterion of justice [midat hadin].  And this is the lovingkindness of the holiday of Sukkot -- the lovingkindness that comes by right.  All of this happened to our ancestors, and this is why it says, "I remembered to your favor the lovingkindness of your youth [... How you followed Me in the wilderness]"  The meaning is that the Holy One, blessed be He, caused the lovingkindness to be remembered throughout the generations in that it was on account of Israel's own good deeds, and the remembering is by right.  The meaning is that lovingkindness is just for a moment, except that, for one who merits that lovingkindness by right, it endures forever.  (And this is "[I will make with you an everlasting covenant,] The enduring lovingkindness promised to David.")  And this why it says, "I made [the Israelites] live in sukkot," for even the sukkot are a reminder of the exodus from Egypt, but they are a reminder of the lovingkindness that was done through the merit of B'nai Yisrael, etc.  And in this way the question of the Tur [why Sukkot is observed in the Fall rather than in Nisan] is resolved.

Section 6



Section 7



Why is it that Sukkot follows Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur?  It's because one can't fully attain this dwelling (the sukka) except through the power of t'shuva [which we achieve during those days].  In this regard, the Sages said that a ba'al t'shuva occupies a place  [here, the sukka] that the complete tzaddik cannot attain.  {...}  And this is similar to the practice of endowing [the manumitted slave].  This linkage is suggested by the verse [Deut. 16:13] which tells us,  regarding Sukkot [to construct a sukka] "from your granaries and your wine vats."  And regarding the endowment [the same phrase is used in the immediately preceding chapter] it says [15:14], "from your granaries and your wine vats."  And it is written, [in connection with both passages, (16:12, 15:15)], "you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt.  And Rashi explained [on 15:15] that the double verb [of "ha'anek ta'anikenu" (you shall surely endow)] means that you should endow the slave with a double portion, just as God endowed you with a double portion in your liberation from Egypt [once in Egypt (when the Egyptians gave/lent the Israelites their valuables) and once at the Sea (where the Israelites harvested the booty from the drowned Egyptian warriors)].  [Just as there was, after the liberation from Egypt, an "endowment" of great wealth,] similarly, the making  of amends for our sins also amounts to a liberation, from the Yetzer Hara, and it yields latitude, autonomy, freedom.  And this is why the Talmud [Sukk. 12a] says, regarding the Torah's requirement to use the granaries and wine vats to construct our sukka, "Scripture is referring to the _waste_products_ of your granaries and your wine vats."  These [the waste products, the refuse] are the sins that have been transformed into merits by desire [t'shuka -- possibly a typo for "t'shuva"?]; they are the shield that afterward protects the ba'alei t'shuva.  That is, the Talmud's insistence that the sukka is to be built from scraps, from waste products, symbolizes the process of transforming sins into merits by yearning ["t'shukah," possibly a typo for "t'shuvah," repentance].  Those [merits] are the protection that shields the ba'alei t'shuva [and thus, it's the process of doing t'shuvah that enables one to be in the sukka].

On the eighth day, there shall be a convocation for you: For there is Hallel and joy on eight. And they expounded, "'And you shall be altogether happy' (Deuteronomy 16:15) - to include the [night of] the eighth, etc." As the joy needs to be for the sake of the Heavens. And the hint [to this] is that there is Hallel and joy on eight. For the eighth is above the nature that is in the seven days of building. And it is written (Jeremiah 9:22-23), "Let not one glory... But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me." And that is Shmini Atzeret; and for that reason this day has no point of contact with any [other] nation. As on the seven days of Sukkot, there is joy from the angle of nature, but on Shmini Atzeret, it is the root of joy, as mentioned above. And there is a hint in the verse (Proverbs 25:14), "Like clouds and wind without rain, so is one who vaunts himself over a false gift." For in the first seven days there are clouds and wind - the sukkah (hut) is clouds of glory and we wave the four species to the four winds (<i>ruchot</i>, which is usually understood here as directions). So because of that, there is something for everyone to grab. But the rain that is on Shmini Atzeret was only given over to people of truth, for the joy and Hallel is in it (eight), as mentioned above. Hence, "without rain is one who vaunts himself over a false gift," are the nations of the world except for the Children of Israel, who are rooted in joy. To them is rain given. And the essence of rain is Torah, which is compared to rainfall, since it quenches the hearts of the Children of Israel, like rain quenches the land. Hence the internality of rain is Torah, and the Children of Israel cling to internality; so they are the internality of the Creation. And enlightenment in the Torah comes to them and simple rain comes to the superficial ones. And likewise that which is said, "On the festival, they are judged about water" - internally that is Torah, which is called water. And that is why the Children of Israel merit enlightenment of the Torah on the festival. And the judgement is whether they are fit to receive enlightenment of the Torah. As it is written (Psalms 51:12), "Create a pure heart for me," and then, "renew a steadfast spirit." For a person has to request a pure heart in order to be a vessel that is prepared to receive the Torah. And during these days when the hearts of the Children of Israel are purified, they automatically feel the enlightenment of the Torah afterwards. And with this, the verse (Ezekiel 38:25), "I will sprinkle pure water upon you," is fulfilled. And since everything is in any event dependent upon the internal, the Children of Israel have the choice part also in the external flow. This is like the matter that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded on the verse (Numbers 23:9), "a people which shall dwell alone and will not be reckoned among the nations" - as they eat and drink with the nations, but it does not get reckoned in the tally. And the reason is because this is not their major comfort; rather their main comfort is Torah. And in the Mishnah (Avot 5:19): "What [difference] is there between the students of Abraham, our father, etc. [they] eat in this world and inherit the next world." The inheritance is the essence of the principal, whereas they eat from the fruits in this world. And likewise during the days of Sukkot, that is called eating in this world, however it is nevertheless not reckoned. But on Shmini Atzeret, it is called inheriting the next world. And so, "which shall dwell alone," is fulfilled, as it written, "there shall be a convocation for you." And the three traits of the students of Abraham, our father, are fulfilled in the Jewish people in these days. For on Rosh Hashanah, it is the humble spirit, as it is said, "the commandment [of the shofar ideally] is with the bent." And on Yom Kippur, it is the small appetite , as it is written, "you shall afflict your souls." And on Sukkot, is is the good eye, as they offer [sacrifices] for the 70 nations. That is why they merit the reward to eat in this world and inherit the next world, as mentioned above.

For Hoshana Rabbah: We have already written about why the sages, may their memory be blessed, fixed many prayers on this day. It is that it is called Hoshana Rabbah, since even the lowly ones and the lowly generations can be redeemed [<i>lehivashaya</i>] upon it. For they are the aspect of the willow [which is also used by itself on this day], no taste and no smell. So we must, therefore, understand what their power is. It is indeed written: <i>I was brought low and He saved me</i> (Psalms 116:6). Its understanding is that because they know that they are lowly and need redemption, they will have redemption. And that which the sages, may their memory be blessed, accordingly wrote (Rosh Hashana 17a:9), "Even though I am lowly, I am fit to be saved," is from the reason mentioned above. And this is like it is found in the Gemara (Chullin 89a:5), "<i>Not because you are more, etc. for you were the fewest</i> (Deuteronomy 7:7): Even when the Holy One, Blessed be He, bestows goodness upon them, you diminish yourselves." See there. And this is truly the trait of the Children of Israel. When the Holy One, blessed be He, in His kindness, bestows bounty upon them, they contemplate the truth, that they are not fitting for this and diminish themselves greatly. And this is in fact the trait, since redemption comes to the lowly. And hence when our righteous Messiah speedily arrives, the main redemption is prepared to be specifically with the lowly generations. And the explanation of <i>I was brought low and He saved me</i> is also that after the redemption they remain lowly, as they must know that it was with supernal kindness. And so too is it with the four species [waved on Sukkot]. The willow needs to negate itself to the other species. And that is the [meaning of the] sign of the difference between the leaf of the willow and the <i>tzafzafah</i>, that the leaf [of the former] is pointed up and that [of the latter] is round, such that from its lowliness it becomes built up, so it is disqualified. But the willow points to the other species taller than it, and that is [why] its leaf is pointed. And likewise do our generations need to negate ourselves to the earlier generations, to be redeemed in the merit of our fathers. So then the redemption will be prepared for us more than for the earlier ones. And this is [the meaning of] <i>I was brought low and He saved me</i>. And God, may He be blessed, who is the One who helps the lowly, should have mercy and pity and redeem the poor and lowly people. As what can be lower than us now? And redemption is the Lord's.

After Yom Kippur is the Holiday of Sukkot, as it is written (Isiah 29:19), "Then the humble shall have increasing (<i>yisafu</i>) joy through the Lord." This hints to the Festival of the Harvest (<i>Asif</i>), such that the Children of Israel have merited the aspect of humility (<i>anavah</i>) on Yom Kippur with the commandment of, "you shall afflict (<i>ve'initem</i>)." And that is the aspect of our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, [who had] a greater humility than all of them. On Rosh Hashanah, there is an aspect of fear; and on Yom Kippur, there is an aspect of humility. As it is written (Proverbs 22:4), "In the path of humility comes fear of the Lord" - fear leads to humility. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said about the haughty, "The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'he and I cannot live [together].'" If so, it is on Sukkot that the Children of Israel merit the commandment of booths, since the Name of the Heavens dwells upon the booth (sukkah ); and we [then] say, "I and He." And just like the Holy One blessed be He cannot dwell with those with a haughty spirit, so too do the humble require a special dwelling. And [also] our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, it was because 'he was the most modest of men, etc.,' that he had to ascend to the heavens; for he could not live below. Similar to this is it with the Children of Israel, who are the most humble among the peoples of the world. They need a sukkah and a special dwelling place, to be separated from the haughty spirited. And since they are humble, they merit to have the dwelling of the Divine Presence, as it is written (Isaiah 57:15), "I will dwell with the contrite." Hence they are happy, since 'joy is in His abode."

Section 30

On the eighth day, this is an Atzeret for you – a gathering in. For Sukkot is the Festival of ingathering. And the Children of Israel, when they bring themselves together in the name of heaven – in order that their should descent upon the Succah the name of heaven, their end shall be that they shall sustain and remain in this state of Achdut/Oneness. And this is the meaning of this is an Atzeret for you – that you should remain in Oneness. And so all gatherings, this is their explanation – if they gather for the sake of heaven, they shall remain sustained even as each one goes to their own home. And so to on the holy Shabbat – they are drawn into Oneness, and if this is for the sake of heaven, they shall so be sustained in the days of action. So too the Oneness from Sukkot goes with us also home.

In the pasuk "May your locks be of iron and copper, may your days flow" (Devarim 33:25), Rashi explains that this means the days of old age should be good like the days of one’s youth. The Chidushei Harim elaborates that the blessing of good old age follows from the blessing of the locks. The strength and traits guarded in youth with an "iron lock" will remain strong in old age. This idea is supported by the pasuk in Koheles (12:1), "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of bad follow," indicating the importance of guarding one’s youth.<br>The Zohar clarifies that for the righteous, the days of old age are not inherently bad. By remembering Hashem in youth, one avoids "bad days" in old age. This is further emphasized in Tehillim (92:14), "Planted in the house of Hashem...in old age they still produce fruit," showing that constant vigilance in youth leads to a fruitful old age. For Bnei Yisrael, who are above time, the concept of "your days flowing" signifies that one's strength can remain even in old age if one transcends natural limitations.<br>This concept also applies on a national level. In the generation of the Midbar, Moshe saw that Bnei Yisrael protected themselves with "iron and copper locks," preparing future generations. The phrase "your days flow" hints at later, lower generations deriving strength from the early generations, the generation of understanding. Moshe Rabbeinu's great power was his ability to give the Torah to future generations as an inheritance, fulfilling the verse "Wisdom is good with inheritance" (Koheles 7:11). This wisdom, passed down through generations, is a testament to Moshe's enduring legacy.
