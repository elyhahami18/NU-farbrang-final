Keter Shem Tov



Volume  1



Chapter 1

From the Besht there is an explanation (to Midrash: Eicha Rabba Pesichta Beis) "If only they would abandon me and [they] would watch my Torah". The explanation: For true knowledge is that one does not know. However, there are two types of not knowing. One is that one immediately doesn't enter to probe and to know after [the fact is] that is impossible to know. The second [way of not knowing] is that one probes and seeks until he knows that it is impossible to know. The difference between this and that one [can be understood] with a parrable. There were two people who wanted to know the king. One of them entered into all the rooms of the king and benifited from all the rooms and halls of the king. After this he was not able to know the king. [In contrast] the second one said that after it is impossible to know the king he didn't enter into the rooms of the king at all.

Chapter 2

From the Baal Shem Tov, everyone needs to act on their own level. This is not the case when one grasps the level of his friend, both don’t last. This what is written “Many (tried) to do like Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and they were not successful” meaning they weren’t at his stature, rather they only did like Rabbi Shimon, for they saw him at this level, thus they were not successful.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

[A teaching] from [Rabbi Israel] the Master of Good Name: An interpretation of the verse "his wives turned away his heart" (I Kings 11:4). That there is not a single letter in the Torah that does not carry two meanings that correspond to the [Divine] Masculine [i.e., Tifferet] and Feminine [i.e., Malchut], etc. If this is so, you will find that nothing created in this world does not include [an aspect] of all [of existence]. And the choice is given to each individual to incline to whatever aspect he wishes. For this [reason, the verse states] "his wives turned away his heart".

Chapter 5



Chapter 6



Chapter 7



Chapter 8

From the BeSh"T. "There are three graces: the grace of a place on (in the eyes of) its inhabitants"... (Sotah 47a). This is explained in Chullin 91b, that [when Jacob slept] God "folded up all of the Land of Israel under him"; "the land which you lie upon, I will give it to you" (Genesis 28:13). Meaning, that you will not need to travel from place to place in order to clarify the land's sparks of holiness, for you will be able to clarify them in your place. "And Noah found grace..." (Genesis 6:8)

Chapter 9

From the Besh"t of blessed memory. "For from within my flesh I will see [God]" (Job 19:26). Just as a physical union is not fertile except with an erect penis [אבר חי, lit. "living limb"] and embrace and joy, so too a spiritual union -- and this is words of Torah and prayer -- when engaged with with a living limb and joy and delight, then it will be fertile...

Chapter 10

[A teaching] from [Rabbi Israel] the Master of the Good Name: One should pray for one's enemies, as they are the [rooted in the] spirit of a righteous person from [a past] reincarnation, etc. And through prayer one sweetens [the judgements affecting] the roots [of the righteous individual] and draws the spirit [of the righteous] out of them and that which remains devours them.

Chapter 11



Chapter 12



Chapter 13

"Two of each", man and his wife, they came to the ark (see Genesis 7:9). An interpretation [of the verse is that] there are two interpretations [contained] within each letter [of the Torah]. One [corresponds] to the aspect of the [Divine] Remembering of Mercy. The second [corresponds] to the aspect of [Divine] Judgement. And the righteous transform the Attribute of Judgement to the Attribute of Mercy.

Chapter 14



Chapter 15

[A teaching] from [Rabbi Israel] the Master of Good Name, in the name of Rabbi Saadia Gaon: As the main purpose of the creation of the human in this world is to break their naturally [formed] negative characteristics, and in this they raises the rank [of an attribute of their soul] which is called "your nature" in the higher world which is called the world [olam] similar to the term concealed [helem] and hidden. And [for] this [reason] the verse states: "Go forth for yourself, from your land, and from your birthplace, [and from your father's house, to the land I will show you]" (Genesis 12:1). This refers to the natural [inclination] that one is born with. And [one must] see to it that it is broken as described above. [And as the verse continues] "And from your father's house" - As "your father" [corresponds to the divine aspect] that is called "Wisdom" or "Father", and "your father's house" [corresponds to the divine aspect] of "Understanding" [or] "The World of Thought". And the intention [one must have] is that one must see to it that the negative thoughts are repaired. And this [is why] the verse states: "And your father's house" - that one must recognize [the need] to separate [the holy] that had fallen [into] the thought [that stems] from one's "father house" in order to return them and to raise them [to the realm of the holy]. And though this [act of repair] one will merit higher "land which I will show you" - that I will make "your nature" known in the [higher] world.

Chapter 16

From the Baal Shem Tov: When one becomes aware that emotional suffering [lit: afflictions of the heart] are [signs of] the illness of the soul, [expressing] the mystery of diminished consciousness - once one has this awareness, then one repairs [lit: sweetens] this [i.e. the suffering] through the awareness.  This constitutes one's healing. This is not the case with the mystery of hiddenness, as in the verse "I will surely hide [My face]" (Deuteronomy 31:18), which is when one is not aware that one is spiritually ill. Then one does not [experience] the healing of one's personal affliction.

Chapter 102

From the Ba'al Shem Tov - the explanation of "when you go to war against your enemy and you take his captives" (Deut. 21:10) - it is that through the argument of the inclination to evil you can conquer it. Meaning, that if the evil inclination is quick in its work of enticing a person to transgress, in order to do its bidding from the Holy One, as it is explained in the allegory of the prostitute in the Zohar, a person should take this lesson (mussar) to heart, and similarly be quick not to listen to the evil inclination - which is the desire of one's Maker, Blessed! And this is "you take him captive", precisely.

Chapter 202

<b>"The one who walks alone on a path and studies and makes a break from their study..."</b> (Pirkei Avot 3:4 [in Sefaria's version, Avot 3:7]). A problem: "and makes a break from their study" alone would tell us that they were studying [i.e. and we don't need "and studies"]. A further problem: <b>"the verse is applied to them... [as though they were liable for death]"</b> (ibid.) -- and it doesn't explain which verse! And it's possible to explain as follows: "the one who walks on a straight path" -- and even if they are alone, which is to say that they are not fused to the Name may it be Blessed -- <b>"and studies and makes a break in their study"</b>, here the text wants to say <b>"makes a break"</b> [between] the person themself and the Name may it be blessed. They do this by means of their study, since greatness and glory come to them by means of their study, and they think that they <i>own</i> their study. "They say 'how beautiful is this tree'" (ibid.) -- and regarding themself they say the same in their heart, as it is written "for is a man a tree of the field" (Deuteronomy 20:19). And they further say that "this tree [that you saw] grow and become mighty" (Daniel 4:17) [c.f. use of the verse in Zohar 3:53b in reference to tree of life/Torah]. <b>"How beautiful is this newly ploughed field"</b> (Avot 3:7) -- as it is written "Break up your fallow ground" (Jeremiah 4:3). Meaning, that they say they are preparing for themself a portion in the world to come by means of their study. <b>"The verse is applied to them"</b> (Avot 3:7) -- meaning, the verse "You shall be wholehearted with the Lord your God" (Deuteronomy 18:13) -- meaning, even when you are engaged with Torah! As it says of Torah, "the Torah of God is whole" (Psalms 19:8) -- and that which it says "You shall be wholehearted" -- even in engagement with Torah, "you should be with the Lord your God." And do not say "Isn't the Torah itself called 'Torah of God'?" [and that this suffices for one's relationship with God]. And that is what it says this <b>"verse is applied to them"</b> -- that it includes all the Torah, <b>"as though they were liable for death."</b>
