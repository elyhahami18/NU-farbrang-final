In the commentary <i>Or Hame'ir</i> on Kohelet Rabbah, is written the following: There is a wonderful story in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, whose meaning is not explained. There once was a king, who had a servant who was able to play the harp with the utmost beauty. One tune, in particular, was most pleasing in the eyes of the king, and he instructed the musician to play it before him in the palace every day - even several times a day. And so it was. After some time, the tune seemed old to the musician, and he lost the passion and arousal that had previously burned within him. What did the king do to restore this arousal and emotional desire in the musician? Each and every time he wanted to hear his favourite tune, he would summon a person from the marketplace who had never heard the tune played before. Since this newcomer had just arrived, it rekindled passion in the musician! And so it was for many days. After time, however, the king took advice from his counsellors, in order to know what else could be done with the musician, for it was wearisome to summon a new guest each time the tune was to be played, just in order to arouse some passion. The advice they gave was this: order the eyes of the musician to be torn out, so that he be forever blind, never again to see the form of man. Now, any time the king wanted to hear his favourite tune, he would tell the musician that there was a new person in front of him, who has never heard your music before. Thus the passion was reborn each time, since the musician could not make out the form of the person before him, and truly believed that there was a new listener there. And so it was. This is the end of the story.

See above, Hayyey Sarah #4, regarding this matter; and see in the book Likkutim Yekarim, p.15b, where he writes: “‘Live a life of pain’ (Avot 6:4) – do not read ‘live’ but rather ‘bring to life.’ The explanation is that in every thing he should be careful to intend to bring life to the sparks that are placed within the shells that fell there, for they are in great pain there; see to bring them life and extract them and elevate them.” And so it is in the Likkutei Aggadot at the end of the book Or Torah, p.64b.

Comment 4

Examine well the language of the Rabbi of Toldot Ya’akov Yosef, Mishpatim p.66c, which I copied above, Bereshit in n.160, that a person’s serving [God] afterward through this power is not the essential wholeness for fixing the spark; rather, he must elevate it immediately.

Comment 5

In the book Divrei Shalom, Vayetze p.27d, he wrote in these words: “It is written in the name of Rabbi Israel Ba’al Shem Tov, his soul in Eden, that whatever a person has is relevant to the root of his soul; for in them are the actual sparks of his soul. Therefore when a certain thing breaks or is lost he should not worry at all, for he has elevated what was relevant to him and therefore it broke; and when it is lost and comes to another [person’s possession], presumably that thing also contains holy sparks that are also relevant to that person. Therefore when he has elevated from this what he needed, the thing came to another [person’s possession] for him to elevate what is relevant to him.” And see also in Vayikra, p.40b.

Comment 6

In the book Be’er Mayyim Hayyim, “Explanation of the Haggadah” s.v. Grievous in the eyes of the Lord etc., he wrote: “The Ba’al Shem Tov, may he be remembered for life in the world to come, said: ‘Three who ate at a single table and did not speak words of Torah over it are like those who ate sacrifices of the dead’ (Avot 3:3) – the explanation is that the deceased person is reincarnated in human food, so that words of Torah will be spoken over him, and through this he will bring to life that deceased person who was in this reincarnation; but if they do not speak words of Torah, then he has sacrificed that deceased person who was reincarnated in this food and cast him into lifelessness, and that is why they said ‘sacrifices of the dead.’”

In the Book of Or HaChochma, Bereshit writes, "The Baal Shem Tov said about a verse like water before the face, etc. For example, when a person stands at a river, a shadow of man appears in the water, and when the person reduces himself, Is also small, and when a person reduces the smallest after the smallest until his face comes into the water, then the face of the shadow comes against the face of man, so the analogy, the heart of a man who reduces himself against his friend, and then his friend also reduces himself, until the human stage reduces itself So that he can not diminish any more, so his friend does so, and they become idolatry.

See the Tzaavat HaRivash, which teaches that when one desires to seclude themselves in prayer they must have a companion with them, because one person alone is in danger. Let there rather be two people in one room, each secluding themselves with their Creator. Sometimes, when one is truly cleaving to Gd, they can seclude themselves even in a house full of people. See further on in section 47-48 which say that there should be no one present when wants to cleave to God.
