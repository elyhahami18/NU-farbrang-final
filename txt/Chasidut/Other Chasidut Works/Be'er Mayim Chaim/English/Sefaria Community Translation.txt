Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b>On the</b> seventh day God finished the work that He had been doing, and He rested on the seventh day, etc.: Meaning God surely completed and finished all of the work on the seventh day. But with what? "And He ceased on the seventh day" - with this, that He rested, and He made it into a day of rest and joy, which was the end of the thought of creating the entire work of the heavens and the earth. It is with this that He finished and accomplished the end of their making. And with this, the words of our Rabbis about this verse are sweetened (Bereishit Rabbah 10:9): Geniva said, "This is analogous to a king who made himself a wedding canopy, painted it and embossed it. What was it lacking? A bride to enter it. So, too, what was the world lacking? Shabbat," etc. To here [is the midrash]. The commentators there were hard-pressed to explain what the world was missing without Shabbat. But according to our words, it is very correct, since the Shabbat to the world is exactly like a bride to the wedding canopy. For the entire existence of the world was only created to prepare the meal and the joy of the Shabbat day. And before the Shabbat day arrived, everything was lacking. So the seventh day completed and finished the work, the packed day of joy. Then the bride went up to the wedding canopy, as mentioned.
<b>And behold,</b> Rashi, may his memory be blessed, on the Torah on this verse, cites the words of this midrash, but he changed its wording. And he wrote, "What was the world lacking? Rest, etc." And according to how it appears, he is explaining the words of the midrash as follows: What was the world missing? Shabbat, meaning rest. And likewise did the Matanot Kehunah write that this was the intent of Rashi, may his memory be blessed. And this, too, corresponds to our words. And its explanation was that the whole world was lacking in its work from the angle that there was no rest in it. But the essence of the creation was to do good to the creatures with rest and joy. So the work [of creation] was not complete until Shabbat arrived and rest came to the world. So the Holy One, blessed be He, rested and enlightened the world with His great goodness. And through this, He also attained great pleasure from His world that He created. And He and all of the worlds were at peace and had great delight. And that is why He said [...]


Paragraph 3





Even though the world to come does not have eating or drinking, [those there] will attain satiation and health from the vision of God, like a man who eats and drinks. This is like the statement in Scripture, <i>they beheld God, and they ate and drank</i> (Exodus 24:11). And the sages, may their memory be blessed, explained (Berakhot 17a and Rashi's explanation there) that by way of the vision of God, they benefited and felt good health and satiation like a man who eats and drinks, as we explained this in our essay on the Shabbat prayer book (Root 5, Branch 3), see there. And with this, everything has been properly clarified, with the help of God, may He be blessed.

And likewise is it with Adam the first man. Behold, this tree from which the Holy One, blessed be He, forbade him to eat on that very day — it was not because evil was mixed into its essence. God forbid, it was not like that. And that is why the Targum (Onkelos on Genesis 2:17) explained, "those who eat the fruit attain wisdom [to distinguish] between good and evil." This means one acquires wisdom in his essence to distinguish between good and evil by eating its fruits. And this knowledge is a big danger, as was stated; perhaps he cannot stay with the good, God forbid. But when he did not know [the difference] at all, behold what did the Holy One, blessed be He, gain with his creation, that he should choose the good and despise the evil if he does not know good from evil? Hence [what is correct is that] the Holy One, blessed be He, warned him not to eat from this tree before the arrival of the Shabbat day. And on that day, He commanded him, saying, <i>From all the trees of the garden you shall surely eat</i> (Genesis 2:16), that he should only eat from the other trees (and as we explain well later on in the section, "And He commanded, etc.," and on the verse, <i>And the eyes of the two of them were opened</i> [Genesis 3:7]. See there carefully.) As through this, he would perfect himself with the holiness of his Creator, since they are the plantings of the Lord [alluding to Numbers 24:6). And there was certain much holiness in them and the Torah praised them as <i>pleasing to the sight and good for food</i> (Genesis 2:9). And that is a byname for the goodness of the light of God and His holiness that flows into them. And especially since the Tree of Life was there, the holiness of which is well known concerning its stature. And with this joining together with the holy Shabbat day, the holiness infused in him would allow man to connect himself with His holiness and bind himself up with the Life of all the Worlds. And it would then be permitted to eat from this tree, and he would certainly then know to separate the evil from the good and the chaff from the food and despise the evil and choose the good, and his impulse would not draw him to cling to the evil, God forbid. However, Adam the first man ate the fig before it was ripe, before its time, as he did not wait for the Shabbat. So he attained the knowledge [to distinguish] between good and evil, but he did not have the power of holiness strongly and firmly rooted in him [yet]. And hence he believed [he could succeed], and did what he did. And we will not mention [these things] about the work of the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He; you can find them in their places among the statements of the sages, may their memory be blessed. It follows that the blessings were not drawn to the canopied dwelling, to the home of the house of our God, but descended into the husks and the evil. And through this, evil was mixed in with good and all of the words were blemished as a result, as is well known. But let us return to the main aspect of the tree of knowledge, that is, its amazing stature due to the essence of the intention of the creation, which is to choose the good and to bring down through it all of the blessings specifically for the good. And all of this is praise of the garden. And [R. Alshekh] wondrously continued with the praises of the garden saying, behold...

Paragraph 4

<b><i>There were Nephilim</i></b><i> in the earth in those days, etc.</i>: Behold we have written at length in our book, Sidduro shel Shabbat (Root 3, Branch 1), and in this essay in several places, that it is an essential religious service of an intelligent man to connect the earth and the heavens; to see and to understand, about every single thing that is on earth, that the place of its roots is in the heavens of the heavens, and to know that there is nothing in the world besides the power of God, His light, His infusion, and His lifeforce which is implanted at the time of the creation. And from then until now, the Holy One, blessed be He, supervises and infuses this life force upon it, and it is preserved like this forever. And that is why, "one who benefits from this world without a blessing is as if he robs the Holy One, blessed be, and the Assembly of Israel" (Berakhot 35b). As the main root of everything is to connect it to the heavens and to raise the spark of God that sustains that thing to its root in the heavens above. And in this way, the Holy One, blessed be He, has given this thing to man to bring it up to its elevated resting place. And when he recites a blessing over it at the time of his benefit, he can afterward elevate it, since he made the light of God's holiness dwell upon it with his blessing, when he said, "Blessed are You, Lord, Creator, etc.," and placed the blessing of God upon it, saying that God, who makes everything exist, created it, formed it, and also made it [alluding to Isaiah 43:7]. And through this, the physical body of dust of that thing enters it, and the root of spiritual life that is in it arises. And [in turn,] through this, he can afterward elevate it to the place of its root from which it was hewn with the power of the intention of his benefit for the sake of God alone, and not for the sake of his [own] desire and benefit. However, if he does not previously recite a blessing upon it, behold it is impossible to elevate that thing any longer, since its physicality has not yet been subdued. So then, why is he benefitting from it if he cannot elevate it? Just the opposite, he will bring it further and further down; and God did not give it to him in this fashion, to do evil to it, with the holy spark that rests in that thing. So he is truly stealing that thing from the Holy One, blessed be He, etc. And it is about this that the verse (Leviticus 25:23) warns: <i>And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity</i>, and its translation [in Targum Onkelos] is, "an eternal severance [literally, a severance of the worlds]." This means, to sever, God forbid, the land/earth from the heavens, to say that God is in the heavens above but not in the earth. It is not like that! Rather, He is the Supervisor, who creates and forms all that is formed and also renews the act[s] of creation, in His kindness, always every day, who supervises everything and gives sustenance to everything. And were it possible to fathom a lack of His infusion and His lifeforce from everything that is found, the world would be as if it were not, and it would be void and nothing. However, His good word is always established in the heavens [alluding to Psalms 119:89] and the earth and all that there is in them. And therefore there is none besides Him [alluding to Deuteronomy 4:35]. For there is nothing in all of the higher and lower worlds, in the depths and in the heights, besides the power of His light, His infusion, and His life force. There is nothing else! And that is why the verse stated: <i>There were Nephilim in the earth</i>, meaning they fell from their status and from their level and were only in the earth. And they thought that they were in the earth and God was in the heavens and that He did not oversee what was on the face of the earth or its inhabitants. So they did not consider connecting the earth to the heavens, to believe with complete faith that the Lord is God in the heavens above and upon the earth below, there is none else [alluding to the Aleinu prayer]. And they removed the eye of His oversight from the earth and said, "Who will see me and who will know me." Therefore they did what they did and did not have the fear of God before their eyes at all, as [each one] flatters himself in his own eyes [alluding to Proverbs 36:2-3], saying that he has been allowed to do whatever he want on the earth, and God does not oversee him. Hence...

And there are accordingly two types of procreation: One is in the world's physical dimension, which is sons and daughters, to increase their offspring like the dust of the land, since it was created to be inhabited (alluding to Isaiah 45:18). And the second is the procreation of souls in the higher world through [fulfillment of] the commandments and good deeds. For it is from there that the souls of converts and penitents come, as is known from the words of our teacher, Ari, may his memory be blessed. The essence of this is when a man and a woman cohabit with a true intention for the sake of God with fear and love, with the desired intentions before the One who spoke and the world came into being. And when she does not become pregnant from this cohabitation, those souls are created. In this way, Abraham would convert the men and Sarah the women, like the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Bereishit Rabbah 39:4). As they gave birth to these souls. And it is about them that it is stated: <i>and the souls that they had made</i> (Genesis 12:5) — that they actually made, for the souls [came] from them. And about this, the woman is the same as the man. For she, too, must seek to bring about new souls and spirits through her good actions. As the main descendants of the righteous are [their] good deeds. Hence the intention of that which was stated, <i>Be fruitful and multiply</i> (Genesis 1:28), was about this reproduction. Concerning this, the two of them are the same; in creating "fruit" above to increase the souls in the higher world. However, the command about procreation in the world is like its straightforward understanding, to produce children for the survival of the species. That is what is stated afterward: <i>and fill the earth and subdue it</i>. (For otherwise, one of [these phrases] would be superfluous. And understand [this]). As this is to fill the lower world, to increase the likeness and image of God in the world. And it is concerning this that it is stated, <i>and conquer it</i> — it is the manner of a man to conquer, and it is not the manner of a woman (Yevamot 65b). And that is why he is commanded and not she. And see there, as we have explained it. And that is why Scripture here states about that which she was barren, that you not say that she was completely barren, such that she did not give birth to anything in the world, that it is not like that: It is rather that <i>she had no child</i>. As she did not have a child with a body and soul in this world. But she continuously gave birth to souls by themselves, and made the souls for the converts, as mentioned. (After I wrote [this], I found it explicitly so in the holy Zohar, Parashat Shelach 168, see there.) 

Chapter 12



Paragraph 1


















And this is as the Scripture states <b>"beyond the river dwelt your ancestors from olden times; Terach, the father of Avraham" (Yehoshua 24:2). That is to say, Terach the father of Avraham, his dwelling and his level was in the attribute of "beyond the river", which is, the second side of the river, to perform evil deeds [<i>chasadim hara'im</i>] in the world. "But I took your father Avraham from beyond the river" (Yehoshua 24:3) - from that level itself of "beyond the river" I took Avraham, to the other, opposite side: to do and to increase good deeds in the world [<i>chasadim tovim</i>]. And this is a great and wondrous level, the attribute of one who is forgiving [lit. "passes over their traits"], who the Sages of blessed memory praised (Ta'anit 25b:5). Since They took evil attributes and reversed their attributes to be made into good attributes, regarding this the Scripture says (Yirmiyahu 15:19) "If you produce what is noble out of the worthless, you shall be like My mouth". And our Sages of blessed memory said (Bava Metzia 85a) that even if the Holy Blessed One decrees a decree, They will nullify it for the sake of such a one. And behold, our sages of blessed memory said, blood is spoiled up and made into milk (Niddah 9a), as it is said "Who will make pure from impure?" (Iyov 14:4). And they explained it, that the impure blood alone, it itself is spoiled and made into pure milk. Regarding this it says "Who will make pure from impure?" -- like Avraham from Terach, from the impurity of Terach, Terach himself who was accustomed to do evil deeds in the world and to make known matters of idolatry, how to serve every different idol: from this impurity itself Avraham reversed and made it pure, and taught the people the ways of God and converted the converts, as it is said!</b>

Paragraph 5

<b>And Abram</b> took, etc., and they set out for the land of Canaan, etc.: See what I wrote above to explain how Abraham knew the way in which he was to go. But according to the straightforward meaning, it appears to be according to the approach found in the holy Zohar (Lekh Lekhah 5:22-23) [about finding the place to sacrifice Isaac] and these are its [words]: The Holy One, blessed be He, gave Abraham the spirit of wisdom, etc. So he weighed [every place] in the scales and knew how to connect them to the powers entrusted to govern the inhabited places on earth. When he reached the middle point of civilization, he weighed it on the scales but could not reach any conclusion. He tried to see and know what power, etc. It is like this that, <i>they set out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans for the land of Canaan, etc.</i> (Genesis 11:31). It is just as with the [the sacrifice of Isaac, as] he certainly did not have a command from the Holy One, blessed be He. Rather, he brought himself there on his own, since he knew that the world was founded there and that the gate to the Heavens was there. So too here, even though the Holy One, blessed be He did show him the land, he estimated on his own with his wisdom that God would certainly want him to bequeath this land to him to inherit it. And so immediately when he got to the land, God appeared to him and said, <i>I will give this land to your offspring, etc. </i> (Genesis 12:7) — that is to say, you had the same intention as I, as this is the land that I wanted to give you and your offspring forever. And that is why, <i>he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him</i>. The explanation [of this] is that he was gladdened and rejoiced that God had appeared to him and announced to him that He agreed with him, that he had the same intention as the Holy One, blessed be He. And it is like that which the [sages,] may their memory be blessed, explained [about the phrase in the Shabbat prayers], Moses rejoiced in his gifted portion.

Paragraph 1


And what appears [correct] to me about this is that it is well known that the secret of the commandment of circumcision is very, very deep - 'who can find it?' And it is greater than all of the positive commandments in the Torah, since there is no commandment from all of the 248 positive commandments for which one is liable excision besides [eating the] Pesach sacrifice and circumcision; and thirteen covenants were sealed upon it; and the essence of creation rests upon it - as per the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Nedarim 31b), "Rabbi said, etc. Great is circumcision, for were it not for circumcision, the Holy One, blessed be He, would not have created His world - as it is stated (Jeremiah 33:26), 'If it were not for my covenant day and night, I would not have made the laws of heaven and earth.'" For the whole matter of the creation of the worlds was to impact on the creatures with His goodness, to give over from the radiance of His blessing to the world. Yet the whole time the circumcision is covered with the foreskin, the kindnesses cannot descend into the Foundation (<i>Yesod</i>), in order that the external forces not draw sustenance from them, such that no enlightenment comes out from it. So all of the worlds are impacted by harsh judgements (as it is found in the words of the Ari about the intention of circumcision). Hence the world cannot endure with the negation of circumcision. And that is why Scripture stated (Malachi  2:5), "My covenant was with him for life and peace." As every aspect of life - which is the essence of the endurance of creation - is all through the aspect of circumcision. And therefore the numerical count (<i>gemartria</i>) of <i>brit</i> is nine times life (<i>chaim</i>) - since it is in the aspect of the Foundation (associated with circumcision) which is the ninth trait going downwards and the aspect of life descends from every trait to the aspect of the Foundation, and it is the [trait] that gives the bounty of life to those that come to the world. And it is well known from the words of the Ari that the name of the Foundation is peace, because it creates peace among all the traits and every aspect of the kindnesses and the restrictions descend into it. So the restrictions are grouped into the kindnesses there and are sweetened there. And that is why it stated, "My covenant was with him for life and peace" - it is to say that the aspects of life and peace are with the aspect of the covenant, since the whole aspects of life and peace receives their bounty from it, as stated. And that is why thirteen covenants were sealed upon it, to hint to the one aspect within which all the traits unite and which unifies them into one. For it is 'a ladder planted towards the ground and its head reaches to the heavens.' As the bounty that descends upon it descends from a high and very awesome place, the hidden Mind, the Source of mercy and kindnesses, the aspect of the thirteen attributes of mercy. And that is why thirteen covenants were sealed upon it.

Lot could see that the angels didn't want to do anything until he left the city.  He thought that since the decree of destruction did not fall upon him, he would be able to withhold the destruction from entering the city (of Sodom) by not leaving it. 
He, therefore, delayed a bit because he thought that the people of Sodom would repent and not be destroyed.
The angels knew that it was the opposite- the punishment wouldn't be delayed because of Lot, and that he would also be consumed by the sins of the city held him and took him out.  The reason for his salvation is because G-d took pity on him - he wasn't able to prevent the destruction, and it was enough for Lot to save himself once he left the city.

Paragraph 1

<b><i>And Dinah,</i></b><i>, etc. to see in the daughters of the land</i>. The expression, <i>in the daughters of the land</i>, needs to be understood; it should have said, "to see the daughters of the land." And that which appears [correct] is that, behold the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Midrash Tanchuma, Vayishlach 7:1), "Scripture associates her name with Leah. Leah’s daughter loved to go out just as her mother did. How do we know this about Leah? It is written: <i>And Leah went out to meet him</i> (Genesis 30:16), etc." And at first glance, this is a wonder! Did it not know their, may their memory be blessed, saying (Pesachim 3a) that Scripture did not even speak in disgrace of an impure animal? Why would Scripture write with the intention of showing the disgrace of that righteous woman [Leah]? All the more so, since it is known that she truly intended [it] for the sake of the Heavens, since she desired and strove to establish the tribes of God. And it is like their statement, may their memory be blessed (Bereishit Rabbah 72:5).
In fact, it is just the opposite. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, came to say that Scripture associates her with Leah, to say just like the mother, so too is the daughter. This means that just like her mother certainly intended [it] for the sake of the Heavens, so too did the daughter intend [it] for the sake of the Heavens. For their statement, may their memory be blessed, about the verse: <i>and the souls that they made in Haran</i> (Genesis 12:5), "Abraham would convert the men, and Sarah would convert the women (Bereishit Rabbah 39:14) is well-known. Hence she also wanted to grasp onto the ways of her holy forbears, to convert converts from the daughters of the land, in order to bring them under the beneficence of the wings of the divine presence. And that is why Scripture stated, <i>And Dinah, the daughter of Leah, went out</i>. Meaning that she was truly the daughter of Leah in this going out, acting like her mother for the sake of the Heavens. And that is why she went to see <i>in the daughters of the land</i>. That is to say, to see inside them and the internality of their hearts. For even in the nations of the world, there are some souls that are prepared to accept purity and want to cling to the Jewish people, as is well-known from Ruth and the other righteous converts, who, even when they are still gentiles, accompany and seek out the Children of Israel, because of the holiness within them. And it is because of this that Scripture is recounting Dinah's praise. As she went specifically to see, and not to show herself, her beauty before the eyes of the nations and the princes, since she was beautiful (alluding to Esther 1:11). And also specifically <i>to see in the daughters of the land</i>, and not, God forbid, in the sons of the land. For she had the righteousness of her holy forbears in her, from tip to toe, without budging to the right or the left. So Jacob's bed [the propriety of his family] was complete.

And its saying, <i>all of his sons and all of his daughters</i>, hints to it being in the way of that which [the sages], may their memory be blessed, said (Moed Katan 27b), "Anyone who cries too much for his deceased, will, God forbid, cry for another death." And that is why until the end of three days, his sons and his daughters did not arise to comfort him. Just the opposite, they cried with him. But after three days of mourning passed, then all of his sons and all of his daughters arose, etc. That is to say that it is appropriate for him to be concerned about his children and to be consoled by their words of comfort and to stop crying. Yet <i>he refused to be consoled and said, "I will rather go down to the grave as a mourner"</i>. Meaning, I am not like others who cry for their dead, who will, as a result of this, be visited by something not good, God forbid. Rather, I am crying about myself, since the Holy One, blessed be He, told me, "This is a sign given over to you, that if none of your sons dies in your lifetime, you can be certain never to see Geihinnom," like the sages' statement, may their memory be blessed. (Rashi on this verse, and see Midrash Tanchuma, Vayigash 9.) And that is [the meaning of why] I am crying: Since, <i>I will, God forbid, go down, etc.</i> And that is why <i>his father cried over him</i>, and did not stop crying even after the three days.

<b>Moshe agreed</b> to reside, etc. and he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, to Moshe: And at first glance, the word, "to Moshe," is extra; and it should have said, "and he gave him, Tzipporah, his daughter." Indeed, when Scripture says that he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, to Moshe, it is saying that this was like Moshe's intention of taking this this one from all of his daughters. For she had appeared individually to him. And it also seems that it can be said that even Yitro knew that Tzipporah was fit for Moshe, since he was a great sage. That is why it said, "And he gave." Meaning that he gave Tzipporah, because he knew she was his [proper] mate. And hence he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, to Moshe; meaning she was the one fitting for the level of Moshe. For she was the most proper of women, 'maidens see and acclaim her, etc.'
<b>Also</b> its saying, "Moshe agreed. etc. and he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, etc.," is, in this way, to express our teacher Moshe's great modesty, peace be upon him. As even though Tzipporah ran after him like a bird (<i>tzippor</i>) and he knew clearly that that she was his mate, since she appeared individually to him at the well -  nevertheless, he did not request her from [Yitro]; he did not claim his portion with his mouth and did not speak about this at all. Rather he desired to stay with him until things developed from the Heavens, [that] they would automatically give him Tzipporah. And so it was: During the days of his stay, behold Yitro himself 'gave him his daughter, Tzipporah,' to him, without a request from the mouth [of Moshe]. This was not even like our father, Yaakov, peace be upon him - who said, in order to father children (Genesis 29:18), "I will work for you seven years for Rachel, etc." - and that which is similar. But he, due to his great modesty, did not say anything. And that is why Scripture says later...

 <b><i>And the Lord</i></b><i> did according to Moses' word; the frogs died away, from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields</i>: Meaning, that since the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to fulfill the word of His servant and the faithful prophet to His [people], Moses, they therefore died in this order, first from the houses, afterward from the courtyards, and afterward from the fields. For Pharaoh's request was like this, since he said, <i>that He may remove the frogs from me, and from my people</i> (Exodus 8:4), meaning first from me and afterward from my people, that the removal be in order of the closest first. And likewise did Moses promise him and say, <i>the frogs shall depart from you and your servants [and your people], etc.</i> (Exodus 8:7). And hence in order to fulfill Moses' word, He did so: <i>the frogs died away, from the houses, from the courtyards, etc.</i>. This would not have been so had the Holy One, blessed be He, brought them back to the Nile. It would not have been in this order. For the closer ones would return to the Nile first, and those are the ones from the fields, and afterwards the ones from the houses. And even though Moses said to Pharaoh, <i>only in the Nile shall they remain</i>, its understanding is not that they would return to the Nile, but rather that they would all die. And the only ones that would remain are the ones that had stayed in the Nile, like the statement of the sages, may their memory be blessed (Shemot Rabbah 10:5). And the Holy One, blessed be He, did it to sanctify His great and holy name — that nothing should be missing from that which Moses said, and they would trust the Lord and Moses His servant (alluding to Exodus 14:31).

However, it is known from the meditations of the Ari, may his memory be blessed, that the main negation and banishment of the external forces is by way of the names mentioned and put on the mezuzah, <i>Shad-dai, ve hayah,</i> and <i>kaf, vav, zayin, vav,</i> [then] <i>bet, mem, vav, kaf, samech, zayin,</i> etc. And it is all from the enlightenment of Understanding [<i>Binah</i>], the aspect of the supernal Mother. As in every place that it floats, all aspects of the external forces are subdued by its light; see there at length. Accordingly hence our forefathers who were in Egypt and did not yet have the Torah or a mezuzah, but required protection at the entrance — behold our God, may He be blessed, who has counsel and salvation, had an amazing counsel and ordered [them] to take the commandment they already had in their hands, the blood of the Passover sacrifice. As it was already sweetened and included in holiness, by way of the ritual slaughter and the intention for the commandment of the Passover sacrifice. And it is well known that the numerical equivalent of blood [<i>dam</i>] is the equivalent of, I shall be [<i>Ehieh</i>], in the quadruple expansion, like this, <i>e, eh,</i>, etc. which is hinted to for the enlightenment of Understanding, the aspect of the Mother. So it was put on the doorpost of the entrance and on the lintel. And through this, the destructive power could no longer come to the house, as its eyes were blinded by the enlightenment of this light, such that it fled like the flight of an arrow. So it was a great distinction for it, to distinguish between the house of an Egyptian and the house of a Jew. However, on a written mezuzah, we write these three names on it that were mentioned, and they draw from the aspect of Understanding so that they are banished through it. However, with the blood of the Passover sacrifice, it was not written with [God's] name, and [even] its essence only hints to one name, the name <i>Ehieh</i>. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered to put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, such that there be three names of the Holy One, blessed be He, on the entrance. So through this, the entrance was surrounded on all sides, to banish the destructive power from there. And that is [the meaning of] its saying, <i>And the blood on the houses shall be a sign for you</i>. As this is in the aspect of a sign that is like the king's seal, which is outwardly inscribed on the garments of his servants as a sign that he is a servant of this king. And through this, everyone fears him and is afraid of him, not to touch him for the bad, since his patron is imprinted upon him. And the servant of a king is a king. <i>And when I see the blood, etc., and there shall not be upon you a plague for the destroyer, when I smite, etc.</i> For the smiting of Egypt was through the destructive power that He, may He be blessed, sent. And the destructive power is unable to distinguish. So the blood was a sign at the entrance to strike the people at the entrance with blindness that they should not approach there. (And if you understand well about the secret of the unity of God, may He be blessed, in the secret of <i>and His kingdom reigns over all</i> (Psalms 103:19), you will better understand what he wrote here, <i>and when I see the blood</i>, according to the things mentioned.) And see that which is written on the verse, <i>draw and take</i> (Exodus 12:21) — from there as well, you will correctly understand its saying, <i>and when I see, etc.</i>. And we will return to our topic, which is that on this night, it is the time of the rectification of all judgements of holiness. And so, all aspects of the Other Side fall and are broken. And that is why the Torah commanded...

<b>The waters returned and covered the chariots, etc. including Pharaoh’s entire army, etc. not one of them remained:</b> At first glace, this is repetitive language. After it stated, "including the entire army, etc.," why did it repeat and state, "[none] remained, etc.?" Indeed, however, Scripture is reporting an amazing miracle with this. For have we not already written that the return of the water was while Israel was still in the sea and the sea was split into pieces, such that in one part, He brought through the Israelites within it; and in another part, 'He hurled Pharaoh and his army, etc.!' And that is why the splitting of the Red Sea in the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, is always called difficult. Like they said (Sotah 2a), "Pairing them up is as difficult as splitting the Red Sea," and that which is similar to it. All of this is [about] the essence of its splitting, that it was cut into halves. As He made a half, sea; and [the other] half dry land - punishment and mercy - at one instant. And that is difficult before the Holy One, blessed be He - as it is found in the holy Zohar (Vayera 113b), "There was miracle and punishment as one." See there, that it spoke at length about this aspect. And, if so, it comes out that if this was indeed the commandment to the sea - to scramble the Egyptians while the Israelites were still within it - it is certain that it did not delay the words of the Holy One, blessed be He. Rather, immediately when one of the Egyptians came into the sea, the water would come over him and wash him away. Likewise, the second and the third, until the were finished. And such is implied in the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, that we cited above. As they said (Shemot Rabbah 22:2), "When the last of the Israelites ascended from the sea, the last of the Egyptians descended into it." Behold that they were entering one by one; and likewise were they washed away one by one. But, at first glance, how was the understanding of Egypt so wanting and their wisdom so depraved? As the second one saw with his eyes that the first one was washed away into the sea and he yet went in after him, likewise the third and the fourth. However it was already not their will and their intellect that did this. It is like the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:9:6 on "to a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots"), "The waves of the sea appeared like female horses and [the horses of] Egypt were like aroused stallions, and they pursued them until they sank them in the sea. The Egyptian would say to his horse, 'Yesterday, I would drag you to the Nile and you would not follow me; and now, you are sinking me in the sea?' The horse would say to its rider (Exodus 15:1), '"He cast into the sea (<i>rama bayam</i>)" - see what is in the sea (<i>reu ma bayam</i>),' etc." And that is why it stated, "The waters returned and covered the chariots (a noun form that is usually singular, chariot)." The understanding is that one chariot, the first chariot that came into the sea was washed away; "including Pharaoh’s entire army," which came from behind. That is to say, this was also done to Pharaoh's entire army. Once they came into the sea, they were immediately washed away. And nevertheless, not even "one of them remained," outside. Rather, they all went into the sea, even though they saw the first ones drowning. It was not in the power of the rider to stop the chariot, that it not descend [into the sea]. He was driven against his will and drowned in the depths, as mentioned.

"And he said to Moses, 'I, your father-in-law, Yisro, have come to you, and [together with me is] your wife and her two sons are with her (Exodus 18:6).' It seems [Yisro] made himself the essential [focus] when he should have made [Moses'] wife and sons the essential focus. And indeed, [Yisro was correct in his wording] as he knew the truth. The essential [purpose of the] his journey was his own conversion, and therefore he said, 'I, your father-in-law, Yisro, have come... as this is the main point of my arrival.' However, due to his great humility, he was afraid that Moses might not accept him. [And so] he added, 'and your wife and her two sons,' since he also came to bring his sons and wife to him. Nevertheless, Moses understood this from the way he phrased it, especially after hearing from God that his coming was for the sake of Heaven, as mentioned.

<b>From amidst</b> the Children of Israel, to be priests for me: This is, at first glance, all extra. And it should have said, "Aharon your brother and his sons, Nadav, etc." However from the angle that we wrote adjacently, it is because Moshe had to bring him close, since Aharon was embarrassed and afraid to approach, to take greatness and majesty with this. But lest one say the opposite, that he had to bring Aharon close because of the great amount of work with the service that was given to him, and Aharon did not want to approach until Moshe brought him close with his hands - for at first glance, what is the greatness that is given to him with this, is he not giving him slavery - that is why Scripture says it is not like this. For this coming close is 'from amidst (<i>mitokh</i>) the Children of Israel.' And at first glance, it would have been enough to say, "from the Children of Israel." However it is an indication about the interior (<i>tokh</i>) of the Children of Israel, which is their internality, their goodly lifeforce and the light that streams within them. For is not God among them? And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (see Alshikh) about the verse (Exodus 25:8), "And let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them" - "it does not say, 'in it,' but rather, 'among them." This is saying that the Divine Presence dwells among each and every one. So it comes out that the interior of the Children of Israel is filled with amazing lights which come to them from the King of the worlds, blessed be He and blessed be His name, due to their great holiness. And with all of their importance, I did not choose one of them to stand before Me to serve Me besides he that I chose from the interior of the Children of Israel. For is there not 'a high one who watches over him that is high; and there are yet higher ones over them?' So the dwelling of His Divine Presence, may He be blessed, flows much more in him than in them, for there is no measure (limit) to the dwelling of His Divine Presence, may He be blessed. So you will find that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 39a) "The Divine Presence dwells with every group of ten." But they [also] said (Berakhot 6a), "The Divine Presence is even with one person who sits and involves himself with Torah." And in the Temple, there was [also] the dwelling of the Divine Presence. But certainly the one is not like the other. For the dwelling of His Divine Presence, may He be blessed, in the House of of our God is certainly not similar to His dwelling among ten Jews and to one! And it is similar (see the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, there in Sanhedrin) to that which a heretic asked Rabban Gamliel, "You said that the Divine Presence is with every group of ten, etc. How many Divine Presences do you have, etc." And he compared it for him to the light of the sun which gives light through a hole, a window, a doorway and a patio; and similarly the shine that comes through the hole is dissimilar to the shine that comes through the window and the doorway and that which is similar (see there). Hence behold from the interior of the Children of Israel, I have elevated a small selection; with My holy oil - which indicates kingship - have I anointed him. And it is all "to serve me as a priest." And kohen (priest) is an expression of elevation, as in, "the kohen of Midian" (Exodus 18:1). And this is [the meaning of] a kohen for Me - for Me Myself, to enter before Me and inside, to perform the special service for which no one else is allowed to enter there. And from all of these things, any understanding ear will understand this authority and greatness that has no comparison. All the more so Aharon, the holy one of the Lord - he certainly understood this and more! So he certainly would have run to this thing with all the efforts of his strength, with the literal giving up of his life, were it not for his great humility that he had and his great understanding of this greatness. Such that he was embarrassed to approach until Moshe actively brought him close. And Scripture says, "Open your eyes and see his importance that I have commanded more and more!"

And it is possible that the verse also hints to this above in Parshat Shemini, when it states, "and they brought before the Lord a strange fire, which He had not commanded them": For the Sages, may their memory be blessed said (Yoma 21b), "A fire that consumes fire, that is the fire of the Holy One, blessed be He." The explanation is that someone who has that which is like a fire of flame of the fire of Holy One, blessed be He, burning in his heart for God, that is the fire that consumes fire. The explanation [to this explanation] is that sometimes the burning fire [in a person] that is on account of trembling, trepidation and fear subsides, so that one must hide his face. But they did not do like this, and they were burning with a fire of love, without fear. And that is the strange fire, which He had not commanded them. For the fire of the Holy One, blessed be He, is specifically fire that consumes fire. And therefore, "A fire came forth from before the Lord and consumed them." For it is well known that arousal from below causes arousal from Above. And [with] everything that a person does on Earth, likewise, as it were, does the Holy One, blessed be He, do above corresponding to it, whether for the good or for the opposite, God forbid. So when they aroused themselves with love of burning desire of a fiery flame towards their King, may He be blessed, likewise did a fire come out from in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, towards them in His love for them and consumed them with the burning of the soul, but the body intact, like the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Sanhedrin 52a). That is to say that their souls departed before the light of the Bonfire and were subsumed there, so the light ceased to light up for them. And they died before the Lord, since their souls went out with a breath, with the death of the kiss, with total light, in the light of the Lord. And it is to this that the Sages hinted to [when they said] that they did not marry wives, etc. For the aspect of fear in the verse (Proverbs 31:30), "a woman with the fear of the Lord," is intended to be about the aspect of the Feminine in the secret of the verse, as is well known. They did not marry wives, since they did not enter into the flesh of fear, as it is stated (Psalms 78:63), hence "Fire consumed their young men" because "their maidens remained unwed." As they did not turn their faces from looking at God out of their fear. So the fire consumed their candles in the light of the Bonfire. And it possible that they were also hinting to this when they, may their memory be blessed, said (Vayikra Rabbah 20:9), "They entered drunk." For it is well known that the aspect of wine that brings joy is the trait of 'guarded wine,' from His grapes. As the love towards God is very potent and powerful there, as is well known to those who taste from the Tree of Life. So they died from this great love without being preceded by fear, like the matter that has been said.

<b>And to understand</b> the might of God here by way of a parable: A thorn penetrated very deep into the hand of a man's young son, and he knows that if the thorn remains in his hand, a great pain will spread from there and no medication will be effective afterward. So he wants to remove it from there but is unable to do so without piercing deep and with great strength, since it is very difficult for him to remove it. What does he do? He takes a sharp and pointy knife and cuts into the hand of his son with great might and cruelty. So the infant yells out, and his voice reaches the heavens. But he pays no attention and cuts deeply until the place that he is able to reach and takes out the thorn from his son's hand. And behold the heart of everyone who understands will understand how very great the pain and the consternation is for the father at the time that he cuts his son's hand, as it is truly hard for him to endure it. However, out of his great love for his son, he turns his heart into a heart of stone and becomes cruel to his beloved son; he girds himself with great might and suppresses his mercy and kindness towards his son. So he does not hear the voice of his crying out and does what he needs to because of his love for his son. It is exactly like this when the Jewish people sinned with great and severe sins: Then thorns and brambles from all the aspects of the husks and the external forces penetrated their spirits in such a way that if He would leave them there, God forbid, their pain would spread more and more, and there would, God forbid, not be any getting up after their fall. And that is why He sent enemies against them, to afflict them with all types of afflictions and to weaken their strength with all types of punishments — with pestilence, the sword, famine, captivity, and destruction — to the point that it reaches the neck. So that, in this way, the thorns and brambles around them will be removed from them and they will, God willing, get up at the end of days. And the greatness of the very great pain and duress, as it were, to Him, blessed be He, from the troubles of the Jewish people with all of this is certainly beyond belief and is beyond being recounted in a book written by a man with ink. And this is like their statement, may their memory be blessed (Sanhedrin 46a:15), "When a man suffers, what does the divine presence say? 'I am distressed about My head'"; and like its stating, <i>In all their troubles He was troubled, etc.</i> (Isaiah 63:9), as it were. And [this is the case,] particularly when His great name was profaned by the enemies with the destruction of the temple, when they said, <i>Where is their God, the rock on which they relied for shelter</i> (Deuteronomy 32:37), whereas it was certainly in God's power to wipe them out in an instant. However, His love for the Jewish people had become so great, to the point that He suppressed His mercy with very very great might in seeing what the nations did to His children and to tolerate all of the curses and blasphemies and remain still towards them. But all of it is in order that good will come from this to the Jewish people.

<b>And this is what appears correct:</b> Behold, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Tanchuma, Sh'lach 5:1): "Send men, etc." (Numbers 13:1) - this text is related (to Isaiah 44:18), "They neither know nor understand; for their eyes are stuck shut so that they cannot see." What did He see, to say, "Send men," after the episode of Miriam? It is simply that it was anticipated by the Holy One, blessed be He, that they would come and utter evil speech against the land [of Israel]. The Holy One, blessed be He, had said that they should not [be able to] say, "We did not know what the penalty for evil speech was." For that reason, the Holy One, blessed be He, put this [story] next to the one [in which] Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, because she had spoken [slander] against her brother, etc. But even so, they did not desire to learn. To here is [the midrash]. But behold, according to this, that which Scripture says above (in the section preceding this), "And Miriam spoke to Aharon about Moshe, etc.," is meaning to say, it is a wonder! The wonder is how two righteous people like this could do something like that, to speak evil speech. For it is well known that it is almost more severe than all of the sins in the Torah; and especially about Moshe, the man of God, who ascended into the heavens. Who would not be afraid about speaking against him! However the Cause of causes, blessed be He, is the One who is awesome in [His] plans for people, such that the thing happened for several reasons: 1) In order to publicize the virtues of Moshe, our teacher, who is the master of the prophets; and God came to elevate him, so that his fear would be on the faces of people. 2) To publicize that the Holy One, blessed be He and blessed be His name, does not neglect the reward of any creature. So it is like the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, "Miriam waited a short time for Moshe, etc. Hence all of the Jewish people stopped for her for seven days, etc." (Sotah 9b). And 3) It - and this is the main one - is in the manner of the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, "The Jewish people was not fitting for such an episode. Rather, it was to give a claim to penitents, etc." (Avodah Zarah 4b). And likewise, Aharon and Miriam  were not fitting for that speech, were it not because the Jewish people [would] say, "Send men before us, etc." And Moshe took counsel with the Omnipresent, and His blessed name arranged that the matter of Aharon and Miriam would be first. For maybe, as a result of it, the scouts would see the rebuke for themselves and not speak evil slander against the land. For from the language of [the Sages], may there memory be blessed - in that they said, "What did He see, to say, 'Send men,' after the episode of Miriam" - it is implied that the Jewish people's saying, "Send me," was before the episode of Miriam. For if not, there is no reason to wonder about this: Perhaps that is how it was, this episode was after that episode! But it follows that since it was before the episode of Miriam, it was certainly [also] after the coming together of the elders, for it is surely from this that Miriam's speech was drawn. For Miriam was next to Tzipporah when it was said to Moshe (Numbers 11:27), "Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp." [In response,] Tzipporah said, "Woe to the wives of those [men], etc." - as per the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Sifrei, Bemidbar 99:1; cited in Yalkut Shimoni on Torah 736; and Rashi on Numbers 12:1). However the Cause of causes, blessed be He and blessed be His name, waited to answer and say, "You send," until He arranged for the speech of Aharon and Miriam, and that which happened to the righteous Miriam as a result of it, first - so that the scouts would accept the rebuke and be afraid for their lives, to say evil slander. Yet even though the scouts saw this with their eyes, they did not place it into their hearts to be afraid of this, but acted according to their evil wills. And it is to this that they, may their memory be blessed, hinted to with their words, "this text is related to, 'They neither know nor understand; for their eyes are stuck shut so that they cannot see.'" The understanding of this is that they did not want to know and to understand, even from what they saw with their eyes, not to do this.

Also that which he states, <i>this day, etc.</i> is in the manner of the statement of the sages, may their memory be blessed (Sanhedrin 98a), that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked the Messiah, "When will the Master come?" He said to him, "Today, etc.," until <i>today if you will listen to his voice</i> (Psalms 95:7). And you have been shown to know with this that if the entirety of the Jewish people would truly listen to the voice of God one day, they would be redeemed. And this is [the meaning] of his saying, <i>Be silent and listen, etc.: This day you are becoming a people to the Lord, your God.</i> Meaning to say that in one day alone, you are able to arrive at a wonderous and very great elevation, such that you become a nation to the Lord, your God, and no foreign hands will rule over you. Hence, <i>You are to listen to the voice of the Lord, your God</i>. For is there a sweeter [pronouncement] than this, which can raise you in one day to a very great level to take refuge under His wings? Selah.
