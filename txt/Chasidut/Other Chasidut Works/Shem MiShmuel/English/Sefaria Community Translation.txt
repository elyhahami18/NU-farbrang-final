<b><i>Now that the man has become like one of us, etc., what if he should stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever? So the Lord God banished him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil from which he was taken. And He drove the man out, etc.</i>:</b> And one should be precise — as once it wrote, "and He banished [<i>veyishalach</i>]," then it went back and wrote, "and He drove out  [<i>veyigaresh</i>]," which is the same thing! And in Tanna deBei Eliyahu: <i>And He drove the man out</i> teaches that He divorced the man, and that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him a divorce [<i>gerushin</i>] like a woman. [Yet] it is still not resolved. For a woman's divorce is not [described] with the expression, <i>gerushin</i>, at all [in the Torah], bur rather with the expression, <i>shiluach</i>! So [this is what is] apparent: That behold, his honorable holiness, my father, our master, teacher, and rabbi, may his memory be for a blessing for life in the world to come, explained the words of Tanna deBei Eliyahu, "He gave him a divorce like a woman," is that with the divorce of a woman, she is nevertheless called a divorcee even though she is still with him at home. So the expression, divorcee [<i>gerushah</i>], is that the connection between her and her husband is severed. So this is what Tanna deBei Eliyahu is saying, that earlier the man had cleaving and connection with God, may He be blessed. But now, he was divorced like a woman, and the connection was severed. And with this, he explained the words of the midrash [Bereishit Rabbah], Chapter 56, which compares the tests of our father, Abraham, peace be upon him, to divorce. And that is that since our father, Abraham, peace be upon him, was clinging to God, may He be blessed, it is not fitting to call it a test. For none of the things in this world could hold any place compared to his clinging. Therefore his connection and clinging were taken away from him with each test. And this is [the meaning of], <i>and he saw the place from afar</i> (Genesis 22:4). That is that he saw God, may He be blessed — who is called Place [<i>Makom</i>] — far from him. And that is what is called divorce. And the words from the mouth of a sage are grace [<i>chen</i>, also an acronym for hidden wisdom].

<b><i>But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, "You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die"<i> (Genesis 3:3):</i></i></b><i><i> And in Rashi (Rashi on Genesis 3:3): She added to God’s command (which did not forbid touching the tree, but only eating of its fruit); therefore, she was led to diminish from it. It is to this that Solomon says: <i>Do not add unto His words</i> (Proverbs 30:6). But this must be understood. Is it not our obligation, and is it not proper for us to do this, and were we not commanded about it to make a protection for the protection? So she did well to add [the prohibition of] touching so that she would not come to eating. And the law is like this with chametz (leavened grains) in the Talmud (Pesachim 1ob). [There] Rabbi Yehudah made a decree and negated the commandment to search and destroy chametz [if one finds it] during the holiday, lest one come to eating from it since people are not used to separating from it year-round. And [even with] the rabbis who do not make the decree, it is because that he is looking for it to burn it [at this time, so he will not come to eat it]. And Rabbi Meir (Pesachim 11a) also makes the decree even when people do separate from it, such as with the new grain. See there. And, if so, what sin did she sin when she added to the command? And in fact, [it is written] in Avot DeRabbi Natan 1:5 about that which the men of the Great Assembly said (Avot 1:1), "Make a fence for the Torah": And create a fence around your words just as the Holy One, Blessed be He, created a fence around His, and the First Man made a fence around his, etc. What safeguard did First Man make for his words? The verse states, etc. <i>from the tree of knowledge [...] you may not eat, etc.</i> (Genesis 2:17). First Man did not want to tell this to Eve in the same manner that the Holy One, Blessed be He, had told it to him. Rather he told her thus, making a safeguard for his words, [restrictive] to a greater extent than what the Holy One, Blessed be He, told him: <i>But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden God said, "You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die."</i> — because he wanted to guard himself and Eve from the tree, not even to touch. To here are [its words]. It pushes it to say that [the excerpt in Pesachim and Pirkei DeRabbi Natan] are midrashim that disagree. And, regardless, the mishnah in Avot presents a difficulty for Rashi. And it is also difficult in the opposite direction from the verse that Solomon said: <i>Do not add unto His words.</i></i></i>

<b>There</b> in the Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 84:15): <i>Reuben heard, and delivered him</i> – the Holy One blessed be He said, "You were the first to engage in the saving of lives; as you live, they will designate cities of refuge first only within your boundaries." That is what is written: <i>Betzer in the wilderness…[for the Reubenites]</i> (Deuteronomy 4:43). It appears that it can be explained as being since, behold, the [brothers] judged Joseph. And just like they judged Joseph below with the death penalty, so too was it above [in the celestial court]. As it is known that they decide above according to the decision of the Sanhedrin below. And it is, like in the Talmud, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, "My sons have defeated me." And even greater than this is found in the books: At the time that Rambam wrote that one who says that the Holy One, blessed be He, has a body or depiction, God forbid, is called a heretic, many groups that went with such a thought were then expelled from the Garden of Eden. However, when Raavad wrote [in response], "Why did he call such a one a heretic; there were many greats who were better than us who went with this thought according to what they saw in the verses and, even more, what they saw in the words of the homilies which confuse the minds," all of these went back into the Garden of Eden. And likewise, can it be said about Joseph, that at the time that the [brothers] decided his punishment as the death penalty, supernal life departed from him. However, at the time that Reuben saved him, new life was put into him.

The summary of these things is that it is all in one pattern: The four decrees, the four expressions of redemption, the four empires and the four holinesses - which are the three forefathers and our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him; and the three festivals and Shabbat. And the fourth in all of these encompasses the three previous ones.

And it appears that behold, with the plague of hail, it is written: <i>fire flashing in the midst of the hail.</i> And in Rashi: A miracle within a miracle! Fire and hail mingled, although hail is water! But in order to perform the will of their Creator, they made peace with one another. The explanation [of Rashi's words] is that a supernal power above the distinction between fire and water appeared, such that their distinction was negated. And behold [the rabbis], may their memory be blessed, said that the heavens [<i>shamayim</i>] are made up of fire [<i>esh</i>] and water [<i>mayim</i>] which are intermingled with one another. And that is since a great supernal light, which is above the distinction between fire and water, shines upon them so much that the fire and water negate themselves to it. Hence they are able to live [together in one place]. And that is why he explained in this <i>extend your arm towards the heavens</i>, that it was to bring down the plague from this supernal place, to which even the heavens, which are fire and water, negate themselves to it. And it is understood that it is above the heavens.  Hence he explained that the Holy One, blessed be He, raised Moses above the heavens so that he could bring down the plague from there. However this matter is not [present] with the plague of darkness. So he did not explain this about it [even though the same phrase is found there]. For our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, did not make such an exact inference from the wording of the verse, but rather explained it like this since they knew the matter was so.

And according to what was said [above], we can aim to understand that which is found in the Midrash: That He sent [word] to him five times, and he did not pay any attention to His words — the Holy One, blessed be He, saying to him, "You have stiffened your neck and you have hardened your heart." As it calculates the five times that the expression of hardening the heart is used: After the wonder of the snake, it is written: <i>Pharaoh’s heart is hard</i> (Exodus 7:14). After the plague of the frogs, it is written: <i>he hardened his heart</i> (Exodus 8:7). After the plague of the mixture of wild animals, it is written: <i>And Pharaoh hardened his heart</i> (Exodus 8:28). After the plague of pestilence, it is written: <i>And the heart of Pharaoh remained hard</i> (Exodus 9:7). And after the plague of hail, it is written: <i>and he hardened his heart, etc.</i> (Exodus 9:34). So since he hardened his own heart and made it impenetrable, this punishment came to him, that the Holy One, blessed be He, [also] hardened his heart and made it impenetrable, as is mentioned above. However, any expression of strengthening of the heart that is written is not counted here. As that is not at all from the same idea as hardening the heart, such that it would not be measure for measure.

<b>In the Pesikta</b>, Parsha 17, Piskah 4: On that same day, the firstborn of Egypt died. How was it? They were struck with the plague of death from the evening, but they were writhing the whole night and died during the day. And what is the reason [to say this]? It is not written, "we have all died," but rather [<i>we are all dying</i> (Exodus 12:33)], "we are all in the process of dying." And simply, it can be said that the reason was so that there would be even more fear and confusion among the Egyptians.


And behold, we have already said that the last three plagues took away [Pharaoh’s] power of intellect, which is characterized by the number three – wisdom, understanding, and knowledge – from the bottom to the top. So it comes out that with the plague of the firstborn, the aspect of wisdom, which is called the first as is well-known, was taken from him. And that is the power to see that which will develop. And with the plague of darkness, the aspect of knowledge was taken. For knowledge is that which distinguishes one thing from another, and darkness is the opposite of this. And with the plague of locusts, the aspect of understanding was taken; and we wrote the reason for this in another place. And so when his downfall came with the plague of the firstborn, all of these powers that he used to have disappeared. And what he had been enhanced with as a goodly present now all enhanced the Jewish people. So the Jewish people acquired the ability to imagine and picture the future very well, and that is included in the <i>great wealth</i> (Genesis 15:14) that they brought out from Egypt, whereas Pharaoh and the Egyptians remained like beasts unto themselves [alluding to Ecclesiastes 3:18], without the power to picture the future.

We should contemplate about the idea of TuBiShevat, why we do not say the supplicational prayers (Tachanun). Is not its being the new year of trees something natural? That most of the year’s rains have fallen, such that the sap has risen in the trees; and from then on, the fruits emerge! If so, what is the idea of not saying the supplicational prayers on it? For it has no holiness and no commandment; no miracle happened on it, nor anything [else] that relates to the Jewish people. About the 15th of Av, [the Sages,] may their memory be blessed, spoke at the end of Taanit in the Talmud about some of the reasons [for it], that there were things that occurred on it that related to the Jewish people. But what is the novelty of Tu BiShevat? And it appears [to me as follows]: That behold it is written (Isaiah 55:10-11), "For as the rain or snow drops from heaven and returns not there, but soaks the earth and makes it bring forth vegetation, etc. So is the word that issues from My mouth, etc." Behold the prophet compared the word of God to the rains that bring things forth [produce]. So it appears that the idea of a tree is something that connects the fruit to the ground; and it is what is in the middle between the fruit and the ground and has the power of connection. And it appears that it carries a hint in its numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>). <i>Ilan</i> (tree) is 91, the numerical equivalent of the names of the Existence and Lordship of God, to which the Heavens and Earth relate. So it is the connection of the Heavens and the Earth.  And we can learn from the essence of the physical about the spiritual; and this is why man is compared to [a tree], as it is written (Deuteronomy 20:19), "for are the trees of the field human beings." For the form of man is to connect the upper realm and the lower realm, in that he has a soul from the upper realm and a body, which bears the soul, from the lower realm. And [the Sages,] may their memory be blessed, said about the reason for the beheaded calf (being killed in its prime, is that it is symbolic), that he (the man murdered) was not allowed to make fruits. What are fruits [here? The fulfillment of] commandments. For the commandments are comparable to the fruit that grows on trees. As in the fruit, it has the spiritual power to sustain and give life to man. This is as per the explanation of the Ari, may his memory be blessed, to the verse (Deuteronomy 8:3), "not by bread alone does man live, but rather by all that issues from the mouth of the Lord does man live" - meaning by that which issues from the mouth of the Lord that is in the bread. And the body of the fruit is what bears the spirituality that is in it. So too are commandments the 248 limbs of the King. and the body of the commandments are what bears the spirituality in the commandment. And when a person does a commandment - since he has the power to connect the higher realm and the lower realm, it therefore comes out that there is the power in the act of the commandment that he does to connect and attach the higher realm and the lower realm, the act of the commandment from the lower realm and the spirituality in it from the higher realm. This is comparable to a tree that has the power to connect, and issues fruit that connects, as mentioned above. And this is so even though there are fruits of the ground (that grow straight from the ground and not from trees) and they have spirituality and that which issues from the mouth of the Lord in them, and it is nevertheless not made by way of an intermediary. And that is like there is also, among places in the world, the place of the Temple, that was always a connection for the upper realm and the lower realm, as per the Midrash, even without man as an intermediary. However the holiness in the commandments is [always] with man as an intermediary. 
Just as rain causes fruits to grow, so too does divine illumination, which is given into people's hearts, awaken a person to produce their own "fruits." This is why the word of God, as conveyed through the prophet, is also compared to rain and snow. Similarly, as our sages said in the first chapter of Rosh Hashanah regarding rainfall: If the people of Israel were entirely wicked on Rosh Hashanah and it was decreed that they would receive only a small amount of rain, but later they repented, it is impossible to increase the amount of rain because the decree has already been issued. Instead, God brings down the rain in its proper time and manner. Conversely, if Israel were completely righteous on Rosh Hashanah and an abundance of rain was decreed for them, but later they regressed, it is impossible to reduce the amount of rain, since the decree has already been issued. Instead, God brings it down at an improper time or in places where it is not needed. The same applies to divine illumination in a person’s heart, which is analogous to rain. On Rosh Hashanah, it is decreed how much divine illumination each person will receive. If they later change, it is impossible to increase or decrease this amount. However, if they are deserving, they receive this illumination at the right time—during Torah study and prayer, or at moments when they need spiritual protection to avoid falling into materialism. Conversely, if they are undeserving, the illumination is given at an inappropriate time, such as during distraction and confusion, causing it to be wasted.
Just as the effects of physical rain become apparent in trees after a third of the year, when the sap rises and the fruits begin to bud, so too, from Rosh Hashanah onward, the righteous—who are immediately inscribed and sealed for life—or from Yom Kippur and the first day of Sukkot onward, which represents "kindness within kindness," when even those undeserving according to strict judgment are drawn closer, receive divine illumination and spiritual awakening day by day, as mentioned above. A person who is not foolish—one who does not waste what is given to them—experiences an increase in vitality and emotional sensitivity. By the time a third of the year has passed, the aspect of the heart in a person is completed, as explained in the Midrash on Parashat Shemot, which states that the heart is positioned in the upper third of the human body. This is analogous to the sap rising in trees, causing the fruit to begin forming.  In this regard, the verse states: **"Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, when he has no heart?"** (Proverbs 17:16). However, after a third of the year has passed and the aspect of the heart has been completed within a person, a clearer period begins for Torah study and divine service. Having passed through the "months of Esau," they now prepare themselves for the four special Torah portions of Adar, Purim, Nissan, Pesach, the Counting of the Omer, and Shavuot. During this time, the days elevate themselves more and more, day by day, becoming periods of spiritual labor in Torah and mitzvot at a higher level than the rest of the year, with greater vitality, emotional sensitivity, and inspiration of the heart. Just as there is a **"New Year for Trees"** (Tu BiShvat), connecting to the above concept, so too for a person—who is compared to a tree—this marks the beginning of a new stage of heightened emotional inspiration beyond what was experienced before. Even for those who have been lax in their divine service until now and do not feel this inspiration, the divine illumination has undoubtedly influenced them in a concealed manner, at the very least. As a result, they have been granted the **aspect of the heart**, and if they take time to reflect, they will find within themselves a deeper sense of heart and spiritual sensitivity than they had before.
Based on the above, we can understand the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel regarding the New Year for Trees. Both ultimately refer to the same fundamental concept: that the physical tree serves as a metaphor for a human being. Both agree that a third of the year is calculated to mark the completion of the aspect of the heart, which is positioned in the upper two-thirds of a person’s body. However, their disagreement arises from their respective perspectives—strict justice (din) vs. kindness (chesed).  Beit Shammai, who follow the attribute of strict justice, align their calculation with those who are judged as righteous on Rosh Hashanah and are immediately inscribed and sealed for life. Their spiritual "rainfall," meaning divine illumination, is decreed at that time. Therefore, according to their view, a third of the year concludes on the first of Shevat, when the aspect of the heart is completed. The natural cycle of trees, which serve as a metaphor for humans, follows this pattern accordingly.  Beit Hillel, who follow the attribute of kindness, begin their calculation from the 15th of Tishrei (the first day of Sukkot), which represents "kindness within kindness." From that point onward, a new reckoning begins, as our sages say: "What has passed has passed; from now on, a new accounting begins." Accordingly, the natural cycle of trees follows this perspective, and the completion of a third of the year—marking the completion of the aspect of the heart—falls on the 15th of Shevat (Tu BiShvat) Thus, the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is not about the fundamental process but rather about which divine attribute governs the calculation—justice or kindness. Each opinion determines the timing of when the aspect of the heart is completed in alignment with their respective perspective.

<b>In the Gemara</b> (Yoma 29a:4): Just as the dawn is the conclusion of the entire night, so too, Esther was the conclusion of all miracles.

So too was the miracle of Purim light reflecting back from the second Temple, and it shone for them even as they were still in exile. And this is a model for all of our exiles mentioned above, in which light shines upon us from the future redemption even when we are still in the darkness of exile.

What comes out from this for us is that miracles of the second type — that are not the negation of nature, but rather that nature only acts according to the will of the Holy One, blessed, be He — is more of a novelty. And it will be so in the future to come, as it is written: <i>When you pass through water, I will be with you; through streams, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire, you shall not be scorched; through flame, it shall not burn you</i> (Isaiah 43:2). That means that it will not be like with the splitting of the Red Sea and the rising up of the waters of the Jordan into one heap. Instead, fire and water, just as they are, will be elevated to the point where they will feel the will of the Omnipresent, and they will only do His will, may His name be blessed. And through this, we have explained the words of the midrash [on Parashat] Vayeshev (Bereisht Rabbah 84:8), "Why was it that <i>they hated him</i> (Genesis 37:4) — because the sea would split before them," according to its straightforward meaning: For the splitting of the Red Sea was still lowly in their eyes, and they thought of Judah as the king, and that his level would be like that of the messianic king, and like in the future to come, as mentioned above; that the sea would not hurt them even without the splitting, and as it is written, <i>When you pass through water, I will be with you, etc.</i>. And they thought that the impediment to this was Joseph, as he did not submit himself to Judah. And as a result, [God's] supervision was in the merit of Joseph [and not Judah], and his merit only reached the splitting of the Red Sea and not to a greater level, as mentioned above.

And it appears like this: Note that in the holy Zohar [it states] that the unification during the week is through Metatron, and on Shabbat through the Righteous One, the Life of the worlds, without any intermediary. And we have already said that this is [the meaning of] that which we say before kiddush, "Your leaving should be in peace [<i>tzeitchem leshalom</i>]," is to indicate that the Jewish people is clinging to God, may He be blessed, without any intermediary angels. And we can say that the reason is because Shabbat is [given] to the Jewish people in the merit of Moses, as we say in the prayer, "Moses shall rejoice in the giving of his portion." Hence this aspect that our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, acquired shines then. And through this, we can explain Rashi's words, "It is a soothing rest and not a temporary rest." And my glorious holy father, our master, teacher and rabbi, may his memory be for a blessing for life in the world to come, already dealt with this: Is not a sukkah [hut] that is fit for seven days not called a temporary dwelling? So why is the rest of Shabbat, which is only one day, called a soothing rest and not temporary? And he said it is because work was forbidden forever on Shabbat, since Shabbat is the day of the soul. Just like the soul itself does not have any more connection to work, so too is it with the Shabbat. And this is the explanation of, "it is as if all of his work was already done." Indeed, with the end of Shabbat, it is as if he comes to another world where work is relevant, so that work is again permissible. To here are his [words]. And according to our approach about the topic of the knot of tefillin that [God] showed to Moses, and that in Moses' merit the Jewish people inherited Shabbat, which is in this aspect of being without an intermediary and without any lacking, the things are understood [even] better.

The Medrash on the verse :"אדם כי יהי' בעור בשרו"...This can be compared to a matron that entered into the palace of the king.  When she saw the fools who were gathered there, she became frightened of them.  The King said: Don't be afraid these are man and maid servants, but you only need to drink and be happy.  So too, when the Jews heard the laws of leprosy they became frightened, Moses said these laws belong to the nations of the world, but you only have to eat and drink and be merry." The question is famous: The nations of the world never become impure through leprosy! (How then could Moshe have said that the laws of leprosy belong to the nations of the world?) (3) My father answered that the very fact that we separate the METZORA and send him out of the camp is precisely to prevent negative forces any connection to the entire Jewish community who are left completely pure. (4)  However, what is left unclear is why the laws of Metzora are used specifically as a way of siphoning off the impurity of negative forces?  Even those who serve idols, immorality and murder are not sent out of the camp of the Jewish camp, and those with seminal emissions are also not sent out the camp, (but the Metzora is completely cast out!)
(1)It would appear that we see in the Medrash Rabbah at the end of the Torah portion: שאת refers to Babylon, ספחת to Media, בהרת is Greece, and נגע צרעת refers to Rome.   This is difficult to understand, because צרעת is the accumulation of all the other elements, and is not a affliction in and of itself? (Why then is צרעת compared to a new nation of Rome?)  (2)This could be understood by examining the Medrash at the end of Shmini which states that Daniel saw the first three kingdoms on one night and the last kingdom on one night.  Moses devoted 1 verse to the three kingdoms, and 1 verse to the final kingdom.  why is this? Rabbi Yochanan says that the final kingdom is equal to all three of them, and Reish Lakish says that the final kingdom says that the final kingdom excedes the three. (3) The matter is thus: the fourth kingdom being equal or  exceeding the first three is not by chance.
It appears that man has 3 elements to him - his NEFESH, RU'ACH and NESHAMA, or his body, his soul and his intellect, and there is no real difference between these terms.  Philosophers have attempted to understand how the soul which is spiritual can connect to the physical soul.  My teacher of blessed memory stated that there is a fourth force and that is called the 'image of G-d' which connects all three of these elements because it is equivalent to all of them, and the philosophers do not know this.  It would appear that the four names we call man - , ENOSH,GEVER, ISH, ADAM(relate to these 4 elements).  ENOSH is the perspective of the body which is a mortal, weak strength.  GEVER relates to the NEFESH which has in it the capability to overcome the physical desires of the body, and ISH relates to his intellect.  (ISH) has connotations of being on top of all the others like ISH NAOMI.  ISH means the master of the house.  This (gives added depth to what) the Rabbis have explained that the evil inclination.  First it is like a traveller, then a guest in one's house, and then finally ISH (i.e. it becomes the master of the house).  ADAM corresponds to the image of G-d which connects them all, and in Gematriya ADAM = 45 which relates to G-d's holy name.  These words are ancient.
..However it is known that G-d made a balance of these concepts so that the strength of the dark forces (against the 4 levels of greatness of man mentioned previously) whose purpose is to pull against man, and to put him into their power.  These are the three cardinal sins which are the head and source of all the sins.  They are idolatory, immorality and murder. As the Maharal has explained (in Netzach Yisrael). (1)Idolatory stands against the intellect of man.  In contrast to the straight intellect which is planted in the heart of man, a crooked intellect has been created which will  lead to serving idols as were served in the time of Enosh (as expounded in the Rambam, Yesodei Hotorah) that they created the concept of idols in their intellects. (2)Immorality is created against the body.  The body was created to be the 'carrier' of the soul, and to be subservient to its tasks (according to the writings of the Kuzari pt.3). Against it was created the strength which pulls one to be pulled after animal actions (of immorality), and (3) murder is balanced against the spirit, because it was created to rule over both the intellect and the body, and to lead them wherever the spirit is taken to serve G-d.  This is the meaning of "Limshol" to rule over the world and pull it towards G-d.  This is what Man first said "Let us go and bow to G-d.  Against this, was created the force to rule over everything, and to smash under his feet anything which stands against his desires, until he comes to anger, jealousy, and murder.
Against these three things that pull a person

And on the face of it, it is an impossible thing! How could the text say that all of the congregation of Israel should be holy! Holiness is beyond even the greatest among Israel, since not every person can merit to be called holy. And it is a positive commandment for every human. And this is extraordinary: even though every person is what they are, they can still be holy. And it seems that the explanation is that each, according to what The Holy One commands each person, that person needs to separate and comprehend their standing. The holiness of simple people is not appropriate for those who are in a higher standing, and a person who understands what for them is materialism and coarseness and separates themselves from it, that is holiness. But for those in a higher level that is not holiness at all, and a person in that standing needs to separate from other things, constantly - even if for the simple people their separating constantly from their materialism is real and great kedushah. And the general rule is that this is a general mitzvah but for each person it will look like a different mitzvah, as there is a different holiness, as each person needs to make holy their tendencies that their nature gives them.

And likewise the [Sages’] statement, may their memory be blessed, that the Torah was given at Mount Sinai, again at the Tent of Meeting and a third time on the Plains of Moav, can be explained as being parallel to those three parts of a person: At Mount Sinai, corresponds to the intellect, as mentioned above. At the Tent of Meeting, corresponds to the soul, the place of the sacrifices, which are ‘a soul for a soul,’ and ‘its interior bedecked with love from the daughters of Jerusalem’ – which are the forces of the soul, as mentioned above. The Plains (<i>Aravot</i>) of Moav, from the usage, <i>aravah</i> (wilderness), which is darkness, corresponds to the forces of the body. And the intent is that the Jewish people should be complete with the Torah in intellect, in soul and in body, to be completely holy, such that the complete rectification be accomplished. 
However, an act of the Satan succeeded. As at Mount Sinai, they made the [golden] calf, such that the sin of idolatry is a sin of the intellect. At the Tent of Meeting, there was the sin of the scouts when they rejected the precious land, and [exhibited] fear of the seven nations – such that all of this was a sin of the soul, the seat of which is in the heart. The Plains of Moav was the sin of the daughters of Moav, which was with the body. And some from each of these remained for [all] the generations. [About] the sin of the calf, it is stated (Exodus 32:24), “but on the day when I take account, etc.” [About] the sin of the scouts, it is stated (Psalms 107:26-27), “So He raised His hand [in oath] to make fall […] their offspring among the nations and scatter them through the lands.” And they cried an empty crying, but it was established as a crying for the generations. [About] the sin of the Plains of Moav, it is stated in Yehoshua (22:17), “Is the sin of Peor such a small thing to us? We have not purified ourselves from it.”
But it appears that even though there will not be a general rectification until the days of the Messiah, there was nevertheless a little rectification for these three [sins] through [the Tabernacle at] Shilo, the First Temple and the Second Temple. Shiloh, which was in the portion of Yosef, corresponds to the intellect, the domicile of which is in the brain. And Yosef was in the aspect of the head. This is like the midrash in Parshat Vayechi, [in which] he said to the tribes, “I am the head and you are the body,” as it is stated (Deuteronomy 33:16), “let this be visited upon Yosef’s head, and upon the head of the one set apart from his brothers.” The First Temple, in which the Divine Presence rested was a rectification of the heart, the domicile of the soul. For [God’s] love was displayed in it, as it is written in Rashi on Shir HaShirim (6:5) on the verse, “Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me.” And it is called Levanon, since it is the <i>lev</i> (heart) of the Jewish people, as per the Midrash. The Second Temple lacked five things and was not on the level of the First Temple, but rather as the body is compared to the soul. And understand [this].

<b>And in the holy Zohar,</b> [it is written] that Balak sent for Balaam, since he had the first two letters of Amalek in him, whereas Balak had the last two letters. And it can be explained that behold since Balaam had the power of speech, it is necessary to say that he also had the power of thought, for it makes little sense to have the power of speech without the power of thought. And behold, it is well-known about Amalek that he was a destroyer, son of a destroyer, who separated between the mind and the heart. That is to say that, even though the mind analyzes, the traits of the heart are not moved by it. And this separation is possible in three ways: It can be from the side of the mind that impacts — since the mind is weak, such that it does not enlighten the depths of the heart. Or it can be from the side of the receiver, meaning that the heart is closed and does not accept the enlightenment of the mind. Or it can be from both of them together. And they are hinted to in the letters of Amalek. The first letters, <i>ayin, mem</i>, are an expression of dimming <i>aimum</i>, which is the darkening of the mind. And the last two, <i>lamed, kof</i> are an expression [like the usage], <i> like a dog laps up [yalok]</i> (Judges 7:5), and that is the craving of the physical to fill its desire. As that is the idea of a dog, to receive without impacting. This is like it is in the Talmud Nedarim (24a:3), " I am not a dog, that I benefit from you and you do not benefit from me." And the craving of the heart only to fill its desire is the closing off of the heart from the enlightenment of the mind. For anyone who is running after his desire has his heart sealed and closed from any wisdom. And so, Amalek — which is the ultimate cutting off and division — had all four letters. But behold, Balaam, who had an evil eye, which is from the angle of thought that is related to the mind, had the two first letters. Whereas Balak had the last two letters, in that his action came from the power of the traits that are ascribed to the heart. But Balaam also had something additional, in that he also had the power of speech in him, <i>he whom you bless is blessed, etc.</i> (Numbers 22:6). This is something that Sihon and Og did not have, as they were separated branches, as mentioned above. And it makes sense that Amalek — in that both of the bad forces were in one person, as mentioned above — also had the power of speech as well, which comes from a combination of the mind and the heart, as mentioned above. And that is [the meaning] of Balak's sending for Balaam. As, in the two of them, they have all four letters of Amalek, such that all of the evil forces, thought, speech, and action, were completed in them. Hence they would have the power to stand up against Moses, as mentioned above.

But it appears that he fixed this with that which was said to him, <i>I have shown it to you with your eyes</i> (Deuteronomy 34:4). That is that in our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, seeing Gehinnom and everything that is in it, he brought up everyone who would have been fit to go up with his passing through [it]. And it is like Ari, may his memory be blessed, explained about that which [the sages], may their memory be blessed, said, "he put his eyes upon him and he became a pile of bones," that this is from the powers of the eye, since it extracted all the visible sparks of holiness, so only the bones remained. Likewise did Moses certainly have this power, such that he extracted what was fit to extract with his glance. And not only this, but it is certainly like they, may their memory be blessed, expounded about that which is written, <i>to the furthest sea</i> (Deuteronomy 11:24) — "to the furthest sea" is that he saw all the events until the dead will be revived. So, too, when he saw Gehinnom, he saw all the events until the dead will be revived. And, if so, just like he extracted those found [there] then with this sight, so too would it always work to extract [those there], as if he was passing through at that time. For this seeing is above order and nature, just like he saw with it until the dead would be revived, given that [this sight] is above time. So, too, is it above time regarding the extraction [of those in Gehinnom].

<b>"And these words will be, which I command you today, on your heart"</b> (Devarim 6:6) And there's what to understand that seemingly the language "<i>in</i> your heart" would be more justified, like it says <b>"In your mouth and in your heart to do it"</b> (Devarim 30:14). And so said the elders of our master, our teacher, our rabbi, the great, the memory of the righteous be for a blessing and the world to come, from Kotzk. He told that the words need to be laid like a stone on the heart. And when the heart opens at special times, they will fall into it (this being the end of his [direct] holy speech). Meaning, the heart at most times is closed and the words don't enter within the heart. And in any case, a person cannot give up, rather they should do their own, and should not pay attention to their feeling that the words are not entering into their heart and are not having any action. Rather, the words should be laid like a stone on the outside of the heart and [a person] should not be concerned, and so, when a time comes that the heart opens, at sacred times and suchlike, then immediately the words will fall into the heart.

<b>The matter</b> of sheva berakhot (seven blessings said in honor of a bride and groom) is that seven is a communal number. And at the time of marriage, one becomes a communal person. This is like [the Sages'] statement, may their memory be blessed (Rosh Hashanah 32b), "Since many will come out (be born) from her, she is like a community." And since the number, sheva berakhot, is relevant to him - meaning, that the communal force which is in Him, may He be blessed, is [now also] within him - this [new status] requires sheva berakhot. 
<b>The reason</b> for the commandment to cause the groom and bride to rejoice is surely that which the Ikkarim (Maamar 3 33:9) wrote - that joy gives permeance to a thing. And by marriage, a person makes it that there will permeance to his line forever. It is like it is written in the [text of the] sheva berakhot, "an everlasting structure." That is why the commandment to make them rejoice appears; in order that there will be everlasting permanence [for them].

And in contemplating the commandment of the first fruits (<i>bikkurim</i>), it can be said that its special property is also that it has the lofty power within it to draw a person to accept the yoke of the kingdom of the Heavens upon himself. Meaning, to negate all seven of the traits of his soul to God, may He be blessed, as mentioned above. And that is since the first fruits is practiced with seven species. And in the Yalkutei Torah from the Ari, may his memory be blessed, [it is said] that the root force of the seven species is in the kingdom of the Heavens, from the seven supernal traits. To here are his words. And even though we do not have any business with the secrets, it can nevertheless be explained on a simple level regarding the first fruits. For a person desires the new fruit, especially if he toiled upon them for a whole year, such that a person 'wants his singular portion.' So 'when a person sees a fig that has come out first, etc.,' and he separates it out for the Heavens, this is symbolic of giving over all of his desires to God, and the seven species hint to the seven traits. And we have already said that this is the matter of the seven commandments that exist in the first fruits, as is written by the Rambam. Hence it can be said that the special property of this commandment for a Jew is to arouse a negation of his seven traits to the will of God, may He be blessed, regarding all things for the whole year. And hence a heavenly voice blesses him, "May you repeat the bringing of the first fruits today next year." And it is implied that the power of this special quality continues for the whole year; and that is the idea of accepting the yoke of the kingdom of the Heavens, as mentioned above. And that is the start and the foundation of all matters of service [to God], as per the holy Zohar mentioned above. For if he does not first accept that, he has not done anything. And according to what has been said, the reason for the prohibition of placing [the separation of] the tithe before the first fruits is understood. For without having the yoke of the kingdom of the Heavens first, one cannot serve [God].

And the content of the blowing of the shofar is a broken heart - moaning, wailing, like sick people moan or like one wails about his dead. And that is that a person sees himself as if his powers have already disappeared due to his sickness, or as if he has already died and has no hope. But behold he is purified by the breaking of his heart, like the matter of a clay vessel, which is purified by breaking it. So the Satan is no longer able to accuse [them of sins], since their impurity has removed itself from them. Yet there is nevertheless hope about them for the [Satan]. He is [however] a foolish old king, as he thinks that maybe because of their subjugation and the breaking of their heart they will fall into the pits of sadness, despair and black humor, as this is the worst of all. Hence he still makes efforts to bring piles of iniquities and to accuse, in order that this will cause sadness and despair to the Jewish people below, God forbid. However when he sees that they go back and blow the shofar while they are standing - that is, that they are aroused with new life and hold the commandments dear - then the hands of the Satan weaken and he loses all hope. So he is confused and no longer knows what to do. But he is afraid to continue bringing piles of sins and to accuse, lest from the accusation, the Jewish people will add to their arousal and their new life to the point that the [verse] will be fulfilled, "If only My people would listen to Me, if Israel would follow My paths, then would I subdue their enemies at once, strike their foes again and again" (Psalms 81:14-15). And it is as they said, 'If you will listen to His voice today, He will blow the great shofar [of redemption],' so that the time will come for [the Satan] to be swallowed up.

<b>And [the following is] apparent,</b> since you should note the Talmud, Yoma (54b): And the Sages say: [The world] was created from Zion, as it is stated: <i> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty</i> (Psalms 50:2) — from the perfection of beauty of the world. And also there: And the Sages say: Both these and those [the heavens and the earth] were created from Zion. This appears to be its explanation: Behold it is impossible for this physical world alone in its essence to have any connection with the spiritual world. It is, like [it is written] in the Zohar (Introduction 10:59), that the higher beings do not even tolerate cloaks of this world. So there is a need for an intermediary. And similar to this did the [Sages] may their memory be blessed, say that it is impossible for there to be a connection between the soul and the body without an intermediary. And it is certainly so with the world in general. And it is well known that any intermediary must have a little of the aspect of this and a little of the aspect of that. Hence it has in its power to be the intermediary and to connect this and that. The Sages, therefore, said that Zion is the intermediary, since it has things from the upper world, as is well known. For the space for the ark is not of [its] measure, which is the opposite of the nature of the physical. And not only this, even [anywhere] in Jerusalem, no one said to his fellow, "The place is too tight." And they stood crowded together but bowed down with room. And ten miracles happened in the Temple. Since it was all from the aspect of the upper world, even though it was physical, like any substance in the world. And since it has aspects of both worlds, it is, hence, the intermediary between these two worlds. And that is why the beginning of the creation of the world was there; so that there would be no time in the world that this soul would be completely separated from the upper world. As on account of the separation, it would not have life at all and would be negated from existence. Nevertheless, the revelation of this life is dependent upon cleanliness from the evil forces that spread out in the world. For if it were revealed while the evil forces are spreading, they too would receive additional life. And this is similar to the light that was created on the first day, which was stored away because of the wicked, such that they do not use it. And we have already explained that they should not take this light, which is great love, for foreign love. And, thus, is it regarding the life [that comes] from the upper world to the lower. And it is like the matter of Abraham, who did not want to bless Isaac, so that Esau would not also receive [benefit] from this blessing. And, hence, also at this time when the side of impurity has spread out in the world, this connection is very hidden and is not apparent with the revelation of any difference in the substance of Zion, such that it should be elevated from the nature of all substance of the earth.

In the holy Zohar (Emor 45:289): On that day, Jacob was at the head of the celebration. This can be explained [as follows]: Behold it is known that the seven days of the Festival (Sukkot) are modeled on the seven weeks of the counting of the Omer, and Shemini Atzeret is modeled on the holiday of Shavuot. And in the midrash, [it says] that it should have been separated [from the first day of Sukkot] by 50 days, like Shavuot is from Passover, except for the burden of [celebrating during] the rainy season. And the intention is like that which was mentioned above, that there is a light from the 50th gate on [Shavuot]. And it is well known that the 50th gate includes all of the previous 49 gates. Hence Jacob was at the head of the celebration [then], because Jacob was all-inclusive.
