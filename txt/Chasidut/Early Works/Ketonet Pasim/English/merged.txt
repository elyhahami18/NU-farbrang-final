Ketonet Pasim

Vayikra

































<b>And from that,</b> it appears to me that the Talmud in Megaillah (7b) can be explained: Rava said, “One is obligated to become spiced (inebriated) on Purim until he does not know the difference between, cursed is Haman, and, blessed is Mordekhai, etc.” And there are many <b>interpretations</b> about this. But did the ‘strap become loosened,’ God forbid, on a day in which such a miracle was done?!? And what appears correct to me is <b>that which I heard from my teacher</b>: ‘Even though these forbid and those permit, these and those are the words of the living God.’ But it is a wonder, how is this possible? So he explained that with the secret of the six extremities, there is right and left, Kindness (<i>Chesed</i>) and Might (<i>Gevurah</i>). And from that angle, there are those that forbid and these that permit. But with the secret of Understanding (<i>Binah</i>), which is called the Living God – and upwards from there – everything is unified. And understand [this]; ‘and the words of a sage are grace (<i>chen</i>, also an abbreviated reference for secret wisdom).’ 
And with this, “One is obligated to become spiced on Purim, etc.,” is understood. It is meaning to say that on Purim, there is great enlightenment in all of the world by way of the revelation of Father, who is called, “And Mordekhai left from before the king” (Esther 8:15), and as it is written <b>in the writings</b>, see there. So behold that the Foundation (<i>Yesod</i>)  rises to Knowledge (<i>Daat</i>); and with Knowledge, it is able to sweeten and spice all of the Stringencies with the Kindnesses, as I explained above, in the explanation of the [passage] in the Talmud (Berakhot 33a), “Knowledge was placed between two letters,” see there. And Knowledge includes Wisdom (<i>Chokhmah</i>) and Understanding, as it is written in the Mishnah (Avot3:17), “If there is no understanding, there is no knowledge, etc.” And in Understanding, everything is unified, there is no Satan or evil encounter. And this is [the meaning] of that which is written; since it is there in Knowledge, that he does not know the difference between, cursed is Haman, and, blessed is Mordekhai. And understand [this].

And with this, it is understood [why] it was necessary to write two warnings (negative commandments) - “nothing fermented (chametz) is to be seen with you; and no leaven is to be seen with you” (Exodus 13:7). For it is to destroy two types of evil impulse: The one of arrogance is called leaven, as mentioned earlier; and the one of lowliness, listlessness and inappropriate modesty without thought is called chametz. As there is only a [slight] something differentiating chametz from matza (they are spelled with almost all of the same letters). And matza is called the bread of destitution (Deuteronomy 16:3), as it is submission and humility with thought - thought being called something. But chametz is modesty without thought, as mentioned above. And it is simple to understand.
