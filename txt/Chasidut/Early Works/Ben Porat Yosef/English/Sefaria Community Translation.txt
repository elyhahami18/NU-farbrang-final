Foreword



Introduction











































































































































































Rather the Torah presented us with a didactic hint about the service of God in general, when doing the commandments – shofar, sukkah, Pesach, tefillin and the like – that each one contains action, speech and will, which is the thought and intention of the commandment and of the prayer. And that is great and awesome, and not everyone – even with those involved in growth – know one part of the thousands and thousands of parts that the Men of the Great Assembly had in mind with the intentions of the prayers. And likewise with the intentions for the commandments. And, in truth, every single Jew has a great need for all three of these aforementioned aspects. As from the act of the commandment, the garment for the soul is made in the lower Garden of Eden; whereas the garment for the soul in the higher Garden of Eden is made from the intention of the commandment. Hence the advice that is given is to include himself and his intention – whether in prayer or in a commandment, or the intention of his eating during the week, and all the more so with the eating of the three Shabbat meals – and join his intention with that of the other Jews of complete faith, who know the intentions of prayer and of a commandment and about the secret of the intention of the Men of the Great Assembly and that which is similar to it. And this is the secret that the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote: Before prayer, one must say, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), in order to fulfill the positive commandment. This is so as to include his prayer and his intention with those that know [how] to unify the higher traits. And it is enough with that.

And [another interpretation] appears to me, as I heard from my teacher (may his memory live in the world to come), that if a person wants to praise, they should praise the Holy One, and if they want to denigrate, they should denigrate themselves, etc., and graceful are the words of the wise.

And through this, [we understand] the elegance of Rahab's words that are written in the Prophets, <i>for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below</i> (Joshua 2:11). And it means to say that which makes God one Unity, meaning a complete name from both sides, as is well known, is as a result that this God is in the heavens which is the middle, and above which is the head, and on earth which is the end. Behold he is the head, the middle, and the end, [and] all of this rises when they concede and bless from the other side [the domain of evil], which is below the earth. So through this, it rises, and the head, the middle, and the end become unified, and it becomes truth [<i>emet</i>, which is composed of the first, middle, and last letters of the alphabet]. And since a unification of truth came about, he who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit [alluding to Proverbs 27:18], so she was given a <i>true sign</i> to preserve their lives.
And the rabbi, his soul is in Eden, Maharsha, thought well about that which she said, <i>for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below</i> – they saw through this, that she had repented completely and fully, which is truth. Since repentance [<i>teshuvah</i>] is read, “the Lord returns [<i>tashuv H</i>].” For the divine presence, which is called the Lord,  descended among the husks as a result of sin, as it were. But through repentance, the Lord returns above and is unified with the supernal traits. And according to our words, that a complete unification came about through her saying, <i>for the Lord your God is God in heaven, etc.</i>, it is complete repentance. And understand [this].

It is well known that the sages of ethics said [that] once the evil impulse was captive in prison because of the prayer of the men of the Great Assembly (see Yoma 69b), and then the fire of Gehinnom was also extinguished at that time. [And] when the evil impulse returned to its place, the fire of Gehinnom returned to its place. For on account of the fire of the evil impulse that burns among the wicked to do evil, it also causes the fire of Gehinnom to rise.
And likewise with the good trait: On account of the fire of the good impulse that burns among the righteous to do the good and the just in the eyes of God, it causes the fire of the altar and of holiness to also burn. And it appears that this is [the meaning of] that which our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 63a), “Even though fire descends from heaven [to kindle the altar], it is a commandment to bring [fire] from ordinary ones.” With this, they hinted that through the fire of an ordinary person and his enthusiasm for the commandments, it causes the fire of holiness to descend from the heavens onto the altar. And this is the secret of that which King David, peace be upon him, said, “I wake up the dawn and the dawn does not wake me up” (Yerushalmi Berakhot 1:1). For with the arousal from below, the Above is aroused. And understand [this].

And I heard from my master an explanation of the verse, <i>Guard your tongue from evil, etc.</i>, until <i>Shun evil and do good, seek amity and pursue it</i> (Psalms 34:14-15): That the name of Isaiah the prophet is half fury and half consolation, which is not the case with Jeremiah. And Jeremiah the prophet was punished in a pit that he was thrown into, and that which is similar to it, because he did not pray for the Jewish people when the prophecy was told to him, etc. And concerning thoughts, it is like dreams, that they follow [the words of] the mouth, etc. [Berakhot 55b]. If he believes, etc. And hence he [would have been] able to pray to sweeten it in its root. For the decreed judgment is in Endurance [<i>Netzach</i>] and Majesty [<i>Hod</i>], etc. And we shall say orally how to sweeten [it], but it should not be written down. And it is also possible for the thought or the dream to be at the end of the world. And with that, the verse mentioned above, until <i>Shun evil and do good</i>, can be understood.  And the words of the sage are grace [<i>chen</i>, also an acrostic for hidden wisdom].
