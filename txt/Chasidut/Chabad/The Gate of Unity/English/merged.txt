The Gate of Unity

Introduction

This is a pamphlet that speaks about the matter of the Godly unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, in all the details of the chaining down of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> in the four worlds of <i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.
It summarizes everything that a person can bring close to his intellect in a manner of comprehension that can vest within and be grasped by the mind and heart regarding every detail of the chaining down of the worlds (<i>Seder Hishtalshelut</i>). That is, it explains everything from the very first <i>Tzimtzum</i> (constriction) until the very end of the world of <i>Asiyah</i> (Action).
This composition is generally known by the name <i>Kuntres HaHitbonenut</i> (The Tract on Contemplation), and many have yearned to see it in print, for there are many mistakes in the hand-copied manuscripts.
I trust that my positive intentions for the good of every person who truly and honestly seeks God, will be desirable before <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה and that I will be judged meritoriously in whatever may be found to not be fitting in the eyes of the wise, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:13</i> “Who can discern his errors etc.”
May <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה uplift the horn of Israel and enlighten their eyes with the light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה, the eternal light, with grace, kindness, and mercy. May He bless them with spiritual and physical life and may He always support and uplift them<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 63:9</i> until the coming of the redeemer.
These are the words of one who speaks in truth and with the love of the light of truth and faith, “a friend that is closer than a brother,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 18:24</i> who is bound with the bonds of great love and eternal love to all those who seek and search out <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה in the ways of the Torah of truth, the mitzvot, prayer and repentance.
From the depths of my heart, Dov Ber, the son of my father, master, teacher and Rabbi, the holy genius, our master and teacher, Rabbi Shneur Zalman, may the memory of the righteous bring blessings and may his soul repose in Eden.





Chapter 1

We already have explained at length in a special pamphlet,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to <i>Kuntrus Ha’hitpa’alut</i>, also authored by Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch, translated into English under the title Divine Inspiration.</i> concerning the particular manners in which one may be aroused in his mind and heart, and the thought that is born of contemplation (<i>hitbonenut</i>), according to the five levels of the soul, the <i>Nefesh</i>, <i>Ru’ach</i>, <i>Neshamah</i>, <i>Chayah</i>, and <i>Yechidah.</i>
We must now clearly explain the matter of contemplation itself, [to understand] what it essentially is, and what one should contemplate.
In essence, contemplation (<i>hitbonenut</i>) is the matter of gazing strongly into the depths of a concept, keeping [one’s mind] upon it for long periods, until he understands it thoroughly in all of its particular parts and details.
This is the inner aspect of the faculty of <i>Binah</i> (Understanding). In the terminology of the Talmud, it is called by the term “<i>Iyun</i>” – עיון, (in depth study). This is as stated in tractate Sukka,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Sukka 28b.</i> “There is <i>Girsa</i> – גירסא (surface study), and there is <i>Iyun</i> – עיון (in depth study).”
The explanation of surface study is that one understands the subject matter only at first glance. That is, [he] flows quickly through the subject matter [which he studies], without restraining [himself] and pausing at all, as known.
For example, one may gaze upon a certain object without contemplating it at all, [to understand the nature of] how or what it is. [He does not investigate] all of its inner and outer parts, except in a passing fashion.
Certainly, with the passage of time, he will forget about it altogether. Furthermore, he will only be able to relate the general matter of what he saw to his fellowman. [This is because his eyes only fell upon it] in a passing fashion, without keeping his eyes upon it at all.
This is likewise the case when the mind’s eye gazes upon a specific logical construct in just a passing fashion. [Because he understands the concept] only at first glance without pausing and restraining [himself] to analyze and investigate it properly, he will not come to know the concept to its ultimate depth at all.
Now, there are three matters in every intellectual concept. [These are;] depth, length and width.
The width is the explanation of the concept from all angles, with many particulars. This is analogous to the width of a wide river. In contrast, the understanding of a concept simply, as it is, is similar to a narrow river.
The length [of a concept] is the tremendous descent of the concept, to invest it into various different analogies so that it may even be brought within the reach of a small child. This is analogous to a flowing river that draws out to its length. (This concept is explained at length in [Chassidic] manuscripts<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe), Pekudei &amp; Noach.</i> in regard to the matter of the length of the hides.)
The depth [of a concept] is analogous to the depth of a river. From [its depth the river] widens, but in and of itself, it is not wide at all. However, it is the main essence of the river (which is called the “undercurrent”), for it is the main strength of its flow from its source.
The waters that are above [the depth], to its height or to its sides and [even] to its length, are secondary to it, for they only represent the spreading forth of its strength.
Likewise, the depth of the concept is the aspect of its essential point, as it is [in and of itself]. This is what is called “The depth of that which is comprehended” (<i>Omek Ha’Moosag</i>).
Everything that spreads forth in the explanation of this concept, [either] the great width with many angles and details, and also the great descent of the length, and even the height above, to understand higher [concepts] through this [concept], (all the way until the depth of the heights (<i>Omek Rom</i>), like the overpowering of the waters in the time of the flood [during the times of Noah]. Likewise, there will be a spiritual flood in the days of Moshiach, in the 600th year of the life of Noah. This is as stated in the Zohar<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 117a</i> that “the wellsprings of wisdom will open.” These are the springs of the depths of wisdom, “which will overpower and rise up and will cover all the mountains.” Then, “the reservoirs of the heavens shall open up,” and there shall be drawn down “the waters that are above the heavens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7</i> This is called the depth of the height (<i>Omek Rom</i>), which is dependent upon the depth below (<i>Omek Tachat</i>), because,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:7</i> “The beginning is bound up with the end,” as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 7:11</i> “Cast your questions to the depths or raise it on high”) are all drawn from the essential depth of the point [of the concept], which is how it spreads forth from the insight of <i>Chochmah</i> – Wisdom, which is called “<i>ein -</i> nothing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 42; <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee</i>, <i>Bereshit</i> p.2</i> This is as stated, “A river goes out from <i>Eden</i>.”
<i>Binah</i> (understanding) is called a river, while <i>Chochmah</i> (insight) is called a spring, as known.
This then, is [the mode of study] called <i>Iyun</i> (in depth study); that he keeps his mind on the concept and analyzes it greatly. This is [a] slow [in depth study] which is the opposite of [the] quick [surface level of study].
The purpose of this is specifically to reach the depth of the concept, as it is in its innermost essential point.
This is analogous to one who gazes his eyes upon a certain object, but not in a passing manner. Rather, [he keeps his eyes upon it] with great attention and scrutiny, taking his time until he knows it well, in all of its internal and innermost components.
This [type of study] is called <i>Hitbonenut</i> – contemplation. [The word <i>Hitbonenut</i> (התבו<b>ננ</b>ות) is] specifically spelled with two <i>Nuns</i> (נ – N), to signify that one [is to] contemplate it and analyze it greatly. This is in accordance with the explanation of Rashi [on the word] <i>Iyun</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on tractate Sukka, 28b.</i> “To stand upon the subject, to understand it clearly.”
We find that this aspect of <i>Iyun</i> is only an aspect of a receptacle for the delving of <i>Binah</i> itself. For, at first glance, this aspect of <i>Iyun</i> is called “the delving of the concentration”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ha’amakat Ha’da’at</i></i> in common usage. [In truth], this is not the case, for the delving of the concentration is only a vessel, [that allows one] to come to the actual depth of the concept.
[A] higher [level than the level of the “delving of the concentration” (<i>Ha’amakat Ha’da’at</i>)], is what is called “delving” (<i>Ma’amik</i>). [This method of delving allows one] to reach higher than even <i>Chochmah</i> itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See the explanations of the famed Chassid of the Mittler Rebbe, Rabbi Hillel of Paritch, to Chapter 1, translated and annotated under the title Listen Israel.</i> Now, seemingly, <i>Chochmah</i> is literally an aspect of the intangible “nothingness” of the concept, [as it exists even] before it comes into the category of being the essential depth or point of the concept in the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>. As mentioned previously, it is like the waters of a spring in comparison to the waters of a river.
Nonetheless, the aspect of delving in [this] source of the concept, its source reaches into the very source of the flow of the waters of the spring of <i>Chochmah</i>, which is called “the depths of <i>Chochmah</i>” or “the hidden-ness of <i>Chochmah.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Omkei Chochmah</i> or <i>Ta’alumot Chochmah</i>. See also Job 11:6</i> For, just as there are depth, length and width in <i>Binah</i>, which is called “<i>yesh</i> – something,” there is likewise a depth, length and width in the spring of <i>Chochmah</i>, which is called “<i>ein</i> – nothing.”
The depth of the spring is the beginning and source of its inception, at its very depth. From there its flow spreads upward until drops of water burst forth into revelation from their concealment [within the ground]. Its utmost concealment is in its ultimate depth below (in the aquifer), as [in the verse], “the wellsprings of the abyss burst forth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 7:11</i> For, the earth is riddled with fissures<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, tractate Chagiga 22a</i> and veins [of water], which have a primary depth. About this it is stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28:12</i> “<i>Chochmah</i> is [found] from nothing,” that is, from the concealed <i>Chochmah</i> which is called the depth of <i>Chochmah</i>.
Now, <i>Chochmah</i> is the discovery of new insight which emerges like a bolt of lightning, as known. [The source of its inception in its hidden depths is its innermost essence. This is similar to the previous explanation of the matter of the depth of the comprehended concept (<i>Omek Ha’Moosag</i>) of <i>Binah</i>.] However, that was only in regard to the depth of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i> which is felt in a tangible way, with revealed explanations [on a subject]. The depth of this explanation of the concept is only the aspect of the “nothing of the something” of comprehension. Therefore, its depth, which is its essential point, is of no comparison to the “nothing” of <i>Chochmah</i> before it comes into the category of comprehension altogether.
Nevertheless, although the depth of the comprehension, which is called the 50th gate of <i>Binah</i>, is drawn from the “nothing” of <i>Chochmah</i> to “something,” (like the teaching,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yoma 77b</i> “A spring will flow out of the chamber of the Holy of Holies; its beginning will be like the antennae of a grasshopper, and it will then widen into the expanse of a river,” and the like,) its source also reaches into the depths of <i>Chochmah</i> itself. It is clearly observable that the delving specifically into the depth of the comprehension (<i>omek hamoosag</i> of <i>Binah</i>) will bring one to the source and root of the concept, thus enabling him to bring new light of <i>Chochmah</i> (insight) into <i>Binah</i> (tangible comprehension). This, then, is what is called <i>Ma’amik</i> – delving, which is an active verb, for he is activating the depths of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah.</i>
(According to what we have explained, we may understand the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer Yetzirah 1:4</i> “Understand with wisdom and be wise in understanding.” In [Chassidic] manuscripts it is explained that “wise in understanding” refers to <i>A”b</i> of <i>Sa”G</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The four letters of the Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה correspond to the ten <i>sefirot</i>. The thorn of the letter <i>Yod</i> (י) corresponds to <i>Keter</i>. The body of the letter <i>Yod</i> (י) corresponds to <i>Chochmah</i>. The first letter <i>Heh</i> (ה) corresponds to how the seminal point of the <i>Yod</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> becomes expanded into the length and width of the <i>Heh</i> of <i>Binah</i>. The <i>Vav</i> (ו) which has a numerical value of six corresponds to the six emotional <i>sefirot</i>. The last <i>Heh</i> (ה) corresponds to <i>Malchut</i>. This will all be explained later in greater detail. What is relevant here is that the four-letter name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה can be expanded. In other words, instead of <i>Y</i> (י) the letter <i>Yod</i> would be spelled out as יוד. The same is done with the other three letters of the name. Now, when it is spelled out with <i>Yod’s</i> (i.e. יו"ד ה"י וי"ו ה"י) it has a numerical value of 72 and corresponds to <i>Chochmah</i>, which is the name <i>A”b</i> – ע"ב (meaning 72). When it is spelled out with <i>Yod’s</i> and an <i>Aleph</i> (יו"ד ה"י וא"ו ה"י) its numerical value is 63 and corresponds to <i>Binah</i>. This is the name <i>Sa”G</i> – ס"ג, which equals 63. We may now understand the above statement that, “be wise in understanding” refers to <i>A”b</i> of <i>Sa”G</i>. In other words, it refers to the <i>sefirah</i>; <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Binah</i>. Likewise, the aspect of <i>Sa”G</i> of <i>A”b</i> corresponds to <i>Binah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>. The Mittler Rebbe will now explain this further. (The explanation of the expansions of the Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה will be discussed later in the book.)</i> (<i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Binah</i>). This is [the ability] to understand a new insight within the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>. This only comes through the aspect of <i>Iyun</i> – the analysis mentioned earlier, which clarifies all the particular parts until they are clear. This <i>Iyun</i> (analysis) is what is called <i>Binah</i> of <i>Binah</i>.
After [a person has done this] he will be capable of bringing new insight into understanding and comprehension, but only within the subject matter itself. This insight is what is called <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Binah</i>. Now, <i>Keter</i> of <i>Binah</i> is the aforementioned depth of the comprehension (the <i>Omek HaMoosag</i>) the source of which reaches into the depth of <i>Chochmah</i>, as explained above.
Now, “understand with wisdom” refers to <i>Sa”G</i> of <i>A”b</i> (<i>Binah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>). This is the power of explanation within <i>Chochmah</i> itself, that he is capable of bringing it into many different explanations and facets. Nonetheless, it is still higher than the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>.
[This type of understanding may be understood from the explanation of] the statement<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Eruvin 100b</i> [regarding Moshe], “He could not find ‘men of understanding’ (<i>Nevonim</i>).” [This (<i>Navon</i>) specifically] refers to “one who understands one thing from another.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Chagigah 14a</i>
The reason [he is capable of this] is because of the source of this power of “understand with wisdom” (<i>Binah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>) that reaches into the depths of <i>Chochmah</i>, which was mentioned previously. For this reason, from one subject matter and wisdom he will be capable of understanding a completely different wisdom.
This [aspect of understanding] is much greater in level than that of a <i>Chacham</i>. That is, [a <i>Chacham</i> only has] insights from “nothing” into the particular subject matter of [his] investigation, but he does not understand an entirely different wisdom from it.
(Nonetheless, the source of the comprehension of a new insight within [the field of] his comprehension is also the matter of “understand with wisdom” (<i>Binah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>). In other words, its source is in the ability to understand one thing from another. However, this remains concealed in the source of the intellect. This will suffice those of understanding.)
We find that the order of levels is as follows; [first is] the aspect of <i>Iyun –</i> analysis, mentioned earlier. [That is], to keep one’s mind on [the concept, and investigate its particulars], until it is completely clear. This is called <i>Binah</i> of <i>Binah</i>; to clarify and distinguish between all the inner and outer specifics, with the utmost precision.
From this, it also is possible for there to be the aspect of a length, to lower the concept through many investments,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In analogies.</i> until it is made tangible to the comprehension of a child, as explained previously. Nonetheless, [he does] not [yet have] the aspect of a width, with various explanations of all its angles.
Following this is the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Binah</i>, which is [the ability] to bring forth insights, [but only] in the specific subject [under his investigation], as previously explained. This is [the aspect of] the width, from which the aspect of <i>Binah</i> of <i>Binah</i> creates a length.
Nonetheless, the extent of the length and width of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> is dependent upon the aspect of the depth of the comprehension, which is called <i>Keter</i> of <i>Binah</i>. It is clearly observable with any comprehension of any subject matter that according to the measure of the depth will be the measures of the length and width. This will suffice those of understanding.)
According to what we have explained, what is commonly called <i>ha’amakat ha’da’at</i> – the delving of the concentration (or meditation), is not the actual delving into the depth of the comprehension (the <i>omek hamoosag</i>). This is because the faculty of <i>Da’at</i> has no relation to it.
Rather, the faculty of <i>Da’at</i> is the aspect of the strong connection of one’s feelings to a concept.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Concentration and interest. See Tanya Ch. 3</i> It [is this type of concentration which] brings one to the depth of the comprehended concept, [but only] after the aforementioned analysis (<i>Iyun</i>), which acts as a receptacle for the depth of the comprehension (<i>omek hamoosag</i>), as previously explained.
Now, <i>Da’at</i> – concentration, also possesses the three dimensions of length, width and depth. For example, there are those who have a short attention span, and those who have a long attention span. There are those who have a broad attention span, but not a long attention span. There are those who possess strong concentration, and those of weak concentration, like “women who have a light <i>Da’at.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Tractate Shabbat 33b</i> That is, because they lack the depth of concentration, subsequently their concentration is short.
The difference between a weak concentration and a deep concentration can be understood by the difference between a child and an adult, as known. A child has a weak concentration. This is to say that he only possesses a very external connection or feelings towards the object of his understanding or desire.
For this reason, a child can be easily seduced into desiring the very opposite [of his original desire]. In contrast, an adult has a deep connection to the object of his understanding and desire, which is called the depth of concentration (or interest). ]Because he possesses this depth[, this automatically draws out a length of concentration and a width of concentration, as we previously explained regarding <i>Binah</i>.
The sign for [this] deep concentration is that [because of the great depth of his connection to the concept] it appears as if he is contracting and focusing the vessel of his brain. It is specifically through this deep concentration that he can come to an essential and deep comprehension of the subject matter, through the aforementioned analysis of <i>Binah</i>.
]However, the aspect of analysis] is the very opposite of contraction and focus (of all his mental capacities). Although, initially, [the analysis of <i>Binah</i>] begins with focus and contraction, it nonetheless immediately spreads forth with great expansiveness, with the clarification of all the particular components and details, as known.
This is not the case with the contraction and focus of the delving of the concentration. On the contrary, [the concentration] is only the contraction and focus, the aspect of gathering all of one’s mental capacities to connect only to this specific matter.
This is the very opposite of the spreading forth of the analysis with a great breadth into the subject matter. However, it is through the delving of the concentration that one can come to the depth of the concept, until its very source in the depths of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>.
([Through the above he is capable of] reaching the aspect of the upper <i>Da’at</i> which unites <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, as was explained previously regarding the matter of the depth of the comprehension (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>) of <i>Binah</i>. This is the meaning of the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar (Idra D’Mishkena) Mishpatim 123, 1.</i> “<i>Da’at</i> is hidden in the mouth of <i>Imma</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Imma –</i> Mother, refers to <i>Binah,</i> while <i>Abba</i> – Father, refers to <i>Chochmah</i>. This will be discussed in much greater detail later in the book.</i>
It is likewise stated, “<i>Moshe,</i> who corresponds to [the faculty of] <i>Da’at,</i> merited <i>Binah</i>,” which refers [specifically] to the fiftieth gate [of <i>Binah</i>]. These [two faculties] are interdependent, as explained in various writings and [Chassidic] manuscripts. This will suffice those of understanding.)

Chapter 2

Now, it is known that in <i>Binah</i> itself there are two levels; <i>Binah</i> and <i>Tvunah</i>. The matter of <i>Tvunah</i> is the aspect of the spreading forth of the light of <i>Binah.</i> (This is as stated in the Zohar,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Ha’azinu 290b and 291a. See also Etz Chayim (Shaar Av”I) Shaar 21, chapter 8.</i> “The lower mother and father are <i>Yisroel Saba</i> and <i>Tvunah.</i>” ]<i>Tvunah</i> is[ called the lower mother.)
]This comes about[ because ]the concept[ is grasped very well in the vessel of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>. Therefore, [through this], it spreads forth to bring it into many matters that are separate from the essential comprehension ]of the concept itself[. ]One who is capable of[ this is called “a man of <i>Tvunah</i>,” as in ]the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 20:5</i> “Deep waters… a man of <i>Tevunah</i> shall draw them out.”
The “deep waters” represent the aspect of the depths of <i>Binah</i> which remain concealed in the essential self. It is specifically the “man of <i>Tvunah</i>” who draws it out and brings it forth from its concealment, to bring it to spread forth in many different manners, in order to quench the thirst of the recipients.
This is analogous to one who draws out deep waters to quench the thirst of the sheep. We may clearly observe that when the reasoning of a concept is too deep to be retained in the comprehension of man, this is called “deep waters,” which is the aspect of the depth of the comprehension (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>), from which the length and width come, as previously explained.
It is specifically one who possesses the power of <i>Tvunah</i> who can “draw it out.” In other words, he brings to light the aspect of the hidden depth of the concept, until it may be retained within the comprehension of man, as if it was not deep at all. Just as [in the analogy of] one who draws the deep waters [out of the depths of the well], he brings the depth [itself] close.
According to the above, we must say that the power of <i>Tvunah</i> is a power that spreads forth from the power of <i>Binah</i>, to bring its depth into revelation below to the recipients.
This is not the case with one who is not “a man of <i>Tvunah</i>.” Although he may be a man of comprehension in his mind of <i>Binah</i>, (which is called a “<i>Tafsan</i> –Grasper” in the terminology of the world,) it is possible that his comprehension remains as it is in the essence of his mind of <i>Binah</i>. ]That is, he only possesses[ “the spirit of <i>Binah</i>,” but there will not come from it any spreading down into separate matters, outside of the essential comprehension itself.
Furthermore, although his comprehension is in the length, width and depth, as explained above, it is all in the essential comprehension, as it is. However, it will not be revealed below in separate matters, and certainly, the depth of the concept remains in its depth, concealed in itself. Likewise, the length and width all [remain] in the essential comprehension, as they are, in that state alone.
An example of all this can be seen in the depth of the logical debate of the Talmud, in which there are many reasons and explanations to argue one way or another etc.
Although one may come to the comprehension of <i>Binah,</i> nonetheless, he still is incapable of bringing to light any actual verdict or ruling of “innocent” or “guilty” from the essential intellect.
In other words, one is not capable of bringing out any “guilty” verdict from this reasoning, nor any “innocent” verdict from this reasoning.
This is because, as of yet, these concepts and explanations are only theoretical abstractions. One will, therefore, not find any spreading forth into matters which are separate from them. In other words, [he will not be capable] of applying these reasons and explanations [in practice] and state a “guilty” or an “innocent” verdict through them.
Rather, it is like a <i>Heyulie</i> power, in which it is not yet known what will result from it or what could be done with it.
]It is[ therefore ]understood that[ the power of <i>Tvunah</i>, which spreads forth from the mind of <i>Binah</i>, is the ability to bring the essential comprehension, to an aspect of spreading down from it, in all matters that are separate from ]the concept[ itself. ]That is to say, he is capable of arriving at a verdict[ whether for “guilt” or for “innocence” etc. Likewise, the arousal [of the emotions] of the heart [comes from this power]. Furthermore, [he is capable of] bringing it into thought in many various angles.
However, at first glance, we see that in <i>Binah</i> itself, there exists an aspect of emotions, which are called the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Binah</i>. These are [also] called the emotions of the intellect that leans either towards merit, or the intellect that leans towards guilt, as known.
However, these are only as the emotions still are concealed within the essential comprehension.
Nonetheless, to bring these emotions out into revelation in a separate matter, such as to shed light upon a certain case according to this concept and reasoning, and to [actually] cause the judgment on this matter to lean either to kindness or sternness, specifically requires a man of <i>Tvunah</i>. ]It is specifically a man of <i>Tvunah</i>] who can bring out insight and light, from the emotional [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Binah</i>.
The meaning of “a man of <i>Tvunah</i>” is that he has a thorough grasp of the essential comprehension. Because of this, the comprehension spreads forth in him, to do and to shed light upon many completely separate matters.
He even is capable of bringing the depth of <i>Binah</i> itself into revelation, as explained above. This will suffice those of understanding.
(This then is the aspect of the lower father and mother, <i>Yisroel Sabba</i> and <i>Tvunah</i>. <i>Yisroel Sabba</i> is the aspect of the emotions of <i>Chochmah</i>, and <i>Tvunah</i> is the aspect of the emotions of <i>Binah</i>. However, these two are how these emotions come into revelation, to the outside. The aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tvunah</i> is the aspect of the intellect which comes in thought, which is called the letters of intellectual thought (<i>Machshevet Sechel</i>), within which the intellect becomes invested. It is the external vessel for analytical thought (<i>Machshava Iyunit</i>), which is the revelation of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i> itself, from the aspect of the essence of the concept and explanation. From the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tvunah</i> is drawn the source of the letters of thought themselves, which is called <i>Leah</i>. This (<i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tvunah</i>) is the aspect of the large <i>Dalet</i> (ד) of the word<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4</i> <i>Echad</i>-אחד.)
For this reason, <i>Tvunah</i> is also called <i>Ben U’Bat</i> – Son and Daughter, as known. This is because <i>Tvunah</i> likewise possesses the three [dimensions of] depth, length and width. Its depth is the essential strength of the power of <i>Tvunah</i> of this comprehension, as it is during the time which he grasps it.
Through this (grasp) he is capable of bringing the [very] depths of the concept [out] into revelation, as was previously explained on the verse, “a man of <i>Tvunah</i> shall draw them (the deep waters) out.”
The length of <i>Tvunah</i> is the descent [of the concept] into a separate matter, to shed light upon it, or to accomplish many actions through it.
Its width is the aspect of the spreading forth of his <i>Tvunah</i> in the essential comprehension [itself], to expand it in his thought in many different manners, and not just [in the essential manner] that it is.
]Now, the reason] that <i>Tvunah</i> is called <i>Ben U’Bat</i> – Son and Daughter, is because it is specifically <i>Tvunah</i> that gives birth to revealed emotions as matters in and of themselves. For although <i>Binah</i> is called the “mother of the children,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar parshat VaYechi 219a.</i> nonetheless, from <i>Binah</i> itself, there is no birth of the emotions (since it is the “upper mother”).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (Shaar Av”I) Shaar 14, chapter 8.</i>
In contrast, <i>Tvunah</i> is called the “lower mother,” [for it is she] who gives birth to the emotions. These [emotions] are the aspects of “Son and Daughter” – love and fear, which specifically come about included in <i>Tvunah</i>. [This is because <i>Tvunah</i>] is the aspect of the spreading forth of the light of <i>Binah</i> downward, as explained above.
It is also for this reason that the aspect of the intellect of the emotions is drawn from the aspect of <i>Tvunah</i>. (This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 3:19</i> “<i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה founded the earth with <i>Chochmah</i>, [and established the heavens with <i>Tvunah</i>.” The first part of this verse, “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה founded the earth with <i>Chochmah</i>,” refers to the fact] that “the father founded the daughter.”
[The second part of the verse states], “He established the heavens with <i>Tvunah</i>.” As known, the “heavens-<i>Shamayim-</i>שמים” refers to the aspect of the emotions, fire-<i>Eish-</i>אש and water<i>-Mayim-</i>מים.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Chagiga 12a. There it states that the Hebrew word for “heaven – <i>Shamayim</i>” (שמים) is a conglomeration of two words, <i>Esh</i> (אש) and <i>Mayim</i> (מים), which mean fire and water. Firstly, these two elements correspond to <i>Chessed –</i> kindness, and <i>Gevurah</i> – might. Secondly, as will be explained later, the actual makeup of the emotions is from these two elements. Thirdly, it is the emotions which influence the speech and action, and therefore, the emotions (<i>Zeir Anpin</i>) are called “heaven” while speech and action (<i>Malchut</i>) which receives from the emotions, is called “earth.”</i>
Similarly, [it is stated],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 24:3</i> “They are established with <i>Tvunah</i>.” This refers to the establishment of the emotions [because] of the aspect of the intellect of <i>Tvunah</i> which is in them, since the aspect of <i>Tvunah</i> is like an intermediary to bring the intellect from the aspect of the emotions of <i>Binah</i> into the emotions of the heart.
This is similar to the power to bring [a concept] into a separate matter, which is the principal aspect of <i>Tvunah</i>, as explained above.)
Furthermore, as known, in <i>Binah</i> there is a bent <i>Nun</i> (נ) and a straight <i>Nun</i> (ן).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See the Magen David of the Radbaz on the letter <i>Nun</i>. Also see Pardes Rimonim of the Ramak, <i>Shaar HaOtiyot</i> (27:17).</i> That is, the bent <i>Nun</i> (נ) is the width, while the straight <i>Nun</i> (ן) is the length.
Furthermore, when expanded, the <i>Nun</i> which fills it is the straight <i>Nun</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When one expands the letter <i>Nun</i> – נ (as opposed to just <i>N</i>) it would be spelled out as - נו"ן. It then includes both the bent <i>Nun-</i>נ and the straight <i>Nun-</i>ן.</i> which is not the case with the expansion of any other letters.
This is because the length is included in the width. This is likewise the case with <i>Tvunah</i>. However, in regard to the double <i>Nun</i> in the matter which is called <i>Hitbonenut</i> (התבו<b>ננ</b>ות), as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 1:3</i> “My nation does not contemplate – עמי לא התנו<b>נן</b>”; this is the inner aspect of <i>Binah</i>, which is called <i>Iyun</i>, to stand upon the subject etc.
This is called <i>Binah</i> of <i>Binah</i> and is an intermediary between <i>Binah</i> and <i>Tvunah</i>, through the aspect of the straight <i>Nun</i>. For this reason it is called <i>Hitbonenut</i>. This will suffice those of understanding.

Chapter 3

From all the above we understand that in the matter of contemplation (<i>Hitbonenut</i>) on the comprehension of Godliness, there are two levels, <i>Binah</i> and <i>Tvunah</i>. <i>Binah</i> is the aspect of the essential comprehension of Godliness, [to understand] every particular of the matter that he contemplates, [to understand] how and what it is. He keeps [his mind] upon the matter with a great analysis [to understand] all its particular components, as explained above.
An example of this [can be understood] from the comprehension of the details of <i>Memaleh Kol Almin</i> (the light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, that fills all worlds). This is [the matter of] the coming into being of something from nothing, and is called, “the Godly power and effect upon the affected.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Koach HaPoel Ha”Eloki B’Haniphal</i>.”</i>
This is the aspect of the name <i>Adon”ai</i> (אדנ"י) or the name <i>Eloh”im</i> (אלהי״ם), which is a terminology of power,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1, The Gate of His Title (<i>Shaar HaKinuy</i>), and The Gate of the Sanctuary (<i>Shaar HaHeichal</i>).</i> as known. In the externality of this matter there are many various particular facets [that one must understand], until he grasps the very inner [aspect of the] matter, [to understand] its inner essence, how it is essentially. This is what was called [above], “the depth of the concept” (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>).
We previously explained that the aspect of <i>Iyun</i> - analysis is the aspect of the vessel which brings one to the aspect of the depth. The length is the aspect of bringing the concept close to one’s intellect through the use of the various known analogies.
[He does this] until the matter becomes very close to his mind, by investing it in physical [analogies], to the point that even a child can grasp it, as explained above.
The width is to expand and explain how the matter is [manifest] in many different ways, as opposed to just a single way.
For example, an analogy for this matter [may be understood] from [how] the life force of the soul [is manifested] in the body. Now, this is only [the aspect of] a spreading forth from the essence, as known.
There are a multitude of [other] ways [to understand the concept] of a spreading forth from the essence. Or, [regarding the concept] of the revelation of that which is hidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">For the explanations of each facet of the allegories presented here, see Rabbi Hillel Paritcher’s explanations to Shaar HaYichud, Chapter 3.</i> [it may be understood] from [the analogy of] the movement of an animal, or from the letters of speech etc. [Another analogy is the flash of] insight from the essential <i>Chochmah</i>, or the revelation [of the power] of sight in the eye. [A further example is] the revelation of the flame from the coal. All the above are examples [of the concept] of the revelation of that which is hidden.
In contrast, the analogy of the ray of the sun, or the light of a candle, or an applied force of energy and the like, are analogies [for the concept] of a spreading forth [from the essence].
All the above is the expansion on the essential matter. The opposite of this would be the short summation [and explanation of the concept] in only one way. Moreover, [in the summation, the explanation] itself is in a short way, [only] glanced [upon] by the mind, without any spreading forth to expand [his thoughts upon it] at all.
In contrast, the way this concept is grasped to its essential depth after the abundant explanations and comparative analogies, is called the depth and essence of this concept, as explained above.
It is specifically after the length and width of the [many] analogies and abundant analysis that he will come to the aspect of the depth that is understood through them. This is to say [that he will only reach the depth], through the external enclothements and abundant analysis. This will suffice those of understanding.
(Everything that was previously explained regarding the particulars of <i>Keter, Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of <i>Binah</i> may be found in a particular concept such as this, and likewise, in every other particular concept in the comprehension of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, as will be explained.)
Now, the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> is the aspect of the recognition and feeling, that is, the connection to the concept, as explained above.
About this it is stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:39</i> “<i>V’yadata</i> – You shall know [this day and set it upon your heart, that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, He is the God, in heaven above and on the earth below there is nothing else,” and “<i>Da et Elokei Avicha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Chronicles I 28:9</i> <i>–</i> Know the God of your father etc.,” which refers specifically to the comprehension of how it is that <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness fills all worlds, as known.
It is specifically this that brings one to the aspect of the “depth of everything,” that is, the depth of <i>Chochmah</i> “which is found from nothing,” as explained above.
In other words, [this is] the depth of the sight of the intellect, into this comprehension of how <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness permeates all worlds, which is higher than the [actual] grasp of the intellect, as known.
(This is as stated in <i>Ra’aya Mehemnah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar (Ra’aya Mehemnah) Mishpatim, 116b</i> “with the eye of the intellect, for the heart sees all.” This is [also] called,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Miketz 199a, Bereshit 38a-b, Pikudei 247b, Trumah 134a</i> “Gazing at the preciousness [of the King].” Now, in this too there is an aspect of depth, as explained above at length.)
Now, the aspect of <i>Tvunah</i> is to draw forth from this concealed depth, into revelation in the comprehension of how <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness fills all worlds. For, since he grasps the essence of this concept very well, he is, therefore, capable of bringing it into many separate matters.
For example, [he can understand] many details in the existence of the created worlds, how they come into being from nothing to something. [He understands this and draws this out] in a manner of particulars from the general concept of <i>Memaleh Kol Almin</i>, in which these particulars were concealed.
Without this power of <i>Tvunah</i> in this comprehension of <i>Memaleh Kol Almin</i>, his comprehension of it would remain in his brain of understanding alone. He would not know what to do with this [concept], or how to bring this <i>Hitbonenut</i> to comprehend how [his very own] existence is brought about something from nothing. [He would not be capable of doing this] at all, as understood from all the above. This will suffice for those of understanding.
(From the above we may [now] understand the reason for the lacking [which may be found] in beginners or even in those who are experienced, but lack <i>Tvunah</i>. Although they grasp [the explanations of the concepts well], when they hear or read them, they are incapable of bringing the matter of the coming into being of the worlds out of nothing, into contemplation during their prayers.
[Because of this] they may reach the point where they ask [themselves], “What am I to do with all this?” and “Of what benefit is this [to me].” This is because in his mind these are two separate things, because the understanding remains in his mind [as an abstract concept], totally removed from all matters. This will suffice those of understanding.)

Chapter 4

We must now explain how one should contemplate (<i>Hitbonenut</i>), whether it should specifically be done in a general way, or in a way of particulars. For example, [this may be understood] in [regard to] the Godly comprehension into the aspect of how <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness fills all worlds (<i>Memaleh Kol Almin</i>). In the general comprehension [of how <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness permeates] the three [created] worlds of <i>Briyah, Yetzirah,</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, all the examples of the ray [emanating from the luminary], or of the spreading forth [of Divine influence], or of the letters [of speech] etc., are all rooted in one general matter, that of “the revelation of that which is the hidden.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Giluy HaHe’elem</i> (revelation of the hidden). This matter and all of its analogies will be explained later in chapter 19.</i>
Likewise, in the general [comprehension of the great] difference between a created, limited being, relative to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, the Unlimited Being; [although] there are many particular ways to [understand] this and [although] there are many details (as will be explained), [nonetheless], it all is [understood in a] general [manner].
Or, [on the other hand], should one contemplate in a manner of particulars, [analyzing] each world, each creature and each of the various particular levels in the [entire] chaining down [of the worlds], from cause to [subsequent] cause, [analyzing] each one, specifically in and of itself?
This, likewise, is the question in regard to the contemplation of the “Upper Unity,” of the lights and vessels [of the world] of <i>Atzilut</i>, including all the details of the ten <i>sefirot,</i> until the Essential Self of the Limitless Light (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof)</i>.
Should one contemplate this in a general manner, [that is] the matter of the light of <i>Atzilut</i>, how it comes about from the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, through <i>Tzimtzum</i>, and how it is incomparable to the Essential Self of the Emanator?
Likewise [in regard to the general contemplation of] how “He and His life force are one” (although there are many particulars in this, as will be explained, [nonetheless, it still is a general contemplation]).
[He can understand this matter generally,] through various analogies, such as [the analogy] mentioned in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> of a flame that is bound [to the coal], or such as a general [understanding] of the revelation of the faculties of the soul from their concealment in the essence of the soul.
Through this analysis he will come to comprehend the depth [of the concept] of how the light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, fills all worlds, which is called, “The Lower Unity,” as known.
Now, in truth, the two [methods] are dissimilar [to each other]. [On the one hand] there is an advantage to general contemplation, that through it one will be able to come to the general depth [of the matter], which is the general aspect of the essence of the Godly light.
[However] he will reach this only in a general way, whether in [regard to the comprehension of] the “Upper Unity,” or the “Lower Unity.” This revelation of Godliness in his soul is the ultimate purpose of contemplation.
[On the other hand] there is also an advantage to contemplating specifically in a way of particulars, since [through it] the revelation of the Godly light in his soul will be incredibly closer to him. For, through contemplation in a general way it is possible for one to delude himself, so that it appears to him that this matter is very close to him.
However, in truth, when he only [contemplates] in a general manner, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה appears to him from afar.
This is not the case when one contemplates in a manner of particulars, to comprehend all the details of each particular. ]When he does this[, it becomes embedded in his soul in a very close way.
From this, he will come to comprehend a [higher] particular, on a higher level, until he comes to the general comprehension of the general matter. In this way [the comprehension] is truer, without deluding himself at all.
For example, when he starts contemplating the matter of how the light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, fills all worlds, in a manner of particulars, [he begins by contemplating] how the root of the spiritual influence of the orbits and constellations come into actuality, out of nothing, from the waste matter of the <i>Ophanim</i> angels.
Afterwards, he contemplates the <i>Ophanim</i> angels, and the <i>Chayot</i> angels in a manner of particulars etc. ]This contemplation continues[ until ]he reaches[ the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> [of the world] of <i>Asiyah,</i> which is the general Godly light that brings the world of <i>Asiyah</i> into being.
[He continues] in this way, [contemplating] the details of the ten <i>sefirot</i> [of the world] of <i>Asiyah</i> until he [reaches] the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i>, which becomes the <i>Keter</i> [for the world] of <i>Asiyah</i>.
In this manner [he contemplates] the particulars [of the world] of <i>Yetzirah</i>, and [then] the particulars [of the world] of <i>Briyah</i>.
[He continues in this way] until [he reaches] the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, [which is] the totality of everything, and is generally called by the name God-<i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם, as known.
In this way, after thorough analysis, he realizes the truth of the matter, in a way of great closeness. For, although, in and of itself, each particular of his contemplation is generally not a matter of Godliness and is only a particular that is of secondary importance, nonetheless, when his whole analysis of all the particulars, comes together and becomes bound to the general principle, then the general principle will become embedded in his soul to a greater degree.
This has been tried and tested by all those who have toiled deeply in <i>Hitbonenut</i> contemplation.
Likewise, the contemplation of the “Upper Unity” should be in a manner of particulars [as well]; to understand each particular detail of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the statures of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah, Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, <i>Arich Anpin</i> and <i>Atik Yomin</i>, all the way to the beginning of the <i>Kav</i> in <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc.
It is specifically [the contemplation of all this], in a manner of particulars, that will cause the general light of the essence of the Emanator, which includes and unifies everything, to be implanted in his soul.
However, this is not the case if one only contemplates in a general manner, so that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה appears to him from afar, as mentioned previously.
(For, through this, it is possible for him to fall into false delusions, as do fools and those who lack <i>Da’at</i>. ]This comes about[ because they focus their entire mind solely on one general matter.)
However, the focusing and delving of one’s concentration into each detail is the opposite of error and distance [from <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה].
On the contrary, through this, the matter becomes closer to his [mind] since he goes from one particular to a higher particular until he unifies them all in a general unification, rather than a unification of particulars.
This may be understood from the unification (<i>Yichud</i>) of “Yours, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, is the greatness.” The [general] matter of Godly unification is the aspect of the depth of comprehending the nullification of the “something” to the “nothing,” [both] in [the comprehension of] the “Upper Unity” and the “Lower Unity.”
Now there [also] is a particular unification for each particular thing. For example, in “Yours <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is the greatness,” this is the aspect of <i>Chessed</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Greatness refers to <i>Chessed</i>.</i> of <i>Malchut</i> [of the world] of <i>Atzilut</i> [as it is invested] in [the worlds of] <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, in a particular way for each world.
That is, even the general matter here is only a single particular quality of a particular quality of <i>Malchut</i>.
Likewise, [when one contemplates] “Yours <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is the might,” both in general and in its particulars in each world, [it] is, [nonetheless], considered to be a particular unification.
The same [principle] applies to the unifications of all the particulars of the ten <i>sefirot</i> [of each of the worlds] of <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah,</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, as known.
In contrast, a general unification is like [the understanding of], “Behold, the place is with Me,” or, “The exalted King… who is aloof from the days of the world.” [In other words, He is aloof from “the days of the world,” which refers to] the six directions (the emotional <i>Sefirot</i>) and the intellect of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> [of the worlds].
However, in comparison to the essence of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is <i>Keter Malchut</i>, even this is, [likewise], only considered to be a particular.
In a similar manner [there is a contemplation of] all the other <i>sefirot</i> [of the world] of <i>Atzilut</i>, until the essence of the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Ein Sof</i> (the Unlimited One), at the beginning of the <i>Kav</i>. There are many unifications of the many particulars in each <i>sefirah</i> and <i>partzuf</i> (stature).
The general unification, [however], is the general nullification of the entire chaining down of the <i>Kav,</i> relative to the Essential Self of the Limitless Light (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof</i>), as known.
However, [this is not the case with] one who has not delved his concentration into particular unifications, but, [rather], begins with the general aspect. Even though he toils greatly in [comprehending] the many general concepts of how everything is generally sublimated to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, such as the aforementioned analogy of the flame, and other such [concepts], [nonetheless], the truth of the matter will not become as embedded in his soul, as much as it would have been, had he gone through a thorough analysis into the particular details, which would bring him to [truly understand] the general [concept].
This then, is the meaning of, “the particular requires the general and the general requires the particular,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Shmot 3a, Terumah 161b, V’Etchanan 264a.</i> for no general [concept] can exist without particulars.
(This matter has already been debated by many of the foremost <i>Rishonim,</i> such as the Rambam and the Tur. [That is], whether [during prayer] one’s intentions should be focused on the particular meanings of the words, such as [contemplating] the greatness of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה [in a way of particulars]? Or, whether one’s intent should rather be to realize, in a general way, before Whom he is standing and praying? This matter is discussed in [Chassidic] manuscripts).
Now, although [as a rule] a general thought and a particular thought cannot exist simultaneously, nonetheless, he who delves with all his heart and with all his desire, specifically to [contemplate] the essence of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, even though his analysis is into the particulars, he will specifically direct everything to the general thought of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self.
He will not fall from the general intention at all, as a result of focusing on the particulars. This is because all the particulars are drawn to and follow the general principle, as known to all who travel upon the “Path of Truth,” [who direct themselves] specifically only to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. Likewise, this is as stated by the Sages, “[pray] to Him rather than to His qualities.”
[This is to say that] the main intent of the matter of contemplating the particulars is solely for the specific purpose of coming to the Essential Self and being of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself.
[In other words], one should never consider the particulars to be the main thing, such as studying a subject for itself [rather than to know <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה].
Likewise, one’s analysis of the Zohar and the writings of the Ari’zal must specifically be in this manner. This will suffice those of understanding.
(My father, our master, mentor and teacher [the Alter Rebbe] of blessed memory, whose soul is in <i>Eden</i>, received this teaching from the mouth of the <i>Rav,</i> the <i>Maggid</i> [of Mezeritch] of blessed memory, with a full explanation, and this is how I heard it from his mouth.)
Through all of the above we have answered the question of those who inquire regarding the specific [kabbalistic] meanings of the words [of the prayers]. How is it that those who know them do not become confused [and distracted] from the general intent?
Rather, on the contrary, the intent of the meaning of the words [of prayer], as explained by Kabbalah, serves to strengthen the depth of one’s general grasp of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, as known to those who have tasted [the contemplation of the words of the prayers] in a way of particulars.
However, for those who are novices, it is best that, at first, they should delve in a general way, until they become accustomed, little by little, to specifically contemplate the particulars [during prayer]. This will suffice those of understanding.

Chapter 5

After having explained the need to contemplate specifically in a manner of particulars, it follows, of necessity, that one must know all the particular levels in all the details of the chaining down of the worlds (<i>Seder HaHishtalshelut</i>) of <i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah,</i> and <i>Asiyah,</i> so that one may contemplate them.
These particulars cannot be understood by everyone through the general teachings [of Kabbalah and Chassidus].
Therefore, whatever needs explanation in each detail, will be explained in a special pamphlet,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">That is, from chapter 10 and on of this book.</i> so that a person of understanding will automatically understand them and will come to know many other details.
However, it first is necessary to introduce one more point (which also will be explained in detail) of how <i>Hitbonenut</i> contemplation should be done. This is extremely necessary for all those who truly desire closeness to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה and do not seek to merely fulfill their obligations and deceive themselves [that they thereby are truly serving Him] etc.
As known, every contemplation upon the Godly matter of the coming into being of something from nothing, each contemplation, according to its place [in the order of things], includes two matters;
The first is the aspect of the nullification of the “something” to the “nothing.” This begins with the comprehension of the relativity of limited beings, by understanding how their existence is derived from the “nothingness.”
This is brought close to the intellect through various explanations and analogies and the like, until the truth of it becomes well settled in his mind.
The second matter is the aspect of the Godly “nothingness” that bring him into being, and how <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is totally separate, relative [to created beings], since He has no limitations.
This matter is concealed from the eyes of the intellect and cannot be fully grasped.
However, the truth of it will, nonetheless, flash like lightning in his brain, so that he will glimpse the truth of the matter, as it is.
However, although it is in an aspect of concealment, it will be as true for him as if he saw it with physical sight.
This is the difference between the aspect of the “sight” of <i>Chochmah</i>, [and the aspect of the “hearing” of <i>Binah</i>]. The sight of <i>Chochmah</i>, the <i>Koach Ma”h</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The letters of <i>Chochmah</i> (חכמה) can be rearranged to spell <i>Koach Mah</i> (כח מה), meaning “the power of ‘what’.” This represents the aspect of the sublimation to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה of <i>Chochmah</i>, as in the verse (Ex. 16:7-8), “<i>V’Nachnu Mah</i> – and what are we.”</i> (the power of “what”), is the sight of the soul that sees, but not with tangible sight. Rather, it is a flash of intellectual sight which is beyond full comprehension.
Therefore, the arousal that results from this is nothing but the aspect of nullification, which is the complete absence of awareness of self.
The aspect of the “hearing” of <i>Binah</i>, on the other hand, comes with full comprehension, literally. This is to say that he comprehends how the “something” comes into existence from the “nothing,” as explained above.
The resulting arousal is a tangible feeling of joy and good-heartedness.
The more he grasps, the better he feels and the more he delves into it, the more he grasps.
In contrast, the aspect of the “sight” of <i>Chochmah</i> is the opposite. The more he delves into it, the more the Godly “nothingness” that creates, becomes removed and astounding to him.
This astonishment over the awesome gap and absence of any comparison [between <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, who is beyond all limit, and himself], grows and grows, until he is bewildered and consternated over it etc., (as it is written in the Chassidic manuscripts).
Accordingly, all those who contemplate in a manner of particulars [rather than a general manner] will become [aware of] these two aspects through their contemplation; the concealed aspect and the revealed aspect.
Accordingly, the arousal that is born of it [is comprised of] two opposites; “His heart is worried within him”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Tractate Chagigah 13a</i> because he comprehends the astounding greatness of the Godly “nothing” that brings [everything] into being, and he is [simultaneously] joyful because of his thorough grasp of how all that exists comes into being.
This may be understood by example of one who contemplates in a manner of particulars into the coming into being of the planetary orbits from the Godly “nothing,” which comes about from the aspect of the external vessels of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
In other words, he comprehends how it is only from the external vessels and is merely a glimmer of a glimmer, which radiates within the soul of the celestial orb<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a star or planet</i> as it grasps that which gives it its existence.
Likewise, he understands how the angels of the world of <i>Briyah,</i> (“In which <i>Imma</i> (<i>Binah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>) resides”), comprehend the Godly power of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> which brings them into existence.
He grasps these concepts in a way of comprehension, and he becomes aroused by the greatness of the Creator, and how they [the angels, stars and planets] are constantly sublimated [to Him], as stated, “And the hosts of the heavens bow down to You,” in their orbits etc.
However, the aspect of the Godly “nothingness,” the essential creative force of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, is concealed from his grasp.
However, it is automatically forced into his comprehension, because the understanding of how the “something” comes into existence has become true for him.
Furthermore, it is only comprehended in a concealed way, specifically because of the astonishment over the total absence of comparison.
This is likewise so in the contemplation of the particulars of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, in its lights and vessels. For example, the contemplation on the light of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, or the contemplation on the light of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, to understand how they were emanated.
This can be comprehended by way of analogy from how light is emanated into revelation from its concealment in the essence [of the luminary], here below [in the physical world].
This is also similar to how Moshe, “emanated from his spirit,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 11:25</i> and the like.
Furthermore, although the emotive qualities (<i>Midot</i>) of the world of <i>Atzilut</i> are only in the aspect of sources, and are separate from the Godly influence as it is within creation, he nonetheless will comprehend how they come into being.
However, the aspect of the true “nothingness” that shines upon them from the light of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, who emanates them, cannot be grasped even through intellectual comparisons. Rather, it may only be [grasped] in a concealed fashion, which is the aspect of the intellectual sight, which is higher than actual comprehension and grasp.
This is like the saying, “No thought can grasp You,” which refers to the thought of <i>Binah</i>.
In other words, this is the opposite of comprehension, for the more he delves [into it], the more astounding will the essential light of the Emanator be for him.
The indication of this [type of arousal] is that a very great aspect of nullification is born [in him].
[From all the above] we find, that of necessity, the [opposite] aspects of nullification and joy, which branch out and are born of the <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> [that is, the contemplation] of each particular, specifically come together, as one.
This is true of all <i>Hitbonenut-</i>contemplation of each particular detail, specifically.
These two aspects are interdependent. If he has no joy from the thorough comprehension of the “something,” then he will also not come to the astonishment and sense of distance in his inability to grasp the “nothingness.”
The degree of his joy is, literally, commensurate to the degree of his nullification, for his comprehension of the created is commensurate to his astonishment at the separateness of the Creator.
This is an important principle [that applies to] every <i>Hitbonenut</i>-contemplation, whether general or particular.
(In contrast, if it appears to someone that he thoroughly grasps the aspect of creation, but he lacks the aspect of nullification to the Creator, then, without a doubt, it is a certainty that he has not grasped anything.
Likewise, if someone imagines that he possesses the aspect of nullification through the realization of the wondrousness of the Creator, but does not thoroughly comprehend the manner of how [everything] comes into being, it is a false imagination and he has no nullification whatsoever.
These two are interdependent and commensurate to each other, for the above-mentioned reason.
This is known to all who have tasted true <i>Hitbonenut</i>, and do not at all delude themselves.
This is likewise understood by those who are accustomed to the teachings of <i>Chassidut</i> from their youth. However, a great many people delude themselves in all this, in many different ways etc.)

Chapter 6

The statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II, page 255a, Zohar III, page75a, also see Tanya, end of chapter 34.</i> “Weeping is affixed in my heart on this side and joy on that side,” is well known.
[This is to say] that one must prepare his soul for the general Godly knowledge of the chaining down (<i>Hishtalshelut</i>) of the Limitless Light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, in the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> until his soul becomes a fitting receptacle for this.
This can only come about through these two matters of weeping and rejoicing.
For, although they are two opposites, nonetheless, they come together, literally as one, specifically from the same contemplation.
It is specifically through this that his soul becomes well prepared, so that the comprehension of the particulars of the Limitless Light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, in the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i> become embedded in the essence [of his soul].
If either of these<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Joy and weeping (love and fear)</i> is missing, in other words, if there is one without the other, [then it is certain that nothing has become embedded in his soul]. Even if it appears to him that both are in his heart, but they are not within his soul truly and deeply, but only in an external, passing way, this is a sure sign that nothing has become embedded in his soul, except from a very great distance.
With the slightest opposition, such as being greatly preoccupied or from an increased sense of self and ego, it will be completely uprooted from his heart.
As known, the explanation of these matters is that pleasure and joy are in <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>. Pleasure is in <i>Chochmah</i> (insight), and joy is in <i>Binah</i> (comprehension).
(As known, this is the difference between <i>Shabbat</i> and <i>Yom Tov</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained in greater detail in chapter 26.</i>)
The comprehension of the intellect gives rise to joy, that is, the joy of the soul. This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 113:9</i> “The mother<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Binah-Comprehension</i> of the children rejoices.”
Moreover, as known, the primary source of joy is specifically in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Amidah</i> prayer for the holidays.</i> “They will rejoice in You,” specifically.
Now, we explained previously in regard to the comprehension [of <i>Binah</i>], that “no thought can grasp Him.” Quite the contrary, He is astounding in the great degree of His separation.
This is the aspect of the <i>Koach Ma”h</i> (the power of “what”) of <i>Chochmah</i>, [in which the perception] is concealed, as explained above.
This being the case, it should be the opposite; that joy is not into <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Being.
For, as soon as he comprehends it, it can no longer be His true Essence and Being, but rather only an aspect of how He restrains<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tzimtzum.</i> This will be explained in chapters 12 and 13.</i> Himself in order to bring the created into being.
Accordingly, <i>Chochmah</i>, which is the aspect of “nothingness,” as previously explained, is where it would be fitting for the joy of “we will rejoice in You” to exist.
However, this is not the case, for as known, nullification, which is the opposite of joy, is specifically in <i>Chochmah</i>, whereas joy is in <i>Binah</i>.
Rather, as known, the explanation is that everything contains its opposite. Moreover, although it is revealed as its actual opposite, from this [fact] itself, we see that its whole force is only due to the opposing force.
Furthermore, the strength of the opposing force is [always] commensurate to the strength of its opposite, literally. If so, they are literally as one.
An example of this is pleasure and pain. Commensurate to the degree of a person’s pleasure in something, will be the degree of the arousal of pain, which is the absence of the pleasure that opposes [the pain].
This takes place should something stand in opposition, to negate that pleasure, since that is its opposite.
The opposite is true as well. The degree of his pleasure in something cannot be recognized except through the degree of pain he has when that thing is missing.
We see that this is literally one force, except that it divides into two equal lines which are literally in equal balance to each other.
The one side will not be stronger than the second, even to the amount of “the thorn of a <i>Yod</i>.”
The same [principle] applies to joy and weeping. To the degree of his joy, which is a felt and revealed pleasure when <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness is revealed within his grasp, as explained above, so will be the degree of the second side, which specifically comes out of it and from its power.
This [second side] is the weeping over the lack of revealed light in his soul, because <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness is concealed [from him], until he literally despises his life.
The more one has tasted the flavor of Divine pleasure with rejoicing, the more embittered will he be in his soul from its opposite.
Likewise, the opposite is [also] true. From the degree of the depth of his bitterness and weeping, that he despises his physical life, is the strength of his pleasure and joy in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness recognized. This is the gauge for the measure of its strength.
This is because these two lines are counterbalanced with absolute equilibrium, as explained above.
This then, is the meaning of “Weeping is affixed in my heart on this side and joy on that side,” <b>with equal measure</b>, literally.
Likewise, even higher than this is the aspect of the concealed pleasure of <i>Chochmah</i>. It is from this, (the depth of his pleasure which is concealed in his essence,) that the aspect of a total and complete nullification of himself comes.
Therefore, its opposite, which is born of its strength, is the matter of casting his soul<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With self-sacrifice.</i> against anything that opposes it. For, this is included in the aspect of his ego.
In other words, he will despise his life with total and true negation of self, as written,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 73:25-26</i> “Who [but You] do I have in the heavens? And beside You I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart fail: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.”
For, these two lines are [literally] an equal balance, as explained above. This will suffice those of understanding.
Now, there is [an aspect of] weeping which is even higher than this. This comes about out of the lack of comprehension [into <i>HaShem’</i>s-יהו״ה Godliness] because <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is so absolutely and awesomely beyond any relativity [to him], since the vessel of his brain cannot contain it.
This is like how, “The eyes of Rabbi Akiva flowed with tears”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Vayera 98b</i> because of the deep secrets that the vessel [of his brain] could not contain.
This is the aspect of the astonishment at the “concealed of all concealments,” That is, literally the Essential Self of the Limitless Light (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof</i>), which is beyond comprehension whatsoever.
On the contrary, the more one delves into it, the more astonished he becomes, as previously mentioned.
It is specifically from this that his heart becomes [filled] with consternation and he weeps. This only comes because of his immense pleasure and desire to comprehend, which he is incapable of doing.
As known, this is the principal receptacle for the aspect of insight into the secrets of the Torah. This is as explained elsewhere regarding the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Chagigah 13a</i> “The secrets of the Torah are only given over to a person whose heart is worried within him.”
However, were he to comprehend the actual Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, then there would be a matter of joy into <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essence.
Now, although the revelation of this Godly pleasure comes in a completely felt way, nonetheless, its source is in the essential pleasure that is concealed from him. It is from this [pleasure] that the opposite comes forth, which are the tears at the wonderment and separateness of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, and the lack [of comprehension of Him], as mentioned previously.
For, these two poles are also in equal balance, literally.
This is to say that according to the degree and strength of the great and immense pleasure he would have in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה, were he to actually comprehend Him, accordingly, it’s opposite will be present, which is the deep weeping when the vessels of his brain cannot comprehend [Him], as explained above. This will suffice those of understanding.
We, therefore, find that the order of the levels of “a thing and its opposite” is as follows: [First is] the joy and happiness from a revelation of Godly light that is actually comprehended. The opposite, which comes from it, is the weeping over the concealment or opposition to this.
Higher than this, is the aspect of the concealed pleasure and joy, which is in the <i>Koach Ma”h</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> into the essence of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness that brings [everything] into being. Its opposite power is that he despises his own life, and the life of anything other than <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, as in the verse, “Who have I in the heavens…”
Even higher than this is the aspect of the essential pleasure and joy specifically into the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness. This is like the statement, “They will rejoice in You,” literally, in a revealed way.
Its opposite power comes forth when the vessels of his brain cannot contain this. This causes him to weep.
(This is like the weeping of one who is separated from someone he truly loves with his soul. For example, [regarding the love of] David and Yehonatan, [it states,]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel I 20:17</i> “He loved him as one loves his own soul.” [Therefore, when they were forced to separate] it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel I 20:41</i> “They kissed one another and they wept.”
This [weeping] comes as a result of the strength of the abundant love and great pleasure they have when they are together as one. There are many more examples of this.)
All the above, answers the previous matter concerning the fact that joy is in <i>Binah</i> and pleasure is in <i>Chochmah</i>. Although the comprehension itself is into a restrained revelation (<i>Tzimtzum</i>) of Godly light, which he [is capable of] comprehending, nonetheless, the <b>source</b> of the joy reaches into the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, specifically,
just as the souls in <i>Gan Eden</i> literally derive pleasure from the ray of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Indwelling Presence (<i>Zeev HaShechina</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Brachot 17a</i>
[Even though] their comprehension too, comes in a restrained, limited fashion, as known.
This then is the meaning of “We shall rejoice in You,” specifically. That is, “Joy on this side,” and its opposite, which results from its force, is the “weeping,” as in the three above mentioned levels.
These two poles are exactly equally balanced, as mentioned above.
This also is the meaning of the verse<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 28:47</i>, “[Because you would not serve <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, your God,] with joyfulness and gladness of the heart, because of the abundance of all things,” That is, with comprehension into He who brings [everything] into being.
Similarly, [it will thus be] in the future, as written,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 14:14; Isaiah 52:8</i> “We will behold <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה eye to eye” and,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 25:9</i> “On that day it will be said, this is our God,” in the second person. Then, [on that day] “We will rejoice and be glad in Him” specifically, as known. This will suffice those of understanding.
However, [in the state of the world as it exists] now, all this bursts forth and comes out specifically through its opposition. [Therefore, what becomes revealed is] specifically the opposite, which is the “weeping on this side.”
[This is revealed] all the way to the highest levels, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 31:8</i> “They shall come with weeping,” specifically. It likewise states,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 126:6</i> “He who goes weeping on his way, [bearing a bag of seed, shall come back with a joyful shout, carrying his sheaves].”
However, in the coming future there will be laughter, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 126:2</i> “Then shall our mouths be filled with laughter,” and as explained elsewhere regarding the matter of the joust [<i>kenigya</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Vayikra Rabba 13, 3. It is stated that in the future there will be a “joust” between the <i>Shor Ha’bar</i> – the Giant Ox, and the Leviathan, and that this joust will bring the righteous much pleasure. The <i>Shor Ha’bar</i> will gore the Leviathon with his horns, while the leviathan will slaughter the <i>Shor Ha’bar</i> with its fins. It is explained that this refers to the “battle” which will take place between the animal soul and the Divine soul, i.e. the physical and the spiritual. The two will “slaughter” each other. The Hebrew word for slaughter can also mean to “uplift.” That is, the two will cause each other to be uplifted to a higher level than they are at the moment.</i>
This is likewise the explanation of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 63:16</i> “You are our father,” that<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Shabbat 89b</i> “this refers to <i>Yitzchak</i>,” that this <i>Tzchok</i> (laughter) will come about in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>Yitzchak</i> (the name of the second forefather) means, “I will laugh” in the future tense. This refers to the laughter in the time of revelation which follows the tears of the time of concealment during exile. Specifically at that time, we will address <i>Yitzchak</i> as “our father.”</i> That is, it will come out from its opposite, which is the weeping that there was during the time of exile, as known.
Based on all this we may understand the true reason why the midnight prayers of <i>Tikkun Chatzot</i> are specifically done through tears.
This is advantageous for the soul, allowing one to pray [the morning service] with a revelation of an essential pleasure [in <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה], as in the verse, “We shall rejoice in You” etc.
and although the weeping during the midnight prayer of <i>Tikkun Chatzot</i> are simple tears shed over “the sins of one’s youth” and the like, nonetheless, about this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 42:4</i> “My tears were my bread day and night.”
[“Day and night”] refers to the recital of the <i>Shema</i> and the [<i>Amidah</i>] prayers of the morning and evening.
This is because his tears over his distance, which are caused by his sins and transgressions, rectify the aspect of the source of the sin [itself]. This [source of sin] is specifically the casting off of the yoke of Heaven, and the aspect of the exile of the Indwelling Presence of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which comes in a particular manner in each Godly spark.
These tears rectify and remove the blemish completely, and awaken above the aspect of the weeping that opposes and comes out of its opposite power, which is the essential joy, mentioned above.
This [joy] will radiate within his Godly soul during the <i>Shema</i> recital and the prayers etc. and will, literally, become as bread for his soul.
[On the other hand] the casting off of the yoke of Heaven is its opposite, which is the opposite of tears. This is like the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 29:18</i> “He blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.”
This is like a servant who rebels. His rebelliousness and [the fact] that he has cast off the yoke [of his Master] is the main problem and is the source of anything that he will do contrary the will of his master.
About this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 107:17</i> “The foolish afflict themselves on account of their sinful ways and their iniquities.” “[Now, the iniquitous are those who are rebellious,” <sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Yomah 36b</i> who cast off the yoke of Heaven. Although they afflict themselves for their sins, and the sins of their youth, how will it help, because,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 107:14</i> “Their soul abhors all manner of food” [which refers to the bread] of <i>Chochmah,</i> as mentioned above.
[This is] the opposite of the pleasure which surely enlivens one’s soul.
The verse then continues,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms, 107:18</i> “They reached the gates of death,” as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 30:15</i> “[See I have set before you this day] life and good” which is the joy and good heartedness, from the aforementioned essential pleasure. Its opposite is “the death and evil” through casting off the heavenly yoke.
Now, it is specifically the tears during the midnight prayer of <i>Tikkun Chatzot</i> which is the foremost preparation for one’s soul to stand in prayer with all of the aforementioned matters of the three of levels of “weeping from this side…etc.”
[However] if not, he will delude himself in one of these ways. Either he will have weeping alone, or joy alone, or [he will have both but] they will not be true, to their depth.
This is a sign that the Godly light has not touched his soul except from a great distance. This is like the secret of the exile of the Divine Presence in the collective souls of the Jewish people.
(This then, is the main source and general reason for those who constantly fall from their levels of Divine pleasure and joy, without it being established whatsoever.
With the slightest resistance and opposition, the “Ropes that bind” him to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה become completely uprooted from his heart. This is as mentioned above regarding the verses, “The foolish afflict themselves…Their soul abhorred all manner of food…etc.”
Therefore, whoever truly desires closeness to God should constantly make a great preparation within his soul during the midnight prayer of <i>Tikkun Chatzot,</i> and with the aforementioned matter of “weeping is affixed in my heart on this side and joy on that side.”
He should not delude himself, thus literally freely destroying his soul. This will suffice those of understanding.)
(From all of the above we may also understand the reason for the great principle, [which was said] in the name of the <i>Maggid</i> of <i>Mezritch</i> of blessed memory. [That to] naturally [have a dominance of the] “black gall”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A serious nature.</i> is a preparatory receptacle to the attainment of true pleasure through self-sacrifice in “One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד,”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the recitation of the <i>Shema.</i> When one says the words <i>HaShem</i> is One-<i>HaShem Echad-</i>יהו״ה אחד he gives his entire life over to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, with true and absolute dedication, even to the point of death for the sake of the sanctification of the Name of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה.</i> and for the reception of all the secrets [of Torah]. All this is explained in <i>Kuntras</i> [<i>HaHitpa’alut</i>] at length. This will suffice those of understanding.)

Chapter 7

Now, before we proceed to [explain] the detailed knowledge of the Chaining Down of the worlds (<i>Seder Hishtalshelut</i>), we must preface with a matter that was previously mentioned (in chapter four).
This specifically refers to the connection of the particulars to the general principle.
As known to those who delve into the <i>Zohar</i> and other authentic texts of Kabbalah, in the [study of the] <i>Hishtalshelut</i> and the investment of the statures (<i>Partzufim</i>)<i>,</i> it is necessary for each person to know the [explanation of the <i>Seder Hishtalshelut</i>] in short form.
Beginning with the Simple Unity at the beginning of all things, until the end of all things, which is at the end of our lowly world, it all is literally bound with one “knot.” This is similar to a chain that goes from beginning to end and chains down from cause to cause etc.
The first light of the simple unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, who is called, “The Cause of all causes”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Bereshit 22b</i> is also called “First” or “Preceding,” as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 44:6</i> “I am first and I am last.”
“I am first” refers to <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Ein Sof</i> (The Unlimited One) after the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is known as “the empty place.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Drush Igullim V’Yosher</i>) Shaar 1, Anaf 2</i>
“I am last” at the end of everything, is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, which is the source of the existence of this lowly world.
“Their beginning is bound to their end and their end to their beginning.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>, Chapter 1, Mishnah 7</i> They are literally as one, like a chain whose lowest link is bound to its highest link.
This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:39</i> “See now that I, I am He,” without any change at all from beginning to end.
Now, although it is known that there are a multitude of details in the chaining down from beginning to end, the entire purpose of man is the contemplation of all the particular details from beginning to end, to bind them all into one general unity with the Simple Unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, Who is called “first.”
This is as stated, “See now that I, I am He,” literally, and as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:6</i> “I <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה have not changed.”
This is the pivotal point upon which the contemplation of the particulars must be founded, so that all [the particulars] are drawn to this general principle, as previously explained.
Now, the explanation of this matter for beginners [is as follows]: The order of the multitude of [details] of the chaining down of the line and thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>) which is drawn out after the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, is known briefly as follows:
At first, before the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, there was “Him and His Name alone.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Pirke D’Rabbi Elazar, Chapter 3</i>
This refers to the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, blessed is He (<i>Atzmoot Ein Sof</i>), and His light and ray, which is called “His Name.”
It was all in the aspect of His essence, literally in an aspect of limitlessness, and He filled all “empty space.”
Afterwards, He made a <i>Tzimtzum</i> within Himself, and there remained an aspect of an Impression (<i>Reshimu</i>) of what was withdrawn, within this “empty space.”
From this impression (<i>Reshimu</i>) He drew out the line and thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>), in an aspect of encompassing and inner [lights].
The Unlimited Light before the withdrawal (<i>Tzimtzum</i>) is called “The upper purity,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tihiru Ila’ah</i> – The Upper Purity</i> whereas the general encompassing light of this line (<i>Kav</i>), at its beginning, is called “The lower purity,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tihiru Tata’a</i> – The Lower Purity</i> as known.
Afterwards, through a <i>Tzimtzum</i> (withdrawal), <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited was drawn down to become <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon.</i>
[Then,] from <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> there became <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
From <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> there came <i>Keter</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>. From <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> there came <i>Keter</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, and [likewise] from <i>Zeir Anpin</i> to <i>Nukvah</i>, until from <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> there came <i>Keter</i> of <i>Briyah</i>.
In this manner [there chained down] from <i>Briyah</i> to <i>Yetzirah</i>, and from <i>Yetzirah</i> to <i>Asiyah</i>, until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, which is the end of everything.
We find that the “end of everything,” which is <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> is bound to the “beginning of everything,” which is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) which contracted to become <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
This is as stated in the beginning of <i>Etz Chayim</i>, in <i>Shaar HaKlallim</i>, and is the meaning of “I am first and I am last,” as previously explained.
(In contrast, the aspect of the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light before the <i>Tzimtzum</i> cannot yet be called by the terms “beginning” or “end” since it is still an aspect of the light of His Essence, as it is before being drawn down to influence below.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In the liturgy of the <i>Amidah</i> prayer.</i> “You are holy and Your Name is holy,” as known.)
Now, after [one contemplates the particulars] is the unification.
Through the thorough contemplation (<i>Hitbonenut</i>) of all the particulars of the chaining down (<i>Hishtalshelut</i>), from the beginning of all things, which is <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> specifically, they should then all be drawn to the First Source, which is the aspect of the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
This is the general intention of the first verse of the <i>Shema</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4</i> recital, [which is] the “Upper Unity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Bereshit 18b. The first verse of the <i>Shema</i> is the “Upper Unity,” while the second statement of the prayer is the “Lower Unity.”</i>
[In other words, Listen Israel, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה our God] <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is One” refers to His simple unity before the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>. About this it states in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, Mishnah 7</i> “Before One, what do you count?”
[This is to say, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He is] higher than the ten <i>sefirot.</i> This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> “You are One, but not in enumeration” of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, as known.
However, the general intent of “Blessed is the Name of His glorious kingship forever and ever,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In the daily <i>Shema</i> prayer, the statement which immediately follows the first verse of “Listen Israel,” is the “<i>Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuto LeOlam Va’ed.</i>”</i> which is the “lower unity,”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See tractate Psachim 56a, and Zohar Bereshit 18b</i> is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One after the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
About this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:13, “<i>Malchutcha Malchut Kol Olamim</i>.” The literal translation is “Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.” However, it can also be translated as, “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all the worlds.” (<i>Malchut</i> is Kingdom). This signifies how <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, not only brings all worlds into existence, but that He is the ruler of them all.</i> “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds,” until <i>Malchut</i> (Kingdom) of <i>Asiyah</i>. This is the aforementioned matter of “I am first and I am last.”
Now, this entire unification (<i>Yichud</i>) and “binding” from the beginning to the end, which follows the contemplation of the multitude of intermediary particulars, is only like a single detail in comparison to the general principle which includes them all.
This general principle is the aspect of the general encompassing of the Circle (<i>Igul</i>) which encompasses the Line (<i>Kav</i>).
[Moreover,] it too is considered to only be a detail in comparison to the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light before the <i>Tzimtzum,</i> which is called the “Upper Purity.”
[This “Upper Purity”] is even higher than being an aspect of a “general principle” for “particular details,” since we have already stated that “He is Holy” and removed in the aspect of His Essential Self.
This is the meaning of the words,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See the <i>Baruch She’amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> prayers of the morning prayers, “<i>Yachid Chay HaOlamim</i>”</i> “The Singular One, Life of the worlds.”
From this aspect of “<i>Yachid –</i> Singular,” [influence] is drawn down by means of the aforementioned first <i>Tzimtzum,</i> to become what is called “the life of the worlds” of <i>ABY”A,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah.</i></i> which are within the line-<i>Kav</i> in an encompassing and inner manner, as known. This will suffice those of understanding.
It is necessary for a person to know and implant in his soul all the explanations of the chaining down of the worlds. After the explanations of all the particular details in the order of the chaining down (<i>Seder Hishtalshelut</i>) have been explained to a person,
then he should constantly accustom himself, throughout his life, [to contemplate them] in his mind and heart, so that he will be proficient in all the details, specifically.
[Through this,] he will [be capable of] making a summation of the entire length, including [the entirety of it] from beginning to end as one.
This [should be done] to such a degree that in a single moment of contemplation within his soul, [when he contemplates] “the end of everything,” which is the comprehension of physical coming into being of “something out of nothing,” [that is, the creation] of the physical planets and the four physical foundations, and all the other particulars of this lowly world, [he will see that there rests upon them the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One, literally].
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:26</i> “Lift up your eyes on high, and behold Who has created these.” “Lift up your eyes on high” with an actual physical sight, “and behold Who has created these” into a completely physical something, through the most final <i>Tzimtzum</i>-concealment.
It is literally in this [“end of everything”] where <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One, which is the “beginning of everything” and is even higher than the source of <i>Atzilut</i>, rests, in a limitless aspect, specifically.
This is why the book of Psalms only mentions the greatness of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, in a simple manner, [as it pertains to] the greatness and wondrousness of the acts of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה in the [physical] heavens and the earth, and its physical hosts, specifically.
It makes no mention or praise of His greatness [as it pertains to] the upper spiritual worlds and the highest heights which even precede the world of <i>Atzilut</i>.
This is because, as previously mentioned, “the beginning is specifically bound to the end.” This is [also] as stated, “See now that I, I am He,” and that the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light is what encompasses [all of existence]. This will suffice for those of understanding.
This then, is the true intent in the contemplation of the particulars, as previously explained.
(Even though according to the calculation of the [multitude of] details in the chaining down of the worlds, there is a very vast distance between the beginning and the end, nonetheless, in truth, it is very close, without any interruption and concealment in between.
This is as stated, “See now that I, I am He” and,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Tikkunei Zohar 120a</i> “There is no other besides Me, as an intermediary.” This will suffice for those of understanding.)
(This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Kohelet 7:29</i> “[Lo, this only I have found,] that God has made man upright; but they have sought out many calculations.” “That God has made man upright” [refers to] Primordial Man (<i>Adam Kadmon</i>), from the beginning of the line (<i>Kav</i>) until the “heel” of Primordial Man (<i>Adam Kadmon</i>), which concludes at the end of the world of <i>Asiyah</i>.
It is all one complete [matter] from beginning to end. [However,] “They have sought out many calculations” [referring to] the aspect of Circles (<i>Igullim</i>), with separations and divisions, one above the other.)
All the above may be understood, in a very brief way, from the aspect of the <i>Ketarim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This word is the plural of <i>Keter</i> (crown). The <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Keter</i> corresponds to the faculty of “pleasure” and “desire,” as will be explained at great length later.</i> of each world.
In the aspect of the <i>Ketarim</i> there is no aspect of “chaining down” from cause to effect in a way of distance of levels, at all.
For example, the aspect of the simple desire in the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See introduction of Etz Chayim, and Shaar 1, Anaf 2</i> “When it arose in His simple desire,” that is, the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One itself is what arose in His simple thought, [as in the statement] “I shall rule,”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As stated in the Zohar on “<i>VaYimloch</i>.” These words, “I will rule – <i>Ana Emloch</i>” is the original simple desire which arose in His simple thought.</i> which is much higher than the desire to Emanate (<i>Atzilut</i>) or to Create (<i>Briyah</i>) etc.
Those [desires] are still only in the aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i>.
From this first [simple desire], there is a <i>Tzimtzum</i> – lessening to the “Primal Desire,” which is called <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
Afterwards, [there came] the desire to Emanate which in general is the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
Afterwards was the desire to Create, which is <i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i>, following which [there came] <i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Yetzirah,</i> until the aspect of <i>Keter Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, which is the desire to actualize.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 135:6</i> “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desired He did…”
[Similarly,] below in man, what difference is there between the aspect of his desire and essential <i>heyulie</i> in which there were included four desires.
For example, the desire for his essential self and his most final desire to actualize, all came from and are rooted in one source.
Likewise, there is no difference between <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה simple desire that was drawn down to become the desire for emanation, and His simple desire that was drawn down to become [the aspect of] “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desired He did,” at the end of our world of action. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 8

Now, just as in the aspect of <i>Keter,</i> there is a unification of all the particulars to the general principle, reaching, literally all the way to the aspect of the simple desire [as it is] in the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light, in this same way, a person may contemplate the aspect of the <i>Chochmah</i> of each world, from beginning to end.
This then is the meaning of what is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:1</i> “<i>Bereshit Barah</i> – In the beginning God created etc.”
“<i>Bereshit-</i>בראשית” is translated by Targum Yerushalmi<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum Yerushalmi to Genesis 1:1</i> as “<i>B’Chochmeta -</i> with Wisdom.” Onkelos translates it as “<i>BeKadmin</i> – Primordially.”
This is the aspect of <i>Keter,</i> which is called <i>Kadmon</i> – Preceding, since it is the aspect of the essence as it precedes <i>Chochmah</i>.
This is because,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28:12</i> “Wisdom is found <b>from</b> “nothing” but it is not an actual “nothing” itself, which is not so of desire.
However, just as desire is [brought about] from the Essential Self by means of <i>Tzimtzum</i>, until it [finally] becomes invested in action, thus fulfilling the above-mentioned verse, “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires He did,” so is it with the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i>.
[In other words, <i>Chochmah</i> too is brought about] by means of <i>Tzimtzum</i> from His Essential Self.
[The Essential <i>Chochmah</i>] is what is called “the Primal <i>Chochmah</i>” or “the Simple <i>Chochmah</i>” as it exists within the Simple Unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה.
From there it is drawn down into each particular world of <i>ABY”A</i>, until [it reaches] the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of the world of <i>Asiyah</i>.
About this [last level] it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:24</i> “You have made them all with wisdom.”
For, just as it states “<i>Bereshit-</i>בראשית,” that “He created” with wisdom, in the same way, he likewise “formed” and “actualized” with wisdom.
This is similar to how it is that the desire to create, form, and actualize are all [rooted] in a single [primary] desire.
However, it chained down from the world of Creation to the world of Formation, and from the world of formation to the world of Actualization, with a lowering of levels from cause to effect.
For example, from <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i> of the world of <i>Briyah</i> there came <i>Keter</i> of the world of <i>Yetzirah</i>.
Likewise, He created, formed and actualized [everything] with a single wisdom.
However, [here too, in regard to <i>Chochmah</i>] it chained down from <i>Briyah</i> to <i>Yetzirah</i> etc.
In other words, from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Briyah</i> [influence] is drawn down to <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i>.
Likewise, in this manner [influence chains down] from <i>Yetzirah</i> to <i>Asiyah</i>, until [it reaches] the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> about which it states, “You have made them all with wisdom.” Similarly, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 3:19</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה founded the earth with wisdom,” and other such verses.
(More particularly the chaining down is that <i>Keter</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> comes from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i>, and <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> comes from <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i>. Nevertheless, generally, all aspects of cause and effect from one world to the next are drawn one from the other without being diminished by the multitude of intermediaries that are between them.
For example, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Kings I, 5:26</i> “And <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה gave Shlomo wisdom.” [Now, Shlomo] was in the world of <i>Asiyah</i>.
This influence was drawn down from <i>Chochmah</i> [as it exists] in the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light (<i>Ohr Ein Sof</i>), to <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
From <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [it was drawn down] to the Concealed <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
From there [it descended] to become the light of <i>Abba</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. [From there it descended] until [it reached] the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
From there [it descended further] to <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i>.
In this manner it [descended] from <i>Briyah</i> to <i>Yetzirah</i>, and from <i>Yetzirah</i> to <i>Asiyah</i>, until from <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> this light and influence of Godly wisdom entered the soul of <i>Shlomo</i>.
[This was] likewise [the case], in the chamber of the Holy of Holies in the Temple. There radiated from <i>Keter</i> and <i>Chochmah</i> of the Essence [of the Unlimited Light] until [it reached] the aspect of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Chochmah</i> of the chamber of the Holy of Holies in the world of <i>Asiyah</i> – Actualization. [This is to say that] the spiritual [light] of <i>Keter and Chochmah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> rested upon the physical Tablets and the Holy Ark, which stood in the chamber of the Holy of Holies in the physical Temple below.
(Similarly, [in our daily prayers] we request,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See the beginning of the Amida prayer.</i> “You grace man with knowledge” and, “Grace us from You,” specifically. This will suffice for those of understanding.)
(By way of example, this may be understood from human beings below. For instance, a person’s essential <i>Heyulie</i> wisdom includes [within itself] all that spreads forth and branches out of the light of his wisdom, even completely outside of his essence,
That is, even [to the point of] intellect that is invested in a physical act, which is separate [from his essential self].
For him, there is no difference between the spreading of his essential insight (<i>Chochmah</i>) within the essence of his intellect, in which he conceptualizes [in a way of] intellectual analysis, and the spreading forth [of the intellect] into a [physical] act, which is separate [and apart from his essence].
It is all considered to be a single insight, except that this [level] is more spiritual and essential to him, while in action it [the wisdom] becomes [invested] into a separate thing.
This is so much so, that in relation to the aspect of his actual essential self it is but a single wisdom, except that it spreads forth from his intellectual analysis into his emotions and thoughts, until, ultimately, he actually puts this insight into action.
An example is [when someone has] an [innovative] insight in business matters etc. (
Similarly, [this may be understood] in regard to the speech [of God], as in the verse, “And God said, let there be light” which then came into action, as in the verse, “And there was light.”
Of course, this originated from the aspect of His Essential Wisdom as it is in the Essential Self of the Emanator.
[This is to say,] that He emanated (<i>Atzilut</i>) the light, and afterwards he created (<i>Briyah</i>), formed (<i>Yetzirah</i>) and made (<i>Asiyah</i>).
This is likewise the case in regard to all the specifics of the coming into being of the emanated, created, formed and actualized, from the Essential Self of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>).
All the particulars of these [worlds] are unified and bound with the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof</i>), which is [vested] in <i>ABY”A</i>.
Moreover, from [the perspective of] His Essential Self, there is absolutely no difference between the first and the last.
This being the case, the statement, “I am first and I am last” likewise applies to the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> at the beginning of the emanation – <i>Atzilut,</i> until <i>Chochmah</i> at the end of the Actualization – <i>Asiyah</i>.
Furthermore, in this way, the aspect of the general unification of the emotions, thought, speech and action of each of the four worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>, may also be understood in a manner of particulars.
[This is to say] that the emotions of <i>Atzilut</i> become invested within the emotions of <i>Briyah</i>, and the emotions of <i>Briyah</i> become invested within the emotions of <i>Yetzirah</i>. The emotions of <i>Yetzirah</i> [then] become invested within the emotions of <i>Asiyah,</i> so that ultimately, the six directions of <i>Asiyah</i> are bound up with the beginning of everything, that is, with His Essential emotions, which precede the world of <i>Atzilut.</i>
About these [emotions] it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See the morning prayers, blessing of <i>Yotzer</i>.</i> “[The King who is exalted and alone,] who is exalted above the days of the world.”
This refers to the aspect of the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i>, [which receive] from the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, [which receive] from the emotions of the Unlimited Light itself, which are concealed within His Essential Self, literally.
An example [of the above] is the aspect of <i>Chessed –</i> Kindness of the Unlimited Light. About this [Kindness] it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Lamentations 3:22</i> “<i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה kindnesses have not ceased,” since it, literally, is in an aspect of Limitlessness.
[Regarding this Kindness] we say,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:22, and Shabbat Prayers</i> “Let Your Kindness…be upon us,” literally.
[This is to say that it should radiate] within the kindness of the diminished emotions of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, which radiates in this world.
Likewise, from the aspect of His essential thought, [influence] is drawn down until [it reaches] the aspect of the thoughts of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, in that He thinks to do it, in actuality.
The same [principle] applies to speech and action, because just as “everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires” in His Essential desire, “He does,” so too, “everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires” [to think], He thinks.
[The] only [difference between this and the desire as it exists in His Essential Self is] that it descends and is drawn into the [order of the] chaining down [of the worlds from cause to effect] until His desire, intellect and thought is to actually do.
However, [the entire chaining down process] of the desire, intellect, emotions, thought and action are all considered to literally be one [thing] relative to the aspect of His actual Essential Self. This is understood from all the above, and will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, after [contemplating] all this, a person should conceptualize and contemplate “Who created these,” physically, how it is that even the last particular is not separate from the first general source.
[He should contemplate this in regard to] each particular of Creation, such as the creation of the heavens and the earth, or all the particulars in the categories of Inanimate, Vegetation, Animal, and Speaking Beings.
[He should contemplate] how their spiritual source in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> is bound up and connected to the highest heights, like a chain.
This is so, just as the aspects of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>ABY”A</i> are unified [with their source], as stated, “In the beginning He created” [which was translated as] “Primordially – <i>Keter</i>,” and, “With Wisdom – <i>Chochmah</i>.”
So too, with the particulars which branch out from them, These being the emotions, thought, speech and action of each world.
(Which are the ten general <i>sefirot</i> of each world. That is, <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin, Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> of [each of] the four worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>.)
[This continues] until the aspect of Action – <i>Asiyah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of the world of <i>Asiyah.</i> The end [of everything] is bound with the beginning of everything.
For, just as He emanated with <i>Kadmon</i> (Desire), so too, with this very same <i>Kadmon</i> (Desire) He created, formed and did, as is written, “Everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה desired, He did etc.”
Likewise, the emotions (the six directions) are nullified to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 33:21</i> “Behold, the place is with Me.”
[For example,]<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Chronicles I 29:11</i> “Yours, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, is the greatness” [represents the nullification of <i>Chessed</i> to <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה] in each world, according to what it is.
[This continues upward] until the aspect of His Essential Space. This is called “His Place,” as in the dictum of our sages, of blessed memory,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshit Rabba 68:9</i> “He is the place (<i>Makom</i>-מקום) of the world, but the world is not His place.”
This is similar to the well-known adage,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar (Raya Mehemnah) Pinchas 225a</i> “He grasps all worlds, but there are none who grasp Him.” Even the Primal Thought and Desire [cannot grasp Him].
From all this, the matter of the unification and connection of the particulars to the general principle by way of the totality of everything in the essence of the Unlimited light [as it is drawn down] into ABY’’A, may be understood.
This is besides the aspect of the unity [as it relates to] each world, in a way of particulars, in regard to the ten <i>Sefirot</i> [of each world]<i>.</i>
Now, although a person may know the explanations for the entire chaining down of <i>ABY”A</i> [with all its] particulars, he should [nonetheless] draw his soul to [contemplate and] unify the particulars to the general totality, in the aforementioned manner, until [they are] literally [one] with the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light (<i>Ohr Ein Sof</i>).
This is aside from [his contemplation in] unifying and nullifying each particular world to the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
[He should do this] until his vast contemplation in the particulars of this matter, become encapsulated in a wondrously brief summary.
An example of this [can be understood from the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:13</i> “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds.”
This is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) [as it is invested] within <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, as previously explained regarding Desire, Wisdom and Emotions.
This is in accordance with the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:39</i> “See now that I, I am He,” literally.
Similarly, [regarding the verse,]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:6</i> “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed.”
“I-<i>Ani-</i>אני,” which is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i>, is the [same] “nothingness-<i>Ein</i>-אין” as <i>Keter</i>, since “the beginning is bound up with the end.”
[This is true] both particularly in each particular world, and in the general totality of everything.
It thus states, “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed.” [That is, there is no difference] whatsoever between <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One and <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
This then, is the meaning of, “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds,” that is, even until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>. [It all is] because of the reason explained above. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 9

At first glance, the verse, “I HaShem have not changed,” is not understood.
Now, [this verse] is speaking in regard to <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) Himself.
However, if in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> (Actualization) there is a change between judgment and kindness, which is [only] an aspect of a reaction, then it must be that in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Ein</i> Sof (The Unlimited One) this change also takes place.
After all, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:39</i> “See now that I, I am He.”
It likewise states,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:13</i> “Your kingdom is the kingdom of all worlds,” literally equally, as explained previously.
In other words, when the desire for kindness arises in His simple essential desire, this very same essential desire for kindness descends until the very end, to the desire for kindness of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, literally.
According to all the above mentioned, it is likewise understood that the opposite is true as well.
Furthermore, we recite [daily],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> recital.</i> “He renews every day…the act of creation” here below [in our physical world].
In other words, [“he renews”] in “<i>Kadmin</i> – Desire” and “<i>Chochmeta –</i> Wisdom,” [which are the translations]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum Onkelus and Targum Yerushalmi to Genesis 1:1</i> of “In the beginning He created.”
[These are “renewed”] all the way until the highest heights, literally in His Essential Self.
This being the case, [it seems] that there is a renewal even in the Essence of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof)</i>.
How then can it state,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:6</i> “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed,” [implying that there is no change] whatsoever?
Similarly, we say,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See the morning prayers.</i> “You are He before the creation of the world; You are He after the creation of the world.” This [principle] likewise applies “before He emanated,” as known.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Avodat HaKodesh (R’ Meir ben Gabay) Chelek HaYichud, Ch. 2.</i>
Moreover, in the analogy of man below, there is change from a desire for judgment to a desire for kindness, even in the essential desire, as known.
Likewise, how can we [pray and] request, “May it be desirable before You,” [requesting of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה to have] a new desire; that a desire for judgment should be overturned into a desire for kindness?
[This question is further strengthened by the fact that] we see multitudes of changes every day and every hour, in “everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה desires”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 135:6</i> and constantly does in the heavens and the earth.
Now, the resolution for all this is the matter of <i>Tzimtzum</i>, as known.
For, if the influence was in a manner of cause and effect, then the matter of change and reaction would fall upon it.
However, since the aspect of the drawing down [of influence] is only in an aspect of a light and ray, and this too is by means of <i>Tzimtzum</i>, there is therefore no change at all in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, even in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
Such is the case, all the way to the highest level.
After <i>Tzimtzum</i> [however] there is an aspect of change, but only from the perspective of the recipients, as known.
The explanation of the difference between “<i>Ohr</i> (Light) and <i>Shefa</i> (Influence) is known to all.
However, even in the aspect of the light it was necessary for [its revelation] to be by means of <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
It therefore is incumbent upon every individual to know the matter of <i>Tzimtzum</i> and to contemplate it [relative] to each world according its value.
This is because it is the main principle in the general matter of the unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, and [in understanding] how there is no change relative to the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
[This is to say] that before Him, “the darkness and the light are equal,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 139:12</i> the spiritual and the physical are equivalent, so much so, that the world of <i>Atzilut</i> and the world of <i>Asiyah</i> are equal [before Him], as known.
Now, the [above] is only in relation to the encompassing light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which is called <i>Sovev Kol Almin</i> (The light that encompasses or transcends all worlds) both generally and particularly.
This [light] is higher than the level of light that is in an aspect of <i>Memale Kol Almin</i> (the light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה, blessed is He, that fills all worlds), as known.
However, even in the aspect of the inner light of <i>Memaleh</i>, both generally and particularly, there is no change.
[Here too] its upper and lower [levels] are equivalent.
This is as stated, “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed,” and “I-<i>Ani-</i>אני” refers to the aspect of <i>Memaleh</i> [the inner pervading light], as known.
Likewise, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 23:24</i> “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? – says <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה.” He, specifically, fills them equally.
This too [refers to] the aspect of the inner pervading light, as in the dictum,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Tikkunei Zohar, 457 (91b) and 470 (122b) and other sources.</i> “There is no place void of Him,” as known.
The reason is because even in the aspect of [the inner light of] <i>Memaleh</i>, the light and influence descend specifically by means of <i>Tzimtzumim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is the plural of <i>Tzimtzum</i>.</i>
As known, even the aspect of the line and thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>) which is drawn from the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One and is generally called the inner light<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Memale Kol Almin</i>.</i> of the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> is, likewise, initially drawn by means of <i>Tzimtzum</i> in the Essence.
This is the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is called the “empty place” (<i>Makom Panuy</i>) and the “empty void” (<i>Challal Reikan</i>), as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Etz Chayim</i>, Shaar 1, Anaf 2 (<i>Drush Igullim V’Yosher</i>)</i>
This is likewise the case in the descent of the <i>Kav-</i>line down, into the aspects of <i>Igullim</i> and <i>Yosher</i>, until it becomes the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, [this too] is by means of <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
The same [principle] applies [in the descent] from <i>Adam Kadmon</i> to <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin.</i> [It too is by way of <i>Tzimtzum</i>].
Even within the world of <i>Atzilut</i> itself, generally, there is a screen (<i>Masach</i>) between <i>Keter</i> and <i>Chochmah</i>.
This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Terumah 26:33</i> “The curtain shall be for you as a division between the holy and the holy of holies,” as explained in <i>Zohar</i>.
Similarly, [there is a screen (<i>Masach</i>)] between <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> to <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, and between <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukva</i>, as known.
[Furthermore], between <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i>, there is a <i>Masach</i> (screen) and <i>Malchut</i> penetrates the screen and becomes <i>Keter</i> of <i>Briyah</i>.
In this manner, there is a <i>Masach</i> (screen) between <i>Briyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>, and <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i> penetrates the screen and becomes <i>Keter</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i>.
Similarly, <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> penetrates the screen and becomes <i>Keter</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
[This continues] until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, which is called “The King who is exalted and alone.”
This is also like the statement of the Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 77b</i> “Like the creation of the world: At first there was darkness, and then the light returned.”
Similarly, the Sages stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Bereshit 1:1 and the citations there.</i> “Initially it arose in His thought to create with the quality of Judgment.” This [quality of Judgment] is the aspect of <i>Tzimtzum</i>, [which is] the title God-<i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
This is as stated, “In the beginning God-<i>Elohi”m</i>-אלהי״ם created etc.” [“<i>Bereshit</i> – In the beginning” is translated as] “<i>Bechochmeta –</i> With Wisdom,” and “<i>BeKadmin</i> – With Desire,” which is the desire and wisdom of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>. This will suffice for those of understanding.
According [to all of the above] everything is resolved [in regard to] the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:6</i> “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed.”
[This is to say that there is no change] between a desire for kindness or for judgment in all of the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>.
In other words, [this refers to] how He is before the <i>Tzimtzum</i> or <i>Masach</i> (screen) through which [the light] penetrates and becomes the <i>Keter</i> of the lower world.
It is, specifically, to this aspect, [that is, the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, that we pray and] say, “May it be desirable, specifically, before You.”
[Relative to the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He,] all aspects of “higher” and “lower” in the world, are literally equivalent.
However, after the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, the desire is drawn into the intellect and emotions with changes, until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> [about which] we say, “May it be desirable before You,” [meaning that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, should cause] a change in actual action, from judgment to kindness and the like. This will suffice those of understanding.

Chapter 10

We must now understand all the particulars of the four worlds of <i>ABY”A</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> in a manner of specifics. In other words, we must understand all the specifics in the matter of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>ABY”A</i>, their lights and vessels, and their vestments, one within the other.
Moreover, we must understand all their particulars, even how each <i>sefirah</i> divides into its particular specifics.
For example, we even [must understand] the aspect of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Malchut</i> that is in <i>Chochmah</i>, that is in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Chessed</i>, and the like.
[Furthermore, we must understand] the matter of the unifications and inclusions [of the <i>sefirot</i>] in the aspect of the <i>Keter</i> of each world. [<i>Keter</i>] is the aspect of the intermediary between the upper world and the world that is below it.
Briefly, this general principle is known, that from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the upper [world], there comes about the <i>Keter</i> of the lower [world]. This [principle] applies even to the highest levels.
However, all those who contemplate should first contemplate upon the Primal Source, Who is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Bereshit 33a. (<i>Mekora D’Koola</i>)</i> “The Source of everything” (<i>Mekora D’Koola</i>).
That is, [he should contemplate] the aspect of the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof</i>), [even] before the aforementioned first <i>Tzimtzum</i> which is called “the empty place” (<i>Makom Panooy</i>).
There too [he should contemplate] specifically in a manner of particulars.
This [contemplation] is known as the “elongation of the One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 13b</i> [signifying that one is to contemplate] specifically upon the Simple Unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה.
In general, this [Simple Unity] is divided into three levels, each of which includes ten <i>sefirot</i>.
These [three levels are called] <i>Yachid-</i>Singular<i>, Echad-</i> One, and <i>Kadmon-</i>Preceding. All this is still within the aspect of the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof</i>) before the aforementioned first <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
The aspect of <i>Yachid</i>-Singular, connotes that He is literally alone.
This is higher than the unity of parts, which is called <i>Echad</i>-One, as known.
Accordingly, in the aspect of the actual Essential Self of the Unlimited Light, it is not yet fitting to discuss the matter of the ten <i>sefirot</i> at all.
For example, [to say] “<i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>)” would automatically imply an understanding that it was preceded by the aspect of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Chochmah</i> etc.
Now, in truth, even the aspect of the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light, which is called “Alone,” includes ten <i>sefirot</i> within itself.
However, they are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a-b</i> “He is wise, but not with a knowable wisdom etc.,” to the point that we say, “He is not of any of these qualities at all,” as known.
The explanation of the matter is that, in truth, just as the Essential Self of the Unlimited One (<i>Atzmoot Ein Sof</i>) is an absolutely simple light, so is this [the case] with His light and ray, which is called the Unlimited Light (<i>Ohr Ein Sof</i>).
As mentioned previously, this is the meaning of “Before the creation of the world there was Him and His Name alone.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, Ch 3.</i>
This [level] is called the “upper purity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tehiroo Ila’a</i></i>
This is the matter of the revelation of the light of His Essential Self, specifically as it is.
This [level] is called <i>Yachid-</i>Singular. That is, there is nothing besides Him that the terminology of “unity” or “singularity” may be applied to.
This is the meaning of,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> “You are one, but not in enumeration” of ten.
However, from the fact that they stated, “He is wise, but not with a knowable wisdom etc.,” it is, nonetheless, [apparent] that there are various categories and levels [such as] wise, understanding, merciful etc.
[Nevertheless,] all this is not [stated] in regard to His Essential Self, but only in regard to what He estimated within Himself in potential, of what is destined to be in actuality, after the aforementioned first <i>Tzimtzum</i>
(As written in <i>Mikdash Melech</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Mikdash Melech to Zohar I 15a.</i> quoting the <i>Arizal</i> himself, and as explained elsewhere at length.)
This is also the meaning of the first general teaching of the <i>Zohar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 15a</i> “In the beginning of the rule of the King, He engraved an engraving in the Upper Purity.”
The explanation of this is that in the aforementioned Essence of the revelation of His simple light, which is called the Upper Purity, “He engraved an engraving,” which is the matter of engraving letters.
“The beginning of the rule [of the King],” refers to when it arose in His simple desire. This is the aspect of <i>Keter</i>, whereas the aspect of the letters which He engraved is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One.
If this is the case, then there is a beginning and end, a <i>Keter</i> and <i>Malchut</i>, even in the aspect of the Essence of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One.
The explanation of this is that it arose in His simple thought and desire, “<i>Ana Emloch –</i> I shall rule.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Magid Dvarav l’Yaakov of the Maggid of Mezhritch, Ch. 83 and elsewhere.</i>
All this is still totally within His Essential Self. [That is, it] still precedes the matter of the estimation within Himself, in potentiality, of what His revealed desire for Kingship will be, after the first <i>Tzimtzum,</i> which is called the “empty place” (<i>Makom Panuy</i>).
The analogy for this, as known, is from the powers of the [human] soul, as they come into revelation from desire until action.
All these [powers] and their specifics exist in the concealed light of the essence of the soul, which is called the aspect of <i>Yechidah</i>.
For example, when a person [who] desires kindness and goodness, [wants] to do a particular act of goodness, this comes about because he possesses this quality of kindness and goodness in the aspect of the essence of his soul, which is called <i>Yechidah</i>.
It is because of this that this desire for kindness comes into revelation from its concealment.
Now, we must say, with certainty, that in the essence of his soul, this desire for kindness exists in a way of an essential <i>Heyulie</i> power.
[That is to say,] it includes within itself everything that he may come to desire of kindness and goodness, in every particular specific that may be asked of him.
If this is the case, we must say that prior to his revealed arousal of desire and will to express his kindness in this particular deed, it was included in the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness.
It then came out of the <i>Heyulie</i> state to become revealed in this particular act.
Furthermore, we observe that in the [revealed] desire for kindness, there is intellect, wisdom, emotions, thought, speech and action.
It therefore is certain that in the source of this desire for kindness, while it was concealed in the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, there too, it included these divisions of intellect, emotions, thought, speech and action, which it possesses.
However, in the aspect of the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, as it exists prior to being expressed into a particular thing, even though, there too, there are divisions of intellect and emotions etc., nevertheless, they are included and unified in an ultimate state [of unity].
This likewise applies to any other particular essential qualities, such as the quality of <i>Gevurah</i>-Judgment<i>, Tiferet</i>-Beauty (or Mercy)<i>,</i> or <i>Netzach-</i>Conquest<i>,</i> and the like. [This is so,] until the quality of <i>Malchut-</i>Kingship<i>,</i> which is the quality of leadership.
Certainly, it too includes ten [qualities, such as] the desire and will for kingship, the wisdom [for kingship], emotions, thoughts, [speech and action] etc.
However, before it comes to an aspect of revelation in a particular thing, such as ruling over a specific country etc., they were absolutely included and unified in the aspect of the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kingship.
[This is] similar to [what was explained] regarding the aforementioned essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness.
If so, it is automatically understood [in regard to] the essential <i>Heyulie</i> qualities of <i>Keter, Chochmah, Binah, Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod</i> and <i>Malchut</i>, [all of] which are in the essence of the soul, that it is not fitting to speak of them using a terminology of “unification” or “inclusion,” [stating that they are “unified”] in the essence of the soul, which is called <i>Yechidah</i>.
This is because they are not at all separate from the essence.
For example, with the aforementioned quality of the <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness that is embedded in the essential nature [of a kind person, it cannot be spoken of as being separate from his essential self].
The essence of the soul itself is even higher than being [called] an “essential desire for kindness,” since this [kindness] is only a particular of the actual essential being, which is the ultimate of simplicity.
However, [although this desire for kindness is only a single particular that is drawn from the essence,] it nonetheless is impossible to say about it, that it “unifies” with the <i>Heyulie</i> quality of <i>Netzach</i> – Conquest, which is [also] embedded in the essence of the soul. This is because the two are both absolutely unified with the essence, and are not at all separate from the self.
By way of analogy, the power of movement, that actually is included in the essence of an animal, even before it moves at all, is not at all separate from the essential self of the animal.
Now, even though in the revelation of this [<i>Heyulie</i>] power of movement, [that is, when the animal] makes a particular movement, it divides into many particular ways [of moving], it [nonetheless] is impossible to state that all the particular movements were “included” and “unified” while the power of movement was still included in the essence of the animal.
This is because, at that point, it was not within the category or definition of “movement” at all, not generally and not particularly.
This is likewise [the case] with the aspect of the revelation and spreading forth of the life force to enliven the entire body, while it still is completely included in the essential spirit of life.
Even though [this life force] divides into [various powers, such as] sight to the eye and hearing to the ear etc.
Certainly, even before it came forth to materialize in the eye and ear in actuality, there was included [in this life force] a spiritual power and life force of sight [destined] to the eye, in and of itself, and a spiritual power and life force of hearing [destined] for the ear, in and of itself etc.
Nonetheless, before the essence of the soul came to the aspect of spreading forth life force, even though it was included in it, nonetheless, it is in the same way that the aforementioned power of movement is included in the essential self of an animal.
It is only applicable to [use a terminology of] inclusion and unification of “sight” and “hearing” when [these powers] are <b>destined</b> and <b>prepared</b> to come into revelation in actuality, to enliven [the body].
However, while they were still completely included in the essence of the soul, it was as if this [aspect of] “spreading forth of life force” was completely nonexistent.
This is because the essential self of the soul is much higher than the aspect of “spreading forth,” except that it includes within itself this [<b>ability</b>] to spread forth [and enliven] as well, just as the essential self of an animal includes the power of movement within itself, as explained above.
If so, then how is it fitting or proper [to use terms] such as the aspects of “unification” and “inclusion” of the particular light and life force?
[Rather,] it is only fitting in regard to the particular divisions of life force that are <b>destined</b> and <b>prepared</b> to spread forth into revelation.
From this we are forced to say that all these particulars that spread forth [into revelation], [exist] completely included within the essence, for if this was not so, from where did these particulars in the spreading forth of revelation come?
This is similar to the light and rays that are included in the self of the sun. [In other words,] concealed within [the sun] are all the particular ways of the spreading forth of its rays etc. This will suffice for those of understanding.
We thus find that there are three levels, one following the other, that are drawn from the actual essence of the soul, which is called the <i>Yechidah</i>.
The first [level] is the ten essential <i>Heyulie</i> powers, such as the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, and the like.
They are absolutely and totally included in [the essence]. [This is] like the inclusion of the power of movement in the essential self of an animal, or like the inclusion of the [power] to “spread forth life force,” which is included in the essential self [of the soul], as explained above.
In regard to these [<i>Heyulie</i> powers,] it is not fitting to use a terminology of “unification of separate parts together.”
This is because they are completely included in the essential self, and it is as if they have no existence at all, as explained above.
The second [level] is the aspect of the spreading forth of the ten powers, as they are prepared to come into revelation.
This is like the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, as it comes to do a particular act of kindness.
[However, this is] still before it is drawn out into actuality. Rather, it is only <b>destined</b> and <b>prepared</b> to come out to this particular [act of kindness].
Here, [on this level,] the matter of “unification” of the many particulars which are within it, is applicable.
For example, [included within this are] the intellect and emotions of this desire for kindness, which are drawn from their concealment in the general <i>Heyulie</i>.
The third [level] is when it is drawn to that particular [act of kindness], only that it has not yet come into [actuality] due to some lacking or obstacle.
However, the preparation itself is already complete. The only thing that is missing is for it to come out and be revealed in actuality.
In other words, he already estimated within himself, in a manner of particulars, [everything that is necessary to bring] this thing into actuality.
This is to say that he estimated within himself, in potential, what is necessary [for him] to bring it into actuality.
In the aforementioned allegory of the power of movement, [this can be seen] when it is prepared and destined to come into revelation in a particular [movement].
In the example of the spreading forth of life force to enliven the body, [this can be seen] when it is prepared to come out [of the essence].
At this point, all the particular life forces [like sight and hearing] are completely included in a general unity.
After this, he estimates within himself and prepares within his power of movement, how to move in a particular way.
Similarly, [regarding the example of the influx of life force], there is the estimation of the revelation and spreading forth of the spirit of life, as he prepares within himself to enliven [the body] in actuality.
Another example is the power of growth, as it is prepared to grow in actuality. Here too, there are these three levels.
Furthermore, [all three of these levels] are before anything came out into actuality.
For example, in the [power of] movement, [this entire estimation] is before any actual physical movement. Or, in the spiritual life force, [this preparation] is before it actually comes into a physical body.
Then, there is a change from a spiritual existence to a physical existence, such as a physical movement and physical life force.
The same is true in the example of physical growth.
For this [change of existence] to be, it is necessary for there to be an initial <i>Tzimtzum</i> - contraction and restraint in the revelation of this spiritual [<i>Heyulie</i>]. This is so that there may be [a transition] from spiritual to physical (as will be explained in chapter 12).

Chapter 11

Now, the analogue for all that was mentioned above about the [human] soul, may be understood by [a person] who conceptualizes [how it is] above in the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is called <i>Yachid-</i>Singular.
Included [in the level of <i>Yachid</i>] there also are ten <i>sefirot</i>. These are called “the ten hidden <i>sefirot</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In Hebrew this is “<i>Eser Sefirot Hagnoozot BeHelem Ha’Atzmoot</i>.”</i> that are hidden in the Essential Self, literally.
For example, the simple desire for the entire chaining down, which is a specific [line of revelation], arose because of the desire for kindness included in the aspect of the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One.
This is as stated in the introduction of <i>Etz Chayim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 1, Anaf 2. Also see, Etz Chayim Shaar HaKlallim, Chapter 1. There it states, “When it arose in His desire to create the world, blessed be His name, in order to bestow goodness unto His creatures…” This indicates that the desire for creation comes from a desire to bestow kindness and goodness.</i> “When it arose in His simple desire.”
Certainly, the reason for this arousal of the simple desire of His Essential Self is only because in His Essential Self, “He desires kindness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 7:18</i>
It therefore arose in His desire to bestow His goodness and kindness, to be a source for the source of the chaining down of the line and thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>).
This is like the aforementioned analogy, that because of the essential [<i>Heyulie</i>] desire for kindness that is included in the aspect of the <i>Yechidah</i> [of one’s soul], it arises in the desire of [a person] to do goodness and kindness through a specific act, as explained previously.
[That is,] it becomes revealed from its concealment in the <i>Heyulie</i> for the desire of kindness, to include every particular that will ever arise in his desire to bestow goodness.
Everything [that becomes revealed] comes because of [this <i>Heyulie</i>], and because of its strength.
Furthermore, the revelation of the desire which comes because of this [<i>Heyulie</i>] desire for kindness includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>]; <i>ChaBa”D</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acronym for the three intellectual <i>sefirot</i>, <i>Chochmah</i>, <i>Binah</i> and <i>Da’at</i>.</i> emotions (<i>Midot</i>) etc.
From this we must conclude that also the aspect of the <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, which is literally included in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, likewise includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>]; intellect and emotions etc.
However, it is not fitting to speak of them using terms of “inclusion” or “unification,” since they still are included in His Essential Self in the way of a <i>Heyulie</i>.
This is likewise so in regard to the other qualities, such as the qualities of <i>Gevurah</i>, <i>Netzach</i> or <i>Tiferet</i> etc.
They all are included in the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, which is called the “Upper Purity.”
It is this [level] that is called <i>Yachid</i> – Singular, and is higher than <i>Echad Pashut</i> – Simple Oneness [or Unity].
This [inclusion] is so, until the quality of Kingship in the Essential Self of the Unlimited Light, which is called <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One.
It too is included in the aspect of the essential <i>Heyulie</i> of the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One.
[Furthermore,] it is literally Unlimited.
Just as the desire for kindness of the Essential Self is completely Unlimited, and [just as] there is no limit to His wisdom, likewise, the quality of “ruling over” (<i>Malchut</i>) which is included in the Essential Self of the Limitless Light, is Unlimited.
Moreover, in the concealment of the Essential Self, it [too] includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>]. These are the desire, pleasure, wisdom and emotions of the quality of Kingship – <i>Malchut</i>.
However, the matter of “I shall rule” which arose in His simple desire and thought, represents [the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kingship] as it comes out of the concealment of the <i>Heyulie</i>, to be revealed in a particular thing; [namely,] the entire chaining down of the worlds.
This is similar to what was explained above in regard to the quality of the desire for kindness in a human being below, and as explained in the analogy of the ten powers that are included in the aspect of the <i>Yechidah</i> [of the soul], [that they are there] in a way of an essential <i>Heyulie</i>.
[That is,] they are not at all separate from the essential self.
Similarly, [analogies were given of] the power of movement, which is included in the essential self of an animal, and the <i>Heyulie</i> ability to spread forth life force [and enliven], which is included in the essential self of the soul, literally, as previously explained.
Lower than this [level] is the aspect of the Unlimited Light that radiates and spreads forth.
However, this all is still in the aspect of His Essential Self, before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
This [level] is what is called “<i>Achdut HaPshuta</i> – Simple Oneness [or Unity].”
Here it is possible [to speak of the] “inclusion” and “unification” of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, [however,] they too are called<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer Yetzirah Chapter 1, Mishnah 2 – “<i>Eser Sefirot Blimah</i>”</i> “ten <i>sefirot</i> without ‘whatness,’” because they nonetheless are still beyond the aspect of preparing to influence below, in [actual] revelation.
However, it is already prepared to come out of the <i>Heyulie</i> state [into revelation] into a particular matter.
For example, in the aforementioned analogy of the <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, [this is] when it comes to the realm of will and desire [to be expressed in actuality] in the chaining down of a line [of action].
Although, even within Himself, this has not yet come out into complete revelation, nonetheless, here the aspects of “unity” and “inclusion” are applicable.
However, it is called a “Simple Unity” because it still is within the light of the His Essential Self, which is the ultimate simplicity.
For example, in the [<i>Heyulie</i>] desire for kindness there are the aspects of division of intellect and emotions etc., even before it comes into any [actual] revelation whatsoever. [It is] because of [these concealed qualities] that it arose in His [revealed] desire and wisdom to bestow goodness, as was previously explained in regard to the second level in the human soul.
Now, the third [level] is when from the aspect of this desire for kindness, it already arose in the desire and intellect etc.
An entire estimation is ready in “letters,” which He estimates within Himself of how the influence will actually be drawn outside of His Essential Self.
For example, in the analogy of the power of movement, [this is when he] prepares how to move.
[This may also be compared] to the power of the life force of the soul, as it is prepared to enliven.
[This is to say that] they already are prepared and estimated in a limited way, as previously explained in regard to the third level in the [human] soul.
Similarly, [in regard to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, Above, this [level] is what He estimated within the Essential Self of the Limitless Light, which is called the “Upper Purity.”
[That is, He makes] an estimation of how everything that He desires in the entire chaining down [will be revealed], as an actual line of revelation, all the way until the end of world of <i>Asiyah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The world of Actualization.</i>
This then, is [the meaning of] the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 15a</i> “He engraved an engraving in the Upper Purity,” as mentioned previously.
This level is called <i>Kadmon</i>-Preceding. In other words, this is the desire for the manner of the influence, which precedes any actual revealed influence.
[All] this is still prior to the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is called the “Void” or “Empty Place,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The first <i>Tzimtzum</i> is called the Void-<i>Challal-</i>חלל, and Empty Space-<i>Makom Panooy</i>-מקום פנוי.</i> as mentioned previously. This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, the fourth level is how after the <i>Tzimtzum</i> (withdrawal), there remained an aspect of an impression (<i>Reshimu</i>), from which the line [of limited revelation] was drawn.
This is generally [called] the “Lower Purity,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Tihiru Tata’ah</i> which is the general encompassing [light] for the entire chaining down of the line.
[The line] comes as an aspect of influence lower than the Essential Self, as in the analogy of the life force which spreads forth in revelation, to enliven [the body].
It is also similar to the power of movement, which spreads forth to actually move [the body] in a revealed way.
[Here], there is a change from spiritual existence to physical existence, as previously mentioned.
This is [also] similar to the physical growth [of a plant, which comes] from the spiritual [power] of growth.
Likewise, this is the difference between the light which follows <i>Tzimtzum</i>, compared to the Essential Light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, that precedes <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
Because of this [infinite difference], the matter of <i>Tzimtzum</i> was necessary. It was specifically so that there could be a [limited] ray and line of light, the purpose of which is to be the source of the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> as known.
Nevertheless, all the particular specifics of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>ABY”A</i> were originally included in the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, in the aspect of an Essential <i>Heyulie</i>.
Afterwards, by means of the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, it changes [to be revealed] in a limited fashion, according to the general influence of the line, which is the aspect of the [general] encompassing [light].
This is similar to the spiritual life force of the soul when it comes to enliven the body.
Included in the spiritual [life force] are all the particular specifics of the physical life force, such as physical sight and hearing etc., as explained previously.
(The matter of the Restraint-<i>Tzimtzum</i> and the Impression-<i>Reshimu</i> which remained, will be explained in the next chapter.)
(This then, is the general explanation for that which is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See the beginning of the daily prayers, “<i>Baruch She’amar</i>.”</i> “Blessed is He who said and the world came into being.”
The explanation is that “He said” in concealment, in His simple desire within <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), as it still is included within the aforementioned essential [<i>Heyulie</i>] desire for kindness.
Afterwards, “[and the world] came into being,” [refers to] the revelation of light which spreads forth for a specific matter to chain down, to become the source of all the worlds.
The explanation of “the world came to be,” is [that it came to be] specifically from that which He estimated within Himself in potential etc.
For, this is the source for what comes into existence afterwards, that is, the general world which is drawn from the <i>Kav-</i>Line, as mentioned above. This will suffice for those of understanding.
[The prayer then continues,] “Blessed is He.” [The word “He-<i>Hoo</i>-הוא”] is in the third person. This refers to the aspect of the Predecessor of the world – <i>Kadmono Shel Olam</i>.
In other words, this is the aspect of [<i>Kadmon-</i>Preceding<i>,</i> which is] the estimation within Himself in potential.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 46:10</i> “He declares the end from the beginning,” that is, from the “beginning” of the <i>Kav-</i>Line, to its end.
The verse then continues, “<i>Umikedem Asher Lo Na’aseh –</i> And from before, [He declares] that which has yet to been done.”
This [too] means, from the Predecessor of the world – <i>Kadmono Shel Olam</i>. [This] is also called,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Micha 7:20</i> “<i>Yemei Kedem</i> – The preceding days.” That is, it precedes that which is drawn in the <i>Kav</i> [the limited line of revelation].
This refers to the fact that He preceded [and prepared] within Himself in potential, that which is destined to come out in actuality. This will suffice for those of understanding.
[The prayer] then continues, “Blessed is He who says and does.” This refers to what is actually drawn into the <i>Kav</i>.
[The prayer continues,] “Blessed is He who makes the Beginning.” This refers to the entire measure of the stature of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> (Primordial Man) etc.
[The prayer continues,] “Blessed is He who decrees and fulfills” – in the beginning. This refers to the aspect of the <i>Kav HaMidah</i> (The Measuring Line), that precedes <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
This is the aspect of the <i>Tzimtzum</i> of the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression, from which the <i>Kav-</i>line is drawn, as known, and as will soon be explained with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.)

Chapter 12

We must now understand the explanation of the aforementioned matter of the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, and the aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression which remained.
Although it is known to those who are familiar [with these matters], nonetheless, there are many particular details in it.
One must delve very deeply into this [matter], for it is pivotal to true union with the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
[That is, the understanding of this is pivotal to the realization of] how everything, even the entire chaining down of the <i>Kav</i>, is literally as nothing before Him.
[This should be contemplated] to the point that a person is capable of focusing his desire, with self-sacrifice, upon the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He, alone.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemia 9:6</i> “You are He, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה alone etc.”
This is [also] the meaning of,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The blessings of the <i>Shema</i> recital.</i> “The King who is exalted, alone,” [which refers to] the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
That is, “He is exalted” even “over the days of the world” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, which are called “the preceding days (<i>Yemei Kedem</i>),” as previously mentioned.
This is [also the explanation of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Kings I, 8:27</i> “The heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, cannot contain You”]. “The heavens” refers to the aspect of the general encompassing [light] which follows the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
“The heavens of the heavens” refers to [the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He,] before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>. “They cannot contain You” even in the way of a “vessel for a vessel,” as in “He engraved an engraving in the upper purity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 15a</i> This will suffice for those of understanding.
This [matter] is further [emphasized by] the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 73:25</i> “Who have I in the heavens but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire beside You.” “Who have I in the heavens” refers to the general encompassing [light] (<i>Sovev</i>) before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is called “the heavens of the heavens.”
“There is none upon earth that I desire beside You,” refers to the aspect of the <i>Kav V’Chut</i> (Line and Thread), which is the aspect of the general inner, pervading [light] (<i>Memaleh</i>).
Now, as known to those who have done the analysis, there are various different analogies and ways to explain the matter of the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is called “the empty place.”
[However,] they all arrive at one general point; that in order for the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, to be expressed in a limited way, in the aspect of a [thin] line [of revelation], He necessarily restrained His essential light, so that it would remain concealed in His Essential Self.
[This is necessary, so that] not all of it would shine forth, but only an infinitesimal amount.
This is in order that the light could afterwards be drawn down [into revelation] in [a way of] a qualitative leap of [diminished] value.
This is analogous to the brilliance of a deep and broad concept [as it exists in the] self of the teacher.
In order for him to draw [this concept] to the student, who is not [intellectually] comparable to him, the teacher must conceal the entire depth of his comprehension within himself, so that all that is left is but an aspect of an impression, which is like a single point from all the depth and breadth.
This is not to say that [his understanding] was completely withdrawn and concealed.
Rather, it is like one who relates a teaching in a brief way. He himself has the entire depth and breadth of the logical arguments in his intellect, only that during the time that he states his ruling briefly, they are temporarily included and concealed within himself.
However, as soon as he is questioned [about it], he can expand on the subject.
Only that in order for the student to understand, through this short [ruling], he temporarily conceals [the depth and breadth of it] within himself, as explained elsewhere at length.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Likutei Torah, Vayikra (in the additions) 52c and on; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra, Vol. 2, pg. 921 and on.</i>
Now, the impression, which remains like a point, is not a complete and true <i>Tzimtzum</i> (withdrawal).
[A true and complete <i>Tzimtzum</i>] would be like one who completely withdraws [revelation] and completely conceals, [in which case] the student lacks all [revelation].
Rather, [the explanation of] the matter is that included in this short [ruling] is the entire length. Not a single thing is missing, not even half a thing.
This is similar to how the short rulings of the <i>Mishnah</i> include the entire length of the logical debate of the <i>Talmud</i>.
This is [likewise] similar to how the entire logical debate is not concealed from one who knows it, even when he reviews it to himself briefly.
We find that his knowledge of the length encompasses the entire revelation of the brief [teaching], in a concealed way.
[However,] it is not completely withdrawn, as [in the case of] forgetfulness or the like, as explained elsewhere at length.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Likutei Torah, Vayikra (in the additions) 53c; Also see Sefer HaMa’amarim 5647, pg. 48.</i>
The second type of analogy, which is the life of the soul [as it is invested] in the body, also brings out the same point as above.
This is that in order for there to be a change from the essential spiritual life of the soul, to a [physical] life of flesh, it is necessary for there to be an initial concealment and contraction of the light of the soul.
This is because there is no comparison between them.
Nonetheless, the soul is affected by the occurrences of the body.
Therefore, even the light of the physical life [force] is connected and bound with the spiritual light of the essence.
This is similar to [how the aforementioned] physical growth is bound to the spiritual power of growth.
However, when one’s [physical] limb becomes severed, God forbid, this does not cause a loss to the spiritual light and life force of that limb.
Proof of this is [the fact that] a blind person can give birth to a whole person, as known.
This [shows that] the spiritual [life force] is merely concealed, but still exists, hovering over the physical life force of the body.
This is called “<i>Tzelem Ish</i> – The form of man.”
This is similar to how the aforementioned [breadth and length of] knowledge, which is concealed, [encompasses the brief teaching] etc. (This is all explained elsewhere at length.)
Likewise, when the spiritual power of movement comes into an [actual] physical movement, it becomes constrained within itself.
Nonetheless, the physical movement is connected and bound to the spiritual [power of] movement.
There are many other examples of this as well, such as the matter of having insight into a particular concept, which comes from the power of conceptualization [of his soul], which rests upon him in a concealed [fashion].
However, [we must now] understand the aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i> – Impression, which indicates the withdrawal of everything into concealment, so that only an impression of everything remains.
This is better understood through other analogies and matters. For example, it is like the blueprint<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The word for “Impression” is “<i>Reshimu,</i>” and it is worthy to note that this shares the same root as “Blueprint – <i>Roshem</i>.”</i> that the architect drafts.
He is capable of constructing the [entire] building from the small lines of the blueprint. The entire length of the construction is included briefly in the blueprint.
Another example [of a <i>Reshimu-</i>impression] is like someone who makes a sign [for himself] as a memory aide.
The sign [or mnemonic] has no [actual] relation to the essence of the matter, but is merely a memory aide, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 31:20</i> “Make signs for yourself.”
This is a much greater concealment than the [aforementioned analogy of someone who] teaches the summary of the law, which includes the entire [logic] within it.
[For, in that example] there at least is some relationship between the short summary and the lengthy [explanations].
There is another analogy for this <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression, which implies an even greater <i>Tzimtzum</i>-Restraint and concealment.
It is like a person who throws a stone. The power that propels it is separate from the self [of the thrower].
Nonetheless, the entire power of movement is invested within [the stone] in a concealed fashion.
However, there is a great distance of separation from the essential power [of movement] in his hand.
In contrast, this is not the case with the power of movement itself, when he physically moves himself.
[In this case] it is vested within the physical in a more revealed [manner], as mentioned previously.
There is an [analogy of] even greater concealment than this [example of the thrown object], which is similar to the concept of the impression that [one makes] only as a reminder.
This is like when one hints with his hand to a very deep concept or idea.
The physical movement is totally separate from the spiritual thought, but nonetheless, the concept is understood through [the movement].
An even greater concealment is how the light of an intellectual [concept] is [invested] within the [physical] movements of one’s fingers when he writes it down, as explained elsewhere at length.
Now, all the above bring out the same point, as mentioned above.
This is that the aspect of the essence remains concealed and included within this impression and point. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 13

Now, from all that was said above, we can understand the analogue, as it is above in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness. This is the general matter of the <i>Tzimtzum</i> which is called the “empty place” and is the aspect of the withdrawal and concealment [of His revelation] within Himself, so that afterwards there could be the aspect of an influence of light [in a limited fashion], as mentioned previously.
Now, [this revelation] was not completely removed or concealed.
Rather, it is like the aforementioned analogy [that when a teacher] conveys [a teaching] in a brief manner, his knowledge of all the depth and length becomes concealed within himself.
If so, according to this, even after the entire chaining down of the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> which occupy this “empty place,” the aspect of the concealed light of His Essential Self encompasses and surrounds the entire chaining down of the <i>Kav</i>-line.
Furthermore, just as before the <i>Tzimtzum</i> the light of His Essential Self filled this entire void and empty space, as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>, so too, after the <i>Tzimtzum</i> the light of His Essential Self is present, as it is, in an unlimited aspect, literally, except that it is not revealed below, relative to the influence [that reaches] the recipients.
However, in regard to His Essential Self, there is no change here, whatsoever.
This is like the analogy of a person who knows the entire length [of a concept], [so that] even while he is teaching his student in a brief way, if questioned, he can immediately respond [at length].
However, the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 18:12</i> “He sets darkness as His hiding place,” and the statement of our Sages, of blessed memory,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See (Rashi) to Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 77b.</i> “At first there was darkness [and then the light returned],” is only speaking in regard to [Creation] below.
This is because [Creation] is only drawn from the aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression that remained after the aforementioned concealment.
This then, is the meaning of [the words],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>Amidah</i> prayer.</i> “You are holy, and Your Name,” that is, the Light of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self, “is Holy” and removed [from Creation].
Similarly, [it states,]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the liturgy of the morning prayers.</i> “You are He before [the creation of the world, and You are He after the creation of the world],” and as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Malchi 3:6</i> “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed.”
This is because, that which He afterwards “reveals deep things out of [the] darkness”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Job 12:22</i> and concealment, through the radiance of the <i>Kav-</i>line<i>,</i> specifically [comes] from the same light of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self that precedes the <i>Tzimtzum.</i>
This is the meaning of “You are He,” as known.
However, the light of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self is not considered to be encompassing the chaining down [of the worlds] that occupies the “empty place,” as an encompassing [light encompasses] an inner [light], such as the general encompassing [light] of the <i>Kav</i> that encompasses [all the worlds of] <i>ABY”A</i> equally.
This is because it is not yet within the definition or category of an influencing light altogether, so much so, that it cannot even be [considered to be] an aspect of “encompassing [light].”
Rather, it is the light of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, which is the aspect of His revelation, as He essentially is.
This is why we say,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See the liturgy of the <i>Emet VeYatziv</i> blessing following the <i>Shema</i> in the morning prayers.</i> “He endures and His Name endures.”
Likewise, [the statement,] “Blessed is He and Blessed is His name,” and the like, only refer to the “letters” that He “engraved” in the “upper purity,” which is what He estimated within Himself in potential.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word “Blessed-<i>Baruch</i>-ברוך” also means “to draw down,” as indicated by the words of Mishnah (Kilayim 7:1), “One who draws down the vine to the ground-<i>Hamavreech et HaGefen</i>-המבריך את הגפן.”</i>
Moreover, [after <i>Tzimtzum</i>] this [impression] too, remains somewhat concealment and withdrawal.
In other words, it is only according to what is necessary for the chaining down (<i>Hishtalshelut</i>) that follows this <i>Tzimtzum.</i> This will suffice for those of understanding.
Likewise, [this may be understood] according to the second analogy mentioned above, of the life force of the soul in the body, in that it changes from spiritual existence to physical existence.
Here too, there is no change at all, since, just as there is a connection and bond between the physical life force and the spiritual life force, in that we see that the soul is affected by the circumstances of the life of the body, but nonetheless, there is no change in the spiritual essence as a result of a lack of spreading forth of life force to a physical limb, as explained previously, so too, there is no change in the light of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self, even as it radiates after the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
[This is true] even though [after <i>Tzimtzum</i>] it is [revealed] only according to the capacity of the chaining down [of the worlds].
For, [although] there is a connection and bond between them, nonetheless, according to this analogy, the <i>Tzimtzum</i> of the light into a [limited] line [of revelation] does not cause any change at all in the light of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self.
This is, likewise, the case according to the third analogy of the physical [movement] that comes from the [spiritual] power of movement (<i>Koach HaTnoo’ah</i>), or [similarly], according to the aforementioned analogy of the insight (<i>Chochmah</i>) that comes from the power to conceptualize (<i>Koach HaMaskil</i>).
All these [analogies] arrive at the same point, as explained before at length. This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, it was explained above that the aspect of the Impression (<i>Reshimu</i>) is like a summary that includes the entire length within it.
From this it is understood that above, in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, this is the “Power to Limit” (<i>Koach HaHagbalah</i>) which exists in the Limitless Light, which is essentially utterly unlimited.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Avodat HaKodesh (R’ Meir ben Gabay) 1:2</i>
In other words, [He has the ability] to bring the entire radiance of His Essential Unlimited Light, into an aspect of limitation.
This is the matter of the Impression (<i>Reshimu</i>), within which the entirety of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is included in a limited fashion, similar to the analogy of the brief summary that includes the whole [concept] within it.
This is possible because <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is all capable, and [therefore] also includes the power to limit (<i>Koach HaMagbil</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Avodat HaKodesh (R’ Meir ben Gabay) 1:2 ibid.</i>
[He can therefore] limit and include the entire Light of His Essential Self in a single impression, as explained elsewhere at length.
However, actually, [the above] is not an accurate analogy for the aspect of the Impression (<i>Reshimu</i>) that remained in the aforementioned “void” (<i>Challal</i>) and “empty place” (<i>Makom Panuy</i>).
This is because this [impression] indicates that everything was withdrawn from there.
[It does not indicate] that some light remained, albeit, in a brief and limited fashion. Rather, [in truth], only an impression remained.
This being the case, a truer analogy [for the <i>Reshimu</i> – Impression] is [the analogy] of the short lines and signs of the blueprint that architects draft, which includes the entire length of the construction of the building.
An even greater [example of concealment], is [the analogy of a person who makes] a sign for remembrance, as previously explained.
Similarly, [regarding how it is] above [in regard to <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness], it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:7</i> “The remembrance of Your abundant kindness” and the like, [in reference to] the essential kindness of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה.
An even greater [example of] concealment and withdrawal is like the aforementioned analogy of a person who throws a stone.
Similarly, it states in <i>Sefer HaBahir</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Also see Midrash Shemot Rabba, Ch. 13.</i> “It is as if it was thrown” etc.
This is because the aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression remains separate and distant from the essence of the light.
This power that is concealed within the impression-<i>Reshimu</i> is called the aspect of the “concealed light,” which is separate from the concealed Essential Light of the Unlimited One, blessed is He.
This is similar to the separate force concealed in a thrown stone.
[The force that propels the stone] comes from the power [of movement] of the hand, which already becomes concealed within the self [once the stone leaves his hand].
(This is comparable to all the stars and planets whose orbit is [caused] by the hidden Godly power of movement that comes about in an aspect of a “throw” from the light and Godly force of the nine external vessels of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
This [Godly force that propels them] is a “separate force,” and is called the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i>, which comes out as separate and distant [from its source].
This is unlike [the force vested in] the fingers when [a person] writes or the power of the hand as it [applies] itself [directly] upon an object.
These are [examples of] a revelation of the essential power in [a way of] closeness and is called the aspect of <i>Malchut</i>, as explained elsewhere at length.)
An analogy that is even closer to this [aspect of Impression-<i>Reshimu</i>] is like how an intellectual concept is concealed and hinted at through a physical motion [of the hand].
This is called the aspect of “investment” or “containment” within a separate matter.
This is, likewise, the case when a person writes, [so that] the intellect and wisdom [are invested in] the movements of his fingers, as mentioned previously.
Likewise, above in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, the aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i> is like something relatively separate, within which the entire Light of His Essential Self is invested in a concealed manner. This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, through all the above [analogies], we have, at least, understood the general matter of the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression.
That is, though it comes in an aspect of complete withdrawal, so that all that remains in it is [just] an aspect of total brevity and “hinting” or [something] like a separate power, in a way of great brevity, nonetheless, all the particulars in the [entire] chaining down of the <i>Kav-</i>line [of limited revelation] come out of, and are drawn from this <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression itself.
This is because of [the fact] that this <i>Reshimu</i> – Impression includes everything within it, albeit in a concealed manner. It is for this reason that [afterwards] everything can come into revelation, through the aspect of the <i>Kav</i>-Line, until the end of <i>Asiyah</i> (the world of Actualization).
This is like the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Zichronot</i> blessing of the <i>Rosh HaShanah Musaf</i> prayer.</i> “All of creation is not concealed from You.”
It specifically says “from You.” This is [to indicate] that everything is done [by] and drawn into revelation according to how it arose in His simple desire, in the essential light which preceded the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
[That is, according to] how He estimated within Himself.
For, with this primal thought that He estimates within Himself, “He sees and gazes at everything in one glance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Rosh Hashanah 18a.</i>
That is, [He sees] that which is hidden and concealed in the brevity and “hint” of the <i>Reshimu</i>.
This is analogous to the architect’s blueprint. It is specifically from this [blueprint], that he will know [how] to make all the particular details of the entire length of the actual construction, from beginning to end.
However, in order that he will not forget his [original] reasoning and considerations due to the lengthiness of the subject, he drafts a blueprint as a reminder.
In this way he will not veer from [his original intent] and he will not have to rethink [the matter] within himself, anew.
This is likewise the case in the matter of making mnemonics for a deep study within himself.
These are beneficial to him, in [the fact] that through them, he [is reminded and] knows the entire length of the analysis of the depth within himself, so that he will not stray from [his reasoning] etc.
Likewise, this aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression, within which the entire light of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is concealed and included in the way of a “summary” or “hint,” is itself the source for the drawing down of the line and thread-<i>Kav V’Chut</i>.
[It is the source both] of the aspects of the encompassing [lights] and the inner, pervading [lights, of the entire Creation,] from beginning to end.
This is so that everything should be [created exactly] as it arose in His simple desire and wisdom, in the Essence of the Unlimited Light, literally.
This is the meaning of what is stated elsewhere, that a point contains two opposites, concealment and revelation.
It is concealment relative to everything above it, [but, on the other hand] all revelation to the recipients comes about specifically from it.
This [revelation] is the aspect of the <i>Kav</i>-Line, that is drawn from the <i>Reshimu</i>-Impression.
[The <i>Kav-</i>Line] is in the shape of [the letter] <i>Vav</i> (ו), which begins as a <i>Yod</i> (י) and is drawn down, as explained elsewhere at length.
Through all the above, the general matter of the <i>Tzimtzum</i> [which is called] the “empty place,” and the aspects of the <i>Reshimu</i> and the <i>Kav,</i> may be understood.
[It is understood] that this is a self-limitation only in order that everything will be drawn into revelation.
This then is the meaning of [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 36:10</i> “With You is the source of life, [in Your light is seen light.” That is,] from Your essential light there is seen a [secondary] “offspring” light, which is the aspect of the line-<i>Kav</i>, as will be explained with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
Now, the entire purpose of man is the deep contemplation of this matter, and the like.
It is specifically through this, that he will come to the true unity of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, binding his soul to the Supernal Life of all lives, which is the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, literally, for the above-mentioned reason. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 14

We must now understand the aspect of the Line and Thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>), that is drawn from the aspect of the aforementioned <i>Reshimu</i>, in a manner of particulars.
Firstly, we must understand the general matter of [the <i>Kav-</i>Line]; that it is the literal opposite of the aspect of the aforementioned <i>Reshimu-</i>Impression.
This is because a point indicates the concealment and withdrawal of everything, so that only a single point remains.
Moreover, this point or impression specifically indicates the aspect of the absence of spreading forth below.
In other words, the matter [of a point] is the absence of extension and revelation to a length and width.
This is like the form of the letter <i>Yod</i> (י) which has no inner space, as known.
Now, regarding the matter of the <i>Tzimtzum</i> of [the <i>Reshimu</i>] from above, in other words, that [everything] remains in the aspect of a point alone, it is possible that its opposite can come from this.
This is because, the result of the [<i>Tzimtzim</i>] is that everything becomes included in the [<i>Reshimu</i>] in a brief and “hinted” manner, and the like.
On the contrary, this is the main cause of all revelation of influence [from the <i>Reshimu</i>], as mentioned previously.
However, at first glance, the fact that this point indicates a complete absence of spreading forth below, certainly could be considered to be a complete and true <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
[That is,] it completely hides and conceals, making it impossible for light to come and [be revealed] below.
This being the case, how is it possible that the opposite [of this point], which is the drawing down and spreading forth of the <i>Kav</i> – line, can be drawn from it?
Rather, as known, the [explanation of the] matter is that, in truth, a point and a line are not two opposites, for a line is drawn from a point, and by the joining of many points, a line is made.
Rather, the [explanation of the] matter, as known, is that a point is like a <i>Heyulie</i> relative to a line (<i>Kav</i>).
It [therefore] is similar to every [type] of <i>Heyulie</i> or simple substance.
[This is to say that] though [a Heyulie] is specifically in a state of the absence of spreading forth, nonetheless, this is not at all by necessity, but only because of what a <i>Heyulie</i> essentially is, in that as of yet, it is higher than the aspect of spreading forth.
It thus has not [yet] descended from its essential state.
[For example,] this is like the <i>Heyulie</i> of the life-force of an animal to enliven [the body] in a revealed fashion, as it still is included in its essential self, in that it has yet to spread forth to enliven [the body].
Similarly, it is like the <i>Heyulie</i>-ability of movement as it is in the essential self, before it spreads forth to move.
And is likewise like the power of growth before it spreads forth to cause growth
And like the power of intellect before it spreads forth to conceptualize, and there are many other similar examples.
It therefore is understood that, in and of itself, this absence of spreading forth cannot be called a true <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
On the contrary, it is the essential <i>Heyulie</i> power, from which everything is revealed and spreads forth.
In a similar manner we may understand the aspect of a point relative to a line.
[That is], its lack of spreading forth is only because, as of yet, it is an essential aspect, and is above the aspect of “spreading forth.”
Now, although [the <i>Reshimu</i>] comes about through the <i>Tzimtzum</i> of everything, so that nothing remains except for a single point, as mentioned above, however, this itself indicates that the entire aspect of the Essential Self is included in it.
Since this is the case, it therefore does not spread forth downward.
This is analogous to a <i>Talmid</i> (student) in the presence of his <i>Rebbe</i>.
As long as he is preoccupied with absorbing [the teachings] and is [focused], similar to a point, with a concentration (<i>Tzimtzum</i>) of his whole essence, he cannot “give out” by influencing his fellow [with explanations of the teachings].
However, after he has received [the teachings], the opposite [is true].
For it is from this very <i>Tzimtzum,</i> in that he was [focused] like a point, that all the influence spreads forth and is drawn out to his fellow, as explained elsewhere.
From all this we understand that the line which extends from the point, is just like the aspect of spreading forth from an essential <i>Heyulie</i>.
However, [in regard to] the fact that it is drawn out in an aspect of a “short line,” it is explained elsewhere that just as a point is the aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> relative to a line, likewise, a line is the aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> relative to the aspects of the length and breadth of a plane.
For as known, although the line-<i>Kav</i> comes in an aspect of being drawn down and spreading from above to below, nonetheless, it is not [yet] a specific manner of drawing down [or revelation] at all.
Rather, it only is that the light has been drawn from above to below.
It is through this that the aspects of “above” and “below,” from influencer to recipient, comes about.
This is not the case in regard to the <i>Heyulie</i> of a point, in which there is no up or down, beginning, middle, or end, as known.
(This is the [meaning] of the statement in <i>Etz Chayim,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Cha<i>yim</i>, Drush Igullim V’Yosher, Shaar 1, Anaf 2</i> that the whole essential [purpose of the] radiance of the line-<i>Kav</i> is solely to bring about the aspects of “up” and “down,” as will be explained.)
This [<i>Kav</i>] is analogous to a “Builder’s Rod,” which is not [counted] into the measurements of the length and width of the area of the building itself.
Nonetheless, with [the builder’s rod, the builder] measures all the measurements of the length and width [of the building].
[However, the builder’s rod] itself is only like a short line which includes all possible measurements of length and width.
Thus, the form of the <i>Kav</i>-Line is an aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> relative to the plane of the letters and gives them their length and width, such as the lines of the letter <i>Beit</i>-ב, as stated elsewhere.
According to this, even the beginning of the extension of the line from the point, although it comes in an aspect of spreading forth and drawing down, nonetheless, it still is in an aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i>, in that it includes many ways that length and width may be drawn out within measure.
This is why it is called the <i>Kav HaMidah –</i> The Measuring Line, as is known.
This is indicated by its form, which in essence is short, and merely issues from above to below.
Nonetheless, included within this issuance is everything that was concealed in the <i>Heyulie</i> of the point, except that it [now] comes in a way of being drawn down.
This [ability] comes from the power of the essential light that is concealed in the Essential Self of the Influencer, before being concentrated (<i>Tzimtzum</i>) into a single point.
However, now it comes [into revelation] solely by way of a line, and not as it [originally] was in the Essence of the Influencer, where it was with the great expanse of His actual Essential Self.
In this <i>Kav-</i>line, the light of the Essential Self only comes according to the capacity of the recipients.
However, it nonetheless possesses a likeness to the light of the Essential Self that is concealed in the point, except that it [now] comes [into revelation] in a manner of being drawn down.
It therefore comes in the form of a <i>Kav</i>-line.
This [<i>Kav-</i>line] is the aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> for all the light and influence [given] to the recipients. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 15

Now, the analogue of all of the above may be understood regarding the aspect of the impression-<i>Reshimu</i> which remained in the aforementioned “void” and “empty space.”
(This is the <i>Yod-</i>י of <i>Sa”G-</i>ס״ג (יו״ד ה״י וא״ו ה״י) of the Upper Purity, as stated in the book <i>Emek HaMelech</i>.)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Emek HaMelech</i> – Shaar “<i>Yod</i> of the name of <i>Sa”G-</i>ס״ג.”</i>
This is the aspect of the <i>Heyulie</i>, which includes everything that will [afterwards] branch out from it [into revelation] by means of the <i>Kav V’Chut</i> – Line and Thread.
Now, although all the Light of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, was concealed until only the aspect of an impression remained, nonetheless, as mentioned above, specifically through this <i>Tzimtzum</i>, everything is certainly included in it in short form.
Furthermore, although [the point of the <i>Reshimu</i>] indicates the absence of spreading down, [nonetheless] this is not an aspect of total <i>Tzimtzum.</i>
It is only because it is an [essential] <i>Heyulie</i> power [that it does not spread down], as explained above.
Rather, since it is a power that restrains the entire original light, therefore it does not spread forth except by way of a line, according to the manner [necessary] for influence, as mention before.
Nevertheless, from the above it is understood that this line-<i>Kav</i> possesses the power of the original [Limitless] Light that preceded the <i>Tzimtzum.</i>
[Furthermore, this light] is [still] literally in an aspect of Limitlessness, except that it comes by way of a line, according to the manner [in which] the recipients [are capable of receiving].
Through this we may understand the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 186:2, “With You is the source of life, in Your light is seen light.”</i> “In Your light is light seen.”
[This is a secondary light,] a radiance of a radiance, which is called an “offspring light.”
For, [although] after the <i>Tzimtzum</i> the light breaks through by way of a mere line, it nevertheless comes from “Your” essential light, since everything is included within the <i>Reshimu</i>, and it is from [the <i>Reshimu</i>] that the <i>Kav</i>-Line is drawn.
[The <i>Kav-</i>line] is an aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> for all the influence [of the chaining down of the worlds], and [it] brings about the dimensions of “up” and “down,” as stated in <i>Etz Chayim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Drush Igullim V’Yosher, Shaar 1, Anaf 2.</i>
For this reason, we may [now] understand the answer to two [seemingly paradoxical] opposites that are found in this <i>Kav-</i>Line.
The first [aspect of the <i>Kav-</i>line] is that it has the power to “include the left in the right etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar<i>,</i> beginning of Parshat Korach.</i>
This is the aspect of the inter-inclusions and unifications of all the lights which branch out, from <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut.</i>
It is specifically through [the <i>Kav-</i>line] that [it is possible for] a light to be exchanged into a vessel which is not its own, such as the light of <i>Chessed</i>-Kindness [being invested in] the vessel of <i>Gevurah</i>-Sternness.
This is in accordance to what is explained elsewhere at length in regard to the matter of the letter <i>Vav</i> (ו) of the word “The Awesome One-<i>VeHanora</i>-<b>ו</b>הנורא.”
The second [aspect of the <i>Kav</i>] is that it is specifically called the “Measuring Line,” in that it gives measure to all lights and vessels.
This is as we previously explained regarding the matter of the <i>Kav-</i>line, that it is called the “Builders Rod.”
[Now], at first glance, this seems to be the opposite of inter-inclusion [and unification] etc.
However, [the explanation of] the matter is that both [these aspects of the <i>Kav-</i>line] are true.
Quite the contrary, the [two] are interdependent.
This is because the <b>root</b> of this <i>Kav</i> comes from the original power of the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which preceded the <i>Tzimzum</i>.
This is as explained above regarding the matter that “In Your light,” specifically, “light is seen,” [referring to the light] of this <i>Kav-</i>line.
Certainly, <b>it is within the power</b> of the essential light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, to make inter-inclusions and unifications of all opposites throughout the entire chaining down [of the worlds], from the “top” of <i>Adam Kadmon,</i> until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
This is in accordance with the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar, 17a.</i> “You are He who unifies them and binds them… You are He, inside and out.”
This is also the [explanation of the] matter of “the name of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 (יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א) within, which is the path of the entire Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>,” and there are other such statements.
All this [inter-inclusion and unification] is [possible] because of the radiance of the limitless light of The Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which is within this <i>Kav</i> and goes and extends down until <i>Malchut,</i> the end of all the levels [of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>].
It is for this very same reason that it is within the power [of the <i>Kav</i>] to measure every measurement and limitation. [That is, it measures] all lights and vessels, and all unifications of “influencer and recipient,” [determining exactly] how much the “masculine waters” and “feminine waters” will be.
This [aspect of measurement comes] from the aspect of the <i>Reshimu-</i>impression, which limits all the light of the Essential Self in various manners, according to His estimation within the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
We find that from the angle of the Light of the Essential Self in the <i>Kav</i>-Line, it is considered to be an aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> [the function of which is] to inter-include and unify everything, [whereas] from the angle of the limiting power of the <i>Reshimu</i> in it, it limits and gives measure to everything, according to the aspect of the first assessment [and estimation] which was included in this <i>Reshimu</i>.
By way of analogy, this is similar to an architect who drafts a blueprint, which defines the manner in which the [building will be] built, so that everything should be precisely according to how he decided within himself of how the measurements [should be].
[This is done] so that he should neither stray to the left nor to the right [from his original plan].
Now, although at times it is possible for there to be additional radiance in the emanated [<i>sefirot</i>], more so than the dictates of the “measuring line” (<i>Kav HaMidah</i>), this specifically comes about from the power of the Light of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
At times it will radiate in one way, and at times it will radiate in another way.
For this reason, any aspect of <b>new</b> light [found] within <i>ABY”A</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> comes specifically from the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which precedes the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
This is because it is from His essential light, that light is seen within this <i>Kav-</i>line.
At times there is additional [radiance] and at times there is diminished [radiance].
This also [accounts] for the changes [that take place] in the unifications of all the <i>Partzufim</i> (Statures), from [the top of] <i>Adam Kadmon</i> to the “heel” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, at the end of [the world of] <i>Asiyah.</i>
An example is the change between the time of the Holy Temple to the time of the exile, and the like.
Moreover, we generally [pray and] say, “May it be desirable before You.”
[This to say,] literally before Your Essential Self, which is even higher than the ten essential <i>sefirot</i>.
[We request that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He] should change “The simple essential desire” that has already been drawn forth within the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One.
[That is, we request that it should be drawn forth] and come into the estimation which He estimated within Himself [for the entire chaining down of the worlds] until the end of the <i>Kav-</i>line, in an entirely different way, such as from Judgment (<i>Din</i>) to Kindness (<i>Chessed</i>), and the like.
This is as previously explained (at the end of chapter nine) regarding the matter of “I <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה have not changed.”
[That is,] in the original light that precedes the <i>Tzimtzum</i> there is no change between a desire for kindness or [a desire for] judgment.
[This is] because of the reason mentioned above (in chapter ten), regarding the matter of the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, which is completely included in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
[It was previously explained] that there are three levels until it comes to a particular matter, (as explained at length in chapter eleven).
When the Sages stated, “[Pray] to Him and not to His qualities” this even refers to His <b>essential</b> qualities, which are [one] with the light of His Essential Self.
This is because the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, “is not of any of these qualities altogether.” This will suffice for those of understanding.
This then, is the meaning of, “You are He who unifies them etc.” It specifically states, “You [are He],” referring to “He” who “is One, but not in [a way of] enumeration”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a.</i> of ten <i>sefirot.</i>
Similarly, the power of the <i>Reshimu</i> and the <i>Kav</i> to limit and measure, (which is why it is called “The Measuring Line” (<i>Kav HaMidah</i>)), comes specifically from the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
Moreover, [these two powers] are interdependent.
(This is in accordance with what is stated elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Teshuva 87a.</i> regarding the general matter of <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) and <i>Gevurah</i> (Might) within the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
[It explains there] that [the <i>Gevurah</i> of His Essential Self] is the power of limitation, to limit and conceal, [thus withdrawing into] Himself [in a way of] elevation after elevation, endlessly and without measurement.
This is the meaning of the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Chadash, Yitro 34c. See also Tikkunei Zohar, 40b. See also Torat Chayim, Noach 69b, and footnote 11 there. The entire statement is, “The light of the Unlimited One is above without end, and below without conclusion.”</i> “The light of the Unlimited One is above without end.” [In contrast, <i>Chessed</i> of His Essential Self] is the aspect of the spreading down of the light, “down below without conclusion,” by means of the <i>Kav</i> which extends from the <i>Reshimu</i>.
These are two equally balanced lines, and [are both] completely in a state of being unlimited.
Therefore, even in the lowering of the Light of the Unlimited One within this line-<i>Kav</i>, these two powers, these being the power to restrain and limit and the power to bind and unify, are equal.
Likewise, regarding the matter of changes in the light and its expression, whether [it will be] with additional or diminished [revelation], such as [the difference] between the weekdays and Shabbat and Holidays, or the [difference between the] time of the Holy Temple and the time of exile, it all comes from one power. [This one power] divides into the two lines of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>, which are equally balanced.
This comes from the power of the original light, that is, the Light of the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, from the aspects of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah,</i> as He is, in and of Himself. This will suffice for those of understanding.)
This is in accordance with what was explained above (in chapter fourteen), that a line is a <i>Heyulie</i> relative to a plane.
[This is to say,] it includes the essential power and light of the Essence of the Influencer, except that in the Essential Self it is [revealed] with great expanse, whereas in this line, the very same power comes [revealed] in an aspect of restricted influence and expression [according to the capacities] of the recipients.
This being the case, even the aspect of the restraint and expression of [the <i>Kav-</i>line], comes specifically from the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 16

We now must understand the specifics of the matter of this Line and Thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>), [and] how it has [both] the aspects of encompassing [lights] and inner [lights].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Encompassing lights are called <i>Makifim</i>, and inner lights are called <i>Pnimim</i>.</i>
This is as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Drush Igullim V’Yosher, Shaar 1, Anaf 2.</i> “It circles and returns and re-encircles,” (as explained elsewhere at length).
[It is] this aspect of the first encompassing circle that is called “the Lower Purity.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tihiroo Tata’a –</i> The Lower Purity</i> This is the aspect of the general encompassing [light], which encompasses the four worlds of <i>ABY”A</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> equally, as stated in [the beginning of] <i>Etz Chayim</i>.
However, let us first preface with [an explanation] of the general matter of the Line (<i>Kav</i>), [to understand] how it is the aspect of a general <i>Heyulie</i> for all the many particular influences that “branch out” from it, until the end of the [world of] <i>Asiyah</i>, as mentioned previously.
This may be understood by way of the well-known analogy regarding the matter of a general thought.
With this general thought, “He gazes and sees to the end of all generations…with one glance.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Rosh HaShanah 18a</i> (As Maimonides<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodot HaTorah 8:9-10; Also see Tanya, Ch. 42 and 48.</i> expresses it, this is the [meaning of his] statement, “With the knowledge of Himself, He knows all creatures,” as explained elsewhere at length.)
As known, the explanation of these things is that there are two types of desire.
The first is the simple [essential] desire of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which is literally included in His Essential Being. This cannot yet be called a “general thought or desire,” since it still is totally one with His Essential Self, literally.
For example, even if this desire has already been determined within Himself, [that is,] how to do a particular act of kindness, or how to speak or think it, or how to conceptualize a particular concept, or how to have desire or pleasure in a particular thing.
Nonetheless even though this [essential] determined desire is connected to the extension of the desire for a particular matter, however, it [itself] remains included in His hidden essence.
It, therefore, does not yet have aspects of “general” and “particular.”
It is only afterwards, when the desire which He determined [within Himself] arises to come [out] into actuality, that it becomes revealed out of its hiddenness.
[Only] then does this desire come to an aspect of “general” and “particular.” In other words, [now it may be defined as a] general thought that includes the entire [concept of] the act, from beginning to end, in one glance.
Afterwards, it divides into particular desires, each of which possess intellect and emotions etc.
[Each of these desires] come in succession to one another in a chaining down, in which the upper [desire] encompasses the lower [desire], “like a circle within a circle.”
This [type of desire] is called a “composite” desire, for it [is made up of] a general [desire] and particular [desires].
This may be understood through the well-known analogy of a person who wants to build a large building, according to his predetermined desire that it should specifically be [built] in a special manner.
Now, even though this predetermined desire comes in a way of a measured, specific pleasure, that it should [specifically] be thus, and it obviously [follows that] the intellect and emotions [of this desire] come with [certain defined] proportions and measurements, nevertheless, all this is the estimation and predetermination as it still [exists] within himself. [As of yet] it is [totally] included within himself and is as if it is nonexistent.
Only with the passage of time, when this thought comes to be acted upon, do the actual divisions of all these predetermined particulars and various specifications become recognized.
However, at first, this desire comes in a general manner, that is, that he should have a building with a particular form.
Afterwards, it divides into particular desires for each particular detail.
It [thus] descends with order and levels, [beginning with the first general [desire] that includes everything in one glance, to a particular of this desire. [Now, the particular desire] is [also] called a general [desire] relative to the [particular] desires that branch out from it.
[This process continues] until the very final desire and concept, which is the final action, at the conclusion of everything. This will suffice for those of understanding.
The analogue of all this, may be understood [in regard to how it is] above in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Godliness, in regard to the difference between the aspects of the Upper Purity and the Lower Purity that follows the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
That which He estimated within Himself in potential within the Upper Purity, is similar to the aforementioned determination as it is within the simple desire of the self.
As of yet, it has not come to an aspect of spreading forth from the Self altogether.
Moreover, even though this essential determined desire connects to the extended desire that follows it, nonetheless, it remains included in a hidden manner in the Essential Self of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
It is therefore above [and beyond] the aspect of a general [desire], to be considered as “[a general desire] that foresees and gazes [at everything] in a single glance.”
However, the second desire that follows the aforementioned <i>Tzimtzum</i>, is when the simple determined desire of His Essential Self comes to the aspect of spreading forth.
This is the aspect of the <i>Heyulie</i> Line and Thread (<i>Kav V’Chut</i>), which includes every particular issuance from the beginning [of the chaining down] to its end, as previously mentioned.
The first encompassing [light of this <i>Kav</i>-line] is called “the Lower Purity.” This is analogous to the general desire for a large building. [This general desire] includes all its particulars from beginning to end, at once.
Afterwards it divides with order and levels [descending] from the general to the particular, as in the aforementioned analogy.
In other words, as it arose in His simple <i>Heyulie</i> desire, to specifically come out into revelation, it included all the particular desires.
This is the desire that includes [and encompasses] them all, and is called, “The Primal Desire” (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>) [relative] to everything that follows it.
Afterwards, this desire comes by way of particulars, such as the desire to emanate (<i>Atzilut</i>), within which is included [the desire for the] ten <i>sefirot</i> [of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>] in all their particulars.
However, all this is still concealed, until it comes into an aspect of revelation, when the light is emanated in an aspect of [actual] emanation (<i>Atzilut</i>).
Following this is the desire to create (<i>Briyah</i>) something from nothing etc. This [desire] includes [the ten <i>sefirot</i> of] intellect and emotions etc.
[This descent of desires continues] until the final desire, which is, “Everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה desired, He did” [and brought out into actuality]. [This is] the final conclusion of everything.
Now, all these particulars were included in the Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>), which comes in an aspect of influence <b>after</b> the [original] <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
This then, is the aspect of the beginning of the Line (<i>Kav</i>). That is, it is the first “circle” that follows the drawing down of the beginning of the aforementioned <i>Heyulie</i> Line (<i>The Kav HaMidah</i>).
[This first “circle”] is called the general encompassing [light] of the four worlds of <i>ABY”A,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i> and encompasses them [all] equally.
It is [also] called the “general thought” that foresees and “gazes” upon [all of Creation], from beginning to end, in a single glance.
This then, is the explanation of the general matter of the whole of this Line-<i>Kav</i>.
All the particular ways that it, “circles and returns and re-encircles…” may be understood according to the aforementioned analogy, as will be explained in the following chapter, with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 17

We must now understand the particulars of the matter of the <i>Kav-</i>Line, as it is in an aspect of “<i>Igullim-</i>Circles” [and “<i>Yosher-</i>Upright”] etc.
However, we must preface with [an explanation] of the aspect of the beginning of this <i>Kav-</i>Line, which comes in an aspect of an inner light (<i>Ohr Pnimi</i>), and then encircles and [once again] is drawn down as an inner light. Then it once again encircles etc.
It is explained in <i>Etz Chayim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (Drush Igullim V’Yosher), Shaar 1, Anaf 2-3.</i> that in the aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Igullim</i> – The circles of desire, the uppermost is the most superior, while the innermost is the [most] inferior, whereas in the aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Yosher –</i> The upright <i>sefirot</i>, the opposite is true. [This is to say that] the uppermost is the [most] inferior, while the innermost is the [most] superior.
Now, the explanation of these matters is as follows: It is known that although in relation to the aspect of the simple determined desire of the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, the aspect of this Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>) is called a spreading forth of the desire. However, it too is still concealed, and not at all revealed.
This is because [the <i>Ratzon HaKadoom-</i>the Primal Desire] is only the influence and expression of the Simple Desire for kindness, which has already been determined in the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, that it should come into actuality in a particular way.
Immediately, when it arises in thought how everything should be, it is called the “Primal Thought and Desire” (<i>Machshava V’Ratzon Kadoom</i>). [This thought] includes within itself every particular desire [of the entire chaining down of the worlds], as explained previously in the analogy of a building.
If this is the case, this entire Primal Desire is still within Himself, without being revealed outside [of Himself]. Nonetheless, afterwards, everything is actualized from this [Primal Desire].
This then, is the meaning of [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:9</i> “For He said,” within the Primal Thought, “and it was.”
This [Primal Thought] is called “The life of all the worlds,” from the “head” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> to the “heel” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [which is] at the end of the world of <i>Asiyah</i> (Actualization). This is the meaning of [the statement], “All of creation is not concealed from You.”
[This means that] there is [not a single particular detail], even the most final of details, that did not originally exist within this [Primal] Desire and Thought.
On the contrary, [as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Lecha Dodee</i> prayer of Friday night.</i> “The end action arose first in thought”]. [This is to say that] “The end action,” such as the end of the seventh millennium, “arose” within this Primal Thought “first,” as explained elsewhere at length.
(In the terminology of the <i>Zohar</i> this [Primal Thought] is called “<i>Ateeka D’Ateekin</i>-The Ancient of the Ancients”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 165b; Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 128a-b, and elsewhere.</i> or<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 129a, 132a, and elsewhere.</i> “<i>Ateeka Stima’ah</i>-The Concealed Ancient One.” This is the aspect of, “The Supernal Desire of all Desires, which is revealed in the forehead of the Holy Ancient One (<i>Atika Kadisha</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 129a, 136b - “<i>Rayva D’Kol Rayvin Ila’een, D’Itgalyn B’Metzcha D’Atika Kadisha.</i>”</i>
This is because pleasure is invested within desire, so that they are literally as one.
Likewise, the simple [essential] <i>heyulie</i> desire of the <i>heyulie</i> desire for kindness (which was mentioned previously in chapters 10 and 11), included the simple pleasure of the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. This is called, “the delight of the King in Himself (<i>Sha’ashoo’aiy HaMelech B’Atzmooto</i>).”
This is also [the case] in regard to the three levels of [<i>Yachid, Echad</i> and <i>Kadmon</i>], until [the Essential desire] came to the particular matter of “<i>Ana Emloch-</i>I shall rule,” which is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> (Kingdom) of The Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), that preceded the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, as explained there.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">That is, as explained in chapters 10 and 11.</i>
All [these levels] are the aspect of “The delight of the King in Himself, within the Upper Purity.
However, “<i>Ateeka D’Ateekin</i> – The Ancient of the Ancients,” which is the source of all pleasures, and [is also known as] “The Supernal Desire of all Desires,” refers to the aspect of the Line-<i>Kav</i> that follows the <i>Tzimtzum</i>. It includes [all] the various desires and pleasures that are destined to be revealed.
“<i>Atika Stima’ah</i>-The Concealed Ancient One” is the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [and] is the concealed desire and pleasure, as it still relates to Himself, except that [now, after the <i>Tzimtzum,</i>] He thinks to bring this [desire] into actual revelation.
[For example,] this is like [the desire] that there should be a revelation of the desire and pleasure to emanate the ten <i>sefirot</i> [of the world of <i>Atzilut-</i>Emanation], (It is for this reason that “<i>Atika Stima’ah</i> – The Concealed Ancient One” is considered to be an aspect of “concealment which is at least subject to revelation.” This is not the case with the beginning of the <i>Kav,</i> which is called “The Concealment of all Concealments – <i>Steema D’Kol Steemeen</i>,” for even the thought of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> cannot grasp Him.) or that there should be the desire and pleasure to create [the world of <i>Briyah</i>] etc.
[The aspect of] “<i>Atika Kadisha-</i>The Holy Ancient One” is the pleasure that [becomes invested] within <i>Chochmah</i> (Insight).
This is the aspect of <i>Atik Yomin</i> (“The Ancient of Days”) and <i>Arich Anpin</i> (“The Long Face”) [which are the <i>Keter</i> (pleasure and desire)] of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> (Emanation). [This is when] the pleasure and desire become revealed, all of which will be explained in a manner of specifics.)
Now, the [explanation of the] aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Igullim</i>-Circles of desire, one within the other, is as known, that every cause encompasses its effect, “like a circle within a circle,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:16, 10:10</i> and that the effect can never grasp its cause, except in a way of distance from it.
This may be understood from a desire that becomes completely revealed.
Although this [revealed desire] includes ten [<i>sefirot</i> within itself, such as] intellect and emotions etc., nonetheless, it initially comes about as a single decision, without any apparent divisions [into ten <i>sefirot</i>].
This is called, “The General Circle of Desire” which encompasses [and] contains all [the particulars that will become revealed], within it. [Every subsequent “circle of desire”] comes about specifically from its power. However, [it encompasses these “circles of desire”] from a distance.
An example is the reasoning and intellect for this desire, which is called its effect.
It is impossible for it to be close [in a way of] comparison, to its cause, which is the desire, because, as known, “desire is altogether beyond reason,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Shnei Luchot HaBrit, Beit HaShem 4b, (See footnote in the name of Rabbi Yosef Al Kastilia); Yonat Elem (of Rabbi Menachem Azaria de Fano) Ch. 2; Also see Torat Chayim 63a, note 7.</i> [and, therefore] it can never be comprehended [through reasoning].
Nevertheless, it is from the power of desire that the “circle” of <i>Chochmah-</i>Insight comes about, though it too has no recognizable divisions into ten [<i>sefirot</i>].
This is similar to the analogy of [a judge] who, [because he] has been bribed, will find a rationalization for the desire.
Although this [desire for] reasoning also includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>], that is, desire, intellect, and emotions, nonetheless, it is comes about in a general fashion etc.
Likewise, the “circle” of <i>Binah</i>-Comprehension, which comes about from the power [of the “circle” of <i>Chochmah</i>], can never grasp [<b>its</b> cause]. In this manner, the [“circles of the desire” for the] emotions [are also drawn forth,] one within the other. [This continues] until the [“circle of the desire” for the] end action, which is the final circle [of desire].
All this is included in the desire for Himself, until the end action which is the innermost [circle of desire] etc.
Likewise, this is how it is in the aforementioned concealed desire, which is called the Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>), the source of all the desires [for the entire chaining down of the worlds].
It includes ten <i>sefirot</i>, one circle [of desire] within the other circle [of desire], until the circle [of the desire] for the end action. This is the desire for the end action, since “everything that He desires, He does” in actuality.
The aforementioned Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>) is the uppermost circle [of desire], that includes [and encompasses] everything [that is desired in the entire chaining down of the worlds.]
[Now, all this is in the aspect of desire], however, when this desire in Himself comes to be <b>actualized</b>, it is the other way around.
[This is to say that] the desire becomes concealed and invested in the intellect, and the intellect encompasses it.
Then the intellect becomes concealed and invested in the emotions, one within the other, until the end action, which is the uppermost.
In other words, invested within the actual power of the action are the thoughts. Invested within the thoughts are the emotions. Invested within the emotions are <i>Chochmah</i>-Insight and <i>Binah-</i>Comprehension, and invested within <i>Chochmah</i> is the desire (<i>Arich</i>) and pleasure (<i>Atik</i>).
[Here] we find that the innermost of them all is the desire and pleasure, while the most external of them all is the action [which is the most] inferior one.
This is the aspect of <i>Yosher-</i>Upright, which comes in an aspect of the upper being invested in the lower.
However, in the aspect of the aforementioned Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon Kadoom</i>), since it is still within Himself, it therefore is drawn forth in an aspect of <i>Igullim-</i>Circles, in which the uppermost is this concealed all-encompassing desire.
The first circle [in the scheme of <i>Igullim</i> – Circles] is the desire and pleasure for the whole chaining down [of the worlds], which is within it. This circle is the general encompassing [light] of the [four worlds of] <i>ABY”A</i>, as mentioned previously.
The beginning of the <i>Kav-</i>Line is the aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> drawing down [of influence], like a short line that diminishes (by way of <i>Tzimtzum</i>) from cause to affect, such as from <i>Ratzon-</i>Desire to <i>Chochmah</i>-Insight, and the like.
Likewise, from the aspect of the aforementioned <i>Reshimu-</i>Impression, a <i>Kav</i>-Line is drawn with very great diminishment.
For, although the <i>Reshimu-</i>Impression comes about in [a way of] limitation [of the Unlimited Light], as explained previously, nonetheless, it is still from the aspect of the World of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), except that it is the last aspect [of the Unlimited], which comes about with brevity.
This is not the case with the Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>) which comes into the category of [expressing] influence <b>outside</b> of the World of the Unlimited.
However, [because] it [still] is an all-encompassing <i>Heyulie</i> [for the entire chaining down of the worlds], therefore it is drawn out by way of a short line. This will suffice for those of understanding.
(This is [in accordance with] the statement in <i>Etz Chayim</i>; that the essential purpose of the radiance of the <i>Kav</i>-Line, is solely to bring about the aspects of “above” and “below” such as the ten <i>Igullim-</i>Circles, [which follow in progression from higher and lower] until the end action.
In contrast, in the World of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), even the aspects of “above” or “below” do not exist. Rather, there is only His absolutely simple singularity, as previously explained.
Furthermore, even though [in potential] He estimated within Himself that which is destined to be, it all is actually still within Himself and is literally in an aspect of being limitless (<i>Ein Sof</i>).
Because of this it states in <i>Etz Chayim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, (Drush Igullim V’Yosher) Shaar 1, Anaf 5, and the end of Anaf 2, and Shaar 42 (Shaar Drushei ABY”A) Ch. 1.</i> that it is forbidden to speak even in regard to the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Malchut D’Ein Sof</i>).
Rather, we are permitted to speak only in regard to the aspect of the <i>Kav-</i>Line and the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> (Primordial Man). [Since] this is the aspect of the first source of the entire chaining down [of the worlds], it may, therefore, be comprehended in [relation to] the many descents [that take place] until [the comprehension of how] the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> become [invested] within <i>BY”A.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.</i>
This is because they [the <i>Kav</i> and particularly <i>Adam Kadmon</i>] are called by the name, “the Cause of all causes” (<i>Eelot Kol HaEelot</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 22b; Pardes Rimonim, Shaar 3, Chapter 1.</i> and<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 19 (42a).</i> “the Primordial of all the Primordials” (<i>Kadmon L’Kol HaKedoomin</i>).
However, [in regard to] the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One (<i>Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof</i>) [it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar, 17a.</i>] “No thought can grasp Him,” [which includes] even the aforementioned Primal Thought (<i>Machshava HaKedooma</i>).
This is because the World of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is qualitatively beyond and is called “Totally Holy” [and transcendent], as a result of the aforementioned <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
[In contrast], the aforementioned aspect of the Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon Kadoom</i>) is called “His Great Name.” “His Name-<i>Shmo</i>-שמו-346” is the same numerical value as “Desire-<i>Ratzon</i>-רצון-346.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Pri Etz Chayim (Shaar Kriyat Shma), Shaar 8, and end of chapter 28.</i> This is the [explanation] of the matter of [the words of the <i>Kaddish</i> prayer,] “May His Great Name be blessed etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned previously, the word “Blessed-<i>Baruch-</i>ברוך” also means to “draw down.”</i>)
(Furthermore, as known, the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is called “<i>Adam D’Briyah</i>-Man of Creation,” as will be explained [in the following chapter].
This is in contradistinction to the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, [about Whom] it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel I 15:29</i> “For He is not a man.”
As known, this is also [in accordance] with the intentions of the prayer, “<i>Nishmat Kol Chai</i> – The Soul of all living beings,” which is the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>. This will suffice for those of understanding.)

Chapter 18

Now, [regarding] the aspect of the Primal Desire to Himself, of everything that will be in the [whole] chaining down [of the worlds] (<i>Hishtalshelut</i>), it includes ten [<i>sefirot,</i> or “circles”] until the “end action” that arose in this Primal Desire, which is the last aspect within it.
Now, the <i>Keter</i> of the lower [world] comes about from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the upper [world].
This is the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> (Primordial Man). Moreover, as known, in [regard to] the general manner [of the chaining down of the worlds], the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> (Primordial Man) is called “<i>Adam D’Briyah</i>-Man of Creation,” which is the aspect of Thought (<i>Machshavah</i>).
<i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> (Emanation) are called “<i>Adam D’Yetzirah-</i>Man of Formation.” <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> [of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>] are called “<i>Adam D’Asiyah</i>-Man of Action.”
Just as the [particular] world of <i>Briyah-</i>Creation is, literally, a creation of “something from nothing,” as known, so too, the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is considered to be a creation of something from nothing. [This is to say that it is created] from the <b>true</b> “<i>Ein-</i>Nothing” of the Light of the Unlimited One Himself, which is in the aforementioned <i>Kav-</i>Line, which is called the Primal Desire to Himself (<i>Ratzon Kadoom L’Atzmo</i>).
Now, as known, the explanation for this is [as follows]: It was explained above that the aforementioned Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon Kadoom</i>) is called “the source of all desires.”
It is the aspect of the <i>Heyulie</i> desire, which is the source from which all “desires for desires” find [their existence].
This can be understood by way of analogy from the aspect of the <i>Yechidah</i> of the human soul. The essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, which is included in it in an aspect of a <i>Heyulie,</i> includes every particular desire for kindness that he is destined to desire.
When [this <i>Heulie</i> desire for kindness] comes to be drawn forth in a particular manner for a specific matter, it comes out of the aspect of the essence [of his soul] so that he will have an essential and concealed desire, which is the aspect of the aforementioned Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon Kadoom</i>).
However, [this Primal Desire] has not yet become invested within that thing [which he desires at all], but is rather still [completely] to himself, as mentioned previously.
However, when [the Primal Desire] becomes invested [within] and affects a “desire for a desire” for this particular matter, such as becoming invested within the intellect and thought, to cause a “desire for a desire” for this particular thing, the existence of this desire for this thing within the intellect and thought is like an entirely new creation from its source.
This is because the aforementioned aspect of the Primal Desire is the source for the creation of this “desire for the desire” of the intellect, and this “desire for the desire” is called a [new] creation.
For, we observe that it is not at all times that a person has a desire for a specific desire, such as the desire for business or for study.
It is [therefore] necessary [to state] that there is a source that creates this specific desire.
[This source] is called “the desire for this [specific] desire.” It automatically [follows] and is understood, that since the desire for this [specific] desire is not drawn forth at all times, and furthermore, at times it will radiate with great strength and light, while at other times it will radiate in a diminished and weak [fashion], therefore, it must be said that even the source which makes and brings about this [specific] desire, which is called the “<b>desire</b> for the desire,” also comes about in an aspect of “something” coming into being from “nothing.”
This is comparable to a bribe, which brings about a constant “desire for a desire” to merit [the briber].
This is because the bribe touches the essence of his soul. Because of this, it is constantly drawn out, bringing into being a “desire for a desire” of kindness and merit [towards the briber].
The opposite [is true] in regard to his enemy. A constant “desire for a desire” of judgment will be brought about [towards him], and the like. This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, as known, every revealed desire includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>]. This being the case, this “desire for the desire” also includes ten [<i>sefirot</i> within it].
Moreover, [being that] there are ten powers, it automatically follows that there are ten types of “desire for desire,” all of which come into being in an aspect of “something” from “nothing.”
All this is an example, in order to understand the aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> (Primordial Man), which is entirely just the matter of “a desire for a desire.”
This is because they are the aspect of the concealment of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> (Emanation) [whereas the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>] are revealed [desires], as known.
For example, <i>Keter</i> (desire) of <i>Chochmah</i> (insight) of <i>Atzilut</i> is the desire for intellect.
Its source is in <i>Keter</i> (desire) of <i>Chochmah</i> (wisdom) of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, which is called “the [hidden] desire for this [revealed] desire.”
Likewise, [the revealed] <i>Keter</i> (desire) of <i>Chessed</i> (kindness) of <i>Atzilut</i> comes from [the concealed] <i>Keter</i> (desire) of <i>Chessed</i> (kindness) of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc.
However, the coming into being of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> itself, is all drawn from the aspect of the <i>Kav-</i>Line, which is called “The Source of the Coming into being of all Desires for Desires.”
This is because it is the essential simple desire, which originated within Himself that it should be thus, as mentioned previously.
It therefore causes and makes the “desire for desire” [to be] in a particular way.
[This principle applies] from the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> [of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>], which is the aspect of the “desire for the desire” for Kingship.
However, the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> only comes about from the last level of the aforementioned <i>Heyulie</i> Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom HaHeyulie</i>).
[<i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>] is the “desire for the concealed desire” which is higher than the aspect of <i>Chochmah-</i>Wisdom of the “desire for the concealed desire.”
In this manner, all the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> are in an aspect of concealment.
[The <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>] are all the [hidden] “desires for the desires” for all the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which [themselves] come in an aspect of revelation, as will be explained. This will suffice for those of understanding.
This then, is the [reason why] the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is called “<i>Adam D’Briyah</i>-Man of Creation,” [for] it [comes into being] similar to the aspect of the coming into being of “something” from “nothing.”
We clearly observe that a “desire for desire” comes into being at specific times, similar to how all other created entities come into being.
This is similar to the coming into being of thought, which is a creation of “something” from “nothing” in comparison to the essential desire in [a person’s] soul.
We [also] clearly observe that [in regard to] the “desire for the desire” which comes into an aspect of being, the beginning of its coming into being is specifically in thought.
This is because thought is an aspect of a vessel for the desire, since the desire becomes invested in the thought, as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 26:3, 36:3</i> “As I have thought to do.”
Similarly, the first existence of the “desire for the desire” is [also] within thought, and is called “the desire which is within thought.”
This is the general [explanation] for the matter of <i>Keter</i> (Desire)<i>, Chochmah</i> (Insight) and <i>Binah</i> (Comprehension) of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>. That is, this is the aspect of the coming into being and actualization of the light of the “desire for the desire” in a specific manner, as it comes in the “hidden thought” [of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>].
In contrast, the aspect of the <i>Kav-</i>Line is higher than the actualization of the existence of a “desire for desire” for a particular thing, even in the “hidden thought.”
Rather, the thought of everything that will be, is still entirely to Himself.
This is to say that it still includes [everything] in the thought for Himself, and is not an existence of a desire within a thought for anything outside of Himself whatsoever. This will suffice for those of understanding.
(In the words of Maimonides,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, 2:9-10.</i> this is “the knowledge of Himself, rather than a knowledge which is outside of Himself etc.,” as explained elsewhere.)

Chapter 19

We must now understand the source of the ten emanated <i>sefirot</i> [of the world of <i>Atzilut</i> – Emanation]. Their source is from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
This is as stated in <i>Etz Chayim Shaar HaKlallim,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, (Shaar Seder Atzilut) Shaar 3, Chapter 1.</i> that <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> comes about from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon.</i>
Now, we must first preface with [an explanation of] the matter of how the ten hidden <i>sefirot</i>, which are concealed, come out into revelation.
This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 41:4</i> “He calls out the generations from the beginning (<i>Rosh</i>-ראש),” that is, from the “head (<i>Rosh</i>-ראש)” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc.
<i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> states<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:7</i> that [the revelation of the concealed] is like “the flame that is bound in the coal,” and there are many similar analogies to this.
However, this [matter] may be better understood from the [revelation] of the ten powers of the soul.
As known, the matter of “concealment and revelation” is unlike the spreading forth of a power from its essence, such as the “power of action” that spreads forth in the action, since [in such a case] it is the power of the essence itself [that spreads forth] and is called, “cause and effect.”
Rather, it is similar to the aspect of the ray and light of the essence.
This is like the radiance of the rays of light of the sun, or like the life and light of the soul as it is within the vessel of the body, or like a flash of insight [as it comes] from the “power of conceptualization,” and the like.
However, a truer analogy for the matter of “the revelation of the concealed” is like the revelation of movement from a living animal, or like the letters of thought and the letters of speech, and the like.
All the above are better [analogies] than the analogy of the flame that is bound, in a hidden fashion, with the coal.
For although the flame was indeed hidden in the coal, nonetheless, the flame came out of the essential heat of the coal, and thus, this is not a true comparison to the matter of “revelation.”
[This is because, “the revelation of the hidden”] is merely like the aspect of an appearance or a color, such as the color of an apple, which is not essential to the apple, as known.
This is likewise the case with the revelation of the concealed essential powers of the soul, such as the power of the quality of <i>Chessed-</i>Kindness, as it is in the essence.
Its revelation is when a desire and intellect for kindness and goodness is constantly brought into being because of this essential quality of the essence of the soul.
The opposite is true of someone whose essential quality is cruelty. [In such a person] a desire and intellect for judgment and punishment is brought into being.
Now, the coming into being of the source of this desire for [either] kindness or judgment is still considered to be [part and parcel] of the essential quality, and is altogether not separate from it.
However, the revealed desires for judgment or its opposite, which are born [of the “desire for the desire”], are merely like a revealed indication of the essence.
This may be compared to the revealed movement [which comes] from the [power of movement in the] essence of the animal, or to the revealed life force [of the soul as it exists] in a separate thing, that is, the [physical] body.
This is to say that because he is essentially alive, he reveals his life force in [physical] movement.
Moreover, because he essentially is a living being, he [therefore] also enlivens the inanimate body. [The physical life] is called “<i>Chayei Bassar-</i>the life of the flesh” etc.
[Similarly,] the revelation of desire comes into a separate thing, which is this [above mentioned] matter of [either] kindness or judgment.
However, the source that gives rise to this desire comes from the power of the essential quality alone.
[We] automatically understand [from this] that since there are many different types of things, a specific desire will be born for each of them from a single source, which at all times is dependent upon the essential quality.
Similarly, [when one’s] intellect constantly leans towards a desire [for] kindness, this is only because of [his] essential quality of kindness, which constantly gives rise to a desire and intellect for kindness, specifically.
Because there are many different separate things [through which this kindness may be expressed, therefore,] an individual desire and intellect is born [from the same essential source] for each one [in and of] itself. This will suffice for those of understanding.
We [therefore] find that the general “desire for the desire” for kindness can bring forth many different particular desires for kindness, in many very different matters and ways.
[Nonetheless,] they all are from one source, this being the concealed desire, which is called, “The essential desire for kindness,” [which comes about] because of the essential <i>Heyulie</i> quality [of kindness in the essence of the soul].
However, [this essential <i>Heyulie</i> quality] comes [to be expressed] in a specific way, to be this [specific] “desire for the desire” for this specific thing. This will suffice for those of understanding.
However, it is nevertheless understood that there is a great difference between [the concealed desire of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> and] the revelation of the desire for kindness [of <i>Atzilut</i>] which is merely the aspect of a “revelation of the concealment” of the essential desire, which arouses this [specific] desire.
[In contrast, the concealed desire of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>] comes from the power of the essential quality [of the Self], and is not an aspect of a “separate thing.” This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, the matter of “He calls out the generations from the head of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc.,” may be understood according to the above analogies.
This is analogous to a person who calls out to something to come out from its concealment and be revealed outside.
Likewise, the main matter of the aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut-</i>Emanation, is only that they come out from being concealed to being revealed.
This is why they are called by the terms, “Lights-<i>Orot</i>” or “Emanations-<i>Sefirot</i>,” [in that they are] similar to a ray and a light.
This is similar to any aspect of the “revelation of the concealed,” in that it is only an aspect of light, or only like the aspect of an indication [of the Essence], [such as the] color [of an apple]. [In other words,] it is like the movement of an animal [which is merely an indication that, in essence, it is alive] etc.
Moreover, this is the meaning [of the word <i>Atzilut</i>-Emanation,] as in [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beha’alotcha</i> 11:25.</i> “And He emanated from the spirit,” which was not the [actual] spirit of Moshe [itself].
Rather, it was only an aspect of a revelation of his light and ray, which spread forth and emanated, similar to a flame [that emanates] from a coal, and the like.
All this may be understood according to the aforementioned analogy regarding the matter of [how] the desire becomes revealed in a separate thing.
That is, it emerges from the concealment of the essential desire, according to [his] essence, as mentioned previously.
Likewise, the aspect of the <i>Ketarim</i> (Crowns) of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>-Emanation, is only the aspect of the <b>revelation </b>of the desire, in comparison to the concealed essential desire [itself], which is called “the desire for the desire,” this being the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon,</i> as previously explained.
For example, the revealed desire for kindness of <i>Atzilut</i> which is called <i>Keter</i> of <i>Chessed</i>, is drawn from the aspect of the concealed desire for kindness of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
Likewise, [the revealed desire for wisdom (<i>Chochmah</i>) of <i>Atzilut</i> is drawn] from the aspect of the concealed desire of <i>Chochmah</i> [of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>].
However, just as it is understood from the aforementioned analogy that the existence of what is called “the desire for the desire” comes as an aspect of a “general [desire],” which “gives birth” to many different [particular] desires and many different matters and ways, likewise, many different types of revealed desires for kindness of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> are “born” from the aspect of the “desire for the desire of kindness” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
The [explanation of the] matter is that from the aspect of the <i>Malchut</i> of a [particular] quality of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, comes about the aspect of the <i>Keter</i> of that quality of <i>Atzilut</i>.
However, [when speaking] of the ten <i>sefirot</i> generally, it is only from the [general] aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> that the [general] <i>Keter</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> is made.
This is to say that it is only from the “letters” and revelation of the <b>concealed</b> essential desire that the essential light of the <b>revealed</b> desire is made.
(This bears a similarity to what was explained in chapter eighteen, that the “desire for the desire,” that is, the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, is only made from the aspect of the “end action” of the “Essential [Primal] Desire”- [<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>].)
(By way of analogy, [this is like] the revelation of the desire in the speech of the influencer, which becomes the essential desire of the recipient.
Similarly, it is like how the letters that reveal the intellect in the speech of the influencer, become the essential intellectual light of the recipient.
Likewise, the light of the desire for kindness in the recipient, only comes about from the letters and revelation of kindness in the speech of the influencer.
As known regarding every [type of] cause and effect, that the root and beginning of the effect is made from the last level of the cause.
Similarly, <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> [of <i>Atzilut</i>] is made from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
In other words, the source of revelation of the desire which results from pleasure, which is called <i>Atik Yomin,</i> as will be explained, is made only from the revelation of the “desire for the desire” in “speech.”)
This is the general [explanation] of the matter of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>, which came out of the concealment of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, as stated, “He calls out the generations from the head” [of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>] etc.

Chapter 20

Now, before the details of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> can be explained, we must preface [by explaining] the matter of <i>Nekudah</i>-Point, <i>Sefirah-</i>Emanation, and <i>Partzuf-</i>Stature.
As known, the general difference between the aspect of <i>Tohu</i> (Chaos) and the aspect of <i>Tikkun</i> (Rectification) is that the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Tohu</i> (Chaos) are only in an aspect of “points,” which are the aspects of the <i>Ketarim</i> (Desires).
[In contrast,] in the world of <i>Tikkun-</i>Rectification, the [<i>sefirot</i>] come in an aspect of division in which each <i>sefirah</i> [is divided] into ten, and therefore, the aspect of “Rectification” automatically comes about.
This is the aspect of the inter-inclusion [of the <i>sefirot</i>] by means of the Name of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 (יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א).
Now, the explanation of these matters is known, that the aspect of <i>Nekudot</i>-Points is the aspect of an essence before it spreads forth. This is similar to a point, which does not spread forth.
An example [of this] is the light of the quality of <i>Chessed-</i>Kindness. The aspect of the essential quality of kindness is the aspect of its <i>Keter</i> (Desire).
However, what is meant here is not the aspect of the essential quality of <i>Chessed-</i>Kindness as it is embedded and rooted within the essence of the soul, which is called the <i>Yechidah</i> (Singular), as mentioned previously, since [the way it exists embedded in the essence of the soul] is [still] totally in an aspect of a <i>Heyulie,</i> (as mentioned previously in chapters 10 and 11).
Rather, what is meant here is in regard to the aspect of the revelation of the desire for a <b>particular</b> [act of] kindness, [as it becomes revealed] from its concealment in the essential <i>Heyulie</i> of kindness.
[Now], even this [revealed] desire has not yet spread forth [from its essential state].
Rather, it [exists] as it is, beyond reason whatsoever for this desire, [such as the reason for] why he desires to reveal kindness etc.
Certainly, [as of yet], there are no divisions into the various different ways [that this kindness may be expressed].
Even if his intellect leans specifically to <i>Chessed-</i>kindness, [nonetheless] it is not divided into various ways [of how the kindness will come out].
[This is because] although the [aspect] of intellect that essentially leans toward kindness and merit, is the aspect of the <i>Chochmah</i> (Insight) of the essential <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness), nonetheless, it too, is only in an aspect of a <i>Nekudah</i>-Point.
Likewise, [the aspect of] the <i>Netzach</i> (Conquest) of this <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) [also] comes in the way of a <i>Nekudah</i>-Point.
We [therefore] find that although the aspect of the essential kindness which comes into revelation, includes ten [<i>sefirot</i> within it, that is, desire, intellect and emotions, nonetheless, there are no recognizable divisions within them.
Rather, they are all [included] in an aspect of a single point. This is the aspect of <i>Akudim</i>-Bound, wherein [the <i>sefirot</i>] were all bound up in a single vessel.
It is because of this that the aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Tohu</i>-Chaos cannot unite or become inter-included one with the other.
Rather, they are [disjointed points,] one beneath the other, as stated, “He reigned and he died etc.”
An example of this is an essential desire for kindness that comes into revelation.
Although it includes intellect etc., nonetheless, it cannot join with an essential desire that is its opposite, [such as an essential desire] that comes in an aspect of judgment.
[This is the case] even though it too includes intellect, [albeit, one] which essentially leans towards judgment.
This is because they do not have a vessel within which two [essential] opposites, such as these, can become inter-included.
We can observe this tangibly, that a person whose intellect essentially leans towards kindness cannot, in any way, tolerate his opponent, who is a person whose intellect essentially leans towards judgment.
(This is analogous to the debates between the academies of Shammai and Hillel, and the like. Even if his opponent poses difficult questions [on his views], which he is unable to logically answer, he will remain silent, but will [find it] impossible to acknowledge [the correctness of his opponent’s opinion]. [Neither will he be able] to retract [his opinion] and align himself with the opposite view, whatsoever.)
However, the aspect of <i>Tikkun-</i>Rectification is when a quality comes to spread forth from its [essential] point (<i>Nekudah</i>), outside of its essential desire and intellect.
In other words, this is like when the quality of <i>Chessed-</i>Kindness gives rise to a desire and intellect to have a kind disposition toward his fellow, [specifically] because he did him a favor.
[This is to say that] it is not because his [own] essential goodness and kindness becomes revealed, as a necessary consequence of the natural goodness in the essence of his soul.
On the contrary, he may be cruel by nature. However, he will desire to do [acts of] goodness to someone who was gracious to him and who saved him from death, or the like. [Moreover,] his intellectual disposition towards him will always lean towards [thoughts of] kindness and merit, and the like.
This is called <b>composite</b> kindness and goodness. It is not at all the simple essential kindness that stems from his [essential] nature.
The same [principle] is true of the opposite [quality], which is the composite quality of judgment. Towards his enemy, who has done him much harm, his desire and intellect will lean towards [judging him as being] guilty, even though he [himself] may be a kind and merciful person in his essential nature.
Accordingly, it is understood that there are many different ways in which the composition [of one’s desires] are formed, according to the composition of his emotions towards [any given] thing.
This is like love or hate that are dependent upon something, as mentioned above.
It is therefore possible to find something that, from one angle, he loves, and his desire and intellect are entirely for goodness and kindness [towards that thing], while from another angle of the very same thing itself, he hates it. [This is to say that] his desire and intellect is turned towards harming and punishing [the very same thing].
[Because of this,] it is possible for there to be an intermediary [composite] aspect, which includes <i>Chessed</i>-Kindness and <i>Gevurah</i>-Judgment together as one.
This is in accordance with the teaching,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 78b, and Rashi there; Also see Zephaniah 2:3</i> “[In the same matter] where His judgment is, [there He enumerates good deeds],” in regard King Saul who killed the Gibeonites. [Simultaneously, King David was reprimanded] for not properly eulogizing [King Saul]. [This is an example of] two opposites at once.
Similarly, regarding King Solomon’s marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 32:31; Talmud Bavli Nidah 70b</i> “My anger has been aroused etc.”
However, the Song of Songs was said in reference to <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה joy over the building of the Holy Temple, as stated, <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 3:11; Zohar II 143a.</i> “On the day of the joy of His heart.”
[This is an example of] joy and anger, one thing and its opposite, as one.
Similarly, [regarding the flood] it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21</i> “[I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake;] for the impulse of man’s heart is evil from his youth.”
However, previously it was stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:5-6</i> “And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, [and that all the impulse of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.] And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה repented [for having made man on earth] etc.”
As explained elsewhere, all this comes about from the aspect of the qualities of <i>Tikkun-</i>Rectification, which are composite aspects.
In other words, they spread forth [outside of their essence] and do not result from the essential [nature] alone.
Therefore, it is possible for there to be an inter-inclusion of one thing with its opposite.
In contrast, [regarding] the <i>Nekudah</i>-Point of <i>Tohu</i>-Chaos; even when it is made into a division of ten [<i>sefirot</i>], [nonetheless] it is only [in the aspect of] a <i>Sefirah</i>-Emanation.
[However,] it is not a <i>Partzuf Adam</i>-Stature of Man, wherein there is the aspect of the inter-inclusion of all opposites.
Rather, it is specifically in the aspect of <i>Tikkun</i>-Rectification, in which each point spreads forth out of its essence, that they can become inter-included through the abundance of many different vessels, within which they are composed. This will suffice for those of understanding.
This then, is [the meaning of] the statement in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>, “He took fire and water and mixed them one with the other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 12a</i>
In other words, [this is] the aspect of the composition of fire and water [together], specifically <b>not</b> [as they are] in their essential state, as explained elsewhere at length.

Chapter 21

With all the above [in mind], the general matter of the inter-inclusions of the three emanated lines may be understood. [The <i>sefirot</i> of] <i>Chochmah, Chessed</i> and <i>Netzach</i> are to the right, <i>Binah, Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i> are to the left, and <i>Da’at, Tiferet</i> and <i>Yesod</i> are in the middle.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These three lines are known in Kabbalah and Chassidut by their abbreviations. <i>Chochmah, Chessed</i> and <i>Netzach</i> are called <i>ChaCha”N</i>. <i>Binah, Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i> are called <i>BoGa”H</i>. <i>Da’at, Tiferet</i> and <i>Yesod</i> are known as <i>DaTi”Y</i>. (It is this configuration of the <i>sefirot</i> into three lines, right, left and middle, which is usually depicted as “The Tree of Life.” This configuration of the three lines of the <i>sefirot</i> as they are inter-included, is generally called the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Yosher</i>.)</i>
[Now,] it is stated in <i>Pardes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Pardes Rimonim of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, Shaar HaTzinorot.</i> that the inner aspect of <i>Keter</i>, which is called <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, is not divided into three lines.
[It is only from] the external aspect of [<i>Keter</i>] that the three lines separate.
[In other words, it is] from the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Keter</i> [that a distinction of three lines begins], as known regarding the [Kabbalistic] intentions of [the words] “The Great, The Mighty and The Awesome”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See the beginning of <i>Amidah</i> prayer. As mentioned previously, “The Great – <i>HaGadol</i>” represents <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) to the right, “The Mighty – <i>HaGibor</i>” represents <i>Gevurah</i> (Might/Judgment) to the left, and “The Awesome” represents the median conduct, the middle line which synthesizes the right and the left, which is <i>Tiferet</i> (Beauty/Mercy).</i> etc.
The explanation of these matters is that the aspect of the inter-inclusions of the right and left lines [one with the other] is specifically by means of the middle line.
The [explanation of the] matter is that in the right line of <i>ChaCha”N,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chochmah, Chessed</i> and <i>Netzach</i></i> <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness is an offshoot of <i>Chochmah</i> – Insight, but is [nonetheless] separate from it.
This may be [understood by] the fact that <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness, branches from [<i>Chochmah</i>, which is] the intellect and reasoning that in the composition of something separate, leans toward kindness.
Similarly, <i>Netzach</i> – Conquest is an offshoot of <i>Chessed</i>, but is [nonetheless] separate from it. This is to say that the quality of kindness necessitates the aspect of triumph, in order to bring the kindness into actualization etc.
[On the other hand] the left line [of <i>BoGa”H</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Binah, Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i>.</i>] is the opposite [of the above]. For example, the [emotional] quality of judgment, branches out from an intellect that leans towards judgment.
In the same manner <i>Binah</i> [gives rise to] <i>Gevurah</i>, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 8:14</i> “I am <i>Binah</i>, <i>Gevurah</i> is mine.”
[For, as known,] <i>Chochmah</i> leans towards kindness, while judgments are aroused from <i>Binah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar VaYikra 10b-11a</i>
(This accords with the statement in <i>Etz Chayim</i> that <i>Abba</i> (Father-<i>Chochmah</i>) is the source of the kindnesses and <i>Imma</i> (Mother-<i>Binah</i>) is the source of the judgments, as known.)
Now, the aspect of the inter-inclusion of these two [opposite] lines, so that they come to be connected [and synthesized] as one, is by means of the middle line of <i>DaTi”Y</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Da’at, Tiferet</i> and <i>Yesod</i></i>
For example, <i>Da’at</i> is the aspect of the median [conduct] that tips [the mind] from intellectual kindness to intellectual sternness, and is [therefore] called “The Leaning <i>Da’at</i>.”
(For example, [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21</i> “I will not continue to curse the earth because of mankind,] because the inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth, [I will, therefore, not continue to punish any living thing, as I had done etc.”] becomes an intellectual reasoning for merit, though at first, this very same intellectual [reasoning] leaned toward judgment, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:5,6</i> “And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה saw that the wickedness of man was great [in the earth, and that all the impulse of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה repented that he had made man on earth] etc.” There are [many] other cases similar to this, as explained elsewhere.)
We find that [specifically] in <i>Da’at</i>, the two conceptual opposites of <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) and <i>Gevurah</i> (Judgment) become connected. That is, it may lean toward kindness in one way and toward judgment in another way, and the like, even in [regard to] the same case.
Similarly, the quality of <i>Tiferet</i> mediates between [the heartfelt emotion of] <i>Chessed</i> and [the heartfelt emotion of] <i>Gevurah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Pardes Rimonim of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, (<i>Shaar HaMachri’in</i>) Shaar 9; Chapter 3.</i>
An example of this is the [quality of] mercy, which can only take place after the quality of judgment. [This is to say that] although [he is found guilty], mercy releases him. This is the quality of <i>Yaakov</i>, as known.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 87b</i>
Likewise, the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> is the mediator to inter-includes the two opposites [gut emotions] of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i>.
This is the matter of, “The kidneys which counsel” [either] yes or no,” before the [actual] influence of the influencer [is expressed]. [This takes place] whenever it is necessary to express the essential [heartfelt emotional] qualities of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>.
For example, in every deliberation of <i>Da’at</i>, [the final decision] comes about through the tipping of the [intellectual] balance.
Then, after the verdict [has been reached], it is weighed upon “The Righteous Scales,” which are <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i>, [to determine exactly] how to bring the influence out to the recipient.
This then, is the general matter of the middle line of <i>DaTi”Y,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Da’at, Tiferet, Yesod</i></i> which connects the two lines to its right and to its left.
[Now,] as known, the particulars of how [the <i>sefirot</i>] are inter-included are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 5:1</i> “The Twelve Diagonal Lines – <i>Yood Beit G’voolei Alachson</i>,” whereas the middle line is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 26:28; Zohar II 175b.</i> “The Inner Beam,” for runs through from end to end.
In other words, it reaches up to the inner aspect of <i>Keter</i>, which itself is higher than division into lines.
Because of this [the middle line] has the power to unify and synthesize the two [opposite] lines [to its right and left].
Now [for] the explanation of the matter of the inner <i>Keter</i> of the Emanated (<i>Atzilut</i>), which is called the <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter,</i> (and is the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i> etc.).
This is the aspect of the desire and pleasure that comes into revelation, which is called “The Light of <i>Keter</i>.” It too includes ten <i>sefirot</i> within it.
[However] the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Keter</i>, is the reasoning for the desire and is called “The Hidden Reason of the Desire.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta’am HaKamoos LaRatzon</i></i>
Similarly, [<i>Keter</i>] contains a <i>Chessed</i> and a <i>Netzach</i> etc, [until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i>.]
All this is within the aspect of desire, which [still] is unlimited, even when it comes into revelation from the “Hidden Essential Desire” [of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>], as previously explained.
It is for this reason that the emotional [<i>sefirot</i>] of the desire and pleasure (that is <i>Keter itself</i>) are called “the preceding days” in comparison to the emotional [<i>sefirot</i>] of [the levels of] <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> (Insight and Comprehension) [themselves], which come about in a limited fashion, [that is], only according to the limitations of revealed intellect, as will be explained.
It is [only] from the external aspect of <i>Keter</i> that there comes about a division into three lines.
This is because in the “Hidden Reason for the Desire,” the desire is [already] regarded as being divided into <i>Chessed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i> and the intermediary [quality of <i>Tiferet</i>].
However, in <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, which is beyond the “Hidden Reason for the Desire,” it is still only a simple essential desire, altogether beyond reason.
This is because a desire is altogether beyond reason, even a hidden reason.
This is similar to the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Menachot 29b</i> “Be silent! It thus arose in thought etc.,” as explained elsewhere.
Therefore, although [the level of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>] comes into revelation from the lowest aspect of the concealed desire of the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, (as explained at the end of chapter 19), it [nonetheless] is above divisions of right and left.
About this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 26:33</i> “And the curtain shall be for you as a separation between the Holy and the Holy of Holies.”
[This refers to] the aspect of the space (<i>Parsa</i>) separating <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i> from <i>Chochmah</i> [of <i>Keter</i>].
This is the aspect of the <i>Krooma D’Aveera</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 128b.</i> (“Airy Membrane”), as explained elsewhere at length.
For this reason, we say [in our prayers],<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See the morning blessings and other places.</i> “May it be desirable <b>before</b> you,” [that is,] before the <i>Parsa</i>-Space.
[Since <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i> is above division, it can therefore] change from a desire of judgment to a desire of kindness, and the like. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 22

We must now understand the particular inter-inclusions of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> (Emanation).
However, we must first explain the specifics of the matter of the sub-division of the <i>sefirot</i> into ten, and ten into ten etc.
For example, <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> (Kindness of Insight) also divides into ten, and likewise, <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> (Sternness of Insight) divides into ten etc.
For, [as known], <i>Chochmah</i> (Insight) includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>] in it.
An example is <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> (Kindness and Sternness of Insight), which are the [intellectual] leanings, either toward merit or toward judgment.
Now, <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>, which is the intellectual leaning towards merit, also includes ten [<i>sefirot</i>] within it.
This is like <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> as they are within [<i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>, so that there is an intellectual] leaning toward merit in a specific manner, and also an [intellectual] imperative toward judgment in a specific manner.
(For, although merit will be overturned to culpability within [the quality of] Judgment of <i>Chochmah</i>, and culpability will be overturned to merit within Kindness of <i>Chochmah</i>, this is [only so] as the quality is in its essence, [wherein] there are no sub-divisions.
However, [as it is in a state of] sub-divisions, [of the ten sub-dividing into ten etc.], it is possible for the aspect of Judgment to even be within Kindness of Insight (<i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>), and for the aspect of Kindness to be within the Judgement of Insight (<i>Din</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>), as known.)
Similarly, the [actual] emotional [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> themselves, are also divided into the ten [<i>sefirot</i>], <i>Keter, Chochmah, Binah</i>, and the emotional characteristics-<i>Midot</i> etc.
For, although [it was stated],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Ketubot 84a</i> “We do not [exercise] mercifulness during judgment,” this was [said in regard to] the essential [quality] Judgment.
Similarly, there is no Judgment in the essential [quality] of Kindness.
However, as they spread forth from the essence [to become composites], there <b>is</b> Kindness in Judgment and Judgment in Kindness, as mentioned above.
Now, there is a [type of] inter-inclusion called, “The nullification of a thing to its opposite, that opposes it,” in which it becomes just like its opposite.
This is like the [matter of] “sweetening” of the Judgments (<i>Gevurot</i>) within the Kindnesses (<i>Chassadim</i>).
For example, this is like when the prosecutor transforms to become a defender, or the opposite, when the defender transforms to become a prosecutor.
Similarly, it is like the sweetening of bitter waters in sweet [waters], or the opposite.
Likewise, [it is like] the nullification of an intellectual [reasoning] for merit, into an intellectual [reasoning] for culpability, or the like.
These are [all examples of] true inter-inclusion, which is only possible because the opposition itself [latently] possesses its [opposite] power.
If this was not so, it would be impossible for it to become nullified to it.
For example, sweetness possesses [latent] bitterness and bitterness possesses [latent] sweetness.
By way of analogy, an example of this is a [dish called] <i>Merkachat</i>, [which is made] from honey cooked with radishes. This creates a delightful taste, which includes sharpness and sweetness as one, as known.
Similarly, there is [something of] the nature of fire in water, and [something of the] nature of water in fire.
Because of this, there can be an inter-inclusion of fire with water, or water with fire, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 12a</i> “He took water from fire and fire from water etc.”
This [principle] likewise [applies to] the emotions of <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) and <i>Gevurah</i> (Judgment). Because there is Judgment in Kindness and Kindness in Judgment, as mentioned above, therefore, Judgment may be nullified within Kindness, or vice versa, Kindness [may be nullified] within Judgment.
If this was not so, there could never be an inter-inclusion of one thing with its opposite.
However, there is [another type of] inter-inclusion of Judgment with Kindness [which comes about specifically] because it is essentially similar to it, rather than being negated by it.
On the contrary, [in such a case], it [actually] gives [additional] strength and force [to its opposite].
Nonetheless, it is called <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> (Sternness of Kindness) or the reverse, <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Gevurah</i> (Kindness of Judgment) in that it strengthens the sternness and judgment.
As known, this matter is comparable to [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 25:21-22</i> “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; [and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, for [in doing so] you are heaping hot coals [upon his head etc.]”
This is to say that with this kindness and goodness, he perpetrates complete malevolence and judgment upon his [enemy], by destroying his soul.
Similarly, [it states],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 7:10</i> “He pays His enemies up front, in order to destroy them.” This is likewise the case in any aspect of judgment and retribution that is done through the aspect of kindness.
This [kindness] gives much greater strength and force to the judgment, and is called <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Gevurah</i> (Kindness of Judgment).
This is like [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 30:31,32</i>] “And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה shall cause His glorious voice to be heard” in the camp of Sancheriv.
Similarly, the opposite is true of the aspect of <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> (Sternness of Kindness). [That is,] there will be a much greater strength and force in an act of kindness which is done through the quality of judgment.
An example of this is the <i>Gevurot G’shamim -</i> “The strength of the rains,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Ta’anit 1:1</i> which come in a constricted fashion so that they should come forth with abundance.
This is similar to the <i>Tzimtzum-</i>constriction of any light of influence, so that it may be received [by the recipient].
This [principle] also applies to the divisions of the “72 bridges”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Pardes Rimonim, Shaar 21 (Shaar Pratey HaShemot), Chapter 5. Rabbi Nechunia Ben HaKanah (<i>Sefer HaBahir</i>) calls <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה name of 72 by the term “the 72 Bridges.” This refers to the name that arises from the three verses that begin with the words, “<i>VaYisa, VaYavo, VaYeit</i>” (Exodus 14:19-21). Each of these verses possess 72 letters, and they into 72 three letter combinations, made up of the letters of these three verses. This name is a name of Kindness, as indicated by the fact that the numerical value of 72 is Kindness-<i>Chessed-</i>חסד. However, it is expressed through the vehicle and vessels of <i>Gevurah-</i>Sternness, as indicated by the fact that the numerical value of 3 verses x 72 letters = 216, which is the numerical value of Judgment-Gevurah-גבורה-216. (Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 3, The Gate explaining that the Explicit Name (<i>Shem HaMeforash</i>) is ע״ב-72 and יר״ו-216.)</i> and likewise to the “afflictions of love,” [as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 3:12</i> “For <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה admonishes the one He loves,] and like a father, he desires His child.”
That is, the kindness is specifically actualized through a garment of the quality of judgment.
It is specifically this [kind of expression of kindness] that [brings out] the [strength and] force of the kindness, even more than the [expression of] the essential kindness.
This is similar to [the statement],<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Megillah 13b</i> “He precedes the cure to the infliction,” and as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 6:1</i> “For He has torn, and He will heal us; [He has smitten, and He will bind us up].”
Now, at first glance, why is the infliction necessary altogether? However, through the healing, one becomes healthier and stronger [than at first].
This is because sickness is the aspect of harsh judgment. It is remedied by means of the quality of Judgment within Kindness, that is, medicine, which is [made] of harsh substances.
This [principle] applies to the sweetening of every judgment. [It takes place] specifically in its [essential] source. That is, it is specifically [by means] of the Judgment in the Kindness (<i>Din SheBeChessed</i>).
This is because it is the strength of the Kindness, [which is required] to overpower the Judgment and sweeten it. This will suffice for those of understanding.
Through all the above, the inter-inclusions of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>, and the particular ways of how [they inter-include] may be understood, in that even <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> [may be inter-included] with <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Gevurah</i>.
[This holds true] even though they may be two extreme opposites, [such as in a case] in which one is potent Kindness (<i>Chessed</i>) and one is potent Judgment (<i>Gevurah</i>).
Moreover, they are certainly [opposites] in that they are expressed within exchanged [and opposing] garments, [in which] one actualizes a judgment and one actualizes a kindness.
Nonetheless, since each one is specifically an actualization for something that is its opposite, that is, <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> actualizes judgment but its inner [motivation] is kindness, and <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Gevurah</i> actualizes kindness but its inner [motivation] is judgment, therefore, specifically [because of this] they can come together as one, since each one [includes and], at the very least, indicates these two opposites.
This may be illustrated [by the fact that it was the angel] “Gavriel who [offered to] save Avraham,”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 118a – When he was thrown into the fiery furnace by Nimrod.</i> and similarly, [by the fact that it was Gavriel] who<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yoma 77a – It states (Ezekiel 8:16), “He brought me to the inner court of the house of HaShem, and behold, at the door of the temple of HaShem, between the <i>Ulam</i> (porch) and the Altar there were about twenty five men. Their backs were towards the temple of HaShem, and they faced east, and they bowed down eastward, to the sun.” The Talmud continues, “From the fact that it states that they faced east don’t we know that their backs were towards the temple of HaShem? Rather, what do we learn from the fact that their backs were turned towards the temple of HaShem? This teaches us that they were revealing themselves, and defecating (towards the <i>Shechinah</i>). The Holy One blessed be He said to (the angel) Michael, “Michael, your people have sinned.” Michael answered, “Master of the Universe, isn’t it enough that there are good people amongst them?” The Holy One blessed be He answered him, “I will burn them, including the good ones that are amongst them (because they did not rebuke the sinners).” Then (Ezekiel 10:2) “G-d spoke to the man who was clothed in linen (referring to Gavriel) and said, “Go in between the wheels (referring to the <i>Ophanim</i> angels), under the cherub (referring to the <i>Chayot HaKodesh</i> angels), and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and throw them upon the city.” And he went in, in my (Ezekiel’s) sight.” It then continues and says (Ezekiel 10:7) “And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and he took thereof and gave it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen (Gavriel), who took it and went out.” Rav Channa Bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Chasidah, “Had the coals not cooled from the hands of the cherub to the hands of Gavriel, there would not remain even a remnant or a refugee from the enemies of Israel.” (Note: The term “The enemies of Israel” is a euphemism for Israel themselves. The Talmud did not wish to express a curse in regard to the Jewish people so it turned it around against their enemies.) We see from this story that the coals cooled in the hands of Gavriel, the angel of <b>fire</b>. Now, seemingly, they should have gotten hotter in his hands. However, because he possesses the quality of <i>Chessed</i> as well, he is actually capable of cooling the coals.</i> “cooled the coals.”
This [comes] from the aspect of the <i>Gevurah</i> in the <i>Chessed</i>.
Similarly, a good [heavy] sweat eliminates the illness of [high] fever, like [the above-mentioned fact that harsh] medications heal afflictions.
[Furthermore], it was he [Gavriel] who smote the camp of Sancheriv, in an aspect of <i>Chessed</i> which is in <i>Gevurah</i>, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Kings II 19:35; Isaiah 37: 36; Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 95b</i> “The angel of the <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה went out [and smote in the camp of Ashur] etc.,” as known. This will suffice for those of understanding.
This then, is [the meaning of the teaching],<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar beginning of Parshat Korach<i>.</i></i> “To include the left in the right and the right in the left.”
This is similar to light of <i>Chessed</i> in a vessel of <i>Gevurah</i>, wherein the vessel actualizes the opposite of its light.
That is, the vessel of <i>Gevurah</i> actualizes judgment, which is the opposite of the light of kindness within it.
The reverse is also true. A vessel of <i>Chessed</i> may actualize kindness, which is the opposite of the light of <i>Gevurah</i> within it.
However, this is not at all a contradiction, since this [phenomenon] is the aspect of lights and vessels, which is related to the matter of “form” and “substance” (as will later be explained).
This is in accordance to that which is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of the inter-inclusions of the name of seventy-two and the name of forty-two, which are the [first] two paragraphs of the <i>Shema</i> recital.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The first paragraph of the <i>Shema</i> recital has 42 words, beginning with the word “<i>V’Ahavta</i> – And you shall love” until the end of the paragraph. This paragraph corresponds to the name of 42 letters. It is explained in the writings of the <i>Arizal</i> that the name of 42 letters (of <i>Ana B’Koach</i>) is a name of Sternness-<i>Gevurah</i>. In contrast, the second paragraph of the <i>Shema</i> recital has 72 words, beginning with “<i>V’Hayah</i> – And it shall come to pass” until the word “<i>V’Samtem</i> – And you shall place them.” The name of 72 is a name of kindness (as is indicated by its numerical value, which is equal to the word <i>Chessed</i>, as mentioned previously). Now, the first paragraph speaks of love of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה (<i>Chessed</i>), while the second paragraph speaks of the retribution which will ensue when one strays from <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה (<i>Gevurah</i>). So although the first paragraph represents <i>Gevurah</i>, it is expressed through vessels (i.e. letters) of <i>Chessed</i>. In contrast, the second paragraph represents <i>Chessed</i>, but is expressed through vessels of <i>Gevurah</i>. (Also see the <i>Kavanot</i> of the Arizal to the <i>Shema</i> recital<i>.</i>)</i>
Another example [of this principle] is [the fact that] the binding of Yitzchak was [done] by Avraham, the [epitomal] man of kindness.
[This is] likewise the case in regard to the “waving”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 8:5 through 8:21</i> of the Levites, who became included within the Kindnesses of the <i>Kohanim</i>-Priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Levites are rooted on the side of <i>Gevurah,</i> while the Priests (<i>Kohanim</i>) are rooted on the side of <i>Chessed</i>.</i>
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 18:3</i> “[Bring your brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,] bring them near to you, [so that <b>they may join to you</b>, and minister to you].”
Why is it possible for them to serve their opposites? There are many other such examples.
Now, all of this is only possible because of the aspect of sub-divisions that exist in each [<i>sefirah</i>].
Therefore, “a kind finds its kind and become awakened,”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Eruvin 9a</i> even when the two are literally opposites.
This is similar to the matter of the differences between Michael and Gavriel, the angels of fire and water.
[Nonetheless] they do not extinguish each other, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Job 25:2</i> “He makes peace in His high places.”
This is specifically because each one [latently] possesses something of his opposite.
However, in [regard to] the completely simple [essential] lights, such as the aspect of <i>Nekudot</i> – Points, which are called <i>Ketarim</i> – Crowns, it is impossible for them to become inter-included whatsoever.
This is because each one is completely different from the other, and nothing of its opposite can be found in it altogether.
An example [of this] is the essential aspect of goodness which is in the essence of the soul of a good person, and is called “The depth of goodness.” [In no way can it compromise] with the essential evil, which is called “the depth of evil.”
Only in true penitents – <i>Ba’alei T’shoova,</i> do we find that even the essence of evil has been transformed into goodness, so much so that,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yoma 86b</i> “their transgressions themselves become counted as merits.”
This is because they give themselves over with [complete] self-sacrifice to the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, who is even beyond the essential differences between <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) and <i>Gevurah</i> (Judgment).
Therefore, it is specifically through giving ourselves over to <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה, blessed is He, with complete self-sacrifice, that we are capable of praying and saying, “May it be desirable before You,” meaning, in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He etc.
Similarly, [regarding the thirteen qualities of mercy, it states],<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6</i> “And <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה passed before him and proclaimed, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, Benevolent and Gracious God etc.,” [thus] transforming even <b>essential</b> judgment into kindness, as will be explained concerning the matter of the “Thirteen Fixtures of the Beard.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yod-Gimel Tikkunei Dikna</i></i> This will suffice for those of understanding.
(This [sub-division and inter-inclusion] comes about by means of the aspect of the <i>Kav V’Chut</i> – Line and Thread, which possesses [something] of the power of the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, literally.
This is in accordance to the statement of our Sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Pardes Rimonim, Shaar 32 (<i>Shaar HaKavanah</i>), Chapter 2, citing Sifrei.</i> “[One must pray] to Him [alone], and not to His qualities,” not even to His essential qualities. All this will be further explained, with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. This will suffice for those of understanding.)

Chapter 23

[We] now [must understand] the aspect of <i>Keter</i> [more] particularly, [to understand] how it is the aspect of an intermediary.
In its inner aspect it possesses something of the last level of the Emanator, while in its external aspect it is the root and head of the Emanated, as stated in <i>Etz Chayim.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 42 (<i>Shaar Drushei ABY”A</i>), Chapter 1.</i>
Moreover, as known, the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> are separate and exalted and do not become invested within the emanated.
This is [the meaning of the words,]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See the liturgy of the morning blessings of the <i>Shema</i>.</i> “[The King who alone is exalted…] who transcends the days of the world.”
Because of this it is called “<i>Atik Yomin</i> – The Ancient of Days.” [<i>Atik</i>] shares the same three letter root as “<i>HaMa’atik Hareem</i> – Who <b>removes</b> Mountains.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 9:5</i> [In other words, <i>Atik Yomin</i>] is <b>removed</b> from the days of the world. Now, all this is well known.
Now, we must understand this in a manner of particulars, since <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i> are considered to be one, except that in general, the aspect of <i>Atik Yomin</i> is considered to be the end of the World of the Unlimited One, whereas the aspect of <i>Arich Anpin</i> is the root and beginning of the Emanated [worlds], as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 42 (<i>Shaar Drushei ABY”A</i>), Chapter 1.</i>
As known, the explanation of these matters is that these [two levels of <i>Keter</i>] are the aspects of pleasure (<i>Ta’anug</i>) and desire (<i>Ratzon</i>).
Now, we observe that within every desire there is a pleasure, and if not for the pleasure there would be no desire for the thing at all.
This is like the desire for wealth or honor. If not for the pleasure of [wealth or honor], he would have no desire for them at all.
Therefore, seemingly, pleasure is the inner aspect of desire.
However, we also observe the opposite, that if there is no desire there is no pleasure.
That is, he will have no pleasure whatsoever from something he does not desire. If so, desire is inner to pleasure.
What we see is that the one cannot exist without the other, because desire cannot exist without pleasure, and pleasure cannot exist without desire.
According to this, we must say that the two are one, because it is only when they bound together as one, that [<i>Keter</i>] exists.
All this [holds true] whether it is the simple essential pleasure and desire, or whether it is a composite pleasure and desire that the soul spreads forth and is drawn after, even though it is not of [the soul’s] essence, but is [rather] a separate thing from it.
Generally, we see that the nature of the soul is to be drawn after something that is pleasurable, to the point that its entire essence could be drawn after [it] and included in it.
[This is] like a composite pleasure for a specific [thing], which is separate [from the essence], such as honor, wealth, insight, or the emotional [traits] of kindness, judgment, conquest and self-aggrandizement, or the like.
[This is true of] anything that the soul craves, such as lusting for all worldly pleasures, and the like.
Although none of these [desires] are in an aspect of an essential <i>Heyulie</i> pleasure, and it is only that the soul is drawn after them and lusts for them, nonetheless, from this we see that the essence of the soul is in an aspect of a <i>Heyulie</i> of pleasure.
It is for this reason that it is drawn to composite pleasures and flees from pain, which is the opposite of pleasure.
These [two, pleasure and pain,] are two lines that are equally counterbalanced, literally.
Commensurate to the spreading forth of the soul to become filled with light from pleasurable things, so will its light become completely diminished and withdrawn by pain and anguish.
From this we see that the essence of its being is pleasure.
However, the principal [proof for this] is from the fact that it will flee and become withdrawn due to pain.
This is a greater proof [of this phenomenon].
It is for this reason that the early Kabbalists decreed and stated that pleasure is considered to be of the essence of the soul, and they stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 2:2</i> “There is nothing higher than pleasure.”
However, this is not [entirely] true. Rather, the essence of the soul becomes <b>filled</b> with great pleasure, and its entire essence is drawn after it, to the point that it may expire when it is almost entirely drawn into it. This is like [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 84:3</i> “my soul expires etc.”
The reverse is likewise true, that it will expire and its light will become completely and absolutely diminished by the intensity of extreme pain [or anguish], as known.
Now, an even clearer proof [of this] is from what we observe regarding even the particular powers of the soul; that it is mainly the pleasure in a particular power that establishes its existence at all times.
For example, [regarding] the power of the quality of kindness; although it is essential and natural in the nature of [of a person who is] good to bestow goodness, [nonetheless,] its principal existence [comes about from] the pleasure, in that he takes pleasure in influencing goodness.
The true existence of his good nature is that by nature he takes great pleasure in [bestowing] goodness, to the point that the main vitality of his soul comes about through the pleasure [that he gets from doing acts of] goodness and kindness.
The reverse is true of someone who is cruel by nature. This only means that his entire vitality is the pleasure [that he gets] from doing evil and cruelty, as known.
Likewise, the primary existence of the quality of Victory (<i>Netzach</i>) is the immense pleasure [that he gets], to the point that the entire vitality of his soul is drawn into being victorious over his fellow.
Should he not be victorious, he may [actually] become ill.
Similarly, this is the case with each and every particular quality, including Insight (<i>Chochmah</i>) and Desire (<i>Ratzon</i>).
Their principal existence and source is the pleasure [in them], as is clearly observable that without the pleasure in conceptualization, a person will not have the power to innovate any insight.
This is in accordance with the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 138a - Rabbi Yitzchak the son of Rabbi Yossi was traveling from Kaputkia to Lud. He encountered Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yitzchak said to him, “Say that our associates, the Sages of the Mishnah, should be awakened to this matter; that the <i>Yetzer Hara</i> (lust) should be banished from the world, except during the time of marital relations.” [Rabbi Yehuda] answered him, “By your life! The <i>Yetzer Hara</i> (lust) is necessary for the world, just as rain [is necessary] for the world. If not for the <i>Yetzer Hara</i> (lust), there would be no pleasure in learning [Torah].”</i> “Were it not… for the pleasure in [Torah] study etc.”
[Moreover], as known regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 8:1</i> “A man’s wisdom illuminates his face,” that the “<i>Lachloochit</i> – Moisture” within which is the <i>Heyulie</i> for pleasure, is the source for the conceptualization of any concept.
However, it is only in regard to desire that we observe that without desire there cannot be pleasure. ]We find this phenomenon] even in all the particular qualities.
For example, if [a person] does not desire kindness or judgment, he will have no pleasure in them at all.
Similarly, if he does not desire to become intelligent, he will find no pleasure in [intellectual pursuits] at all.
Likewise, if he does not at all desire victory, he will have no pleasure in victory. [The same is true of] self-aggrandizement or all other worldly pleasures, such as wealth or honor and the like.
Without desire, there is no pleasure in them, whatsoever.
In other words, because this entire matter is that since the whole essence of the soul is drawn after the pleasure and desire, (for, [just as with pleasure,] the desire also draws forth the entire soul, to the point where it can expire because of its desire for something, as is known,) therefore, all its particular powers also [derive] their principal existence from the pleasure and the desire.
The absence of [pleasure and desire in any particular matter] is the pain of the matter, this being the opposite of pleasure.
If something [stands in] opposition to [his] desire, although, [in and of itself], it is not [necessarily] a painful thing, he will automatically be agonized by it.
For example, if he desires to love his enemy, he will delight in him.
On the other hand, if he no [longer] desires someone who he loves, he will be agonized by him.
Similarly, if he enjoys something that is hateful and damaging to him, he will desire it, or if he is pained by something that he loves, he will no [longer] desire it.
This is because desire and pleasure are one essence, and it is impossible to know which precedes [the other].
At times the one is internal and the other is external, while at [other] times the opposite [is true].
[However,] the one cannot be found without the other, for if there is no pleasure there is no desire, and if there is no desire there is no pleasure.
[This is the case] whether it is a simple [desire or pleasure] or whether it is a composite [desire or pleasure], as mentioned above. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 24

Now, to one who contemplates [how things are] above, the analogue for all that has been previously stated will be understood.
[That is, he will understand] how the aspect of the essence of the simple pleasure of the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One, as it is before <i>Tzimtzum,</i> which is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Emek HaMelech, Shaar Sha’ashuey HaMelech B’Atzmooto.</i> “the Delight of the King in Himself,” is literally an infinite aspect.
Moreover, [he will understand that] even the ten essential <i>Sefirot</i>, from <i>Keter</i> to <i>Malchut</i> of The Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), all [derive their existence] from the simple pleasure in His Essential Self.
By way of analogy, even the essential kindness of the [human] soul, [derives] its existence primarily from the pleasure [of it].
Nonetheless, in truth, the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is even beyond the aspect of simple pleasure.
However, it is drawn after and radiates within the aspect of pleasure, just as the essence of the [human] soul is drawn after pleasure.
It is for this reason that it was stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 2:4</i> “There is nothing higher than pleasure.”
For example, [vested] within the aspect of the desire for kindness of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה Essential Self, is the simple [essential] pleasure.
It is drawn forth and radiates greatly, until it descends and even comes into a separate matter.
This [separate matter] is the aforementioned aspect of the Primal Pleasure and Desire (<i>Ta’anoog V’Raton HaKadoom</i>) that follows the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, to become the source for the [entire] chaining down of the worlds of <i>ABY”A</i>.
It descends [further], to the point that it is drawn down to the very end of everything, such as even the most final particular of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> – Emanation.
This is [understood] by way of the aforementioned analogy of the pleasure that exists to give being to the [emotional] quality of Victory (<i>Netzach</i>), and the like.
This then, is the [meaning] of the statement in <i>Etz Chayim</i>, that <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin,</i> which are the pleasure and the desire, are one entity, (and they are called the “three heads which are engraved, one within the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Zuta</i>) 288a. Also see Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i>) Shaar 13, Chapter 2.]</i> Sometimes one [pleasure] is internal [and sometimes desire is internal] etc., as mentioned previously.) and that the one cannot be without the other.
[<i>Keter,</i> which is the pleasure and desire, is] invested within each and every <i>sefirah,</i> [even] in the most particular of particulars, for without it, it can have no existence at all, as previously explained at length.
Moreover, it [also] encompasses them all.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amirei Admor HaZaken, HaKtzarim, page 492. See also, Zohar II (<i>Ra’ayah Mehemnah</i>) 42b, and introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a.</i>
(This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere with the analogy of the ten pits which are dug in succession. The [water in the] first is drawn into each [subsequent] pit etc. Likewise, it states in the Zohar, “He made a big vessel, [like a person who makes a big excavation, which becomes filled with the water that comes out of a spring… He then made a small vessel, which is the letter <i>Yod,</i> which became filled with it from the source (<i>Keter</i>), and He called it a spring flowing with <i>Chochmah</i> - Insight.] Through it, He called Himself, ‘<i>Chacham</i> – Wise’, [and the vessel He called <i>Chochmah</i> - Insight.]” Similarly, it states, “You brought out ten ‘<i>Tikkunim</i> – Vessels’ and called them ten <i>sefirot</i> etc.”)
This is because the aspect of <i>Atik Yomin</i> is considered to still be a part of the World of The Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim<i>,</i> (<i>Shaar Drushei ABY”A</i>) Shaar 42, Chapter 1. See also Shaarei Teshuvah of the Mittler Rebbe, pg. 104.</i>
This is because the World of The Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) is considered to continue until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, which is the aspect of the “letters” of the end action that arose in the aforementioned Primal Thought and Desire (<i>Machshava V’Ratzon HaKadoom</i>).
It is [these “letters,” which are] the last level of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, that become the <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which is the aspect of the revelation of the light of the pleasure from the aforementioned concealed pleasure and Primal Desire (<i>He’elem Ha’Oneg V’Ratzon HaKadoom</i>).
Therefore, even <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i>, and the [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Chochmah, Binah</i> and the emotions that are within it, are all considered to be of the end of the World of The Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>).
However, [this is not the case] with <i>Arich Anpin</i>, which is the aspect of the revelation of the desire that comes because of the pleasure.
Because [the desire] is drawn to spread forth below, it is called the beginning and root of the Emanations, which refers to the ten <i>sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>, both generally and particularly.
It is for this reason that the aspect of <i>Keter</i> is generally called an intermediary aspect, which possesses something of the last level of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, but is the beginning of the Emanated.
Because the lights of the Emanated are in an aspect of “the revelation of the concealed,” they therefore are in an aspect of separateness from the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, as previously explained (in chapter nineteen<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew text it says (chapter 12), but it is a typo which should say (chapter 19), as corrected above.</i>).
By way of analogy, this is like the emotions of <i>Chessed</i> or <i>Gevurah</i> for a separate thing, which come from the power of the qualities of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of the Essential Self.
Nevertheless, it is the aspect of the pleasure and desire which comes from the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, that vests within everything in order to constantly give them existence, as mentioned previously.
This is because, the source of this pleasure and desire is in the Essential Self of the light of The Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, and is called “the Delight of the King in Himself” (<i>Sha’ashoo’ei HaMelech B’Atzmo</i>).
This is similar to the [aforementioned] analogy of the soul, which is drawn after every pleasure, which is proof that the pleasure fills its light.
If so, then this itself is the reason that it is from the particular pleasure within each of the particular [emanations of] lights, that they primarily [derive] their existence.
[This is true] even until the aspect of <i>Malchut,</i> which is the [quality of] Dominion.
Were it not for the pleasure in it, it would have no existence.
The absence of the light of the pleasure [for something] equals the absence of the light of its existence. This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, all the above is only in a general manner.
In a manner of particulars, however, it is only the aspect of the first three [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Atik Yomin</i> that are considered to be [part] of the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
On the other hand, the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> of [<i>Atik Yomin</i>] become invested within the “<i>Gulgulta</i> – Skull” of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
<i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) of <i>Atik Yomin</i> [vests] within the “<i>Gulgulta</i> – Skull” [of <i>Arich Anpin</i>], <i>Gevurah</i> [of <i>Atik Yomin</i> vests] within “<i>Mocha Stima’ah</i> – the Hidden Brain” [of <i>Arich Anpin</i>] etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim<i>,</i> (<i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i>), Shaar 13, Ch. 6-7.</i>
This then, is the meaning of [the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See the liturgy of the <i>Yotzer</i> blessing of the morning <i>Shema</i> recital.</i> “The King who alone is exalted], who transcends the days of the world.”
This is because the coming into being of the desire from the pleasure is primarily from the aspect of the emotions of the pleasure, as known.
For example, <i>Chessed</i> (kindness) of the pleasure [vests within <i>Keter</i> of the desire].
By way of analogy, when a person is in a state of pleasure during the joy of his son’s wedding, or the like, he will then bestow goodness and abundant kindness upon everyone.
[This is] because of the pleasure that uplifts his soul (for the aforementioned reason).
During such a time, he may be aroused to grant every desire.
In other words, even a desire for judgment may be overturned to kindness.
This [overturning of the desire from <i>Chessed</i> to <i>Gevurah</i>] is dependent upon the aspect of the [essential] point of desire, which is higher than the “hidden reason for the desire” (<i>Ta’am Kamoos LaRatzon</i>) that divides into <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> – kindness and judgment.
This then, is an analogy through which one may understand how the aspect of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> vests within the “<i>Gulgulta</i> – Skull” [of <i>Arich Anpin</i>].
Now, the aspect of <i>Gevurah,</i> which is judgment, and is the opposite of pleasure, is what vests within “<i>Chochmah Stima’ah</i> – the Hidden Wisdom” of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, which is the “hidden reason for the desire” (<i>Ta’am Kamoos LaRatzon</i>).
This is the <b>precision</b> of the desire, that it should be a particular way, and not in any other way.
This is in accordance with what is written in books of Kabbalah,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim<i>,</i> (<i>Shaar Arich Anpin</i>) Shaar 13, Chapter 6.</i> that the early [Kabbalists] decreed and stated that <i>Chochmah</i> is an aspect of judgment.
This is because, when desire comes according to the dictates of <i>Chochmah</i>, it comes with precision and restriction that it should be like this and not like that.
For this reason, there are many judgments in the laws of the Torah, since the Torah comes out of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה upper wisdom-<i>Chochmah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II 62a; 85a; (<i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>) 121a; Zohar III 81a; 182a, 261a.</i>
In contrast, the radiance of the thirteen qualities of mercy is from [a level] higher than the <i>Chochmah</i> of the desire, and can [therefore] “pardon iniquity.”
Certainly [this is the case in regard to] the aspect of the first three <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which are not invested in the Emanated.
This is the aspect of the pleasure as it is within Himself.
As of yet, no desire whatsoever has been born of it, except that all desires are destined to come from it.
It is considered to be part of the general essence of the simple pleasure (<i>HaTa’anoog HaPashoot</i>).
That is, it is from the aspect of the source of all pleasures in the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 36:10</i> “With you is the source of life,” that is, the source of all the pleasures [within] the Primal Desire [for Creation] (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom</i>).
In the general totality [of the chaining down] it this called<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 128a</i> “<i>Atika D’Atikin</i> – The Ancient of the Ancients.”
[However, more particularly] it is called “<i>Atik Yomin</i> – The Ancient of Days,” as stated in Daniel,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel 7:9</i> “And <i>Atik Yomin</i> sat etc.” [<i>Atik –</i> Ancient] is a term of antiquity, which [indicates] the aspect of the eternity of the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, as He comes to radiate within the chaining down of the line and thread.
However, in regard to His actual Essential Being [it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 16b</i>] “Is there old age before the Holy One blessed be He!?”
This is in accordance with what is stated elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II 134a; See also Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim, Vol. 1, pg. 224; Na”Ch<i>,</i> pg. 226; Also see the Opening Gateway (<i>Petach HaShaar</i>) to Imrei Binah of the Mittler Rebbe, translated as The Gateway to Understanding.</i> regarding the matter of the word “<i>Va’ed</i> – Forever” (ועד), which through a permutation of letters equals “<i>Echad</i> – One” (אחד), referring to the simple [Oneness] Himself.
For, when the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, who [even] transcends the time of “<i>Yemei Kedem</i> – the Preceding Days,” radiates within time, then time too becomes eternal and is then called “<i>Atik Yomin</i> – the Ancient of Days.” This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 25

We must now understand the details of the matter of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> – Emanation.
In other words, [we must understand] the descent of the light from the externality of <i>NeHi”Y</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netzach, Hod</i> and <i>Yesod</i>.</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> into <i>Abba</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As mentioned previously, when referring to the <i>Partzuf</i> – The complete Stature of <i>Chochmah</i> or <i>Binah</i>, they are referred to as <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> – Father and Mother. The reason they are called “Father” and “Mother” is because it is <i>Chochmah</i>, the “Father,” which provides the seminal flash of insight, which is subsequently developed in <i>Binah</i>, the “Mother.” (This unification gives birth to offspring, i.e., the emotions and actions, as will be explained later.)</i> and <i>Imma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Also see Likkutei Biurim (R’ Hillel Paritcher), chapter 25.</i>
[Now,] sometimes it states<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim<i>,</i> (<i>Shaar Abba V’Imma</i>) Shaar 14, Chapter 1. See also Imrei Binah (of Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch) Shaar HaTefilin pg.116c.</i> that the “Arms”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of the <i>Arich Anpin</i>.</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> vest within <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.
(However, the statement<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 249. See also, Zohar II (<i>Idra D’Mishkena</i>) 122b.</i> that “The head of the King is fixed within <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>” refers to the “head” of <i>Arich Anpin</i> [within] which <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> are affixed. [That is to say,] <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> [is vested] within the “<i>Gulgulta</i> – Skull,” [i.e., <i>Keter</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>] etc., as previously explained.)
[However,] sometimes it states<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III 289b; See also Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 5.</i> that <i>Abba</i> suckles from the eighth “<i>Mazal</i>” [which is] “<i>Notzer</i>,” and <i>Imma</i> [suckles] from the thirteenth “<i>Mazal</i>” [which is] “<i>VeNakeh</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">"8 There are thirteen qualities of Mercy which <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה revealed to Moshe. (Exodus 34:6-7) They are:<br>1. <i>E-L</i> - Benevolent God<br>2. <i>Rachum</i> - Compassionate<br>3. <i>V'Chanun</i> - and Gracious<br>4. <i>Erech</i> - Long (slow)<br>5. <i>Apayim</i> - Suffering (to anger)<br>6. <i>V'Rav Chesed</i> - and Abounding in Kindness<br>7. <i>V'Emet</i> - and Truth<br>8. <i>Notzer Chesed</i> - He Preserves Kindness<br>9. <i>L'Alaphim</i> - for two thousand generations<br>10. <i>Noseh Avon</i> - Pardoning Iniquity<br>11. <i>VaPeshah</i> - and Transgression<br>12. <i>V'Chata'a</i> - and Sin<br>13. <i>V'Nakeh</i> - and He Cleanses.<br>These “thirteen qualities of mercy” are often referred to as “the thirteen fixtures of the beard of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.” The eighth and thirteenth qualities, “<i>Notzer</i>” and “<i>V’Nakeh</i>,” are referred to as “<i>Mazalot</i>.” The root of the word “<i>Mazal-</i>מזל” is “<i>Nozel-</i>נוזל” which means “to flow down.” These two are called “the upper <i>Mazal</i> and the lower <i>Mazal</i>,” because influence flows down from them to the intellectual <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, as will be explained."</i>
Now, as known regarding the matter of the “<i>Ko’ach Mah</i> – the Power of What”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Ra’aya Mehemnah</i>) 28a, 34a.</i> (כח מה) that <i>Chochmah</i> – Insight (חכמה), is<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28:12</i> “found from nothing,” and is in an aspect of “Nothing – <i>Ein</i>.”
[In contrast,] <i>Binah</i> - Comprehension is called “Something – <i>Yesh</i>.”
The light and influence of the “Nothingness” (<i>Ein</i>) of <i>Chochmah</i> – Insight, radiates and is drawn into the aspect of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>.
That is, [there is a transition] from the intangible “nothing” (<i>Ein</i>) to the tangible “something.”
Moreover, [<i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> – Insight and Comprehension] are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 56a; Zohar III 4a</i> “The two lovers who never separate” [about which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Zuta</i>) 290b</i>] “They dwell as one.”
This is the aspect of the “point” of <i>Chochmah</i> – Insight, that flashes like a lightning bolt from that which is above the intellect. (In common language [this is called] “understanding.”)
In other words, [it flashes] from the potential power to conceptualize (<i>Koach HaMaskeel</i>), which is called “The Hidden Insight” – <i>Chochmah Steema’a</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>. [This potential to conceptualize] is called “the Concealed Insight – <i>Chochmah HaNe’elama</i>.” It is the source that brings forth all intellect from “nothingness,” and is called “<i>Maskeel</i>,” as known.
This then, is the explanation of the statement that the light of <i>Abba</i> suckles from the eighth “<i>Mazal</i>” [which is] “<i>Notzer</i>.”
The letters [of the word “<i>Notzer</i>-נוצר” may are the same as the letters of the word] “pipe-<i>Tzinor</i>-צנור.” [That is,] it is like a thin pipe.
Similarly, the aspect of the “<i>Sa’arot</i> – Hairs” of the eighth “<i>Mazal</i>” is the growth aspect of the aforementioned potential power to conceptualize (<i>Koach HaMaskeel</i>).
That is, it sprouts forth all kinds of concepts from “nothingness.”
Now, the development (suckling) [of this seminal flash], that is, the growth of the brain of <i>Abba</i> (Insight) and the growth of the brain of <i>Imma</i> (Comprehension), comes from the thirteenth “<i>Mazal</i>,” which is “<i>VeNakeh</i>.”
These two “<i>Mazalot</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is the plural of the word “<i>Mazal</i>.”</i> the upper “<i>Mazal</i>” and the lower “<i>Mazal</i>,” are the roots of the [intellectual] brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.
This is to say that in the potential power to conceptualize itself, there is a root for the development of the brain of understanding (<i>Chochmah</i>) and a root for the development of the brain of grasp and comprehension (<i>Binah</i>).
These [two, <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>] are called “the brain of <i>Abba</i>” and “the brain of <i>Imma</i>,” as known.
Now, just as the aspect of the brain of <i>Binah,</i> which is the brain of grasp and comprehension, receives from the aspect of the “nothingness” of the brain of <i>Chochmah,</i> so too, in their source, there is a unification of the two “<i>Mazalot</i>” of “<i>VeNotzer</i>” and “<i>VeNakeh</i>.”
It is known that although the “<i>Mazalot</i>” are called “<i>Sa’arot</i> – Hairs,” that only break forth and come out from the aspect of the excess of the “Hidden Brain” of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, nonetheless, their [true] source is from the essence of the “<i>Gulgulta</i> – Skull.”
[This is to say that their source] is higher than the innerness of the “Hidden Brain” itself.
It is for this reason that they burst forth in an aspect of excess.
This is analogous to the bursting forth of steam from the [pressure] of a tightly sealed [pot].
For example, when the potential power for intellect greatly overwhelms the [power of] <i>Chochmah,</i> there is a fallout of excess [insight] from <i>Chochmah</i> [into <i>Binah</i>, that is, from insight into comprehension]. The source of this excess is higher than the actual light of the intellect itself.
It is for this reason that it states, “The excess of the Upper <i>Chochmah</i> is Torah,” specifically in praise [of the Torah], as explained elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Imrei Binah (of Rabbi Dov Ber of Lubavitch), Shaar HaKri’at Shma<i>,</i> page 57a and elsewhere.</i>
Likewise, this is the reason for the greatness of the thirteen qualities of mercy, which are called “the thirteen fixtures of the beard [of <i>Arich Anpin</i>]” that come out of the excess of the “Hidden Brain-<i>Mocha Steema’a</i>.”
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 34:6</i> “And <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה passed before him and proclaimed, ‘<i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה.’”
This is higher than the “Hidden Brain-<i>Mocha Steema’a</i>,” which is called the “hidden reasoning and wisdom for the concealed desire” and is also called “The intellect that is hidden from all contemplation” or “the wonders of <i>Chochmah</i>.”
According to this, when it states that the light of <i>Abba</i> suckles from the [eighth] “<i>Mazal</i>,” this is actually [from] higher than the “Hidden <i>Chochmah</i>” itself.
It is for this reason that it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 134a</i> “Everything is dependent upon <i>Mazal</i>, even the <i>Sefer Torah</i> (Torah Scroll) in the <i>Heichal-</i>sanctuary,” which refers to the unification of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> below.
[This is] the [flash of the] “point” of <i>Chochmah</i> in the chamber of <i>Binah</i>, from “nothing to something,” as mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Zohar 6a. Also see Zohar II 180a</i>
The [flash of insight from <i>Chochmah</i> to <i>Binah</i>] is what is meant by,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer Yetzirah, 1:1</i> “Book-<i>Sefer</i>-ספר” and “Story-<i>Seepoor</i>-ספור,” which is called “the <i>Sefer Torah</i> (Torah Scroll) in the <i>Heichal</i>-sanctuary,” as known.
Now, this is much higher than the statement that <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> enclothe the “Arms” of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
Moreover, this is certainly [higher] than the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> as they are vested within <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.
[This is so] because, as known, the aspect of the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Arich Anpin,</i> are only the aspects of the emotional [<i>Sefirot</i> of] <i>ChaGa”T</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chessed, Gevurah</i> and <i>Tiferet</i>.</i> etc.
These are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 14:31, 13:9. (<i>“HaYad HaGedolah</i> – The Great Hand” is <i>Chessed</i> and “<i>HaYad HaChazakah</i> – The Mighty Hand” is <i>Gevurah</i>.)</i> “the Great Hand and the Mighty Hand,” and in the Zohar they also are called by the term,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III 249b – “<i>Toorey D’Chashoocha –</i> Mountains of Darkness” and “<i>Toorey D’Nehorah</i> – Mountains of Light.”</i> “The Mountains of Darkness.”
(This is in accordance with what is known, regarding the teaching, “This gazelle goes to the mountains of darkness and gathers her food from there.” This refers to how <i>Malchut</i> goes up to <i>ChaGa”T</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, as it states, “The ark was uplifted… in the seventh month” which refers to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, during which <i>Malchut</i> goes up to “<i>Harei Ararat</i>” which is [translated by the Targum as] ‘the mountains of darkness.’”)
These are like mountains that are [so] high that the light of the sun does not shine upon them.
In other words, this is the aspect of the emotions of the desire, which are higher than revealed intellect and reasoning.
In contrast, the emotions that are according to intellect and reasoning are called, “the Mountains of Light,” since <i>Chochmah</i> is called “Light.”
However, the emotions of the desire are called “the Mountains of Darkness,” [for they are] emotions that are hidden in the desire.
[Now,] their source is from the aforementioned aspect of the “Hidden Wisdom – <i>Chochmah Stima’ah</i>,” which is called “The Concealed Insight<i>-Ta’aloomot Chochmah</i>.”
This is the matter of the “Hidden Reasoning for the Desire,” from which the two lines of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> (Kindness and Judgment) of the desire divide.
This then is [the meaning of] the statement that the “Arms” of <i>Arich Anpin</i> vest within <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.
This is as we clearly observe that the root for intellectual reasoning [leaning] towards kindness and merit, exists because of the quality of <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) and the great love within one’s desire.
This is similar to “a bribe, which blinds [the eyes of the wise] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 16:19, also see Exodus 23:8</i>
Because of the bribe, he has a love in [his] desire [towards this person].
He will therefore find justification, and his intellectual powers will be caused to lean from [a judgment of] guilt to merit.
This is similar to [the Talmudic<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli Ketubot 105b</i> account of] Rabbi Yishmael, who “took a basket of fruits… and said [to himself], ‘If he wishes he could justify [himself] like this etc.’”
[From the above] we find that the emotions [of <i>Arich Anpin</i>] vest within the innerness of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, and that <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are “worn” on the outside [like a garment].
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 8:14.</i> “I am <i>Binah</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>” of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, “is mine,” as explained in <i>Etz Chayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, (<i>Shaar Abba V’Imma</i>) Shaar 14, Ch. 2.</i> This will suffice for those of understanding.
Now, as the levels descend further, the intellectual [<i>Sefirot</i>] of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, only receive from the aspects of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
That is, [these <i>Sefirot</i>] bring the influence of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> down.
Similarly, in various places [the <i>Sefirot</i> of] <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> are called<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction of Tikkunei Zohar 17a; Also see Shaarei Orah of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as Gates of Light, Shaar 3 &amp; 4.</i> “the Righteous Scales,” even in reference to the lower emotions that go according to the light of the intellect.
However, the emotions of the desire, which is called “<i>Arich Anpin</i> – the <b>Long</b> Countenance,” are unlimited, like the desire itself, which is unlimited.
Therefore, even the aspects of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> are in an unlimited aspect.
This is as known regarding the explanation of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:7</i> “The remembrance of Your abounding goodness,” that it refers to the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
This is likewise the case in the verses, “In Your great goodness”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See the liturgy of the Morning prayers.</i> and “If he will redeem you, good”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 3:13</i> and “Great goodness for the house of Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 63:16</i> and the like.
In contrast, the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of “<i>Zeir Anpin</i> – the Small Countenance” is the aspect of the emotions that are born of <i>Binah</i> – Comprehension.
They are in an aspect of great immaturity.
This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 92:13</i> “The righteous [shall flourish] like the palm tree,” [that this] refers to the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
[In contrast, the continuation of the verse is,] “He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon,” which refers to the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>, [which is in an infinite aspect.]
Similarly, it states regarding King Solomon,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Kings I 5:13</i> “He spoke [of trees,] from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop [that springs out of the wall].” [The hyssop] refers to the aspect of the smallness of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as it is in <i>Malchut</i>, which is called<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 228b and Zohar II 133a.</i> “a wall.”
(As is known in the [Kabbalistic] intentions of [the prayer], “Amen, May His Great Name be blessed,” that “His Name” (<i>Shmo-</i>שמו-346) has the same numerical value as “Desire” (<i>Ratzon</i>-רצון-346). [Moreover,] “His Great Name” refers to the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> and <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, in that they should be “drawn down” into <i>Abba, Imma</i>, <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> and <i>Nukvah,</i> so that the “right” overpowers the “left.” This is like [the statement,] “In Your great goodness, let your fierce anger turn away from Your people etc.” This will suffice for those of understanding.)

Chapter 26

We must now understand the further descent of the light [as it is] within the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (Insight and Comprehension) themselves.
[That is, we must understand] how the inner aspect of the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (Insight and Comprehension) receive [influence] from <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> (Kindness and Sternness of Desire).
Moreover, [we must] certainly [understand] as they ascend to receive from the <i>Mazalot</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, as mentioned previously.
[Finally, we must understand] the external aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Netzach, Hod</i> and <i>Yesod</i>.</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (the gut emotions of Insight and Comprehension) which vest within the “brains” of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> (Intellect of the Emotions), as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Drushei HaNekudot</i>) Shaar 8 Ch. 2; Shaar 16 (<i>Holadat Av”A V’Zu”N</i>) Ch. 7.</i>
Now, the [explanation of this] matter is known, that the inner aspects of the brains of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are likened to <i>Shabbat</i> and <i>Yom Tov</i>.
This is because <i>Shabbat,</i> which is referred to as,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 31:14, 15. See Zohar III 95a; Also see Pri Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Mikra Kodesh</i>) Shaar 20, Ch. 1.</i> “<i>Kodesh</i> – Holy,” is [observed] through the pleasure of “<i>Chochmah</i> which is a thing unto itself.”
This is the aspect of the inner light of <i>Abba-</i>Insight (which is the innerness of <i>Atik Yomin</i> (Pleasure). This is the reason for the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 58:13</i> “And you shall <b>call</b> the <i>Shabbat</i> pleasure,” as explained elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim<i>,</i> Seder Seudah Shelishit, pg. 204c.</i> at length, regarding the matter of the three meals of <i>Shabbat</i>.)
<i>Yom Tov,</i> however, is refered to as,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 12:16; Leviticus 23:4</i> “<i>Mikra Kodesh</i> – It is called Holy,” [which is] an aspect of joy, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 113:9</i> “The mother of the children rejoices.”
[The “mother”] refers to the aspect of the brains of <i>Imma</i> [Comprehension] which receives from <i>Abba</i> [Insight], because the cessation [from work] of <i>Shabbat</i> is also within <i>Chochmah</i>.
That is to say, it is the inner aspect of <i>Abba</i>, which is the aspect of the “<i>Koach Mah –</i> The Potential Power of What (כח מה).”
[This is] the “[intangible] nothingness” of <i>Chochmah</i>, before it spreads forth to become a “[tangible] something” within the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>.
Similarly, <i>Binah,</i> in its inner aspect, is the depth of the comprehension (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>), for, as known, there is the “nothingness” (<i>Ayin</i>) of <i>Chochmah</i> in <i>Binah</i>, and there is [the somethingness (<i>Yesh</i>) of] <i>Binah</i> in <i>Chochmah</i>.
This is the meaning of [the statement],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:4</i> “Be understanding in wisdom and wise in understanding,” which [refers to] the aspect of the inner unification of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.
This is not the case, however, with the external flow of the influence of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, that is, their <i>ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i> etc., such as the emotional [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Chochmah</i>, which are called the aspect of the six directions of <i>Abba</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The six directions of Abba (<i>Vav Kitzvin D’Abba</i>) refer to the three emotions, <i>Chesed, Gevurah</i> and <i>Tiferet</i> and the three gut emotions, <i>Netzach</i>, <i>Hod</i> and <i>Yesod</i>, of Insight<i>-Chochmah.</i></i>
For example [this is] the [quality of] <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> (Kindness of Insight)<i>,</i> which is the intellectual power that leans towards kindness, or the different intellectual power [of <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>] that leans towards judgment.
These [in turn] radiate within <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Binah</i> (Kindness and Sternness of Comprehension).
That is, it comes into comprehension, with sound reasoning and explanation, either for merit or liability.
These are called the emotions of the comprehended intellect, before they are born as actual [heartfelt emotions] in and of themselves (as will be explained).
Now, when a person cannot find a reason in a [way of] comprehendible explanation [for his position], but is, nonetheless, incapable of conceding to the opposite [position] because of his intellectual leanings, this is an aspect of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Abba</i> (Kindness and Sternness of Insight), [as it is] before it radiates from the “nothingness” [of <i>Chochmah-</i>Insight] into the “somethingness” of <i>Binah</i>–Comprehension. (An example of this is the matter of [the Talmudic<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Beitza 6a</i> incident in which] “Rav kept silent etc.”)
([However, the statements,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Avot 3:13</i>] “Silence is a protective fence for wisdom” or<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Megillah 18a</i> “[If speech is worth one <i>Selah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>Selah</i> was an ancient monetary currency used during Talmudic times.</i>, then] silence is worth two,” refer to the sublimation of the “<i>Koach Mah</i> – The Potential Power of What” of <i>Chochmah</i>, which ascends to the source from which all wisdom comes, and brings out new insights from there. This [source] is called “<i>Chochmah Stima’ah</i> – The Hidden Wisdom,” as previously explained.)
Now, the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> (The gut emotions of Insight) is the aspect of the “scales” of intellect and insight, as to how this intellectual matter should come to be expressed. This is the aspect of “the kidneys that give counsel.”
(This is the matter of the strength of the intellect, which is called, “Strong Mindedness.”
Just as the legs have the strength to uphold the entire body, so too, the aspects of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Abba</i> uphold the “body” of the mind.
The reverse is true if he is not strong minded. He will easily fall [and retreat] from his logical reasoning, [and change his stance] from [judging something as being] liable to [being] meritorious, or from being impure to being pure etc.
The same principle applies to <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Imma</i>.)
In general, the brains of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> which are [heartfelt] emotions that are below intellect (as will be explained), come about from the enclothement of the aspect of the <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Abba</i> into the <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Imma</i>.
Now, the particular matters of the unifications of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> are well known.
[This refers to] whether [their unification] is in their inner aspect, for their own purpose, which is the [unification] of their first three [<i>Sefirot</i>] before they spread forth into the emotional [<i>Sefirot</i>], or whether they unify to bring about new “brains” for <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i>, which is only [the external unification of] <i>NeHi”Y</i>.
The [difference between these two unifications] is the [same as the] difference between <i>Shabbat</i> and the weekdays.
(In the <i>Shema</i> recital, the [inner] intention of [the words] “<i>HaShem</i> our God-<i>Hashem Elohei”nu-</i>יהו״ה אלהינ״ו” is the inner [unification] of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (Insight and Comprehension), from which [it follows that] “<i>Hashem</i> is One-<i>HaShem Echad</i>-יהו״ה אחד,” [which refers to] the unification of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> (Emotions and Speech [or actions]) as they receive an aspect of additional influence of new intellect, so that they may be able to give birth etc.
This is [brought about] by giving ourselves over to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, with complete self-sacrifice during the <i>Shema</i> recital. In contrast, when [one studies] Torah and [performs] the commandments without self-sacrifice, then <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> (Emotions and Speech [or Action]) only [receive] from an external unification of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> (Insight and Comprehension), as explained elsewhere.
An example [of the inner unification] is the matter of the ten martyrs who brought about an ascent of the “Feminine Waters-<i>Mayim Nukvin</i>” to the inner aspect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma,</i> specifically through giving their [actual] lives over to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, with complete self-sacrifice.)
(This [also] is the matter of the unification of the “upper <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,” and the unification of the “lower <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,” which are <i>Yisroel Saba</i> and <i>Tvunah</i>, as was explained at length in regard to the matter of <i>Binah</i> and <i>Tvunah</i>.
The aspect of <i>Yisroel Saba</i> is the six directions of <i>Abba</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the three emotions (<i>Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet</i>) and the three gut emotions (<i>Netzach, Hod, Yesod</i>) of the insight-<i>Chochmah.</i></i> and <i>Tvunah</i> is the six directions of <i>Imma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the three emotions (<i>Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet</i>) and the three gut emotions (<i>Netzach, Hod, Yesod</i>) of the comprehension-<i>Binah.</i></i>
These [two] are called “The lower <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.”
[However], there is another <i>Yisroel Saba</i> that is even higher than the “upper <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.”
This is the six directions of the “Hidden <i>Chochmah</i>” of <i>Arich Anpin</i> and [the higher] <i>Tvunah</i> is the six directions of <i>Binah</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See HaGahot Tzemach to Etz Chayim, (<i>Drush Igullim V’Yosher</i>) Shaar 1, Anaf 5.</i>
The source for the inner unification of the “upper <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,” involving their first three [<i>Sefirot,</i> as explained above], is drawn from the [unification of the higher <i>Yisroel Saba</i> and <i>Tvunah</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>].)
Now, when intellect is drawn down from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> to <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> in order to give birth to souls, it then is necessary for the unification of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> to be in the inner intellect, in their root within the two <i>Mazalot</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i>.
(This then, is the meaning of [the statement],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Mo’ed Katan 28a</i> “Children, [health, and livelihood] are dependent upon <i>Mazal</i>”).
This is as explained elsewhere, that this is the [inner] meaning of [the prayer,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See beginning of <i>Amidah</i> prayer. Also see Pri Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Ha’Amidah</i>), Shaar 9, Ch. 3.</i> “The Supernal God, who bestows good kindnesses, the Possessor of all, who remembers the kindnesses of the forefathers and brings a redeemer to their children’s children etc.”] The “Supernal God-<i>El Elyon</i>-א״ל עליון” refers to the ascent of the inner light of <i>Abba</i> (Insight) as it receives from the <i>Mazal</i> of “<i>Notzer</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה title God-<i>E”l-</i>א״ל is a title that relates to <i>Chochmah.</i> Therefore “The Supernal God-<i>E”l Elyon-</i>א״ל עליון” refers to the inner light of <i>Chochmah</i>-Insight as it ascends to receive from the <i>Mazal</i> of <i>Notzer</i> of <i>Arich</i>-Desire.</i>
Then, [the result of this is that] “He bestows good kindnesses” through the aspect of <i>Yesod</i>, which is called “The Possessor of all,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained later (in chapter thirty-six), <i>Yesod</i> is also called “<i>Kol</i>-All-כל,” since everything (i.e. all the preceding lights) gather in <i>Yesod</i> in order to spread forth as influence to the recipient.</i> to give birth to offspring through [the resulting unification of] <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i>.
This then, is the meaning of [the continuation of the words of the prayer], “He remembers the kindnesses of the forefathers and brings a redeemer to their children’s children.”
The analogy for this is well known. It is similar a person who is particularly outstanding in his [deep] insight [and wisdom]. Since he knows the concept to its depth, specifically to the very source of its inception, he is therefore capable of [bringing out] influence from it to someone who is of a much lesser [intellectual capacity than himself], even to a small child.
[This is to say that] he can make new combinations [to explain] how to conceptualize this concept, specifically not merely [explaining it] as it [already] is [in his own mind].
Furthermore, he is capable of formulating and giving rise to entirely new and different concepts, through this concept.
However, such is not the case in regard to a person who is not so exceptionally wise and who grasps the concept and wisdom merely as it is.
It is [difficult] enough for him to make the “breakthrough” and grasp it himself.
However, he will be incapable of “giving birth” to new insights from it altogether.
Certainly, he will be incapable of lowering it and “bringing down” the explanation of the concept, so that [even] a child could understand it.
[From all the above] we find that the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> (the gut emotions of Insight), which is the aspect of <i>Yesod</i>, that is, the power to influence a recipient, is specifically dependent on the potential power to conceptualize (<i>Ko’ach HaMaskeel</i>), which is the source from which all concepts are “hewn” from “nothing” to “something.”
This is likewise so in regard to the birth of souls from the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i>.
[The aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i>] cannot give birth [to new souls] unless there is additional [influence of] strength in the source of its intellect, from a much higher level than intellect.
This is the reason that for there to be a birth of souls through the unification of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, there must be [influence] from higher than the source of the intellect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>.
This is the aspect of the <i>Mazalot</i> of the “Hidden Wisdom” (<i>Chochmah Steema’a</i>) which is even higher than <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> itself, as previously explained.
This is also the reason for the inner unification of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> during the night of the “Holy <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>Shabbat Kodesh</i>).”
This is because [this unification] is to give birth to souls.
This is, therefore, specifically the time for the “marital relations of the Sages.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Zohar 14a; Also see Zohar II 136a &amp; 204b, and elsewhere.</i>
This is because they are Torah Scholars who are called “<i>Kodesh</i> – Holy” and the source of <i>Shabbat</i> is in the “upper <i>Kodesh</i> –Holiness,” which is the inner aspect of the light of <i>Abba</i>, as previously explained. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 27

Now, after having explained somewhat in a manner of particulars, about the matter of the lights of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> and their internal and external unifications, as previously explained, we must now explain the specifics of the matter of the lights of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which are called <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Yaakov</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, (<i>Shaar HaKelipot</i>) Shaar 48, Ch. 2 &amp; 3.</i>
[Moreover, we must explain] all the particulars of the unifications of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which are [either] called a union of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Leah</i> or a union of <i>Yaakov</i> and <i>Rachel</i> etc., as known.
However, we must first have an introductory understanding regarding the matter of Lights and Vessels (<i>Orot V’Keilim</i>), both generally and particularly.
Now, the explanation of the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 3b</i> [“He and His life force are one, He and His organs are one”], is known. [That is,] “He and His life force are one” refers to the lights (<i>Orot</i>), while “He and His organs are one” refers to the aspect of the vessels (<i>Keilim</i>).
Now, both generally and particularly speaking, the aspect of the lights of the ten <i>sefirot</i> is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:2 – “<i>Eser Sefirot Blimah</i>”</i> “Ten <i>sefirot</i> without what (<i>Bli Mah</i>),” that is, without “whatness.”
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> 17b.</i> “He is not of any of these qualities at all.”
It is solely because of the aspect of the vessels that they are in an aspect of a tangible existence.
This is the [meaning of the] statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a and 17b.</i> “He brought forth ten vessels which we call ten <i>Sefirot</i>… to show… and to conduct the worlds with them etc.”
Likewise, the fact that, in general, the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> are called by four names,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Divine names may be expanded by spelling out their individual letters as follows; <i>Alef</i>-אל"ף, <i>Beit</i>-בי"ת, <i>Gimmel</i>-גימ"ל etc. The letters <i>Hey</i>-ה and <i>Vav</i>-ו each have three possible spellings: ה"י, ה"א, ה"ה, and וי"ו, וא"ו, ו"ו. The Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה may therefore be expanded into several possible spellings depending on the variant spellings of the letters <i>Hey</i>-ה and <i>Vav</i>-ו.</i> <i>A”V-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G</i>-ס״ג-63<i>, Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 and <i>Ba”N</i>-ב״ן-52, [is only in regard to the aspect of the vessels].
[The name] <i>A”V-</i>ע״ב-72<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Etz Chayim</i> (<i>Shaar RaPa”Ch Nitzotzin</i>) <i>Shaar</i> 18, Chapter 2.</i> is an expansion [of the Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה] with <i>Yod’s</i>, and refers to <i>Chochmah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">That is, יו"ד ה"י וי"ו ה"י, expanded with <i>Yod’s</i>-י.

[The name] <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Leah V’Rachel</i>) Shaar 38, Ch. 1 and 2.</i> is [an expansion] with <i>Aleph’s-</i>א and refers to <i>Zeir Anpin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That is, יו"ד ה"א וא"ו ה"א, expanded with <i>Aleph’s</i>-א.

This is the name of 52-<i>B"AN</i>-ב"ן which is its numerical value. This name corresponds to <i>Malchut</i> (i.e., <i>Nukvah</i>).</i>
As known, in the terminology of the <i>Zohar,</i> the ten general <i>Sefirot</i> are only called,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 67b, and the commentaries there.</i> “The secret of the Holy Name.”
All this is specifically only in regard to the aspect of the vessels (<i>Keilim</i>), as known.
Now, the explanation of the matter is known, that in regard to the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 153a, and Zohar I 138a; Also see Zohar Chadash<i>, Ruth</i> 80a.</i> “There are three rulers above, the brain, the heart and the liver,” these are the three vessels for the <i>Nefesh, Ruach,</i> and <i>Neshamah</i>.
The <i>Neshamah</i> [vests] within the brain, the <i>Ruach</i> [vests] within the heart, and the <i>Nefesh</i> [vests] within the liver.
However, the aspects of the <i>Chayah</i> and <i>Yechidah</i> [of the soul] transcend the limitations of vessels.
Now, the aspect of the vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) is composed of a beginning, middle and end. [This is to say that] there is the inner [part] of the vessels, the middle [part] of the vessels, and the external [part] of the vessels.
[This is in accordance to] what is known regarding the matter of the “248 limbs of the King” which are the nine <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
[That is,] nine times nine equals eighty-one.
Then, three times eighty-one, corresponding to the three levels in the vessels – the beginning, middle, and end – equals two-hundred and forty-three.
[Now, with the addition of] the five Kindnesses (<i>Chassadim</i>) which spawn growth, it equals two-hundred and forty-eight.
This is the general matter of the vessels of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which are called “The body of the King.”
In addition [to the “organs”], “He prepared garments for them, from which souls for human beings’ issue forth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i>
[These “garments”] are the garments of thought, [speech and action], as will all be explained.
However, [regarding] the general explanation of the matter of lights and vessels, although there are many very different ways [to explain it], it may, nonetheless, generally [be understood as follows]: It is like the spiritual light and vitality (<i>Ohr V’Chayoot</i>) of the spiritual [power of] sight, as it vests and integrates in [a way of] physicality, in the physical substance of the eye, [thus creating] the aspect of physical sight.
Now, two aspects are [involved] in this: The first is a change of existence, from spiritual to physical.
[This is to say that] physical sight grasps physicality, which is not the case with the spiritual light of [the power of] sight.
This is similarly the case with the light of the spiritual potential power of intelligence, which integrates with the physicality of the vessel of the brain, to the point that it is called, <i>Hitchachmoot –</i> “Active Intellect.”
Likewise, [there is a change of existence] from the [spiritual] potential power to move, as it [vests] within actual physical movement.
So too, [there is a change of existence] from the spiritual potential power of growth, as it becomes integrated and vested in the actual physical growth of physical vegetation.
The second [aspect] is the matter of the limitation and measure of the substance of the vessel. [This is to say that] it is limited and quantified with [specific] measure.
An example [of this is that] physical sight [is only clear] up to sixty miles.
Similarly, [both] the matter of active [physical] intellect or physical movements, spread forth specifically with constraints and limitations, until their limited strength expires.
For example, the strength of the physical comprehension of the vessel of the brain diminishes and expires due to the limited capacity of the vessel.
Similarly, the physical power of movement of the strength of the arm will diminish and expire due to [strenuous] activity, or when lifting a heavy load and the like.
This is because of the limitation of the [physical] power to move.
(This is not the case with the essential spiritual potential power of movement, which has no limitation or cessation.
This is evidenced by [the fact that] in a sudden panic, a person may lift something which [under normal circumstances] is much heavier than his ability [to lift]. This comes from the aspect of the encompassing [lights of the soul], as known.)
Now, this is [the general principle] in every matter of “Substance and Form” (<i>Chomer</i> V’<i>Tzurah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Substance (<i>Chomer</i>) and Form (<i>Tzurah</i>) is another way of saying Vessel (<i>Keli</i>) and Light (<i>Ohr</i>).</i>
]This is to say[ that aside from the fact that the “substance” (<i>Chomer</i>) comes in [a way of] a change of existence, it also limits the “form” (<i>Tzurah</i>).
Nonetheless, the “substance” has a similarity and likeness to the “form,” such as the “substance” of the vessel of the eye [which is specifically suited] for sight, or the “substance” of the vessel of the brain [which is specifically suited] for thought, and the like.
However, the “substance” is made from the thickening and condensation<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The three-letter root of the word <i>Hagshamah-</i>הגשמה is <i>Geshem-</i>גשם which means condensation or materialization. Because of this the Hebrew word for rain is <i>Geshem-</i>גשם<i>.</i></i> of the spiritual “form,” from its lowest level.
For example, the power of physical growth comes about from the last level of the spiritual [power] of growth.
Similarly, the last level of the spiritual life force of the soul becomes vested within the [physical] blood, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 12:23</i> “For, the blood is the soul.”
Likewise, the last level of the light of the spiritual intellect, integrates with the “substance” of the vessel of the brain and the last level of the condensation of the spiritual [power] of sight, integrates with the “substance” of the vessel of the eye.
Because of this [phenomenon] we observe that the growth of the [physical] “substance,” always comes simultaneous to the growth of the [spiritual] “form,” literally as one.
For example, the developmental growth of the “substance” of the [physical] body is simultaneous to the developmental growth of the spiritual light and vitality of the “form,” such as [the fact that] the developmental growth and ability of the “substance” of the [physical] brain comes in proportion to the development of the light and form of the [spiritual] intellect, so that when a child matures and the light of his intellect develops spiritually, automatically, the ability of the vessel of his brain develops [as well].
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Job 32:7</i> “Days speak and many years teach wisdom.”
That is to say, the vessel becomes developed in proportion to the light, each and every day until the age of seventy, at which point a person reaches intellectual maturity, as known. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 28

Now, the analogue from all of the above analogies regarding the aspects of the three vessels of the brain, the heart and the liver, can be understood generally, as follows:
The light of <i>Chochmah</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>, as it is emanated from the Essential Light of the Emanator, is comparable to the light of the spiritual intellect itself, as it is drawn from the essential potential <i>Chochmah</i> power of the aspect of the essence of the soul.
It still is literally one with the source from whence it was hewn.
[This is] is similar to<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:7</i> “The flame [that is bound to the coal],” or like the aforementioned revelation of the desire from the essential [hidden] desire of the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
Now, although this is merely like an indicator or a color, (as explained before at the end of chapter nineteen regarding the matter of “He calls out the generations from the beginning,” that this refers to the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> which came out of the concealment of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, which is the revelation of the [general] desire in a separate thing,) nonetheless, they are called the “Ten <i>Sefirot</i> without whatness,”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:2 – “<i>Eser Sefirot Blimah</i>”</i> because they still are intangible.
This is because a color is also essential, since it is impossible to have an opposite color to the essence of a thing.
[An example of this is when] the color of [the inside of] an apple is white, which indicates its essential sweetness.
Likewise, although it is [coming forth] into a separate matter, nonetheless, the light of an intellect or desire that leans towards kindness, indicates the essence.
Therefore, [it is understood that] the existence of the lights of the ten <i>sefirot</i> [of <i>Atzilut</i>] comes from the aspect of the essential letters of the Emanator, [that is, <i>Adam Kadmon</i>].
An example of this is the name <i>A”V-</i>ע״ב-72 [יו״ד ה״י וי״ו ה״י] from which the aspect of the Light of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> comes into revelation.
This name indicates the essential <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
Likewise, the name <i>Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63 [יו״ד ה״י וא״ו ה״י] indicates the essential light of <i>Binah</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.
This is [true of all the names] <i>A”v-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63<i>,</i> [<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 and <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן-52] that <b>precede</b> the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of [the world of] Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>. They are [therefore] called, “The names of the Emanator.”
This is similar to how the last aspect of the spiritual Form (<i>Tzurah</i>) becomes bound to the beginning of the existence of the light and form within the substance of the vessel (<i>Keli</i>).
This is in accordance to what was previously explained regarding the,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 17:14</i> “blood which is the soul,” and [regarding] the spiritual power of growth, and [regarding] the eye and the brain etc.
However, the aspect of the Vessel (<i>Keli</i>) that limits the light of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is like the light of the intellect as it already is merged within the substance of the brain.
[In this case] the substance of the brain only receives from the “thickening” of the end of the light of the intellect.
Therefore, aside from the fact that there is a [profound] change of existence, it also limits [the light].
This is similar to the light of <i>Chochmah</i> as it vests within the brain, which is [then] called “<i>Chochmah Mocha</i> – Insight is the Brain.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Ra’ayah Mehemnah</i>) 235b; Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i>
It is then that because of the aspect of the vessel of <i>Chochmah,</i> it comes into the aspect of a tangible existence of intellect, which is called, “The conceptualization of a certain specific concept.”
The same [principle applies] to the spiritual emotions in the “Heart” and the spiritual <i>Nefesh</i> in the “Liver.”
This then, is the matter of the “Three rulers above.” These are the three general vessels for the <i>Nefesh, Ruach</i> and <i>Neshamah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of [the world of] Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>.
The <i>Neshamah</i>, which is the aspect of the intellectual <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, [vests] within the “Brain,” the <i>Ruach</i> [vests] within the “Heart,” [and the <i>Nefesh</i> vests within the “Liver”].
These [vessels] are the “letters” of the Lights of <i>Atzilut</i>, which [refers to] the matter of the four names, <i>A”v-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63<i>,</i> [<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 and <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן-52] of <i>Atzilut</i>.
These [four names] are called the vessels for the [light of the] ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which limit the light and restrain it, because the vessels are made from the “thickening” of the lights, as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim<i>,</i> (<i>Shaar Ha’Akoodim</i>) Shaar 6, Ch. 3.</i>
As known, this is called, “The somethingness of the Light,” as it appears in an aspect of a “something,” with tangible existence. This will suffice for those of understanding.
(We find that there are two types of names of <i>A”v-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63<i>,</i> [<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 and <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן-52] etc.
The first [set of names] is before [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> [within <i>Adam Kadmon</i>]. The second [set of names], which are the vessels that limit, is after [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>.
According to this, when a person directs his attention to the [external] names, his [actual] intention is [<b>really</b>] to the source of the lights.
For example, a person who directs his attention to the aspect of the name <i>A”V-</i>ע״ב-72 [יו״ד ה״י וי״ו ה״י]<i>,</i> the source of the light of <i>Chochmah</i> etc., automatically is [also] directing his attention to the vessel of <i>Chochmah</i>, causing it to be drawn down. This will suffice for those of understanding.
These are the [Kabbalistic] <i>Kavanot</i> (devotions or intentions) of the Names [of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה] during the eighteen blessings of the <i>Amidah</i> prayer.
This is because, the source of the [external] limiting vessels [which are the names of <i>Atzilut</i>] is from the names of <i>Atzmoot HaMa’atzeel</i>-The Essential Self of the Emanator, and the two [levels] are interdependent, as will be explained. This will suffice for those of understanding.)
This, then, is the meaning of the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> “[He made ten <i>Tikkunim</i> (fixings)] which we call ten <i>Sefirot</i>… to show… to conduct [the worlds] etc.,” because <i>Tikkunim</i> (Fixings) is the aspect of vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) for the Lights (<i>Orot</i>) of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>.
By way of analogy: a “fixing” for the eye, so that its physical sight may spread further, [may be accomplished] through the means of eyeglasses.
Likewise, the physical organ of the eye is the “fixing” through which the spiritual [power of] sight spreads forth, as explained elsewhere.
[It is] therefore [understood] that all aspects of the spreading forth of influence down, can only come about specifically through the vessels which limit.
For example, it is through the vessel of the brain, which grasps the intellectual concept, that [the concept may be] drawn down to arouse emotions in the heart or to be expressed to another person.
Similarly, it is through the means of the heart, which is the vessel for the spiritual light of love and kindness, that [this light] can come into the category of being influenced to a recipient.
It is [specifically] because of this that the [vessels] are called <i>Tikkunim</i> – Fixings, [because they “fix” the light] so that it can be drawn down from [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> to [the world of] <i>Briyah</i>.
In other words, it’s [sole purpose is] only “to show” etc.
On the other hand, from the aspect of the Essential Light of the Emanator, [the sefirot] are called “Ten <i>sefirot</i> without whatness,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:2 – “<i>Eser Sefirot Blimah</i>”</i> as explained before and as explained elsewhere at length.

Chapter 29

Now, [it must be understood], even in the <i>Hitbonenut</i> – contemplation of the Lights and Vessels (<i>Orot V’Keilim</i>) of [the world of] <i>Atzilut,</i> in a more particular manner, that the primary intent is only [to understand] the matter of “He and His life force are one, [and He] and His organs are one,” that in truth, there is no difference between “He and His life force are one” and “He and His organs are one.”
This is because even though the Lights are “<i>Bli Mah</i> – without whatness,” [that is, they are intangible], while the Vessels are in an aspect of “<i>Yesh -</i> somethingness” [and are therefore tangible], nevertheless, from the angle of the Essential Self of the Emanator, He actually made the root for the existence of the Vessels before making the root for the existence of the Lights.
The fact that the Vessel comes about from the “thickening” of the Light [poses no contradiction to this], since the root and source [of the vessels] preceded this.
This [source] is called the “Simple [Primal] Matter – <i>Chomer Pashoot</i>” or “The <i>Heyulie</i> Matter” which precedes the “Form – <i>Tzoorah</i>” [of the Lights].
The explanation of this matter is known, and may be understood through the well know preface regarding the matter of vessels which actually limit. That is, there are two kinds of limitations (<i>G’vool</i>):
The first is the essential potential power to limit.
Examples of this are the vessels of the brain which limits or the eye which limits, and the like.
However, this is still only in potential rather than in actuality.
For example, in the hand there is the potential power to limit every physical movement, [even] before it actually limits any [specific] movement.
Now, although the actual revealed limitation is, literally, exactly like the spiritual potential power to limit of the hand, which is the root and source for the actual limitation, nevertheless, there is no comparison between the potential power to limit and the actual limitation [itself].
Firstly, one is spiritual and essential, whereas the other is physical and separate from the essence.
Secondly, the potential power to limit is not actual limitation.
Rather, [the person] limits his strength according to his will and choice, and it is [therefore] not a limitation of necessity, that is to say, [it is not] that he does not have the power to spread forth further.
Rather, he does not desire to spread forth further.
[Therefore], this is only [that which] <b>makes</b> limitations, while [it itself] is not truly limited. [In other words, it is not] like an actualized limitation, which is truly limited.
(This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of the innerness of the vessels and the externality of the vessels, as will be explained with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.)
[Through this] it may likewise be understood [regarding how it is] in the upper realms, in the root and source of the vessels which limit the light.
That is, [we may understand] the source and root of their power to limit, which is drawn from the same Singular Preexistent Intrinsic and Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, from which the lights themselves are drawn.
For example, the source of the existence of the light of a desire is from the concealed essential source of all desires.
Now, the potential power to limit is also drawn from there, which limits the power to spread the light of the desire forth, so as not to spread forth further [than desired].
This is so that the “reasoning for the desire” could come about.
This is because if the power and light of the desire would not cease, the “reasoning for the desire” could never come about.
This is controlled by the <i>Kav HaMidah</i>-The Measuring Line, which makes all the actual limitations of the lights.
In the same manner, it makes all the actual limitations of the vessels of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> which limit, and dictates how they will actually limit.
However, their root and source, is not the aspect of true limitation, but rather, it determines the type of limitation.
(This comes from the <i>Kav HaMidah</i> – The Measuring Line, from the aspect of <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Ohr Ein Sof-</i> Sternness of the Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
This is the power to gather in, which is similar to the power to spread out, since they are two lines of equal balance.
This is because [being that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is] “All Capable” (<i>Kol Yachol</i>) [He therefore] also has the power to limit (as explained elsewhere).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Avodat HaKodesh<i>,</i> Section 1, Ch. 8. Also see Derech Emunah (by the same author, Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabai), Ch. 2.</i>
It was explained above<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 13.</i> that this is the aspect of the <i>Reshimu</i> – Impression, which is the source of the limitations of the vessels of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of [the world] of <i>Atzilut</i>.
The aspect of the <i>Kav</i> – Line, which is drawn from the <i>Reshimu</i> – Impression, is the source of all the Lights, as explained elsewhere at length.)
Therefore, although the aspect of the Vessels of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> actually limit through the aspect of the [four] names <i>A”v-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63<i>,</i> [<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 and <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן-52], which are called “Letters,” however, this is only due to the potential power to make limitations within the Essential Self of the Emanator [Himself].
This then, is the meaning of “He and His organs are one.” That is, [the Vessels] come about from the power of the <i>Ein Sof -</i> The Singular Preexistent Essential and Unlimited Being of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, blessed is He, in the same way that, “He and His life force are one,” in regard to the aspect of the Lights.
(However, in truth, even the aspect of the vessels of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> are potential limitation (<i>Koach HaGvool</i>), rather than actual limitation (<i>Gvool B’Po’el</i>).
It is only when the light and influence is limited to [create] “something” from “nothing” in [the worlds of] <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, that they can be considered to be actual limitation (<i>Gvool B’Po’el Mamash</i>), as will be explained with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.)
According to the above, when a person focuses his intention on the names of <i>A”V-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63 etc., which are in an aspect of vessels that actually limit, this itself [constitutes] focusing his intention upon the source of the names of <i>A”V-</i>ע״ב-72<i>, Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63 etc., which are the source of the Light of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>.
(This is the Essential Name of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה – <i>Shem Ha’Etzem</i>, which indicates the Essential Self of the Source, as previously explained.)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See at length in Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1, The Gate of Intrinsic Being (<i>Shaar HaHavayah</i>) and on.</i>
In other words, [his intention] is [focused] on the source of the existence of the Vessels, [about which it states] “He and His organs are one,” as explained above.
From this it is self-understood that the statement, “He and His organs are one,” also applies to the above mentioned “Fixings-<i>Tikkunim.</i>”
This is because the actual limitation (<i>Gvool B’Po’el</i>) is unified with the potential power to limit (<i>Koach HaGvool</i>), which brings about this actual limitation.
[This may be understood] by way of analogy, from the potential power to limit of the hand, which is unified and bound to the actual limitation of the movement, as mentioned above.
(This is most certainly true of the Vessels of the Brain, Heart [and Liver], which cannot yet be considered to be actual limitation (<i>Gvool B’Po’el</i>), as explained above.
Rather, they limit and describe the Lights, only so that they may become recognizable as a tangible existence.
Nonetheless, the [Vessels] are rooted in the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, just as the Lights are rooted in His Essential Self.
These [two powers] are equally balanced, and literally have a single source, this [source being] the aspect of <i>Ein Sof -</i> The Singular Preexistent Essential and Unlimited Being of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, literally.
This is because just as the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One spreads down [without limit], so too it [exists above] without end.
These [two powers, that is, the limitless ability to reveal and the limitless ability to restrain revelation] are <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Atzmoot –</i> Kindness and Sternness of the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
However, regarding the Lights and Vessels [as they are] in their source, it is the reverse of [how they are] in their revealed aspect.
This is because as they are revealed, the aspect of restraint - <i>Tzimtzum</i> is in the Lights, and the kindnesses of spreading forth, is in the Vessels.
This is because even though the [Vessels] limit [the Lights, nonetheless,] all spreading down [of influence] comes about specifically through them.
However, in their source, the opposite is true.
The restraint-<i>Tzimtzum</i> is in the <i>Reshimu-</i>Impression, which makes potential limitation, while the spreading forth of kindnesses-<i>Chassadim</i> is in the lights, which comes about from the aspect of the <i>Kav-</i>Line. This is explained elsewhere, and will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 30

From the above we may understand the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17b</i> “If You would withdraw from them, all [the names] would remain as a body without a soul.”
This refers to the aspect of the vessels of the Brain, the Heart and [the Liver], which [by themselves] are called “A body without the soul.”
[The soul] refers to the aspect of the Lights of the <i>Nefesh, Ruach</i> and <i>Neshamah</i> etc.
However, after having previously stated that the Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) come from the thickening of the Lights (<i>Orot</i>), how then is it possible for there to be a Vessel (<i>Keli</i>) without Light (<i>Ohr</i>)?
Rather, according to what was stated above, that the source of the Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) preceded the source of the Lights (<i>Orot</i>), therefore the Vessels have their own existence, independent [of the lights]. Regarding this it states, “He and His organs are one.”
(Accordingly, a person who directs his intentions to the name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה<i>,</i> such as during the eighteen benedictions of the <i>Amidah</i> prayer, should direct his intention to the source of the vessel, which is the main aspect of The Name, since “He and His organs are one.”
This automatically brings about that the Light (<i>Ohr</i>) is drawn to the Vessel (<i>Keli</i>), since,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Kiddushin 2b</i> “It is the nature of a man to [pursue the woman].” This will suffice for those of understanding.)
Now, there are three levels in the vessels; the inner, the intermediate and the outer.
The [explanation of this] matter is known, that corresponding to the nine <i>Sefirot</i>, <i>ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i>, there are three kinds of vessels.
The innerness of the Vessels is the aspect of the restriction of the light of <i>ChaBa”D</i> of the Light (<i>Ohr</i>).
The intermediary aspect of the Vessels is the restriction of the <i>ChaGa”T</i> of the Light, and the externality of the vessels is the limitation of the <i>NeHi”Y</i> of the Light.
This is the meaning of [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 32:7</i> “You conceal – <i>Atah Seter</i> (אתה סתר).” [The word <i>Seter</i> – Conceal (סתר)] is a backwards spelling of [the acronym] <i>Rosh –</i> Beginning (<b>ר</b>אש), <i>Toch</i> – Middle (<b>ת</b>וך), and <i>Sof –</i> End (<b>ס</b>וף),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Emek HaMelech<i>,</i> Shaar 12<i>,</i> Ch. 4.</i> because the main restriction and concealment [of the Light] is in the externality of the vessels.
Furthermore, in regard to the matter that the aspect of influence and the lowering of [that] influence to the recipients [comes about] specifically through Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>), there also are three levels.
The innerness of the vessels is the aspect of the bringing [down] the Light of the influence of <i>ChaBa”D</i>.
The Middle [aspect] is the bringing [down] and drawing forth of the Light of <i>ChaGa”T</i>, and the Externality is the bringing [down] of the influence of <i>NeHi”Y</i>.
By way of analogy, [this is like] the nine <i>Sefirot</i> of the Light of the quality of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness, as it is limited within three kinds of “letters.”
The letters of Thought (<i>Machshavah</i>) are the aspect of the inner vessel for the <i>ChaBa”D</i> of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness.
The letters of Speech (<i>Deeboor</i>) are the intermediary vessel for <i>ChaGa”T</i> of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness, and the letters of the Action (<i>Ma’aseh</i>) are [the outer vessel for] the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of the Light of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness.
[In other words, this outer vessel] is the power to actualize the kindness, to do it in actual deed.
This [actualization of the kindness] has a vessel specific to it. Likewise, the love of the kindness has a vessel specific to it, and the intellect and reasoning of the kindness has a vessel specific to it.
In most cases, the intellect and reasoning of the kindness are entertained in one’s Thought (<i>Machshavah</i>), the love [of the kindness] is said in Speech (<i>Deeboor</i>) and the power to actualize [the kindness] is actualized in Deed (<i>Ma’aseh</i>).
(However, when [the Light of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness] comes [to <b>actually</b> be expressed] in the three types of Letters (<i>Otiot</i>) of Thought, Speech and Action, they are [only] called “Garments – <i>Levooshin</i>.”
This is lower than the aspect of the vessels about which it states “He and His <b>organs</b> are one,” which is not the case with the Garments - <i>Levooshin</i>.
Rather, [this statement] refers to the Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) for the <i>Nefesh, Ruach</i> and <i>Neshamah</i>, which are the Brain, the Heart [and the Liver].
Now, in the [vessel of the] Heart there are [also] three levels; inner, middle and outer, corresponding to the nine <i>Sefirot</i>.
There is the aspect of <i>ChaBa”D</i> of the emotional qualities of love or fear, which is called the “Intellect of the Emotions” (<i>Mooskal Shel HaMeedot</i>).
This is in the right ventricle of the heart, within which light radiates from the brain of <i>Chochmah</i>, which rules over the heart.
The <i>ChaGa”T</i> of the love and fear is called the “Feeling” (<i>Moorgash</i>).
This is the aspect of the intermediary vessel of the heart, which is the Spirit of Life (<i>Ruach HaChayim</i>) that beats in the left ventricle.
This is drawn from the brain of <i>Binah</i>, which is called “<i>Ruach</i>.”
This is the aspect of the vessel of the felt vitality of the emotions, when they become aroused.
The externality of the heart is the “Breath of the Chest” (<i>Havel HaChazeh</i>), which is the vessel for the natural [reactions] of the emotions.
This corresponds to the aspect of <i>Nefesh</i>, that is, the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of the [heartfelt] emotions.
It is this [level] which radiates into the <i>Nefesh</i> that is “in the blood,” which, generally, is a vehicle for the <i>Ruach</i> of the heart.
Likewise, the aspect of the <i>Nefesh</i> in the Liver includes three levels; inner, middle and outer etc.
The <i>Zohar</i> calls the inner [level], “The Impression of Life – <i>Keesta D’Chayoota</i>.”
This refers to the aspect of the impression (<i>Reshimoo</i>) that remains of the aspect of the <i>Ruach</i> during sleep.
This is the aspect of the intellect of <i>ChaBa”D</i> in their immature state (<i>Katnoot</i>), [as they are] in the <i>Nefesh</i>.
The middle [aspect of the <i>Nefesh</i> in the Liver] is the arousal of the physical life force of the power of movement and feeling, which is in the blood, “which is the <i>Nefesh</i>,” such as the pulse of the hand.
The outer [aspect of the <i>Nefesh</i>] is the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of the Liver, which sends the external life force to all the limbs.
Now, the inner [aspects may become] separated, as explained elsewhere at length.
[This is to say] that during the time of exile, which is called “sleep,” the radiance of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> [which is] the aspect of the soul of the worlds of <i>BY”A,</i> is only in an aspect of an “Impression of Life – <i>Keesta D’Chayoota</i>.”
[It is only] an <b>impression</b>-<i>Reshimoo</i> of the aspect of <i>Ruach</i> of the Heart of the “Upper Man-<i>Adam HaElyon</i>.”
[This is because] during the exile the Assembly of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The “Assembly of Israel” (<i>Knesset Yisroel</i>) refers to the aspect of the General Godly Soul of the Jewish People, where all the Jewish souls converge as one, and is another name for the aspect of the Divine Presence (<i>Shechinah</i>). (See Shaarei Orah of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Gate 1 – <i>Malchut.</i>)</i> is compared to a fetus.
In other words, they are similar a fetus, whose head is folded between its knees, “three inside of three.”
[This is to say] that the Brains of <i>ChaBa”D</i> are concealed within <i>ChaGa”T,</i> and <i>ChaGat</i> is [concealed] within <i>NeHi”Y</i>, as stated elsewhere.)
Now, regarding the matter of the Commandments (<i>Mitzvot</i>), which are called the two-hundred and forty-eight organs of the King, as known, three times nine times nine – corresponding to the three levels of beginning, middle and end of the vessels – equals two-hundred and forty-three, as previously mentioned.
[Now], with the inclusion of the five kindnesses which bring about growth, they are two-hundred and forty-eight.
The aspect of <i>ChaBa”D</i> is the light of the devotional intent in the [performance of the] commandment (<i>Mitzvah</i>).
There is a specific inner vessel for this, [with a specific restriction and] limitation.
The aspect of <i>ChaGa”T</i>, is the love, awe and nullification, for which there is an intermediary vessel etc.
The aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> is the aspect of the power to actualize, [that is] only to do the will of the King, for which there is an external vessel.
(Generally, these are called Intent – <i>Kavanah</i>, Blessing – <i>Brachah</i>, and Action – <i>Ma’aseh</i> or Unification – <i>Yichud</i>, Blessing – <i>Brachah</i>, and Holiness – <i>Kedushah,</i> which are called [by the acronym] <i>YaBo”K-</i>יב״ק.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Which has a numerical value of <i>HaShem Elohi”m</i>-יהו״ה אלהי״ם-112. (See at greater length in Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1, The Gate of Intrinsic Being (<i>Shaar HaHavayah</i>).</i>
As is explained elsewhere at length, these are [also represented by] the matter of the Flesh (<i>Basar</i>), Veins (<i>Geedin</i>) and Bones (<i>Atzamot</i>) of every limb.)
Now, the Five Kindnesses that bring about growth (<i>Heh Chassadim HaMagdeelim</i>) are the aspect of the general drawing down and revelation of the Godly Light through [the fulfillment of] each [particular] commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Pirke HaTzelem</i>, Ch. 6) it states that the five kindnesses (<i>Heh Chassadim</i>) is the aspect of the influence of the last <i>Heh-</i>ה of the name <i>Sa”G-</i>ס״ג-63 of <i>Binah,</i> which is the aspect of <i>Tvunah</i>, which was previously explained.</i>
This is by way of the drawing down of the <i>Kav</i> – Line, which draws from the Source of all kindnesses, for “He waters the tree,” similar to the statement, “You fill all the names” etc.
(Now, according to this, the statement, “They would remain as a body [without a soul” becomes understood]. This is because even the aspect of the “Body-<i>Goofa</i>,” with the aforementioned three vessels, requires the radiance of the Limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, within the <i>Kav</i>, which “fills all the names.”
This is because there is an independent source for the existence of the Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>), as previously explained.
However, if this is the case, then why is this statement made dependent upon something which [at first glance] is not the essence of the matter, which is the statement “they will remain like a body without a soul.”
However, since the essential matter of the vessels is that they correspond to the nine <i>Sefirot</i> of the <i>Nefesh, Ruach</i> and <i>Neshamah</i>, and it is because of the increase of the light that there is growth in the vessels, in order for the light of the influence to be brought down, [therefore,] “If You would withdraw [from them, they would remain as a body without a soul”].
[In other words], the vessel would remain like a body without a soul; that is, it could not spread forth, whatsoever. This will suffice for those of understanding.)

Chapter 31

Now, there is a great advantage of the aspect of the Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>), over and above the aspect of the Lights (<i>Orot</i>). This is because there is a greater aspect of inter-inclusion in the vessels than in the lights. This is the main aspect of <i>Tikkun</i> – Rectification.
For, as known, the main aspect of <i>Tikkun</i> – Rectification comes about because of the abundance of vessels.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaTikkun</i>) Shaar 10, Ch. 5, and Shaar 12, Ch. 4.</i>
[Moreover,] it is specifically by means of the external aspect of the vessel, which is the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i>.
This is evidenced by the fact that we find that in some circumstances, the light of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness may radiate within a vessel of <i>Gevurah</i> – Judgment, or that a light of <i>Gevurah</i> – Judgment [may radiate] within a vessel of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness.
If this is so, that the light may be exchanged to radiate within its opposite vessel, if it is because of [the light] itself, then why can it not become inter-included and bound with a light that is its opposite and opposes it?
For example, the light of the quality of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness will not tolerate the light of the quality of Judgment (<i>Din</i>), whatsoever.
Rather, we must say, that this [inter-inclusion] is because of the aspect of the vessel (<i>Keli</i>), which has the ability to tolerate an opposite light that opposes it.
This is because it is specifically in the vessels that the aspect and matter of the inter-inclusion of a thing with its opposite [is possible]. This is not the case [in regard to] the Lights (<i>Orot</i>).
[Similarly,] in man, the main aspect of rectification is from the angle of his body.
As we clearly observe with our senses in regard to the nature of man’s organs, that each organ contains an inter-inclusion of its fellow [organs],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar Nefilat Apayim 91c; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim<i>,</i> pg. 407.</i> to the point that it is possible to rectify a lacking [in one organ] through healing a different organ.
For example, for a problem in the sight of the eye, healing may be applied to the power of the nerves in the foot, since they include within themselves [something of] the nerves of the eye.
However, in the case of old age and the like, [in which] the light and vitality of the brain becomes weakened to the point that [one’s] sight becomes weakened, one cannot heal [this] through strengthening the power and light of the vitality of the <b>emotions</b> of the heart, even though the heart and brain are inter-included with one another.
It is only through strengthening the <b>vessel</b> of the heart that the vessel of the brain may become strengthened, so that the power of the intellect will radiate to a greater degree, and he will [thereby] have better vision.
This is because there is not as much of a connection and inter-inclusion between the light of the intellect and the light of the emotions, as there is between the vessel of the heart and the vessel of the brain.
This is likewise the case in regard to the vessel of the eye, with the vessel of the nose and the vessel of the ear, and the like.
It is for this reason that it is specifically from the angle of the aspect of the Vessel (<i>Keli</i>) that it is possible for its opposite light to radiate within it. This will suffice for those of understanding.
This may be further understood from our observation that the emotions of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness and <i>Gevurah</i> – Judgment are opposites which literally oppose each other.
Nonetheless, when these emotions come into a vessel, such as actual thought, speech and action, it is possible for the light of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness to radiate in a thought, speech and action, that is its opposite.
[This is so] since it is possible to think, speak and do the opposite of what is in his heart.
Similarly, [a person] can become angry in his heart against someone who he loves in his heart, or he may have mercy in his heart towards someone who he despises etc.
This is because the heart is prepared to become a receptacle for that which is its opposite, since there is a greater inter-inclusion of one thing and its opposite in the vessels, [rather] than the lights.
(The fact that in jubilation there is trembling and in wrath there is mercy, or the opposite, that in trembling there is jubilation and in mercy there is wrath, is all specifically due to the vessels.)
We similarly find this [matter] in the six days of creation. The first day is the aspect of the <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness of “Let there be light,”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3</i> while the second day is the aspect of the <i>Gevurah</i> – Judgment of “Let there be a firmament,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:6</i> as it states in the <i>Zohar,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 205a, and Zohar III 94b.</i> “Each day has its function.”
Nevertheless, in each day there is specifically an inter-inclusion of the other days, as known.
This is because it is specifically when the light comes into the vessel that is called “day-<i>Yom</i>-יום,” that an inter-inclusion of one thing with its opposite [occurs].
This is because, when the matter comes to be influenced in actuality, it is impossible that kindness will not have the aspect of judgment inter-included in it, or that judgment [will not have] the aspect of kindness [inter-included in it].
This is not the case, however, when the light and influence [remains] without a vessel, as of yet.
An example of this is a <i>Halachic</i> legal ruling that is specifically for [the purpose of] practical application.
Of necessity, there will be an inter-inclusion of kindness within the judgment or of judgment within the kindness.
However, this is not the case if the ruling is not [necessarily] for practical application.
[From all the above] we find that the primary aspect of inter-inclusion is in the aspect of the externality of the vessels, which relate to action. This will suffice for those of understanding.
However, at first glance, there seems to be a contradiction to all this.
This is because, in reality, the fact that the light is capable of radiating within its opposite vessel is because of the nullification of the vessel to the light.
This comes about by means of the aspect of the inner name of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 [יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א],<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> which is the source of the aspect of the inter-inclusions in the lights, specifically from the radiance of the <i>Kav</i> – Line.
It is specifically for this reason that the inter-inclusion is in the innerness of the vessels, (An example of this is the devotional intent in the performance of the <i>Mitzvot-</i>commandments, which includes two opposites. This is similar to the [matter of the] <i>Atzamot V,Geedin</i> –Bones and Tendons etc. This is not the case, [however], in the actual action.) rather than in the externality.
This is because, [as known,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Midrash Bereshit Rabba 50:2 and elsewhere.</i>] one angel cannot perform two opposite missions.
This is because all sending forth of influence comes about specifically from the externality of the vessels, which brings out the influence.
This is similar to the external vessels of the “letters,” and the like.
It is for this reason that “The face of the Lion is to the right etc.,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:10</i> and they [are incapable of] changing their function, nor can they join together to exchange missions with each other.
Because of this [the <i>Zohar</i> states,] “Each day specifically has <b>its own</b> function.”
However, the [explanation of the] matter is that because the inner aspect of the vessels receives from the aspect of the inner lights which become limited within the vessel, [therefore,] when there is an inter-inclusion in the lights, there is an automatic inter-inclusion in the innerness of the vessels. This is similar to the arousal and comprehension of [the angels] Michael and Gabriel etc.
[However,] the externality of the vessels [receive] from the aspect of, “The Potential Power to Limit-<i>Koach HaGvool</i>,” which is in an aspect of an encompassing [light].
There can therefore be two opposites as one within them, which is the aspect of the inter-inclusion of one thing with its opposite, specifically.
This is similar to all miracles, which specifically take place in the aspect of the externality of the vessels, which is the [performance of the miracle] in actuality.
For example, every place in which a miracle happens is a place that [simultaneously] withstands a thing and its opposite. [This is to say that, at once, it includes] that which is above nature within nature.
An example of this is the transformation of the sea to dry land, and similarly, [the fact that] the place of the Holy Ark was not according to [natural] measurable dimensions, as explained elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yoma 21b</i>
Likewise, it is [specifically] from there that the source of divisions comes, to separate each [thing] unto itself.
This comes about due to of the aspect of the <i>Kav HaMidah –</i> The Measuring Line in the Encompassing [Light], since it is the source of the vessels that limit.
For this reason, the primary aspect of rectification-<i>Tikkun</i> is specifically the aspect of the abundance of subdivisions.
It is specifically because of the [subdivisions] that there can be an abundance of inter-inclusions of one thing with its opposite as one.
This is likewise the primary aspect of the “Man of Rectification” (<i>Adam D’Tikkun</i>), about whom it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 139:5</i> “<i>Achor V’Kedem Tzartanee</i> – You have formed me back and front,” [which refers] specifically to formation (<i>Yetzirah</i>) in a body of substance (<i>Goof Chomer</i>).
<i>Kedem</i> – Front, refers to the aspect of the simple substance (<i>Chomer Pashoot</i>) that preceded the form (<i>Tzoorah</i>), which is the light.
This is in the source of the vessels that preceded the light.
<i>Achor</i> – Back, refers to the aspect of the vessel of substance that follows [the investment of] the Light and Form etc. This will suffice for those of understanding. This is in accordance with the explanation of this matter elsewhere at length, (and should suffice for those of understanding.)

Chapter 32

We now must understand the aspect of “the Upper Man” of [the world of] <i>Atzilut,</i> who is “upon the throne etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:26</i>
This is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar RaPa”Ch Nitzotzin</i>) Shaar 18, Ch. 5; Also see Etz Chayim<i>,</i> Shaar 42, Ch. 1.</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> which receives from the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Drooshey HaNekudot</i>) Shaar 8, Ch. 2.</i>
As known, this is the matter and aspect of the Emotions (<i>Midot</i>) of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>, which is the primary [source] and root of the influence for the “source of the source” of the vitality of the worlds.
[Nonetheless,] it [itself] is still the end of the world of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, since “He and His life force and organs are one,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 3b</i> as previously explained.
Therefore, even up to the aspect of the vessels of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, in the aspect of the externality of the <i>NeHi”Y</i> of [<i>Zeir Anpin</i>], is still considered to be of the end of the world of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
Now, the explanation of these matters [may be understood in a manner] of “From my flesh I shall behold God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Job 19:26</i> because “Man was made in the image of God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 9:6</i> as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:26</i> “[Let us make man] in our form and in our likeness.”
Now, we observe in the human soul, that its aspects of <i>Chayah</i> and <i>Yechidah</i> are the aspects of the encompassing [lights, relative] to the <i>Nefesh, Ruach</i> and <i>Neshamah</i>, and transcend the limitation of lights within vessels.
This is the aspect of the simple essential desire and pleasure, which is in the aspect of the <i>Yechidah</i> [level of the soul], plus the aspect of the innerness and source of the intellect, which is called <i>Maskil</i>, and is the aspect of the encompassing [light] of the <i>Chayah</i> [level of the soul].
They do not become limited within the vessels at all.
It is only from <i>Chochmah</i> down [that the light] is drawn into a vessel.
This is the aspect of the <i>Neshamah</i> which is within the brain, the <i>Ruach</i> within the heart etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">…and the <i>Nefesh</i> in the Liver, as previously explained.</i>
However, the light of the encompassing desire and pleasure nevertheless radiates from its concealment, from the inner aspect of the light of <i>Chochmah</i>, within the <i>Nefesh, Ruach</i> and <i>Neshamah</i>, which are within the three vessels of the Brain, the Heart [and the Liver].
This is the revelation of the desire that comes into the revealed intellect and reasoning in the aspect of the brain of <i>Chochmah</i>, which is called the Light of <i>Abba</i> [<i>Chochmah</i>].
From there it is drawn down and spreads forth into <i>Binah</i>, which is comprehension.
From the comprehension (<i>Binah</i>) of the brain, the emotional arousal in the heart is drawn down.
This is to say that the thirty-two chambers of the brain, which are called the “thirty-two pathways of <i>Binah</i>,” open up to become the intellect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 128b, 129a &amp; 136a</i>
This is because the Intellect (<i>Mochin</i>) divides into four, that is, <i>Chochmah, Binah, Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>.
Each one of these [four] has eight chambers within it, thus totaling thirty-two.
It is for this reason that [the heart] is called <i>Lev –</i> Heart (לב), because its source is in the thirty-two pathways (ל"ב שבילין), which are the thirty-two chambers.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 31, Ch. 4.</i>
It is through them that <i>Da’at,</i> which includes <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>, causes the light of the intellect of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> to lean [and] be aroused [either] towards <i>Chessed</i> or <i>Gevurah</i>, that is, towards merit or judgment.
These are also called the emotions of the intellect, which are the seven lower [<i>sefirot</i>] of <i>Binah</i>, each of which includes seven. These are the fifty gates of <i>Binah</i>.
[However,] all this is one [related] matter, except that the fifty gates of <i>Binah</i> still are within the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>, such as the “Kindnesses that are concealed within <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Imma</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah, Bamidbar 6d.</i>
In other words, this is the aspect of the arousal of love, as it still is within intellect and comprehension. It thus is considered to be “concealed” and “hidden” within comprehension.
Afterwards, it comes out into revelation as an actual arousal of the quality of love within the heart, which is called <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
In this fashion, the aforementioned thirty-two pathways come out in a revealed way to the heart from the concealed arousal of the brain, and it is for this reason that it is called “Heart-<i>Lev</i>-לב-32.”
This is in accordance with what is stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 31 (<i>Shaar Partzufei Zu”N</i>), Ch. 4; Also see Ma’amarei Admor Ha’Emtza’ee, Devarim, Vol. 3, pg. 994.</i> that the reason it is called “<i>Lev-</i>לב-32” is because the thirty-two lights of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> gather there. These are the thirty-two pathways.
(These are the thirty-two [times that it states in the Act of Creation] “And God said-<i>VaYomer Elohi”m</i>-ויאמר אלהי״ם,” which [refers to] <i>Binah</i>, as it receives from <i>Abba</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee<i>,</i> Vayikra, Vol.2, pg. 625; Devarim<i>,</i> Vol. 2, pg. 651.</i>) as explained elsewhere at length.
Now, certainly, in order for there to be an arousal of an emotion in the heart from the concealed arousal of that emotion as it exists in the intellect and comprehension of <i>Binah</i>, there must first be an aspect of a <i>Tzimtzum,</i> concealment and gathering, which is called a withdrawal.
(This is analogous to a seed decaying so that there can be a transformation from one [state of] being to a different [state of] being, as known.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Tanya 113a; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 598.</i>)
This [<i>Tzimtzum –</i> lessening] is the aspect of the “Narrowness of the neck – <i>Meitzar HaGaron</i>” of <i>Binah</i>, in which the arousal of the intellect becomes concealed, and is drawn down as an arousal in the heart through a transformation of [its state of] being.
(This is similar to the aspect of the “Airy Membrane – <i>Krooma D’Avirah</i>” that conceals and separates between the upper power which transcends intellect, [and the intellect], so that it may be revealed as the light of the intellect through a transformation of [its state of] being.
It is also similar to the “Diaphragm – <i>Chatzer HaKaved</i>” which divides and separates between the respiratory system and the digestive system in order to bring about a transformation of [state of] being, as explained elsewhere at length.)
Nevertheless, the emotions of the heart are patterned after the emotions of the intellect, literally. They are literally according to how they were aroused in the brain, without any deviation whatsoever, even as much as the “thorn of the letter <i>Yod</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This expression means “even the tiniest amount.” An equivalent English idiom would be, “Even to a hair’s breadth.”</i> as known.
The only exception is that in the heart they come about through a transformation of their [state of] being, according to the limitation and restraint of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Binah</i>, which constitute the sending forth of the influence of the light of the essential comprehension, for the sole purpose of arousing the emotions, as known.
Now, included in the emotions of the heart are the three levels of <i>ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i>.
These are the “<i>Mooskal</i> – The Intellect [of the Emotions],” the “<i>Moorgash</i> – The Felt [arousal of the emotions]” and the “<i>Mootba</i> – The Natural [Response of the Emotions],” which were mentioned previously.
Each of these consists of three vessels; inner, middle, and external, as explained previously at length.
However, even the aspect of the externality of the vessels of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of the heart, which is the aspect of the arousal of the kindness and love of the heart, as it comes to be [expressed] as influence to the outside, which is called <i>NeHi”Y</i> of the chest [as it is expressed] within the Thought, Speech and Action, which comes [about] through the externality of the vessel of the heart, which is the aspect of the “<i>Mootba</i> – The Natural [response of the emotions]” of the breath of the chest of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>, about which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> 3b.</i> “He and His organs are one,” is [nonetheless] all still in an aspect of the limitless state of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
By way of analogy, this is similar to man below.
When the essential desire, which is in an aspect of the encompassing [light] of the aforementioned <i>Yechidah</i> [level of the soul], radiates and comes into revelation in the brains of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, to the point that it descends and constricts within the “smallness” of the brains of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Chessed,</i> as it is felt in the heart, which is the breath of the chest, we find that even there, the [essential] desire radiates.
This is because, as we observe, the desire is even felt in the breath of the heart.
This is called, “<i>Re’oota D’Leeba</i> – The Desire of the Heart,”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 100a and elsewhere.</i> which is the fact that his heart lusts in a <b>felt</b> way for something good, and loathes that which is bad and despised, through the absence of desire [for it] in the heart.
This being the case, [we find that] there is an instantaneous unification and bond between the [original] source of the essential desire and the [external] breath of the heart, as if they are literally one entity.
Through this analogy we may understand the Upper Man, which is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
Regarding the heart of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21</i> “And He said unto His heart,” causing it to lean toward Kindness.
Likewise, [a different verse states,]<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:6</i> “And He saddened His heart,” [causing it to lean] toward Judgment, and the like.
We find that within the aspect of the externality of the vessels of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of this heart, there is a radiance of the aspect of the simple essential desire of the Essential Self of the limitless Light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, Who precedes the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
([This aspect] was mentioned previously in chapter ten, in regard to the aspects of <i>Yachid</i> and <i>Echad</i> etc., through the analogy of the essential desire for kindness [as it exists] within the essence of the [human] soul etc.)
This being the case, even up to the aspect of the externality of the heart of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> it still is completely considered to be the end of the World of the Unlimited One (<i>Olam HaEin Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
This is because, “He and His organs are one” just as it is in a human being, whose heart is one with his essential desire. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 33

From all the above we understand the matter of a single <i>Hitbonenut</i>-contemplation of the many particulars that come together as one general [overarching principle] which includes them all.
This is similar to [the matter of] “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires He has done in the heavens and the earth etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 135:6</i> The root of this “desire of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה” is rooted in the first source (which is called <i>Yachid</i> – Singular etc).
This is the aspect of the essential <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness in the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, blessed is He, who is [an] absolutely simple [singularity]. This [desire for kindness] is similar to the essentially good and kind nature embedded in the essence of the human soul (as explained above in chapter ten).
Once it arose in <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה will and desire to bestow goodness in a particular way from this general <i>heyulie</i> light, [this desire] descended with a great chaining down. [Nonetheless], all [this was] still within Himself [and was still] in the aspect of Limitlessness (<i>Ein Sof</i>), until this desire reached the aspects of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of the externality of the vessel of the “Heart.”
In other words, [it reached] the external emotions (<i>Midot</i>) of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), even though, as it is there, [in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Ein Sof</i>] it completely transcends the aspect of limitations of lights within vessels.
Rather, it all is literally in the aspect of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), as “He estimated it within <b>Himself</b>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Mikdash Melech to <i>Zohar</i> 16a</i>
Afterwards, there was a <i>Tzimtzum</i> [withdrawal] and it descended by means of the aspect of the Line (<i>Kav</i>) into the ten <i>sefirot</i> of Circles (<i>Igullim</i>) etc., until the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>. [Now, <i>Keter</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>] is the source of the concealed desire (<i>Ratzon HaNe’elam)</i> which becomes revealed as the “desire for the desire” within <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atik Yomin</i> etc.
[This desire then continued to descend] until the aspects of the desire and pleasure within <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, and became limited within the [revealed] desire, intellect, and comprehension, which are the three upper <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> etc.
[It then continued to descend] until the aspect of the seven lower <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Binah</i>.
[Then it continued] until the aspect of the “immature brains – <i>Katnoot HaMochin</i>” of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> [as they vest] within <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as explained before.
From there it underwent further restraint (<i>Tzimtzum</i>) on the three levels of <i>ChaBa”D</i> and <i>ChaGa”T</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> etc., until the aspect of the externality of the vessels of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> [of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>], which is the aspect of the “Breath of the Chest.”
There, [the descent of] the light of the simple desire, which was included in the concealed Essence of the <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, concludes.
Moreover, this entire chaining down (<i>Hishtalshelut</i>), from the [essential] desire that arose hidden in the Essential Self of the Singular Preexistent Intrinsic and Unlimited Being of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, until it came to be felt in the breath of the heart, happened and was drawn down instantaneously, since “He and His life force and organs are one.”
This means that, “He” literally refers to the aspect of the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, blessed is He, whereas “His life force” refers to [both] the concealed and revealed aspects of the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, [which are] “like a flame [that is bound to the coal] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:7</i>
[This continued] until the aspect of the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
“And His organs” refers to the aspect of the vessels of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
“Are one” means that all this is still in the aspect of His Unlimited Being (<i>Ein Sof</i>).
This is because although the aspect of the vessels, which limit the external emotions of the heart of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, are [in the aspect of] ultimate “smallness” compared to the exaltedness of the essential emotions of the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One – <i>Ein Sof</i>, they nevertheless are considered to be the aspect of the end of the beginning, as scripture states, “He calls out the generations from the beginning etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 41:4</i>
Their final conclusion is the aspect of the “immature” [or “tiny”] emotions of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
Because of this, <i>Zeir Anpin</i> is called “The Small Face,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of “<i>Zeir Anpin</i>” is “The Small Face.”</i> [since] it is similar to the small face of a little child compared to the “Large Face”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 13b</i> of “an elder who has acquired wisdom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Kiddushin 32b</i>
The one is completely intellectually immature, whereas the other is completely mature.
Nonetheless, they are equally within the category of man, except that one is considered to be an “immature person,” while the other is considered to be a “mature person.” However, the form of how they are is the same.
This is because the emotions of a child are also according to intellect and concealed desire etc., except that it comes [revealed] with total immaturity.
[However] in a mature adult, his emotions are mature, according to the breadth of his intellect and his very lofty and exalted desire.
This is likewise the comparison between the immature emotions of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> which are emotions that are limited according to the immature intellect of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i>, compared to the aspect of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, which is called the “Large Face.”
[This is to say that <i>Arich Anpin</i> represents] the mature countenance and brains of “an elder who has acquired wisdom” from the source of the concealed wisdom [itself], which is higher than the “[Airy] Membrane (<i>Krooma D’Avira</i>).”
This is the aspect of the hidden intellect (<i>Sechel HaNe’elam</i>) which is in the concealed desire (<i>Ratzon HaNe’elam</i>) that is the root of the Emanated etc.
In the same way, even the aspect of the emotions of the concealed desire and intellect of <i>Arich Anpin</i> are in the aspect of immaturity compared to the aspect of the even greater “man,” That is, the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon,</i> who is called “The Man of Creation.”
(As known, <i>Zeir Anpin</i> is called “The Man of Action,” <i>Arich Anpin</i> is called “The Man of Formation” and <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is called “The Man of Creation.”
In each of these there are ten <i>Sefirot</i> in a concealed and revealed [manner], as scripture states,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 43:7</i> [“For My glory, I have created, formed, and even actualized”]. “For My glory” refers to <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), “I have created” refers to <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, “formed” refers to <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>, and “actualized” refers to the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> about whom it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:26</i> “Let us make man in our image [and in our likeness].”)
This is analogous to the formation of lines that are made small [representing] something [much] bigger, such as how a map is patterned after planet earth.
Nonetheless, this image contains everything in it.
Nothing is missing, not even the amount of “the thorn of the letter <i>Yod</i>,” except that it is a very tiny [scale model] in which the form of a tiny line may be a five hundred <i>Parsa</i> long river on planet earth, and the like.
Likewise, by way of analogy, are the immature emotions of an infant, compared to the emotions of an elder of seventy years.
This is similar to the ability [of an adult] to give birth to [offspring] who are like him etc.
(This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of “<i>Bootzin Bootzin</i> [<i>Mikeetphay Yediya</i>] – “Small pumpkins [are discernable when they burst forth from their sap] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Brachot 48a; Also see Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Erev Shabbat, 164d; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim pg. 207.</i>)
This is similarly the case in regard to the aspect of the emotions of the “Man” of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>. Even though they become [revealed] in a most diminished fashion (<i>Tzimtzum</i>) in comparison to the aspect of the emotions of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>, nonetheless, it all is one, except that it comes from the aspect of a most incredible length to a most incredible brevity.
(This is the meaning of [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 30:4</i> “What is his name, what is his son’s name-<i>Mah Shmo, Mah Shem Bno-</i>מה שמו מה שם בנו.” “What is his name-<i>Mah Shmo-</i>מה שמו” [refers to the aspect of] <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה-45 [יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א] of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, and “What is his son’s name-<i>Mah Shem Bno-</i>מ״ה שם בנו” is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as explained in several places.)
This then, is the general <i>Hitbonenut</i>-contemplation [of the verse, “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires He has done in the heavens and the earth etc.”] “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires” in the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, blessed is He, literally, “He has done in the heavens-<i>Shamayim-</i>שמים,” which is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 62b, and Zohar III (<i>Idra Zuta</i>) 288a.</i>
[The word “Heavens-<i>Shamayim</i>-שמים” is a composite of the two words] “Fire-<i>Aish-</i>אש” and “Water-<i>Mayim</i>-מים,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 12a; Sefer Yetzirah 1:11-12, and the commentaries there; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra, Vol. 2, pg. 498; Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,392.</i> [that is,] <i>Chessed</i>-Kindness and <i>Gevurah</i>-Judgment of the immaturity of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>.
([This matter is true even down] to the aspect of the “Heavens-<i>Shamayim</i>-שמים” of [the world of] <i>Asiyah-</i>Action.)
This is because, “Their beginning is imbedded with their end,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:6 – “Their end is bound with their beginning and their beginning with their end.”</i> from the <i>Chochmah</i> at the “top” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [all the way] to the <i>Chochmah</i> at the end, in the emotions of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
(This [also is the meaning of] the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel I 25:32; Kings I 1:48, 8:15</i> “Blessed is <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, the God of Israel.” [This refers to <i>Yisroel</i>] <i>Sabba</i> which is the aspect of <i>Adam Kadmon,</i> about which it states, “I have created etc.”
Similarly, [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4</i>] “<i>Shema Yisroel-</i>Listen Israel etc.,” refers to the worlds of <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> in a general manner (<i>Klallut</i>).)
(More particularly, “Whatever <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה desires” in the emotions of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i>, “He has done in the heavens and the earth” of [the worlds] <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, [all the way] to the aspect of the physical constellations and planets, which are the root of influence for the [four categories of] inanimate (<i>Domem</i>), vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>), animal (<i>Chai</i>), and speaker (<i>Medaber</i>) within the physical [world], [all of] which will be explained with the help of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה.)

Chapter 34

Now, in the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> (Emanation) there are two levels, which are called <i>Yisroel</i> (Israel) and <i>Yaakov</i> (Jacob),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaKelipot</i>) Shaar 48, Ch. 2 &amp; 3.</i> as known.
[We will now] explain the [various] particulars of levels in this.
[However,] we must first understand that the reason it is called by the name <i>Yisroel-</i>ישראל is “because you have ruled over (שרית) <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם [and prevailed] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:29; Also see Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Leah V’Rachel</i>) Shaar 38, Ch. 2.</i>
This is the [matter of the] name of <i>Ma”H</i>-מ״ה-45 (יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א) which clarifies and rules over the name of <i>Ba”N</i>-ב״ן-52 (יו״ד ה״ה ו״ו ה״ה),<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar TaNT”A</i>) Shaar 5, Ch 1. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim, Vol. 1, pg. 5; Vol. 2, pg. 573; Vol. 4, pg. 1213.</i> for [it states],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II (<i>Hechalot</i>) 254b; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim, Vol. 1, pg. 295, and Shemot, Vol. 2, pg. 321.</i> “They are clarified with <i>Chochmah</i>,” and,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Pri Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Tefilah</i>) Shaar 1, Chapter 7; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim, pg. 543.</i> “It is in the power of the man to clarify,” and,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 65b</i> “It is the nature of man to conquer etc.”
In order to explain these things, we must first understand the difference between the aspect of <i>Yisroel Saba</i> (The Elder Israel) and <i>Yisroel Zoota</i> (The Little Israel).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 216a</i>
The aspect of the emotional [<i>Sefirot</i>] of <i>Chochmah</i> itself are called “<i>Yisroel Saba</i> – The Elder Israel.”
Now, there are two levels in this: The first [level] is the emotions that are in the Light of <i>Abba</i> (<i>Ohr Abba</i>), and the second [level is] the emotions that are in the Hidden <i>Chochmah</i> (<i>Chochmah Stima’ah</i>).
This is called “The First Man – <i>Adam Kadma’a</i>” in the terminology of the <i>Zohar</i>.
Regarding this it states, “What (<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה) is his name, and what (<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה) is his son’s name.”
Now, the emotions that are lower than <i>Chochmah</i> [intellect] are called “<i>Yisroel Zoota</i> – The Little Israel,” for they are in an aspect of immaturity.
[This is] because they come [to be revealed] through the diminishment and concealment of the main essence of the intellect.
[All that is revealed] is what the external vessels of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i> of <i>Abba</i> draw forth to give rise and bring out an intellect for kindness (<i>Chessed</i>) and love, which is called “<i>Chessed Zoota</i> – The Little Kindness.”
(This may be compared to the seminal drop which is in the brain of the father etc. Similarly, it states “What (<i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה) is his son’s name” in reference to “<i>Yisroel Zoota</i> – The Little Israel,” which is drawn from the seminal drop of <i>Abba</i> (The Father) [<i>Chochmah</i>] etc., as known.)
Now from the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Abba,</i> [influence] is drawn into <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Imma</i>.
[<i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Imma</i>] is the aspect of the influencing and lowering of the comprehension and reasoning of this emotion of kindness.
However, the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Imma</i> is withdrawn during the birthing and revelation of the arousal of the quality of love and the like, [of the heartfelt emotions].
For, as is clearly observable, the reasoning and the intellect becomes abbreviated and withdrawn during the arousal of the [heartfelt] emotions.
(This [explains] the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 1:16</i> “You shall see on the birthing stones,” that is, the thighs become cold at the time of birthing.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Sotah 11b; Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaMochin</i>) Shaar 20, Ch. 3; Also see Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe) Balak 105b; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim, Vol. 2, pg. 378.</i>
[This is] because, the first <i>NeHi”Y</i> is withdrawn and a new <i>NeHi”Y</i> is drawn forth, as explained elsewhere.)
This is called the aspect of, “Breaking through the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Imma</i>,” to give birth to the [heartfelt] emotion.
At first, the [emotion of] love is hidden and concealed, included in the intellect, like a fetus in the womb of its mother.
However, after the [heartfelt] emotions are born they include the kindnesses (<i>Chassadim</i>) of <i>Abba</i> and the judgments (<i>Gevurot</i>) of <i>Imma</i> with [all] their general and particular aspects.
Now, there are three levels in this: There is the aspect of “<i>Mochin D’Yenika</i> – The Intellect of Suckling,” the aspect of “<i>Mochin D’Gadlut Rishon D’Imma</i> – The Intellect of the First Maturation from <i>Imma</i>,” and “<i>Gadlut Sheni D’Abba</i> – The Second Maturation from <i>Abba</i>,” as known.
As known, the explanation of these things is that the emotions are in an aspect of a fetus, three within three.
That is, only the externality of <i>NeHi”Y</i> [is revealed]. Included within them, in a concealed manner, are <i>ChaBa”D</i> and <i>ChaGa”T</i>.
[This is to say that] these are only the [instinctual] nature of the emotions.
Through suckling (<i>Yenikah</i>), they become developed and prepared to receive intellect. This is similar to an infant whose limbs grow from suckling his mother’s milk, as known.
[This continues] until when he is six years of age his emotions have intellect, but in a very limited fashion.
However, [now] his actions and ways have an aspect [and degree] of reasoning and intellect, and are not just the natural instinctive emotions [that are] only like those of an animal.
This continues until he is nine years of age, at which point he is capable of procreation.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 68a</i>
At this point he has an aspect of additional growth of his intellect, more than what is necessary for the emotions alone.
Moreover, it now is possible for the beginning of an emotion that comes into being only according to intellect and reasoning, and if the intellect dictates the opposite, then an opposite emotion will be born, until his emotions are entirely according to [the dictates of] the intellect.
In contrast, prior to the age of nine he only had intellect according to the emotions that were already [instinctively] embedded in him, which he can have insight into.
This [type of intellect] is also found in wild animals and domesticated animals, that they have insight within their [natural] emotions to find food and sustenance, except that in mankind [this aspect] is called “the animal of the speaker – <i>Chai SheB’Medaber</i>.” This will suffice those of understanding.
From nine years of age and up, he is prepared for the second maturation, [which is] from <i>Abba</i>.
This is to say that [now] it is possible for the intellect to overpower the emotions, (as explained elsewhere at length regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 23:9; See Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe), Balak 103d.</i> “From the pinnacles of the boulders etc.”).
Because of this he is capable of procreation, since now each <i>sefirah</i> [of the emotions] includes the nine <i>sefirot</i> of <i>ChaBa”D, ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i>.
This is because when the aspect of the intellect of <i>ChaBa”D</i> of each emotion is developed, then automatically the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> has the power to give birth to offspring, for the two are interdependent (as explained at length in chapter twenty six).
When he was six years of age each emotion included only <i>ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i> and the intellect was very constricted, according to the limitations of the natural instincts of the emotions alone.
The second maturation is from the age of thirteen until twenty,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Teshuvah (of the Mittler Rebbe), Vol. 1, pg. 7a.</i> during which [time] he is capable of selling the [movable] properties of his father.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 155a; 156a; Likkutei Torah BaMidbar 2a; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch pg. 519; Kuntres HaHitpaalut (sections on “intellectual love and fear”); Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe) Balak ibid.; Etz Chayim, Shaar 25, Drush 6.</i>
This is the aspect of <i>Keter</i> and <i>ChaBa”D</i> of each emotion. [In other words,] this is the aspect of the [active] persuasion of the desire of each emotion, from higher than the intellect of that emotion etc.
[This stage of development continues] until the age of twenty, which is the maturity of the intellect of the emotions in their complete state.
[This is because now] he knows how to sell the [immovable] properties of his father, that is, with the brains of <i>Abba</i> (Father) which is the source of the emotions, to transfer it from one domain to another etc.
For example, this is like the changes [he can make] in the combinations of the letters of the intellect, which comes because of the root and source of the depth of the intellect in its essential source, specifically.
(This is as previously explained with the analogy of an outstandingly wise individual etc.)
This then, is the aspect of “<i>Yisroel</i> – ישראל,” [the letters of which spell] “<i>Li Rosh</i> – לי ראש,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Pri Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaLulav</i>) Shaar 29, Ch. 1. Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra, Vol. 1, pg. 75; Shaarei Teshuvah (of the Mittler Rebbe) 94d.</i> meaning “A head” and intellect “for me,” which are the aspects of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Chochmah, Binah</i> and <i>Da’at</i>.
This is because, then [the intellect] is in an aspect of a much more mature state and is capable of refining the aspect of <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן-52 [יו״ד ה״ה ו״ו ה״ה], which is the aspect of <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם, as known, because, “from <i>Chochmah</i> (חכמה),” that is, from the inner aspect of the <i>Koach Ma”H</i> (כח מ״ה) specifically,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Raayah Mehemna</i>) 28a; 34a.</i> which is from the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> [as it radiates] within the emotions, “they are clarified.”
This is analogous to a very wise person. The more he knows the [subject] to the depth of the matter, at its first source, the more he knows how to clarify and refine it, to remove the errors etc.
Likewise, his wisdom will stand by him, so that he can support himself with his profession and profit from his work. This is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 11a; Also see Torat Chayim, Bereshit 2c; Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 8.</i> “His Torah learning is his profession.”
This then, is the [explanation of] the matter of “It is the nature of man to conquer etc.,” which is the aspect of the name of <i>Ma”H</i>-מ"ה-45 [יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א] of <i>Chochmah</i> (חכ<b>מה)</b> which refines [the name of] <i>Ba”N</i>-ב"ן-52 [יו״ד ה״ה ו״ו ה״ה] etc., and this is the meaning of “You have ruled over <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם.” This will suffice those of understanding.

Chapter 35

This then, is the aspect of <i>Yisroel</i> (ישראל), that is, “The Ruler of <i>E-l – Sar E-l</i> – שר א״ל.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Pri Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaKriyat Shma</i>) Shaar 8, Ch. 9; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577, pg. 271.</i> In other words, [he is thus called] because of the radiance of <i>Keter</i> within <i>Chochmah</i>, which is called “<i>E-l</i>-א״ל<i>,</i> the light of <i>Chochmah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 94a; Zohar III 30b, 31a, 65a; Also see chapter twenty-six above, regarding the words “The Supernal God – <i>E”l Elyon –</i> א״ל עליון.”</i>
For, <i>Keter</i> is what overrules, as explained elsewhere regarding the meaning of [the verse,] “Because you have ruled etc.”
We must now understand the matter of the unification of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Leah</i>, which is the unification of the emotions with thought, which is called <i>Leah</i>. In addition, [we must also understand] the unification of <i>Yaakov</i> and <i>Rachel</i> which is the unification of the emotions with speech.
[However,] we must first understand the difference between <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Yaakov</i>.
This is because the aspect of <i>Yaakov</i> is the aspect of <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is the quality of Mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 87b, 157b; Zohar III 302a; Also see Pardes Rimonim (<i>Shaar Erchei HaKinuyim</i>) Shaar 23, Section on “<i>Rachamim</i>” and “<i>Tiferet</i>.”</i>
As known, the forefathers are “the chariot” [of the supernal qualities].
<i>Avraham</i> is in the aspect of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 47b; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Kuntreisim, pg. 4.</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, <i>Yitzchak</i> is in the aspect of <i>Gevurah</i> - Judgment,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Pardes Rimonim (<i>Shaar Erchei HaKinuyim</i>) Shaar 24, Ch. 3 (Section on <i>Gevurah</i>).</i> and <i>Yaakov</i> is the aspect of <i>Tiferet</i> – Mercy.
[Likewise,] it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 7:20</i> “Give truth to <i>Yaakov</i>; Kindness to <i>Avraham</i> etc.”
[Moreover,] regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 2:12</i> “And you shall give me a sign (<i>Ot-</i>אות) of truth,” it states in the <i>Zohar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 2a; Also see Sefer HaMaamarim 5565, Vol. 1, pg. 368.</i> “This is the letter (<i>Ot-</i>אות) <i>Vav</i>-ו.” This is the aspect of <i>Yaakov</i> who is the middle line, “The middle beam… [that passes through from one end to the other”].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 26:28; Also see Zohar II 175b. Similarly, it states (Genesis 25:27), “And the boys grew: and Esav was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; while <i>Yaakov</i> was a pure man (<i>Ish Tam</i>), dwelling in tents.” It is explained (Zohar I 146a) that the word “tents - <i>Ohalim</i>” is plural and teaches us that the aspect of <i>Yaakov</i> (<i>Tiferet</i>) dwells between the tent of <i>Avraham</i> (<i>Chessed</i>) and the tent of <i>Yitzchak</i> (<i>Gevurah</i>).</i>
As known, [the explanation of] the matter is that the right line [which consists] of <i>Chochmah, Chessed</i> and <i>Netzach,</i> is negated by the left line [which consists] of <i>Binah, Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i>.
For example, this is similar to how the quality of judgment negates the quality of kindness and limits its light.
]Likewise,[ the opposite [is true], that kindness limits the light of judgment.
We therefore find that both may cease. This cannot be called “Truth-<i>Emet-</i>אמת,” since the principal [definition] of Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת is that it endures [forever], as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 12:19</i> “The lip of truth will be established forever; but a lying tongue is but for a moment.”
[In contrast,] falsehood is deceit (<i>Kazav</i> – כזב), as in the terminology,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Using the terminology of Isaiah 58:11</i> “[A spring of water] whose waters fail” (<i>Yekazvoo Meimav</i> –י<b>כזב</b>ו מימיו). As known, [under such conditions] the river [which is drawn from the waters of the spring] will cease.
However, the quality of Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת, is that it endures [forever]. This is because it includes the two opposites of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> [within itself]<i>.</i> [Therefore,] nothing at all obstructs it or opposes it. Because of this, “its waters do not fail.”
This then, is [the meaning of the statement in the <i>Zohar</i> that] “the letter of Truth is the letter <i>Vav</i>-ו,” which is the middle line that includes both <i>Chessed</i>-Kindness and <i>Gevurah</i>-Judgment. This [middle line] is <i>Da’at, Tiferet</i> and <i>Yesod</i> (as stated previously in chapter twenty-one).
Now, there is another benefit in the middle line of <i>DaTi”Y</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acronym for the three <i>sefirot</i> of the middle line, <i>Da’at, Tiferet,</i> and <i>Yesod</i>.</i> in that it does not [undergo] change from beginning to end. Just as it is in the beginning, so is it in the end.
It does not undergo change as a result of the length of being drawn down.
This is because of the connection [and unity] that there is in its entirety, [so that] from beginning to end it is unified as a single entity. [In this way] it is like “the inner beam…that passes through” from the highest end to the lowest end.
This is not the case, however, with the other two lines. [That is,] in the right and left [lines] there is no aspect of a connection and bond of each [of the <i>Sefirot</i> with the other <i>Sefirot</i> of that line].
As a result, we do not find that their end is similar to their beginning.
An example of this is [the right line of] <i>ChaCha”N</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acronym for the three <i>sefirot</i> of the right line, <i>Chochmah</i>, <i>Chessed</i>, and <i>Netzach</i>.</i> We find that in <i>Netzach</i> (Conquest) there is a [qualitative] diminishment of the light of the influence [of <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness]. This is likewise the case in [regard to the <i>sefirah</i> of] <i>Hod</i> (Splendor).
As known in [regard to] the [explanation of] the matter of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod.</i> They are called, “The two branches of the Willow (<i>Aravot</i>)<i>,</i> which lack flavor and scent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Vayikra Rabba 30; See Zohar I 220b, (and the Mikdash Melech there); <i>Zohar</i> III 193b; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bamidbar, Vol. 5, pg. 1,868; See also Shaar HaEmunah 101b.</i>
This is because the radiance of the intellect ceases in them, since <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness) is merely a branch of <i>Chochmah</i> (Wisdom)<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 21.</i> and the principal intellect and reasoning of the kindness has already withdrawn and passed.
[The intellect] only remains in [the kindness] in a way of <i>Tzimtzum</i> - lessening and concealment.
Although it still possesses [the intellect] within itself in a concealed manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Teshuvah (of the Mittler Rebbe) 114b and on; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bamidbar, Vol. 5, pg. 1,867 and on; Na”Ch pg. 179.</i> there is nonetheless a separation from [the intellect], and there is not such a great connection and bond between them.
For example, [it states],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> “<i>Chessed</i> is the right arm,” that is, [this refers to] the strength of the right arm which is separate from the brain etc.
[Likewise,] the aspect of <i>Netzach</i>, which is merely the victory of the commitment, is already more separate from the brains of <i>Chochmah,</i> since all that remains within it, is a faint impression of the love and kindness [of the heartfelt emotions].
This is similar to the “right thigh,” which is separate from the kindness of the “right arm,” for there is no [direct] bond between the thigh and the hand.
The same is true of the “left hand” and the “left thigh” which are the aspects of the left line of <i>BoGa”H</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acronym for the three <i>sefirot</i> of the left line, <i>Binah, Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i>.</i> The [<i>sefirot</i> of the left line] are separated one from the other.
Therefore, we do not find their beginning in their end. This is because of the cessation of the intellectual radiance, so that there can be a complete [qualitative] lessening [and diminishment], as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:26 (and Rashi there)</i> “And the hollow of Yaakov’s thigh was strained.”
This is to say that [the angel] hit him in the aspect of <i>Netzach</i>, “in the sinew of the thigh-vein,”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:33</i> to the point that the external [forces of impurity] receive [their sustenance] from there.
This is in accordance with the statement in <i>Zohar</i> regarding the thigh of a <i>Sota</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the verses, (Genesis 32:26) “And Yaakov was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him etc.” and, “He saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh,” the Zohar (Mishpatim 111b) explains that the <i>Sitra Achara</i> (the side of evil) persevered over the thigh, i.e. <i>Netzach</i>, of <i>Yaakov</i>, and “won” it from him. The Zohar then continues to explain that the aspect of the “thigh” (i.e., <i>Netzach</i>) of the aspect of Yaakov was weakened until the Prophet Shmuel came and rectified it. (It explains there that its weakness was that it did not draw down the light of prophecy. As is explained elsewhere, prophecy is primarily revealed through the aspects of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i>.) From the time of Shmuel onward the <i>Sitra Achara</i> does not have dominion over the aspect of the thigh of <i>Yaakov</i>. Rather, the forces of evil and concealment now receive their sustenance from another “thigh,” the thigh of the adulteress (<i>Sota</i>). As scripture states regarding the adulteress - <i>Sotah</i> (Numbers 5:22), “These waters that cause curse shall enter your innards to distend the stomach and cause the thigh to fall.” The reason for this is because the <i>Sitra Achara</i> itself is compared to an adulteress, as stated (Proverbs 2:17), “Who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.” (See Zohar II 111b; Numbers 5:21, 27.)</i>
This also is the reason why regarding <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> themselves it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 56a</i> “<i>Yishmael</i> came out of <i>Avraham</i>,” for he is the excess and dregs of the Kindnesses (<i>Chassadim</i>). [It likewise states,] “<i>Esav</i> came out of <i>Yitzchak</i>” [referring to] the excess and dregs of the Judgments (<i>Gevurot</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 31, Ch. 2</i>
However, <i>Yaakov</i> is the aspect of the middle line of <i>DaTi”Y,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The middle line, <i>Da’at, Tiferet,</i> and <i>Yesod</i>.</i> In this line there is a connection and bond from its beginning to its end, so much so, that its end is found to be the same as its beginning, literally.
(For example, as known, it is impossible for an erection to occur without <i>Da’at</i> (concentration and interest) which [takes place] in the head.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 53b</i> We, therefore, find that the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> and the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> in the brain of the head, are bound together as if they are one entity.)
This is because <i>Da’at</i>, [which] is an inner [light], radiates and is bound up to the compassion of the heart. They are one at all times, literally.
This is similar to the statement in <i>Zohar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar<i>,</i> Tikkun 13 (28a); Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 8</i> “<i>Moshe</i> is inside and <i>Yaakov</i> is outside.”
This is the aspect of <i>Da’at,</i> which is the innerness of the emotions of compassion.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim<i>,</i> Ch. 11</i>
This is because the measure of mercy will literally be commensurate to the measure of <i>Da’at</i>.
Moreover, whoever does not have <i>Da’at</i> is cruel, such as children, or the like. [However], the more one increases his <i>Da’at</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 1:18</i> the more will he feel merciful.
This is because, as explained elsewhere at length, there is no interruption whatsoever between <i>Da’at</i> and <i>Rachamim</i> (Mercy), as there is between the aforementioned aspects of <i>Chochmah</i> (Wisdom) and <i>Chessed</i> (Kindness).
[Furthermore,] there most certainly is a bond [of the <i>Daat</i>] with the influence of <i>Yesod</i>, which is the aspect of the connection of the influencer to the recipient.
This [connection] comes about instantaneously from <i>Da’at</i>, as in [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 4:1</i> “And Adam <b>knew</b> Eve [his wife; and she conceived and bore etc.]”
(There is an internal aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> which are the “Kidneys that give council,” and the innerness of <i>Yesod</i> is the “End of the body; [the sign of the holy covenant].” The externality of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i>, [however,] are “the two thighs.”)<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Brachot 61a; Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a; Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 13 (29a).</i>
This is in accordance with the statement in <i>Zohar Bereishit</i> regarding [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:9</i> “Let the waters [under the heaven] be gathered into one place.” This is the aspect of <i>Yesod</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 18a &amp; 33a.</i> within which all the influence gathers. It is thus called, “The ingathering of all the lights.”
This then, is the aspect of the middle line, [which is, “The inner beam] that passes through… from one end to the other.”
It is for this reason that [the middle line] is called “Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת,” which is made of the letters <i>Aleph</i>-א, <i>Mem</i>-מ, and <i>Tav</i>-ת. [These letters are] the first, middle, and last letters of the [Hebrew] <i>Aleph-Bet</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Bereshit Rabba 81:2 – <b>א</b>'ב'ג'ד'ה'ו'ז'ח'ט'י'כ'ך'ל'<b>מ</b>'ם'נ'ן'ס'ע'פ'ף'צ'ץ'ק'ר'ש'<b>ת</b>'</i> for, as [Truth] is in its beginning, so is it in its end, this being the principal aspect of Truth.
Because of this [the sages] stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Taanit 5b</i> “Yaakov did not die,” since, because of this very reason, death (<i>Mavet</i>), which is the root of the external shells (<i>Kelipot</i>), has no foothold whatsoever in the middle line.
It is for this reason that it states, “You have ruled over <i>Elohi”m</i>-אלהי״ם,” [which is] the aspect of <i>Ba”N</i>-ב״ן-52.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">יו״ד ה״ה ו״ו ה״ה</i>
Now, this specifically [refers to] the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> and <i>Chochmah</i> which are in the head of <i>Yisroel</i>-ישראל [which spells] “a head for me-<i>Li Rosh</i>-לי ראש,” as explained previously. Because of this [the angel] told him,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 35:10</i> “<i>Yisroel-</i>ישראל shall be your name.”
However, this is not the case in regard to [the aspect of] <i>Yaakov</i>. [This is because] the aspects of <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod,</i> which are the “two thighs,” come from the powers of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Avraham</i> and <i>Yitzchak.</i>
Thus, for the reason stated above, [the angel was able to] hit him in the hollow of his thigh, which is the aspect of <i>Netzach</i> of the right line.
In contrast, regarding <i>Yisroel-</i>ישראל it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel I 15:29</i> “And also the <i>Netzach</i> of <i>Yisroel-</i>ישראל does not lie etc.”
This is because <i>Yisroel-</i>ישראל is the inner aspect of the emotions of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>, which is the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> of the middle line, about which it states, “For you have ruled etc.”
Likewise, [the reason for the statement] “<i>Yaakov</i> did not die,” is because it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Job 4:21</i> “They die, but not in wisdom.”
(Similarly, the Sages stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 133a</i> “<i>Yaakov</i> serves in the heights,” which refers to <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, for, “Great is <i>De’ah</i> [since it was placed between two Divine Names].”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 33a – The verse (Samuel I 2:3) states, “For <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is a God-<i>E”l</i>-א״ל of knowledge<i>-Ki E-l De’ot HaShem</i>-כי א״ל דעות יהו״ה,” thus placing the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> (<i>De’ot-</i>דעות) between the two Holy Names of God-<i>El</i>-א״ל and the Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה. The sages thus stated, “Great is <i>Da’eh</i> since it was placed between two Divine Names.” The <i>Maharsha</i> (to Brachot ibid.) explains this statement of the Talmud to mean that the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> exists between the aspects of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>.</i> This is higher than the “chest,”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The “Chest” refers to the emotional <i>sefirot</i> of <i>ChaGa”T</i>, as previously explained.</i> as explained elsewhere.)
However, this is all in regard to the <b>source</b> of <i>Yaakov</i>, which is much higher, in the aspect of the middle line of <i>DaTi”Y</i>, for the above mentioned reason.
However, in regard to the externality of the emotions of <i>Yaakov</i> it states, “He hit him in the hollow of his thigh,” as explained elsewhere. This will suffice those of understanding.

Chapter 36

Now, it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 37:2</i> “These are the offspring of <i>Yaakov</i>; <i>Yosef</i>.”
[<i>Yosef</i>] is the aspect of <i>Yesod</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Ra’ayah Mehemnah</i>) 236a; Zohar at the beginning of Parashat Noach; Pardes Rimonim, Shaar Erchey HaKinuyim (<i>Shaar</i> 23) section on <i>Yosef</i>.</i> which is the aspect of the “Upper Righteous One” (<i>Tzadik Elyon</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Orah (of the Mittler Rebbe) 27a; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat Mekeitz pg. 297-299.</i>
He is also called “the small <i>Vav</i>” (<i>Vav Ze’ira</i>) etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III 74b – That is, <i>Yaakov</i> (<i>Tiferet</i>) is called the “Big <i>Vav</i>-ו,” as explained at length in the previous chapter. In contrast, <i>Yosef</i> (<i>Yesod</i>) is called the “Small <i>Vav</i>” and is a lesser extension of the “Big <i>Vav</i>-ו<i>.</i>”</i>
Now, the explanation of these things is known regarding the matter of [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Chronicles I 29:11</i> “Yours, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, is the greatness (<i>Gedulah</i>) and the might (<i>Gevurah</i>) and the glory (<i>Tiferet</i>), the victory (<i>Netzach</i>), and the majesty (<i>Hod</i>):] for all (<i>Ki Kol-</i>כי כל)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Orah of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as Gates of Light, Shaar 2 (<i>Yesod</i>) – <i>Yesod</i> is called by the title “All-<i>Kol-</i>כל,” because it draws influence from all the upper <i>Sefirot</i> which are above it and brings it down to <i>Malchut.</i> Since all existence is dependent on this, it is thus called by the title All-<i>Kol-</i>כל. Furthermore, the words “כי כל-<i>Ki Kol-</i>80” share the same numerical value as the word <i>Yesod</i>-יסוד-80<i>.</i></i> that is in the heavens and on earth is yours.”
The [Aramaic] translation of this [latter part of the verse] is, “He unites the heavens and [the earth].” This is the aspect of the light of the influence of <i>Yesod</i>, the Upper Righteous One, who is called “the life of the worlds.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 193b; See the liturgy of the <i>Baruch She’Amar</i> in the morning prayers; Shaarei Orah of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Shaar 2 (<i>Yesod</i>); Also see Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, pg. 86d; Pirush HaMilot pg. 77c.</i>
By way of analogy, one who understands the light of an [intellectual] concept, in and of himself, but does not have the power to bring the light of this concept forth, to influence it outside [of himself] to a recipient,
behold, this is still only the aspect of the essence of this influence, as it is in himself.
However, one who is capable of bringing it out as an influence and revelation to recipients, is called the aspect of <i>Yesod</i>.
He is called, “He who unites [the heavens and the earth],” drawing forth [influence] from the influencer to the recipient.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 97:11.</i> “Light (<i>Ohr</i>-אור) is sown for the righteous,” and it states about light,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3</i> “[And God saw the light,] that it was good (<i>Tov</i>-<i>טוב</i>),” just as the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> is called “Good-<i>Tov</i>-טוב,”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 60a; Shaarei Orah of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Shaar 2 (<i>Yesod</i>); Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim p. 224.</i> as in [the statement],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Tanya, Shaar HaYichud VeHa’Emunah, Ch. 4; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim p. 5; Also see Torat Chayim, Bereishit, p. 30b and footnote 4 there.</i> “It is the nature of the good to bestow goodness” specifically to another.
Thus, the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> is called “Righteous – <i>Tzadik</i>” and “Good – <i>Tov</i>,” as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 3:10</i> “Say of the righteous (<i>Tzaddik</i>-צדיק), that he is good (<i>Tov</i>-טוב),” and it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 11:7</i> “For <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is righteous, He loves righteousness,” that is,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 57:15</i> “to revive the spirit of the humble,” and as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:9</i> “<i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה is good (<i>Tov</i>-טוב) to all (<i>Kol</i>-כל).”
(Moreover, the word “<i>Tov</i>-Good-טוב” has a numerical value of seventeen,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah (of the Arizal), Vayeshev; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bereishit<i>,</i> pg. 294 and pg. 328; Shaarei Orah (of the Mittler Rebbe), pg. 170.</i> that is, א"ה ו"ה-17, which are the first letters of the words [of the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:1; Jeremiah 23:24; See Zohar Hashmatot, 251a; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim p. 225.</i> “<b>א</b>ת <b>ה</b>שמים <b>ו</b>את <b>ה</b>ארץ – The Heavens and The Earth,” that is, “He unites the heavens and the earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Hashmatot, pg. 251a – The first two letters of this name (א''ה) are the first two letters of the name אהי״ה which is <i>Keter,</i> whereas the last two letters of this name (ו''ה) are the last two letters of the Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, which represent the lower levels of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukva</i> (<i>Malchut</i>)<i>.</i> As the <i>Zohar</i> states on the words, <b>א</b>ת <b>ה</b>שמים <b>ו</b>את <b>ה</b>ארץ – The heavens and the earth, “These words form the acrostic אהו''ה, for with this name the heaven and the earth were created. The heavens were created with the א''ה and the earth and everything therein were created with the ו''ה.” We thus see that this name אהו״ה represents the union of the higher levels (the heavens) with the lower levels (the earth).</i>
This is the aspect of the connection of the influencer to the recipient, as known, and as explained elsewhere.
[The aspect of <i>Yesod</i>] is also called “Peace-<i>Shalom</i>-שלום”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That is, it is the aspect of the bond between two things, the upper and lower, the Giver and recipient. (See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim<i>,</i> p. 226.)</i> and “Covenant-<i>Breet</i>-ברית,” as [the verse states] regarding Pinchas,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 25:12; Also see Yalkut Reuveni, Parashat Korach; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat Mikeitz<i>,</i> pg. 293; <i>Hemshech</i> 5672, pg. 1.</i> “Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace (<i>Breetee Shalom</i>-בריתי שלום).”
This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the difference between the innerness of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which is <i>Yosef</i>, and the externality of <i>Yesod</i>, which is the aspect of <i>Noach</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Parashat Mikeitz, pg. 292.</i> who is [also] called “righteous” and “perfect,”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 5:9</i> as stated in <i>Zohar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar, beginning of <i>Parshat Noach</i>; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim p. 225.</i>)
This then, is [the aspect of] the “small <i>Vav</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntresim, L’Habin Shoresh Inyan Chevley Moshiach<i>.</i></i> which is the aspect of the collecting and gathering of the light and influence of the emotional qualities of <i>Yaakov</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">i.e <i>Zeir Anpin.</i></i> that were explained above.
This then, is [the meaning of,] “These are the offspring of <i>Yaakov</i>; <i>Yosef</i>.” That is, the aspect of the offspring [that is, the influence] of the emotions is specifically through <i>Yosef</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. <i>Yesod.</i></i> this being the “Light” that is “sown for the Righteous” [who receives from and is thus called] the “Eighteen Worlds” (<i>Chay Almin</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 18) 31b, 33a; Pardes Rimonim, Shaar 3, Ch. 5, Shaar 15, Ch. 2; See Torat Chayim, Parshat Noach, pg. 53a; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Shemot Vol. 2, Parshat Zachor, pg. 499a; Siddur HaAri’zal, Kavanat HaLulav – The Eighteen worlds relate to the eighteen vertebrae of the spinal cord which is shaped like a <i>Vav</i> (ו)<i>.</i> It is specifically the spine which a) holds up the entire body and is thus the foundation of the body, and b) brings the influence down and thereby connects the <i>Daat</i> of the brain, all the way down to the lowest extremity of the body, which is <i>Yesod</i>. This being the case, <i>Yesod</i>, which is likened to the male reproductive organ, is considered to be the final extension from the spinal cord. This is because the influence of life force begins in conception as it exists in the brain, until it makes its way through the spinal cord and finally comes out of the male organ to impregnate the female. Because of this <i>Yesod</i> is likewise called, <i>Chay Almin-חי עלמין,</i> which means “The Life of the Worlds” and also means, “The Eighteen Worlds.” Since <i>Yesod</i> receives the final life force and influence through the spinal cord, it is also called <i>Chay Chooliot HaShedra-</i>The Eighteen Vertebrae of the Spine.</i>
Furthermore, it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 92:13</i> “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree and grow great like a cedar in the Lebanon.” For, the source of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> is in <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> and <i>Atik Yomin</i>, which transcend the intellect.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Pirush HaMilot of the Mittler Rebbe<i>,</i> Ch. 133</i>
For, “their beginning is bound with their end”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Pirush HaMilot<i>,</i> Ch. 76.</i> in that <i>Yesod</i> is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> “the extremity of the body.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim<i>,</i> pg. 225-226.</i>
It is for this reason that the principal pleasure [is felt] specifically at the end of the influencing, as known regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:2; Also see Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar HaMilah 139b; Likkutei Torah (of the Alter Rebbe)<i>,</i> Tazria 20d.</i> “[And by the seventh day] God had ended [His work which He had done] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admur HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim pg. 227-232.</i>
(This is also the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 39:6</i> “And <i>Yosef</i> was well built [and good looking].” That is,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Bereshit Rabba 84</i> “His appearance resembled the beauty of <i>Yaakov</i>” – which is the aspect of <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> – “And the appearance of <i>Yaakov</i> resembled the beauty of <i>Adam Kadma’a</i> (The Primal Man),”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 48a</i> – which is the aspect of <i>Arich Anpin</i> and <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc.)<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See Pirush HaMilot<i>,</i> Ch. 75-76.</i>
Now, regarding the words [of the aforementioned verse,] “These are the offspring-<i>Eileh Toldot</i>-אלה תולדות;” This refers to the aspect of the “six directions” of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, each of which also includes six,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The six “directions” of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> are the three heartfelt emotions, <i>Chessed, Gevurah, Tiferet,</i> and the three gut emotions, <i>Netzach, Hod</i> and <i>Yesod,</i> each of which is also made up of six. <i>Chessed</i> is made up of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Chessed, Gevurah</i> of <i>Chessed, Tiferet</i> of <i>Chessed</i> etc. <i>Gevurah</i> is made up of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Gevurah, Gevurah</i> of <i>Gevurah, Tiferet</i> of <i>Gevurah</i> etc. The same principle applies to all six qualities, totaling a sum of thirty-six qualities.</i> thus totaling 36 which is the numerical value of the word “these are-<i>Eileh</i>-אלה.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah (of the Alter Rebbe), Pikudei 4c; Also see Torat Chayim<i>,</i> Noach 56b, and note 15 there.</i>
However, there can be no “offspring” without an additional influence of new intellect from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>, which is brought about by means of the maturation of <i>Keter, Chochmah, Binah</i> and <i>Da’at</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as previously explained.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah, Pekudei<i>,</i> Sections 4-6.</i>
(In the above, we again [observe] the aspect of a single <i>Hitbonenut</i> contemplation that includes many particulars in one general point, that is, from <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) until the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
(This is in the same manner previously described regarding <i>Zeir Anpin</i> in general,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">See chapter 33.</i> which is the end of the world of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>).)
This is in accordance with what is written regarding King Solomon,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Kings I 5:13</i> “[He spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in the Lebanon to the hyssop that is in the wall.]”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The configuration of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> is called by the term, The Tree of Life-<i>Eitz Chayim-</i>עץ חיים. As explained above in chapter 22, the ten <i>Sefirot</i> not only exist as ten general qualities, but rather every single level and aspect is also subdivided into ten and those, in turn, are further subdivided into ten etc. This means that the “Tree of Life” exists on all levels, from the highest to the lowest levels. This is the meaning of, “He spoke of trees (i.e. the ten <i>Sefirot</i> as they exist throughout <i>Seder Hishtalshelut-</i>The Chaining Down) from the cedar tree that is in the Lebanon (i.e. from the highest level) to the hyssop that is in the wall (i.e. all the way down to the level of the “hyssop in the wall” which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> as it unifies with and influences <i>Malchut.</i>)</i> The words “from the cedar tree that is in the Lebanon” refers to the simple essential pleasure that is in the Essential Self of the light of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, when the desire of “I will rule” arose in His simple will.
The words “to the hyssop that is in the wall” refers to the aspect of the “small <i>Vav</i>,” that is, the immaturity of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, in its influencing and union with <i>Malchut</i> which is called “the wall.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 228b; Zohar II 133a</i>
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Kings II 20:2</i> “Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed etc.,” and likewise it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Kings II 4:10</i> “Pray, let us make a loft with a wall etc.,”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The word used for “wall” here is “<i>Keer-</i>קיר.” The <i>Zohar</i> states that in the Greek language <i>Keer-</i>קיר means Lord-<i>Adon</i>-אדון and is thus a euphemism for the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Malchut-</i>Kingdom. This is because the Divine name associated with <i>Malchut</i> is <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה title my Lord-<i>Adona”y</i>-אדנ״י. (See Zohar I 228; Also see Sefer HaMaamarim 5643-5644, pg. 310.)</i> which refers to <i>Malchut</i>, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i>.
This, then, is the meaning of, “The righteous man shall flourish like the palm tree,” that is, he ascends to the “seventy years”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III 16a, 24a; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Shemot Vol. 1, pg. 225.</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> and there “he will grow like a cedar in the Lebanon” in an aspect of the limitlessness of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), literally. This will suffice those of understanding.)
(It is also explained elsewhere that <i>Yosef</i> is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaTzelem</i>), Shaar 23, Ch. 3; Also see Biurei Zohar<i>,</i> Tisa 54c; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bereshit pg. 294, and Na”Ch pg. 118.</i> “an orphan from his mother,” but not from his father.
The [letters of the] word “orphan – <i>Yatom</i>” (יתום) form an acronym for [the words of the verse,] “[And <i>Yosef</i> was] well-built and good looking – <b>י</b>פה <b>ת</b>אר <b>ו</b>יפה <b>מ</b>ראה.”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 4; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Mikeitz pg. 293-294.</i>
Now, the reason that “he is an orphan from his mother” is because the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Imma</i> is short<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 10; See also Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit L’Shabbat 187d; Pirush HaMilot 43b and 43c; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch pg. 118.</i> and withdraws and becomes concealed during the birth of the emotions. For, as is clearly observable, when emotions are aroused the intellect withdraws.
It is for this reason that it states that <i>Binah</i> only spreads forth until <i>Hod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, but not until <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (<i>Raaya Mehemna</i>) 244b; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bereishit pg. 222.</i>
That is, it only [spreads forth] until [it causes] the aspect of the acknowledgment (<i>Hoda’ah</i>) which comes about because of the intellect.
However, it does not spread forth until <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which is the aspect of the essential connection of the heart, within which there is a glimmer from the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Abba</i>.
[That is, the aspect of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Abba</i>] is the aspect of the connection to the essential light of the concept, prior to its [investment] within the comprehension. Regarding this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 1:16</i> “My heart has seen much wisdom etc.,” [that is, this is] the sight of the intellect within the heart of flesh, specifically in <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
It is the aspect of the nullification that is drawn forth in the breath of the chest and heart, and as stated in <i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II (<i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>) 116b.</i> “With the eye of the intellect, which is in the heart, one can see everything.”
This is because the <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Abba</i> is longer than that of <i>Imma</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 10; Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit L’Shabbat 187d; Pirush HaMilot 43b and 43c; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch 118.</i> and is drawn forth until <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> even after the light of <i>Binah</i> has withdrawn.
Thus, [<i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>] is called “an orphan from his mother” but not from his father etc., as is explained elsewhere at length.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”ch, pg. 118-119.</i>
This is also the matter of, “These are the offspring of <i>Yaakov</i>;” that is, the seminal drop of <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Abba</i> [<i>Yaakov</i>] is the [source of the] aspect of “<i>Yosef</i>,” that is, <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>. This will suffice those of understanding.)

However, we must first explain the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 27:22</i> “The voice is the voice of <i>Yaakov</i>,” for there is an inner unheard voice [and an outer heard voice].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 50b; Also See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim, pg. 308 (citing Zohar); See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar HaLulav 264d; Biurei Zohar, Balak 107c; Sefer HaMaamarim 5668, Vol. 1, pg. 253; Pirush HaMilot, Ch. 30; Sidur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit L’Shabbat 181b; Torah Ohr, Bereishit 6d; Likkutei Torah, Netzavim 47b, and Shir HaShirim 12b and elsewhere.</i>
Since, as known regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:3; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra<i>,</i> Vol. 2, pg. 472.</i> “Day to day speech streams forth – יום ליום יביע אמר”; that the [word for “speech-<i>Omer</i>-אמר”] is [an acrostic for] “Fire-<i>Aish</i>-<b>א</b>ש,” “Water-<i>Mayim</i>-<b>מ</b>ים,” and “Air-<i>Ruach</i>-<b>ר</b>וח,” that is, <i>Chessed, Gevurah</i> and <i>Tiferet</i> (Kindness, Sternness and Compassion).
[This is to say,] that just as the [physical] voice is composed of the physical qualities of fire, water, and air, so too, the breath of the heart itself includes the spiritual qualities of fire, water and air.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II (<i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>) 43b; 184b; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra, Vol. 2, pg. 651; Also see Torat Chayim, Bereishit 39d, and footnote 26 there.</i>
These are the aspects of <i>Chessed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>, and the intermediate quality [of <i>Tiferet</i>] which is the air (or vapor).
In other words, [this corresponds to] the aspects of the constriction or spreading forth of the spiritual breath of the heart.
For example, when a person is happy, there then is an aspect of the spreading forth of light [and vitality] in his heart. This is the breath of the Kindnesses (<i>Chassadim</i>).
In contrast, when he is depressed, there is an aspect of constriction and withdrawal. This is the aspect of the breath of Judgments (<i>Gevurot</i>).
The intermediary between <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>, is the spiritual breath that is an intermediary composed of both <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>.
This is like the air [or vapor] (<i>Ruach</i>) of the physical breath, which is an intermediary composed of both fire and water.
As known, thirst results from the element of fire (<i>Aish</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Tanya Ch. 3</i>
Similarly, regarding the physical voice it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 69:4</i> “My throat was raspy,” which comes about from an intensity of the element of fire in the breath of the heart.
The opposite is a clear [resonating] voice from the element of water (<i>Mayim</i>) of the breath of the heart.
The intermediary, which is the vapor (<i>Ruach</i>), is an admixture [of the two].
This is likewise true of [the emotions conveyed in] the intermediate voice, which contains an admixture of both joy and bitterness or sadness. It is called, “A delightful voice to the soul”; which specifically depends on the proportions of the spiritual admixture in the breath of the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Torat Chayim Bereishit<i>,</i> 39d.</i>
Similarly, the spirit of life [and vitality] in the right and left ventricles [of the heart] is in a constant state of “running and returning” (<i>Ratzo V’Shoov</i>) with the heartbeat, as known that this too is in an aspect of constriction and spreading forth.
(However, here the opposite of the above takes place. For, when the spirit of life enters the heart from [the nervous system that extends from] the brain, the heart contracts to receive it. On the other hand, when it withdraws, the heart spreads forth.
This is because the vitality is specifically in a manner of “running and returning etc.,”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is also in accordance with the verse (Ezekiel 1:14), “The <i>Chayot</i> [angels] were running and returning.” Although in this verse the word “<i>Chayot</i>-חיות” refers to the Angels who are called “<i>Chayot HaKodesh</i>,” nonetheless, the word “<i>Chayot</i>-חיות” can also be translated as “life force” or “vitality” (<i>Chayoot-</i>חיות).</i> as explained in medical books.)
Now, all the above is called “The voice that is heard” in speech, this being the aspect of the vapor and breath of the speech.
This is the aspect of the “voice – <i>Kol</i>” and “speech – <i>Diboor</i>” which is mentioned in many places in <i>Zohar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 36a, 50b; 74a; 98a; 142a, and elsewhere.</i>
This is the aspect of the unification of <i>Yaakov</i> and <i>Rachel</i>.
In other words, it is the aspect of the drawing forth of the emotions of the heart that come into an aspect of the vapor and breath of the heart, which is composed of the spiritual qualities of fire, water and air, until it reaches the aspect of the voice of speech.
Now, the aspect of the power of speech is drawn from the cavity of the lungs in the cardiovascular system, and is called<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum Onkelos to Genesis 2:7.</i> “the speaking spirit” (<i>Ruach Memalela</i>).
(This then, is the meaning of the statement in Etz Chayim that <i>Keter</i> of <i>Nukvah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, <i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of the world of <i>Atzilut.</i></i> adheres to the chest of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut,</i> which represents the desire to speak, is rooted in the emotions, in other words “the chest of <i>Zeir Anpin.”</i> See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Mochin D’Tzelem</i>) Shaar 26, Ch. 3.</i>
This is also the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 119:89</i> “Forever, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, your word stands in the heavens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The words, “your word-<i>Dvarcha</i>-דברך” in this verse refers to <i>Malchut</i>, which represents the faculty of speech, and the words, “the heavens” refers to <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> which represents the emotions of the heart, which is in the chest. As explained before, the word <i>Shamayim-</i>שמים (The Heavens) is a composite of two words, fire-<i>Aish</i>-אש and water-<i>Mayim-</i>מים, which refer to the two primary emotions of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> sternness- <i>Gevurah</i> and kindness-<i>Chesed</i>, as they are composed in <i>Tiferet</i>.</i>
It is also in accordance with what is explained elsewhere regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 58:13</i> “<i>Mimtzo Chaftzecha V’Daber Davar</i>,” that the source of the power of speech is drawn from the breath of the heart of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The whole of the verse is, “<i>V’Cheebadto MeAsot drachecha, Mimtzo Chaftzecha V’Daber Davar</i> - Honor <i>Shabbat</i> by desisting from doing your mundane activities, from seeking your mundane needs and speaking mundane words.” However, the word “<i>Chaftzecha</i> – Your mundane needs” shares the same root as the word “<i>Chafetz</i>” which means desire. Thus, the second half of the verse, “<i>Mimtzo Chaftzecha V’Daber Davar</i>” can be understood to refer to the “desire to speak.” As evidenced from the continuation above (in the chapter), the desire to express oneself in speech is dependent upon the emotions of the heart. When one is depressed, his speech is minimal, and the opposite is true when one is in a state of joy. This, then, is the meaning of the aforementioned statement of <i>Etz Chayim</i> that <i>Keter</i> (the desire) of <i>Nukvah</i> (<i>Malchut</i> or speech) adheres to the chest of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.</i>
It is clearly observable that if [a person’s] heart is depressed and withdrawn [into itself], his speech will be minimal, whereas when [his heart] spreads forth [with joy], his speech will be expansive.
This is because the power of speech is dependent on the breath of the voice in the heart itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikrah, Vol. 2 pg. 652.</i>)
Now, as long as it has not been drawn forth from the breath of the heart into speech, as in,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">See Midrash Tehillim 89:1; Kohelet Rabba 12:10</i> “The heart did not reveal to the mouth,” then the word of the King has not yet been actualized and brought out from “nothing” to “something,” whatsoever.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Hashmatot 253a</i>
This is similar to [the statement],<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Niddah 16b</i> “However, <i>HaShem</i> did not declare who will be righteous and who will be wicked.”
This is because speech is already an actualization, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:9</i> “For He spoke, and it was; [He commanded, and it stood fast.]” Similarly, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 55:11</i> “The word that issued from My mouth shall not return unfulfilled, [but it shall accomplish that which I please] etc.”
However, while [it is still] in the “heart” of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> it can still be overturned from Judgment (<i>Din</i>) to Kindness (<i>Chessed</i>), as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:6</i> “And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה repented [that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart] etc.” It then states,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21</i> “And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה said in his heart, I will not again [curse the ground because of man] etc.”
This is the aspect of <i>ChaGa”T</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Chessed, Gevurah</i> and <i>Tiferet</i>.</i> of the breath of the heart of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> that comes forth and unites with speech, which is called the revealed world, as known. This will suffice those of understanding.
Now, there is an aspect of an inner voice that is altogether not heard in speech. This is the aspect of the intellect within the emotions of <i>Chessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>.
For example, this is like the Love (<i>Ahavah</i>) and Fear (<i>Yirah</i>) that transcends the aspect of the spirit of life (<i>Ruach HaChayim</i>) that is in the heart, like the <b>essential</b> joy and love of kindness or the <b>essential</b> anger and judgment of fear and trepidation.
These are much more spiritual, even more than the spiritual compositions of fire, water and vapor mentioned above, which come to be composed in the physical heart.
Now, although this itself has a composition of [the aspects of] fire, water and air – which are the aspects of <i>Chessed, Gevurah</i> and <i>Tiferet</i>, nevertheless it is within the <b>inner</b> aspect of the heart.
That is, [it refers to] the aspects of <i>ChaGa”T</i>, within which there is a radiance of the <b>intellect</b>. [This radiance of the intellect] is called the inner voice of <i>Binah</i> within <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which comes and is drawn from the brain to the heart.
Thus, when [this intellect] is drawn forth by way of the aspect of <i>Da’at</i> - which is the aspect of <i>Yisroel,</i> as previously explained – [and causes a spiritual arousal of the emotions] that is drawn immediately into the letters of thought, which is called <i>Leah</i>, this is called the unification of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Leah</i>.
This is to say that the inner emotions of the heart are immediately thought in his mind.
[For example,] should he become aroused by an intellect and reasoning for love and kindness, this emotion and the intellect within it, will immediately come into [the letters of] his thoughts.
[This is so] since, as known, the thoughts enclothe the emotions of <i>Yisroel</i> with their particulars.
[These thoughts] are called <i>Leah</i> (לאה), as in,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah of the Arizal, End of Parshat Toldot; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch, pg. 105.</i> being weary (<i>Nil’ah</i>-נלאה) of containing the emotions.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The reason why the level of “thought” is called <i>Leah,</i> which is a term that denotes weariness, in that thoughts constantly go through a person’s mind without cessation. (See Torat Chayim, Parashat MiKeitz<i>,</i> pg. 169a-170a.)</i> The source of <i>Leah</i> is above in <i>Binah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Torat Chayim, VaYeitze, pg. 170a; Also see Likkutei Torah of the Arizal, Parshat Vayeitze, section entitled “The mystery of Yaakov and his two wives.”</i>
The verse therefore states about <i>Leah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 30:20; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee<i>,</i> Na”Ch<i>,</i> pg. 188.</i> “I have born him six sons,” referring to the aspect of the six directions of the emotions of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
However, the unification of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Leah</i> refers to the intellect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> as it is within <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which unites with the lower <i>Leah</i>, that is, with the [letters of] thought that receives from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tvunah,</i> which is the source of thought etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">See Torat Chayim, Parashat YaYeitze<i>,</i> pg. 170a -171a. The aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> will be discussed later.</i> This will suffice for the understanding.
Now, there is also a unification of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Rachel</i>, which is when the radiance of the innerness of the intellect, as it is in the emotions, comes into speech.
Likewise, there is a unification of <i>Yaakov</i> and <i>Leah,</i> which is called “the fleeting thoughts of the heart” (<i>Hirhurei Liba</i>). In other words, this is when the aspect of the externality of the emotions rise up as fleeting thoughts in the brain.
So also, there is a unification of <i>Yaakov</i> and <i>Rachel,</i> which is the drawing forth of the externality of the emotions of the heart into speech, as mentioned above.
Now, the order of the drawing forth is sometimes as follows; The aspect of the emotions of the heart rise and unify with thought, and from thought they come [down] to the externality of the heart – which is the breath of the heart – and from the breath of the heart it enters into the breath of speech, which is called the voice and speech.
At other times, thought enters speech, like a person who says what he is thinking (in his intellect).
This is referred to as,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar Leah V’Rachel</i>) Shaar 38, Ch. 3; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot 5577, pg. 35.</i> “The heels of <i>Leah</i> entering into the head of <i>Rachel</i>.”
At the time that he speaks what he is thinking, it comes out from the voice of the breath of the heart into speech, through the five sources [of the letters in mouth].<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The five sources of the letters in the mouth are the throat, palate, tongue, teeth and lips. These divide the voice into specific letters of speech, as will be explained in later chapters.</i>
Now, certainly, what is in his heart arises in his thoughts, for there can be no thought without the emotions of the heart.
We therefore find that the aspect of <i>Yaakov</i> – which is the vapor and breath of the voice of the heart – functions both in thought and speech, which are called the two sisters, <i>Leah</i> and <i>Rachel</i>.
As known, [these two aspects are sometimes referred to as],<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I (<i>Sitrei Torah</i>) 152a; Zohar II 29b; Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaMochin D’Tzelem</i>) Shaar 23, Ch. 4.</i> “The concealed world – <i>Alma D’Itkasia,</i>” and “The revealed world – <i>Alma D’Itgalia</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Torat Chayim, Bereishit, pg. 168b.</i> [and are also referred to as,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 104a; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Shemot Vol. 1, pg. 213; Shaarei Teshuvah 91b.</i>] “The closed utterance – <i>Maamar Satoom</i>” and “The open utterance – <i>Maamar Patuach</i>.” This will suffice for the understanding.
(In this manner there is a unification of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Leah</i> and a unification of <i>Yisroel</i> and <i>Rachel</i>, in the innerness of the emotions, in the aspect of the aforementioned “inner voice.”
This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:3; Also see Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit L’Shabbat 181a and on; Ma’amarei Admor HaZaken, Hanachot HaRav Pinchas, pg. 3.</i> “Day to day speech streams forth,” and then afterwards [in the following verse, which refers to thought,] “There is no speech,” that is, in thought “there are no words; [their voice is unheard.]”
This [latter unification refers to the unification] during <i>Shabbat</i>, [at which time] the unification is in the <b>innerness</b> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i>, as known, and as explained elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">See Pirush HaMeelot pp. 37b-40a.</i> This will suffice for the understanding.)

Chapter 38

We must now understand the matter of the garments of thought, speech and action, in a manner of more particulars, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> “You have fashioned garments for them etc.”
However, in order to understand this, we must preface with the explanations of the source and root of the aspect of the letters, and why at times they are called “Vessels – <i>Keilim</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 6 (<i>Shaar HaAkudim</i>), Ch. 1; Also see Shaar HaYichud VeHaEmunah, end of Ch. 4; Shaarei Teshuvah, Vol. 1, pg. 38b.</i> and at times they are called “Garments – <i>Levooshin</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5562, Vol. 2, pg. 391; Sefer HaMa’amarim 5563, Vol. 1, pg. 249, and 261.</i>
We will afterwards explain, in a manner of particulars, the aspects of <i>Rachel</i> and <i>Leah,</i> and <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, all the way to the highest of levels etc.
Now, as known, the source of the letters is literally in the essence of the [human] soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar TaNT”A</i>) Shaar 5, Ch. 3; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiyot HaTorah, Vol. 2, pg. 639 and pg. 730; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bamidbar, Vol. 1, pg. 309.</i> for “the soul is full of letters,” that is, from the very beginning and essence of its coming into being.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra<i>,</i> Vol. 2<i>,</i> pg. 922-924; Sefer HaMaamarim 5665, pg. 194; Sefer HaMaamarim 5665, Hosafot pg. 309-310.</i>
They [the letters] are [there] in two ways; as letters of thought, and as letters of speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5666, p. 483; Sefer HaMaamarim 5665 pg. 195.; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra, Vol. 2, pg. 922-924.</i>
In other words, immediately upon the existence of the essence of the [human] soul, the letters of thought are unified in it.
They are essentially included in it, just as the power of movement is included in an animal etc.
Now, they come out and burst forth into revealed thought on three levels.
There is imagination and imagery without letters at all. There are simple, disjointed letters without combining or being connected to any particular matter, and there are letters that combine according to analytical thought.
Likewise, in the essence of the soul there [also] is the aspect of letters of speech.
In that the [human soul] is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 2:7 and Targum Onkelos there.</i> “The Articulate Soul – <i>Nefesh HaMedaberet</i>” or “The Speaking Spirit – <i>Ruach Memalela</i>.”
They [too] are included there in an essential manner, and come out into revelation like the movement of an animal, or the like.
This is like the speech of the angels, about which it says,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3</i> “They call one to another [and say] etc.”
In this there are likewise three levels. There is the simple substance of each particular letter. This is called the breath of the spirit of speech.
Then there are the individual letters <i>Aleph</i>-א<i>, Beit</i>-ב<i>, Gimel</i>-ג<i>, Dalet</i>-ד etc., without combination [into words].
Then there is the combination of the letters [into words] which is called the form of speech in the “speaking spirit.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh, Epistle Five.</i>
This is similar to,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Talmud Bavli, Brachot 18b – It happened that a certain Chassid (pious man) gave a dinar of charity to a poor man on the eve of Rosh Hashanah during a year of famine. His wife was angered over this, so he went and spent the night in the cemetery. While he was there, he heard two spirits of two deceased children conversing with each other. One said to the other, “My friend let us roam the world and hear from behind the curtain what misfortune is to come upon the world this year.” Her friend replied, “I cannot come with you, as I am buried in a reed mat. You go, however, and come back and tell me whatever you hear.” So, she went and roamed and returned. Her friend said to her, “What have you heard from behind the curtain?” She replied, “I heard that the crops of anyone who plants this year at the time of the first rains will be destroyed by hail.” Hearing this, the Chassid went and planted at the time of the second rain. Everyone’s crops were destroyed except for his. The next year he again went and spent the night in the cemetery, and he heard the same two spirits talking with each other. One said to the other, “Let us roam the world and hear from behind the curtain what misfortune is to come to the world this year.” She replied, “My friend, did I not already tell you that I cannot come with you because I am buried in a reed mat? You go and come back and tell me whatever you hear.” So she went and roamed and returned, and her friend said to her, “My friend, what have you heard from behind the curtain?” She replied, “I have heard that the crops of anyone who plants this winter at the time of the second rain will be blasted by a dry wind.” Hearing this, the Chassid went and planted at the time of the first rains. Everyone else’s crops were blasted except for his. His wife said to him, “Why is it that last year everyone else’s crops were destroyed by hail except for yours? And why is it that this year everyone’s crops were blasted except for yours?” So he told her the whole story. It was not more than a few days later when a quarrel broke out between the wife of the Chassid and the mother of the child whose spirit was overheard in the cemetery. In the course of that quarrel his wife said to the mother, “Come I will show you your daughter buried in a reed mat etc.” The next year he again went to spend the night in the cemetery, and heard the same two spirits conversing. The one said to the other, “My friend let us roam the world and hear from behind the curtain what misfortune is to come to the world this year.” She replied, “My friend, leave me be. The words that we spoke between ourselves in the past few years have already been heard amongst the living.”</i> “Two spirits conversing,” and to the speech of the Angels etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra, Vol. 2, pg. 923.</i>
Now, even before the coming into being of the source of the simple desire and the simple pleasure, there already are letters included in the essence of the soul.
However, only after the coming into being of the desire, do [these letters] come out to be the aspect of the revelation of the desire. They are then called “the letters of desire.”
This is the aspect of the revelation of the desire as a “something” with a tangible existence as a desire, this being the principal matter of the letters of the essence of the soul.
That is, they only are the aspect of the revelation [and expression] of the light of the essence of the soul in every aspect and manner of “somethingness” and tangible existence.
[In other words,] it is through the letters that it comes forth into revelation from the aspect of the concealed <i>Heyulie</i> etc.
(This is in accordance with what is written in <i>Likkutei Amarim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Tanya, Shaar HaYichud V’HaEmunah, Ch. 11-12; Iggeret HaKodesh, Epistle 5.</i> regarding the twenty-two letters that are embedded in the soul, that they are twenty-two powers or twenty-two movements of the soul etc.)
It is through this [matter of the letters] that it is possible for the desire to come into revelation in the light of the intellect.
If not for the revelation of the desire in an aspect of letters, that [by means of the letters] it appears as a tangible existence of desire, then the essential concealed desire would not come into any other garment, from one state of being to another state of being.
[This is to say, there would be no descent into the] aspect of a desire that is felt and revealed in the “intellect and reasoning for the desire,” as known. This will suffice for the understanding.
This also is the case with the intellect and reasoning for the desire, which is called the <i>Chochmah</i> of the desire (<i>Ratzon</i>).
The fact that it appears as a tangible existence of “reasoning for the desire” is from the aspect of the letters that are in it.
It is through this [the matter of the letters] that it descends from [its] state, to the state of the emotions of the desire.
An example of this is [the aspect of] love (<i>Ahavah</i>) that is in the desire. It too is only the existence of desire, except that it is vested within the existence of love, that because of his desire he loves etc.
(“Love-<i>Ahavah</i>-אהבה” is of the root “desire-<i>Avah</i>-אבה,”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Shoresh Yesha<i>,</i> section on “<i>Avah</i>-אבה,” cited in Sefer HaChakirah, 92a; Sefer HaShorashim of the RaDa”K, section on “Avah-אבה”; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot 5577, pg. 264.</i> and the <i>Heh</i>-ה [which is additional to the root, represents] the “Five Kindnesses-<i>Heh Chassadim</i>” that spread forth from <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> etc.)
Now, this desire itself, even as it is in the intellect and reasoning for the desire, still refers [only] to the essence of the desire as it transcends [actual] intellect and reasoning.
Nevertheless, it is through the letters that it transforms and is seen as transcending the intellect, to [being] within the intellect, to [being] within the emotions.
Similarly, there are letters for the emotions as well. This refers to the fact that the love that is within the desire has an apparent tangible existence etc.
This continues until the aspects of the desire of thought, speech and action. Each of these has the aspect of letters, all the way to the aspect of the desire for action, that is, when the action arises in his desire. There are specific letters for this.
This is likewise the case with [actual] intellect that follows the desire.
For if the intellect did not have a [tangible] existence in letters of intellect, which is the aspect of the revelation of the intellect as a [tangible] existence, then how would it be possible for the intellect to come forth with a transformation of being to an [emotional] arousal of love which is born of intellect?
For, even there [in the emotional arousal] it is the [very] same intellectual [point] that there was before the birth [of the emotion] of love.
It is only that [now this intellect] vests within the [emotional] existence of love.
This is only possible by means of the letters that are within it.
Likewise, it is in this manner that the letters of the emotions [come] into thought.
If the emotion did not have a tangible existence of letters, how could it possibly vest within the existence of thought etc.? The same is true of the letters of thought within speech etc.
We thus find that it is through the letters that there is an aspect of a chaining down from cause to effect, from the essence of the soul until the end action, and that the source of the letters is literally in the essence of the soul.
It is also understood from all the above that in the source from which the letters are hewn, that is, in the essence of the soul, the letters come into being as one with the essential light of the soul.
This is similar to how the power of movement [of an animal] comes into existence with it [that is, with the existence of the self of the animal] etc., and the like. This will suffice for the understanding.
Now, the analogue to all this is automatically understood: That is, the letters of the Upper Purity (<i>Tehiru Ila’a</i>), about which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 15a</i> “He engraved an engraving,” refer to the aspect of the essential letters of thought and speech in the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.
This is analogous to the letters that are embedded in the essence of the [human] soul, in the <i>Yechidah</i>, on the three above mentioned levels.
These letters chain down from one state of being to another state of being, such as from the simple desire of “I will rule” which arose in His thought before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>, until even the desire, intellect and emotions of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, <i>Atik Yomin, Arich Anpin, Abba</i> and <i>Imma, Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
All this is drawn forth and descends from one to the other in a manner of cause and effect with a transformation from one state of being to another state of being, by means of the aspect of the letters of each of these states of being.
For, this [matter of the letters] is the aspect of the revelation of the “somethingness” [of that state of being,] giving it tangible existence, as explained above.
[This continues] until the aspect of the “end action” of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is the aspect of the letters of action of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, and continues [all the way] to <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, [which is] the root of the existence of our lowly world (as will be explained at the end of this treatise).
This is all included in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 135:6</i> “[Everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה desired, He has done.” That is,] “Everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה desired” within His Essential Self, “He has done” in actuality. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Chapter 39

It now may be understood, in a general way, why the letters are called “Vessels – <i>Keilim</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 6 (<i>Shaar HaAkudim</i>), Ch. 1; Also see Shaar HaYichud VeHaEmunah, end of Ch. 4; Shaarei Teshuvah, Vol. 1, pg. 38b.</i> and are also called “Garments – <i>Levushim</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5562, Vol. 2, pg. 391 and Sefer HaMa’amarim 5563, Vol. 1, pg. 249 and 261.</i>
This is because, at first glance, even though it limits the [spreading forth of] the essence, the aspect of the vessel is [nonetheless] considered to be of the essence.
For example, the letters that at all times are embedded in the essence of the soul, are unified with the essence.
This is analogous to how the letters that are engraved into an image or that protrude, like the letters of a seal [are one with it].
This is likewise so of the spiritual letters of the soul.
[Furthermore] this is similar to the revelation of the essence of an animal through its power of movement, or like the revelation of the life-force that spreads from the essence of the animal, as this power still [exists] embedded [and] concealed within the essential self [of the animal].
We likewise observe this with the letters of an intellectual concept; that they are included [in their source] in the essential power to conceptualize.
That is, immediately when [a person] brings [his] reasoning to light from his potential power to conceptualize (<i>Koach HaMaskeel</i>), its letters come out together with it.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 924; Also see the discourse entitled “<i>Samach T’Samach</i>” 5657 of Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch.</i>
It is by and through these [letters] that its existence is [limited to] a certain manner of being a [tangible] “thing.” These are the letters of any concept to whosoever discovers it.
Proof for this, [that the letters, which are called vessels, are of the essence] is from two individuals who conceive the same concept or reasoning.
One will bring it out with certain letters and combinations, while the other will bring it out into revelation with a different manner of letters and combinations. [However, the concept remains the same.]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5715, page 244-247</i>
(This is like the various commentaries on the Talmud; such as the commentaries of <i>Rashi</i> and of <i>Tosefot</i>, the <i>R”osh,</i> or the <i>Ra”N</i>, and the like. [Sometimes] they may all be explaining the very same concept or reasoning, each one in his own unique language, nonetheless, all [their explanations] amount to the same matter and intent, except that each one explains it according to the letters of his intellect etc., as explained elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Teshuvah 108d.</i>)
This is because when the concept itself is born, its letters are born along with it, through which it takes on [tangible] appearance as an aspect of a “something,” and even though [the letters] depict and define it, they nonetheless are considered to be essential to it.
This is likewise the case with the letters of desire and the letters of the emotions, such as the love of the heart etc.
It becomes revealed by the aspect of its letters, which are what [define the light of Kindness] giving it the aspect of a type of revelation, as a [tangible] existence in various different manners, such as a single concept that becomes revealed through different combinations [of letters] etc.
This then, is what is called the aspect of vessels (<i>Keilim</i>). This is the aspect of the “something” that depicts and defines, but is [nonetheless] considered to be essential.
For example, the aspect of all the vessels of the ten <i>sefirot</i>, [such as] the vessel for the light of <i>Chochmah</i>, the vessel for the light of <i>Chessed</i> and of <i>Netzach</i> etc., which is the aspect of the “something” that depicts them, as known.
(This is in accordance with what was explained in chapter twenty-eight; that from the “thickening” of the lights the vessels are made.
[Furthermore, it was] also [explained] that the root of the vessels preceded that of the lights, and is called “the simple substance” (<i>Chomer Pashut</i>) etc.
This is understood from what was said above regarding the letters that are in the essence of the [human] soul, that they [even] preceded the root for the existence of the light of the essential desire and pleasure etc.)
However, notwithstanding all the above, it is also true that the letters are also called “Garments – <i>Levushim</i>.”
This is because the aspect of a Garment (<i>Levush</i>) is that it is something completely separate from the essence.
It is only that the essence becomes vested in it. This is similar to how the body becomes vested in garments that are foreign and separate from it, which cover and conceal it.
This is similarly the case with the letters of the intellect. Once they come into being as existing [in a tangible way], the essence of the intellect becomes vested and concealed within them, so that all that is revealed is only the aspect of the letters of the concept, which is a manner that it becomes a [tangible] “something,” as if there were nothing besides this manner.
In truth, however, the essential light of the concept is not confined to this specific manner [of combinations of letters].
Rather, [this combination of letters] may be exchanged like a garment, and [the concept] may be invested into a completely different manner of [letter] combinations.
[However] none of these [letter formations] actually reach the essence of what [the concept] is, at all. Rather, it only vests and is revealed in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Sha’ar HaGilgulim, Hakdamah 18; Also see Shaarei Teshuvah, Chinuch pg. 108b-108c.</i>
(This is similar to what was mentioned above, regarding the revelation of the same concept and reasoning [through the various unique manners of expression] in the language of the [Talmudic] commentators etc.)
The same [principle] applies to the letters of the desire (<i>Ratzon</i>), for we find that one simple desire may be invested in many different forms of revelation.
Nonetheless, it is all one single desire. Just as the body vests in its garments, so likewise, the desire becomes revealed in a manner that constantly undergoes change.
Similarly, we observe this with the letters of thought (<i>Machshavah</i>) that enrobe the emotions.
For, the love [felt] in the heart which has already come in its [distinct] manner of letters of [description and] revelation in the heart; when it [subsequently] enters thought, it then vests within the thought, literally like a body that becomes enrobed in a separate garment.
Regarding this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 102:27; See Shaar HaEmunah pg. 97.</i> “Like a garment they are changed and exchanged,” literally.
This is because the garment of thought does not stand still for even a moment. Rather, it is [in a] constant [state of] “disrobing” and “enrobing,” “disrobing” and “enrobing” etc., from thought to thought etc.
This is likewise the case when the light of the intellect comes into the garment of the letters of thought. It literally “disrobes” and “enrobes” from thought to thought, [constantly].
(This is not the case, however, with the aforementioned aspect of the revelation of the letters of the essence of the intellectual [concept] itself, which are considered to be of the essence.
They only appear to be exactly like the garment of the letters of thought after they come into being as a [tangible] existence, separate [and apart] from the essence of the intellect, as explained above.)
[From all the above] we find that it is understood that both [matters] are true in the root of the aspect of the letters.
Sometimes they are in an aspect of “Vessels – <i>Keilim</i>.” This is when they are [still] in the root from which they are hewn, completely unified with the essence, as explained above.
However, they also come into an aspect of “Garments – <i>Levooshim</i>,” which are totally separate from the essence, as explained above.
(This is because the root of the letters is from the aspect of the Encompassing Lights<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMa’amarim 5567, pg. 392.</i> (<i>Makifim</i>), which are the root of the Garments (<i>Levooshim</i>), and [furthermore] the root of the Vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) which define and depict etc. is also from there, as stated above and as explained elsewhere.)
From all of the above it may be generally understood how it is above in Godliness by a person who contemplates all the aspects of the garments of thought, speech and action, and the three types of letters [that there are] throughout all the particulars of the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, and throughout the [entire] chaining down [of the worlds] (<i>Hishtalshelut</i>), all the way to the highest heights in the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), in the letters that, “He engraved an engraving in the Upper Purity,” and the like. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 40

We now must understand the aspect of the source of the letters of the thought of <i>Binah</i>, <i>Tevunah</i> and <i>Leah</i> in a manner of particulars.
As explained in various places in the <i>Zohar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 69, 109a.</i> “There is one kind of thought and there is another kind of thought.”
For example, there is the aspect of the concealed thought (<i>Machshavah Stima’ah</i>) of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, and the aspect of the primal thought (<i>Machshavah HaKedoomah</i>) of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, and the like.
Now the explanation of the matter is that in the Holy Tongue,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Biblical Hebrew</i> desire (<i>Ratzon</i>) is also called by the term “thought” (<i>Machshavah</i>).
For example, [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 18:8. See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim, Vol. 1, pg. 208 and Vol. 2, pg. 641.</i> “I repent of the evil that I <b>thought</b> to do to them,” means, “that I <b>desired</b> to do to them,” as known.
This is because desire immediately vests within thought in the brain. Thus, the desire and the thought of the desire are as one. Therefore “thought” is called by the term “desire,” and “desire” is called by the term “thought.”
For example, the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim, Ch. 1.</i> “When it arose in His desire” means “When it arose in His thought” etc.
Now, this is called, “Concealed Thought” (<i>Machshavah Stima’ah</i>) in accordance to the aspect of the hiddenness of the desire. Thus, the thought within which the desire is invested, is likewise hidden and concealed. It therefore is called, “Concealed Thought.” (This is the aspect of the letters of the desire, as mentioned above.)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot p. 263.</i>
However, the aspect of the Primal Thought (<i>Machshavah HaK’dooma</i>) of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> precedes even the Concealed Desire (<i>Ratzon HaNe’elam)</i>. On the contrary, it is the source of the Concealed Desire, which is called, “the Desire for the Desire,” (<i>Ratzon LaRatzon</i>) etc. This too is an aspect of thought, within which there vests the aspect of the Primal Desire that preceded all “Desires for Desires,” (as explained in chapter seventeen). Nevertheless, it is called by the term, the Primal <b>Thought</b>.
In this manner we may understand this concept all the way to the highest levels, even on the level of the thought of the Simple Desire, literally, as it is in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, Himself, (as mentioned previously in chapter ten).
Now, in regard to desire that spontaneously enters the brain, we observe that it enters the nerves of the brain in a way of simple thought not made up of letters at all.
This is because, in truth, desire does not have an aspect of an organ (vessel), such as the other letters, for example, like how the light of the intellect vests within the organ of the brain etc.
However, the power and light of the desire spreads forth in the nerves of the brain, so that all the limbs obey the desire of the brain. (These are called the “nerves,” which are very fine and from which the power of movement and the power of feeling in the limbs come forth [through the nervous system] as known).
For example, when one stretches out his hand or foot, or gathers them in, it only is in accordance to the desire that rises spontaneously in his brain.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Drushei Chatunah Vol. 1, p. 42 and on.</i>
Now, there is also a different kind of thought, which is in an aspect of actual letters of thought.
These letters come about through the aspect of understanding and comprehension, that is, <i>Binah</i> that precedes them [and] which is called “Analytical Thought” (<i>Machshavah Iyunit</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra Vol. 1, p. 255.</i>
As we clearly observe with every intellectual concept and reasoning, that it is grasped in the mind of <i>Binah</i> (which is called “understanding”), and immediately comes into analytical thought, which is called, “The thought of the Intellect,” (<i>Machshevet Sechel</i>).
This is the power of Analytical Thought (<i>Machshavah Iyunit</i>), which specifically includes all intellectual analysis, but has no relationship to desire (<i>Ratzon</i>) altogether.
This kind of thought is therefore not at all called by the term, “desire” (<i>Ratzon</i>), since it is not within the nerves of the brain [that is, in the nervous system] at all. Rather, it actually is only in the brain of <i>Binah</i> itself.
In other words, in the organ (vessel) for the comprehension and understanding of the intellectual concept itself, there is an organ (vessel) for the analytical thought of any intellectual comprehension.
This is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah,</i> which is the last level of the light of the essential comprehension that brings about comprehension in a separate matter (as mentioned previously in chapter two).
It is from here that the aforementioned power of “the Thought of the Intellect” (<i>Machshevet Sechel</i>) is made, since the light of the comprehension of the concept initially comes into his mind even before any analytical thought. (This is called, “to grasp and understand alone.”)
That is, it is grasped in his mind even before he thinks of the concept through the garment of thought and analysis. Nevertheless, the comprehension and concept immediately spread into analytical thought.
This then, is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah.</i> It is higher than the aspect of the <b>letters</b> of thought (<i>Otiyot HaMachshavah</i>) that are called <i>Leah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim<i>,</i> Shacharit 60c, 69a; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch, p. 103; Shaar HaEmunah 90b and 95b, and elsewhere.</i>
(This is also in accordance with what is known regarding the matter of the large <i>Dalet</i> of the word “One-<i>Echad</i>-אח<b>ד</b>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4; Also see Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim Vol. 1, pg. 283 (and the notes there).</i> which is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> that comes from the aspect of the “back” (<i>Achorayim</i>) of <i>Imma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bereishit Vol. 1, p. 380.</i> It is the source for the coming into existence of the thought that comes forth in actual letters, as explained elsewhere.)
Now, the aspect of the conceptualization itself – which is grasped within comprehension and understanding – is also called by the term “thought.”
However, this is the aspect of the “somethingness” (<i>Yesh</i>) of the light of <i>Chochmah</i> which is called the <i>Chashav Ma”h</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the term “thought-<i>Machshavah</i>-מחשבה” divides into “The thought of <i>MaH-Chashav MaH</i>-חשב מ״ה.” See Zohar I 24a; Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 69, 112b.</i> (חשב מ”ה) of <i>Chochmah</i> (חכ<b>מה</b>).
There is also an inner aspect of the thought of <i>Binah,</i> that is, “not heard,” even in the aspect of the Thought of the Intellect (<i>Machshevet Sechel</i>) and it does not come into letters of thought altogether.
This is like the aspect of the depth of comprehension (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>) which is ungraspable, even in the comprehension and thought of <i>Binah</i>, and the like.
(It is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Zohar 1b; Biurei Zohar (of the Mittler Rebbe), Terumah 49c; Imrei Binah, Shaar HaTefillin, 121b and on; Torat Chayim, Noach, 57c. – It is explained that the word “Who-<i>Mi</i>-מי” always refers to <i>Binah</i>-understanding. This is because the word “<i>Mi-מי</i>” has a numerical value of 50, corresponding to the fifty gates of <i>Binah,</i> as mentioned in chapter thirty-two.</i> “<i>Mi D’lo Kayama L’She’ela</i> – He who is beyond inquiry.”) This will suffice those of understanding.
This then, is the meaning of the aforementioned statement, “There is thought,” that is, the concealed thought of the desire, as mentioned previously, and there is the analytical thought of <i>Binah,</i> which comes into the category of the aspect of actual letters of thought that are called <i>Leah</i> etc.
However, both these aspects exist even in the desire, which transcends intellect.
(In other words, this is the aspect of, “The Hidden <i>Binah</i>” (<i>Binah Stima’ah</i>) of <i>Arich Anpin,</i> which is the concealed thought in the hidden desire. That is, just as there is a hidden intellect and wisdom of <i>Arich Anpin</i>, which is, “hidden from all conceptualization,” and is the hidden <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Arich Anpin;</i> which, as known, is called the hidden reasoning for the desire, so likewise, there is an aspect of, “The Concealed <i>Binah</i>” (<i>Binah Stima’ah</i>) etc.)
This is similar to the difference that we observed between the two types of thought, mentioned above about revealed thought.
This is to say that there is the desire that becomes revealed in the brain, which is the desire in the nerves of the brain. It is called, “the concealed thought” (<i>Machshava Stima’ah</i>), because of the concealment of this desire in the brain before it comes to <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>.
Furthermore, there is also the aspect of the analytical thought (<i>Machshava Iyunit</i>), which is the aspect of the “something” of the “nothing” of <i>Chochmah</i>, until it ultimately comes into the aspect of actual letters of thought.
(Now, according to what was stated previously (in chapter 38) regarding the first source of the letters of thought in the actual essential self of the soul, so likewise, there is a source for the letters of the thought of <i>Binah</i> in the essence of the soul.
This is similar to how there is a source for the lights of the letters of the desire that come into the nerves of the brain and the like.
The only difference, is that one comes as an aspect of revelation of desire and one comes as an aspect of revelation of letters of comprehension (<i>Binah</i>) that are grasped within intellectual comprehension.
Nevertheless, we observe that whatever it is that arises in his desires and thoughts, will come out until the aspect of the letters of thought of <i>Binah</i>. That is, the aspect of the concealed desire and thought is drawn into the revealed thought of <i>Binah</i>.)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bamidbar Vol. 5, pg. 1,753 and the notes there gleaned from the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s notes to the Maamarim of 5659 pg. 77, as well as Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 568; Ohr HaTorah, Ki Tetze, pg. 968; Tanya Iggeret HaKodesh, epistle beginning with the words, “He garbs Himself with light;” Likkutei Torah, Shemini Atzeret 91b.</i>
(This is also the matter of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 3:14</i> “<i>Eheyeh Asher Eheyeh</i>-I shall be as I shall be,” which is the revelation of the general <i>Keter</i> of <i>Arich Anpin</i> within the particular <i>Keter,</i> which is in <i>Binah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 11a, 65b; Shaar HaEmunah 60a.

Subsequently [the verse states], “that I will be-<i>Asher Eheyeh</i>-<i>אשר אהיה</i>” [referring to <i>Chochmah</i> which is called “head-<i>Rosh-</i>ראש” and shares the same letters as “<i>Asher-אשר</i>,” and <i>Binah</i> which is likewise called “I will be-<i>Eheyeh-אהי״ה</i>.] That is, I am destined to become revealed within these other crowns.

Chapter 41

Now, as known regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Zohar 2b.</i> “The mother lends her clothing to the daughter,” this refers to the aspect of the five <i>Gevurot</i>-Judgments, <i>MeNaTzePa”Ch</i> (מנצפ”ך)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The five, “final letters,” of מנצפ״ך, or rather, םןץף״ך, are concluding letters that bring about separation and division between the words.

This refers to the aspect of the combinations of letter-divisions of thought, as stated in <i>Zohar</i> on the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 2:12; Zohar I 97b; Also see Sefer HaMa’amarim 5568, Vol. 1, p. 488.</i> “The voice of the <i>Tor-</i>dove is heard in our land,” (as explained elsewhere).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ohr HaTorah, Shlach p. 448 and elsewhere.</i>
However, it must first be understood that within thought itself there are three levels. These are the aspects of Thought of Thought, Speech of Thought, and Action of Thought.
As known, the explanation of these matters is according to the above explanation (in chapter 38<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text says chapter 37, but appears to be a typographical error (and was thus corrected).</i>) that there are three levels in thought:
For example, there is imagination without letters. This is like a toddler who does not yet have thought<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chullin 12b</i> in a manner of combinations of letters, but rather only the imagery and form of thought. This type of thought is drawn from the power of imagination<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Koach HaDimyon</i>-The Power of Imagination.</i> alone.
Now, although this imagery also has divisions and parts, in that its imagery is restricted to a specific matter, nevertheless, it is only by way of imagination. Thus, it is not yet regarded as being true thought, that is, that he thinks <b>into</b> the matter. Because of this the Sages stated that a small infant has no thought at all.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chullin 12b; Maamarei Admor HaZaken 5568 Vol. 1, p. 488; 5570 p. 13; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra Vol. 2, p. 925..tions.                        is intellect is extremely contricted to the point of false imaginations.                         .tions.                        is intellect is extremely contricted to the point of false imaginations.</i>
Now, even when he matures somewhat and does indeed have combinations of letter-divisions in thought, nonetheless, they are not yet complete letters. Rather, it is only that he can restrict his thinking specifically to a particular matter.
For example, he can think with his brain regarding something that is given to him and distinguish between it and something else, until he desires one and rejects the other, as known.
This is the beginning of the matter of thought and is called, “Action of Thought” (<i>Maaseh SheB’Machshavah</i>).
In an adult this refers to when he thinks about how to do something or specifically how to form or write something in a particular manner or when whatever he actually needs to do, arises in his thoughts.
This is likewise the case when he forms the image of the written letters in his thoughts or when he forms an image of any separate physical thing, such as a fruit or a tree or the form of any image and the like; all this is called, Action of Thought (<i>Asiyah SheB’Machshavah</i>).
An infant, however, lacks even this aspect of thought, but only has the power of imagination (<i>Dimyon</i>).
(Nevertheless, this power of imagination is higher than the imaginations that occur in dreams etc.)
This is as explained elsewhere regarding the matter of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hosea 12:11; Also see Imrei Binah, Shaar HaKriyat Shma, 71b.</i> “By means of the prophets I am depicted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text of this verse (Hosea 12:11) is, “<i>B’Yad HaNevi’im Adameh</i> – ביד הנביאים אדמה.” The word “Depicted-<i>Adameh</i>-אדמה” shares the same root as “imagination-<i>Dimyon</i>-דמיון” indicating that the prophets (other than Moshe) only perceive Godliness through the power of imagination (<i>Koach HaDimyon</i>-כח הדמיון). See Imrei Binah, Sha’ar HaKriyat Shma, pg. 71b.</i> That is, the prophets perceive only by means of the power of imagination of the thought (<i>Koach HaMedameh SheBaMachshava</i>).
This is because, during the time of sleep, all that remains of the mind is the very last portion of the powers of thought, which is just the imagination of thought.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It is for this reason that it states (Talmud Bavli, Brachot 57b) states that dreams are 1/60th of prophecy, and it is because of this that dreams may be interpreted.</i>
(This is the matter of <i>Galut-</i>Exile, which is compared to sleep,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 30.</i> as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 126:1</i> “We were like dreamers.” Nevertheless, dreams are culled from the thoughts of the heart etc.,”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 55b</i> as explained elsewhere.)<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See introduction to Shaar HaEmunah and Shaar HaYichud, also translated as “Essential Faith;” Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot 5577 pg. 244.</i>
Now, the aspect of Speech of Thought (<i>Dibur SheB’Machshavah</i>) is like when someone thinks the combinations of the letters of speech that another person speaks to him.
This is lower than the letters of thoughts that he thinks to himself, without hearing another person speak.
For example, this is when he thinks the combinations of the letters, “Master of the Universe<i>-Adon Olam</i>-אדון עולם.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See the beginning of the Liturgy of the morning prayers.</i> Within this particular combination of letters itself, when in his thoughts he hears another person speak the words, “<i>Adon Olam</i>,” all that takes place is that the letters of speech of the other fellow become engraved in his own thought. This is lower than the letters of “<i>Adon Olam</i>” as he thinks them himself.
Likewise, all thoughts that he thinks concerning how to speak before actually speaking (whereupon he immediately speaks) are called, “Speech of Thought” (<i>Dibur SheB’Machshavah</i>).
As known, this is because the aspect of “Speech of Thought,” brings about the aspect of “Thought of Speech.”
This is because his thinking how to speak, brings about the manner of thought he will have when he actually does begin to speak, what originally, he only thought to speak.
In contrast, the third level is the aspect of “Thought of Thought” (<i>Machshavah SheB’Machshavah</i>), which is when he thinks to himself.
For example, this is like when he thinks the combinations of the letters, “<i>Adon Olam</i> – Master of the Universe,” to himself, without speaking them out, or when he thinks any other matter in its various combinations that are called, “the letters of thought.”
However, here too, there are two levels: The first also falls into the general category of, “Speech of Thought” (<i>Dibur SheB’Machshavah</i>).
This is when he does not think into the concept or meaning of the letters of, “Master of the Universe<i>-Adon Olam</i>-אדון עולם,” or the like; this being the concept of sovereignty and lordship. He does not think about this altogether. Rather, he only thinks the combinations of the letters <i>Alef</i>-א and <i>Dalet</i>-ד of the word “<i>Adon</i>-אדון,” and the like.
Although this level is not brought out in speech, since it is higher than hearing the spoken words “<i>Adon Olam</i>,” nonetheless, this too is called by the term, “Speech of Thought” (<i>Dibur SheB’Machshavah</i>).
(Similarly, this is the matter of the speech of the angels, as the verse states,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3; Also see Talmud Bavli, Brachot 18b; Ma’amarei Admor HaZaken 5570, p. 106; Ma’amarei Admor HaZaken, Inyanim, p. 82; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim, p. 547; Torat Chayim, Noach, 67d.</i> “And they called out one to another etc.” This is similar to the letters of our human thoughts; as if a person is calling to his friend by name, simply by thinking it, in the same manner that he would call him through the faculty of speech. Such is the speech of the angels.
Similarly, in regard to the spirits of the departed, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 18b</i> “Two spirits were conversing one with the other,” which, generally, cannot be heard by humans, as explained elsewhere.)
The second level of “Thought of Thought” is true thought.
This is that he thinks the intellectual concept of the matter contained in the letters of thought. It is because of this, that is, that he focuses on the concept, that he spontaneously thinks the combinations of letters specific to that concept.
(As we observe regarding the combinations of the letters of thought; that they come about solely according to the focus of the mind. If his mind is focused on a certain matter, accordingly the combinations will come about in a certain way, as known.)
For instance, if he focuses his mind on a specific matter regarding some business dealing, as opposed to the matter of lordship, he will think in different combinations of letters. It specifically goes according to what he is focused on.
This is called “Thought of Thought” (<i>Machshavah SheB’Machshavah</i>), which is also called, “The ability to Think” (<i>Koach HaMachshavah</i>). That is, it is the ability to think about any matter in a variety of different combinations.
(This is similar to “The ability to Speak” (<i>Koach HaDibur</i>), which is the ability to speak whatever one desires to speak, as will be explained.)
This is the aspect of the organ (vessel) for the Analytical Thought (<i>Machshavah Iyunit</i>) which is considered to be the Thought of the Intellect itself (<i>Machshevet Sechel</i>) (as mentioned above in chapter 40). This is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> etc.
Now, specifically this type of thought is dependent upon <i>Da’at</i> (focus).
This is why it states that an infant has no thought; because since his ability to focus is small, therefore, so is his ability to think in combinations of letters small. Rather, he cannot think in letter combinations at all. However, great focus (<i>Gadlut HaDa’at</i>) brings about thoughts with many different combinations.
According to the manner of the depth of one’s concentration (<i>Ha’amakat HaDa’at</i>) into the depth of the concept (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>) will be the depth of his thoughts in the aspect of a depth of the analytical thought (<i>Machshavah Iyunit</i>), as previously mentioned.
This is similar to the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 92:6; Also see Sefer HaMa’amarim 5566, p. 323; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bamidbar, Vol. 3, p. 1,081; Devarim, Vol. 2, p. 401; Torat Chayim, VaYeitze 170a.</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, how great are Your works and how very deep are Your thoughts,” all of which depends on the depth of comprehension of <i>Binah</i> (<i>Omek HaMoosag</i>) etc. This is sufficient for the understanding.

Chapter 42

We may now understand the source of the power that divides the combinations of the letters of thought on the third level; when he thinks of a particular matter in various combinations. Where does this power of division come from?
However, as known, the aspect of the five severities <i>MeNaTZPaCH</i> (מנצפ״ך) of <i>Imma</i>, is the source of this power to divide.
As known, the explanation of the matter is that the aspect of <i>Imma</i> is the aspect of understanding and comprehending the concept to its length and breadth.
When he delves into the aspect of the depth of the comprehension, he still is only in the depth of the aforementioned aspect of analytical thought, that transcends the aspect of divisions into actual letters of thought in the intellectual reflection upon the concept. Rather, it is still only pure intellectual thought, as is clearly evident.
However, it is through the aspect of the five severities (<i>Gevurot</i>), which is the aspect of the restriction and withdrawal that is within the power of comprehension itself, that the light of the intellect of the aforementioned analytical thought descends into the aspect of divisions of different letters in particular combinations.
This is called the five severities (<i>Gevurot</i>) <i>MeNaTZPa”Ch</i> (מנצפ”ך) of <i>Imma,</i> that are also called, “The protrusions of the seal.”
Now, although, at first glance, this appears to be an aspect of descent and restriction, nevertheless, the source of this is from higher than the power of comprehending this particular concept.
Proof of this is from what we observe in a small child who does not yet think in combinations of letters when thinking of particular things.
For example, if we were to give him a particular object, although he can discern its value and would not exchange it for another object, which is division and discernment in thought, he is not yet able to formulate it in combinations of letters, as mentioned previously.
Nevertheless, when he is able to speak and make requests in speech for a particular thing, it is then certain that in his brain of thought, he now has these particular combinations for the particular thing that he requested in speech.
For, the letters are divided in thought prior to their expression in speech (as will be explained regarding the statement that,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, (<i>Shaar Leah V’Rachel</i>) Shaar 38, Ch. 3; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577, p. 35.</i> “the heels of <i>Leah</i> enter into the head of <i>Rachel</i>,” that the aforementioned aspect of “speech of thought” becomes the “thought of speech”).
This also accords with what is written elsewhere regarding the teaching of the <i>Zohar</i> on the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 2:12; Zohar I 97b; Also see Sefer HaMaamarim 5568, p. 488.</i> “The voice of the turtledove is heard in our land (<i>Artzeinu</i>-ארצינו).”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The term “Our land-<i>Artzeinu</i>-ארצינו” refers to <i>Malchut</i>, which is speech.</i> That is, it is specifically when there is the aspect of speech that the time of the division of the letters of thoughts begins.
(This is the meaning of the teaching that by way of request, “The mother (<i>Imma</i>) lends her garments, these being the five <i>Gevurot</i> of <i>MeNaTzPa”Ch</i> (מנצפ”ך), which are the divisions of the letters of speech, to the daughter.”)
If so, this proves that the source of the combinations is not in the comprehension itself.
For, a child can discern between that which is good [for him] and that which is bad [for him], even before being able to speak, but he nevertheless does not have combinations of letters in his thought until he is specifically able to speak, as stated above.
Rather, their source is higher than the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>, but is from the power and source of the depth of all comprehension etc.
(For example, this is like how the source of the combinations of the letters of speech are from <i>Abba</i>, that is, from the inner aspect of <i>Chochmah</i>, which is the power of conceptualization (<i>Koach HaMaskil</i>) of <i>Chochmah,</i> that is called <i>Kadmoot HaSechel</i> – that which precedes intellect.
(This accords with what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of, “the two birds,”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Biurei HaZohar, Pinchas, 113b and on.</i> as will be explained.)
Moreover, although it is the five <i>gevurot</i> of <i>MeNaTzPa”Ch</i> (מנצפ״ך) that are within the five sources of the mouth that divide and arrange the combinations of the letters of speech, nevertheless it is, “the father (<i>Abba</i>) who founded the daughter (that is, <i>Malchut</i> – speech).”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>) 256b, 248a, 258a; Iggeret HaKodesh, Epistle 5; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Devarim<i>,</i> Vol. 2, pg. 310; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Kuntreisim, p. 547 and on, and elsewhere.</i>
[This is to say that it is <i>Chochmah</i> that] is the aspect of the power to combine the combinations and they therefore come automatically, without intending how to combine them in the intellect or comprehension. This is as written,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Na”Ch, pg. 120; Kuntreisim, p. 547.</i> “combinations to <i>Chochmah</i>,” as explained elsewhere, and as will be explained later.
So likewise, the power to combine the letters of thought is from the power and root of <i>Binah</i>.)
We therefore find that although the aspect of the combinations of thought come about through an aspect of <i>Tzimtzum</i>-restriction of the analytical thought, nevertheless, the power and root that makes these combinations and divisions is from higher than the power of comprehension of analytical thought itself.
It is for this reason that a small child cannot combine letters of thought until he is capable of combining letters of speech, even though he is indeed capable of grasping and discerning things, as explained above.
Hence, the statement that “a child does not have thought” refers specifically to the aspect of the combinations of the letters of thought, as their source comes from the power and root of the thought and comprehension of <i>Binah</i>. This will suffice for the understanding.
(The fact that thought precedes speech is one of the wondrous and hidden matters. For the root of speech is in the innerness and source of <i>Chochmah,</i> while the root of thought is in the innerness and source of <i>Binah</i>, and <i>Chochmah</i> precedes <i>Binah,</i> for <i>Chochmah</i> is called “<i>Ein -</i> nothing” while <i>Binah</i> is called “Yesh – something.”
(This accords with what is explained elsewhere regarding the difference between “<i>Daber</i> – speak” and “<i>Amarta</i> – say,”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ma’amarei Admor HaZaken, Ethalech Liozhna,</i> p. 105. Also see <i>Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Drushei Chatunah</i>, Vol. 1, p. 39.</i> that the root of “<i>Dibur</i> – actual speech” is higher than “<i>Amirah</i> – saying” of thought etc.
This itself proves that, in a child, thought does not come in division of combinations until there are the divisions of speech.)
Nevertheless, it is specifically the five <i>gevurot</i> of <i>MeNaTzPa”Ch</i> (מנצפ״ך) of <i>Binah</i> that are the source for the five <i>gevurot</i> of the divisions of speech, for “The mother (<i>Imma</i>) lends her clothes to the daughter (<i>Malchut</i>),” as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 16:44</i> “Like mother, like daughter.”
In their roots, however, speech comes from <i>Chochmah</i>, and it is for this reason that it states that, “The father (<i>Abba</i>) founded the daughter (<i>Malchut</i>).”
Similarly, in regard to the aforementioned (in chapter 38) first source of thought and speech, as they are embedded in the essential self of the soul, where the three levels of thought etc., as they are in a revealed state were explained; there too in the essence, the letters of thought are included first, prior to the inclusion of the letters of speech, which is called “the speaking soul.”
For, just as with a soul that is manifest in a body, thought precedes speech by two years or so, so likewise the spiritual soul is not called the “speaking spirit” for a period of time, but it indeed already possesses thought.
Or we may say that everything that is higher and more essential in its root comes down later<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Biurim to Shaar HaYichud, pg. 169d; Shaarei Orah, Shaar HaPurim, p. 58, p. 65; Ma’amarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot 5577, p. 121; Shaar HaEmunah 43b, and elsewhere.</i> and that it is for this reason that it is specifically the “speaking soul” that is called the “intellectual soul,” which refers to the essential aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> that precedes the essential aspect of thought that is within it.
Nevertheless, in its revelation it only comes later, for a reason that is explained elsewhere at length. This will suffice for the understanding.)

Chapter 43

From all the above, the analogue will be understood to one who contemplates how it is Above, when he contemplates the many particulars of the chaining down of the worlds from the highest level to the lowest level. They all are generally included in the first source that arose in His simple thought etc., within the essential Self of the Light of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, before the <i>Tzimtzum</i>.
This too includes the three levels of thought, speech and action of thought, mentioned above.
The aspect of action of the essential thought literally in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, is similar to the matter of the last deed that arose first in thought.
(This is unlike what Maimonides explains that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה knows everything through Self-knowledge.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 2:10</i>
Rather, this is that He knows the entire chaining down of Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah as if it is outside of Himself. That is, through action of thought, like a person who pictures the form of something that is separate from him, even though there is nothing outside of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, blessed is He.)
The aspect of speech of the essential thought of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, is like the fact that He estimated in potential within Himself, that which is destined to be in the chaining down of the worlds etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Mikdash Melech to Zohar I 15a</i>
About this it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar Bereshit 15a</i> “He engraved an engraving in the upper purity.” This is the engraving of the letters within His Essential Self etc.
This is also the meaning of,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:9</i> “He said” – within the essential thought – “and the world was,” or the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Balak 23:19</i> “Will He say and not do?” – through the first <i>Tzimtzum</i> etc., and the like.
As mentioned above, “saying” (<i>Amirah-אמירה</i>) is always the aspect of speech of thought. (This is higher than hearing the speech of one’s friend, as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Kings II 19:16, Isaiah 37:17, Daniel 9:18</i> “Lend me your ear and listen etc.” or the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Malachi 3:16</i> “And <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה paid attention and listened” and the like.)
Now, “thought of thought” of His Essential Self is similar to what was explained above about thinking the intellectual understanding of a matter in various combinations etc.
This is when it arose in His desire and thought, “I shall rule” or the like. This is in accordance to His essential insight and desire etc.
Thus, it says,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Baruch SheAmar prayer</i> “He spoke (<i>Amar</i>-אמר) and the world was” – in the aspect of the <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), that is, “I shall rule (<i>Ana Emloch</i>-אנא אמלוך)” etc.
(According to this, the fact that the awakening of the original desire for kindness was brought about through the deeds of the lower beings [that is, the Jewish people], because of which, it arose in His thought and desire [to emanate, create form and actualize. – reaches the beginning of the arousal of desire in His essential thought etc.)
This is the meaning of the verses,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 40:6</i> “Your wonders and thoughts toward us etc. are beyond telling,” and,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 147:5</i> “His <i>Tevunah</i>-understanding is beyond calculation.”
This is because the level of depth of the essential thought in the essential Light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), is in accordance to the [infinite] depth of His insight and focus (<i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Daat</i>), as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 92:6</i> “How very deep are Your thoughts,” as mentioned before. This is sufficient for the understanding.
In the same manner we can understand on lower levels, such as the chaining down of the desire and thought of the simple unity after the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>, which is called the “Empty Space” etc.
For example, the aspect of the radiance of the “line” etc., is the aspect of the “Primal desire and thought,” in that He foresees everything in one glance etc. This level also has the three levels of thought, speech and action in it.
(This is called Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i> and Action-<i>Asiyah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Hanachot 5577 p. 202 and elsewhere.</i> Thought is in <i>Briyah</i>, speech is in <i>Yetzirah</i> and action is in <i>Asiyah</i>, as written,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 43:7</i> “I created it, I formed it and I even actualized it,” as known).
This principle continues to the desire of the hidden thought of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, to <i>Atik Yomin</i>, to <i>Arich Anpin</i> etc., as it descends lower in the chaining down of the worlds in a manner of particulars.
This is similar to the example in man below. The radiance of the light of the essential thought hidden in the essential self of the [human] soul descends with the revelation of desire, intellect and emotions etc. until it reaches the aspect of thought, which enclothes the emotions of the heart. The thought that enclothes the emotions is called “<i>Leah</i>,” and also includes the three levels of thought, speech and action etc., as mentioned before.
Now, in regard to how it is Above, this applies until the aspect of the letters of the thoughts of His emotions in <i>Atzilut</i>, which is called <i>Zeir Anpin</i>. About this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 8:21</i> “And <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה said (<i>VaYomer</i>-וי<b>אמר</b>) to His heart” – this “saying-<i>Amirah</i>-אמירה” is in thought etc.
Sometimes the matter remains in the supernal thought of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which is called, “The Supernal Man,” as in,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 6:6</i> “And <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה regretted etc.” – which reverted to thought that was never brought into speech or action altogether.
This is similar to the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Tehillim 89:1</i> “The heart did not reveal it to the mouth.” It is also similar to,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Niddah 16b</i> “Whether someone will be righteous or wicked He did not say (ק<b>אמר</b>),” as known. This is sufficient for the understanding.
(Now, in explanation of the aspect of the three levels of thought, speech and action as it relates to the general worlds; <i>Adam Kadmon</i> is in thought, which is the aspect of the, “Man of <i>Briyah</i>.” The aspect of <i>Atik Yomin</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i> is the aspect of speech, which is the, “Man of <i>Yetzirah</i>” and the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> is called the “Man of Asiyah.”
Now more specifically, <i>Zeir Anpin</i> also includes the three levels of <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> - that is, thought, speech and action, within itself.)
A person who understands the general principle from the accumulation of the particulars, will understand from the aspect of the action of the essential thought in the essence of the light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), to the aspect of the action within the thought of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
About this the verse states,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 135:6</i> “Everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה desires” – in His essential thought – “He did” – from the “nothingness” of <i>Atzilut</i> to <i>Briyah</i> etc.)
Now, the matter of, “The big <i>Dalet</i>-ד of One-<i>Echad</i>-אח<b>ד</b>” may be understood in the same way.
It is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> from behind <i>Imma</i> etc., which is the matter of the knot of the Tefillin of the head etc., as known.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (<i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>) 236b; Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar HaTefillin, Shaar 4, Ch. 5; Likkutei Torah of the Arizal to Exodus 33:23.</i>
It may be understood in a manner of the particulars of the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which is called “One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד,” being that it is the aspect of the oneness of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> (which in the aspect of the general worlds is called the “Man of Action (<i>Adam d’Asiyah</i>)”).
This is the root of the thought of <i>Leah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar HaTefillin, Shaar 8, Ch. 13.</i> which comes in an aspect of letters and combinations, and is called “Thought of Thought.”
(However, it is called, “The big <i>Dalet</i>-ד,” indicating that it is the aspect of the mature state of speech (<i>Gadloot HaDibur</i>). For, as explained above, there are two levels in this.
In truth, however, this too is considered to be, “Speech of thought,” in that He thinks the concept in combinations, even without intending to bring it into speech at all.
This is the, “Big <i>Dalet</i>-ד” of <i>Alef Chet</i>-א״ח-9 (The first two letters of One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד) which are the nine sefirot<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The letters <i>Alef-Chet</i>-א״ח have a numerical value of nine.</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar HaTefillin, Shaar 8, Ch. 12.</i> That is, every emotion and <i>Sefirah</i> comes in the letters and combinations of the thought of <i>Leah</i> etc., from the power and root of thought, which is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> etc.
It is because of this that one must elongate the <i>Dalet</i>-ד [when reciting the <i>Shema</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 13b</i> This is because it is the root of the aspect of Kingship-<i>Malchut</i> within the four directions of the world in the lower unity of,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 18b; Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 56a</i> “Blessed is the name of His glorious kingdom forever and ever etc.)
Now, one may also understand this in a general way, in regard to the “Primal thought” up to the Simple thought in His Simple Unity, literally in the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, blessed is He, in the aspect of “The Concealed of all concealed”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Zohar 2a</i> that no thought can grasp,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a</i> even the thought of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc., this being that the big <i>Dalet</i>-ד is when it arose in the letters of His simple thought and desire etc., which comes from His Essential <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i>. This is sufficient for those of understanding.
(As to what is written in Etz Chayim, that “the heels of <i>Leah</i> enter the head of <i>Rachel</i> etc.,” and similarly, in regards to what the sages stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, (<i>Shaar Leah V’Rachel</i>) Shaar 38, Ch. 3; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Vayikra Vol. 1, p. 253; Torat Chayim, Vayeitze 173c, note 20.</i> “That which humility made the heel of her soles, fear of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה made the crown of her head etc.,” this refers to the aspect of speech of thought that becomes thought of speech. This is the meaning of the “Heel of humility.”
This is because thought is in a state of concealment and nothingness, whereas speech is in a state of revelation and somethingness etc., and thought (<i>Machshavah</i>) becomes the crown of <i>Rachel</i>, which is the aspect of speech (<i>Dibur</i>).
This is because the aspect of the power, root and beginning of speech are the combinations of the letters of thought. For, if the combinations of thought cease, so does speech cease, as known.
This is the meaning of<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 22:4</i> “The heel of humility is the fear of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה etc.,” as explained elsewhere.)

Chapter 44

We may now also understand the root of the matter of the division of the letters of thought from the aspect of the five severities (<i>MaNTzePa”Ch)</i> etc., [as they apply] much higher<i>,</i> even in the “Essential Thought” [before <i>Tzimtzum</i>] and the “Primordial Thought” [after <i>Tzimtzum</i>] (<i>Machshavah HaKedooma)</i> and the “Hidden Thought” (<i>Machshavah Stima’ah)</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>, until the thought of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> in the way explained before in detail about man below; that the root of the letter-divisions of the combinations come from higher than the source of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i> itself etc.
This is the matter of <i>Ma'amar Satoom</i> – “The Closed Saying,” and <i>Ma'amar Patu'ach</i> – “The Open Saying.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 104a; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Shemot Vol.1 p. 213; Shaarei Teshuva 91b.</i>
An example is the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3</i> “And God said-<i>VaYomer Elohi”m</i>-ויאמר אלהי״ם.” <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם represents the one hundred and twenty combinations<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 15, Ch. 6; Shaar 44, Ch. 5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Shemot Vol. 1, p.137 – There are 120 possible permutations of the five letters of <i>HaShem</i>’s-יהו״ה primary title God-<i>Elohi”m</i>-<i>אלהי״ם.</i></i> of the “Hidden Thought” that is literally in the Essential Self. This is called, “The closed saying” that is concealed within the Essential Self of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, He who is called the “Concealed of all concealments etc.,” to the highest heights, as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28:23</i> “And <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם understands the way thereof etc.”
This aspect of <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם is the aspect of the “constraint and withdrawal” (<i>Tzimtzum v’Histalkut)</i>. This is as stated by our sages,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi to Genesis 1:1; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiyot HaTorah Vol. 1 pg. 337; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 4, p. 1,420.</i> “At first it arose in thought to create through the quality of judgment,” which is the name <i>Elohim-</i>אלהי״ם etc.
That is, this also refers to the aspect of the letter-divisions of the combinations of the, “Hidden Thought” (<i>Machshava Stima’ah)</i>.
(This accords with the translation of Onkelos<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Onkelos translation to Genesis 1:1</i> on the word “<i>Bereishit</i>-in the beginning, as being <i>B'Kadmin-</i>בקדמין, which refers to the Primal Desire (<i>Ratzon HaKadoom-</i>רצון הקדום), that is, the “Desire of the Primordial Thought” (<i>Machshavah HaKedooma</i>-מחשבה הקדומה), which is called the aspect of <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם in an aspect of constraint and division, according to the statement of our sages that,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Rosh HaShanah 32a</i> “<i>Bereishit</i> is also a [creative] utterance (<i>Maamar)</i>”; in that it is the aspect of the Hidden Saying (<i>Ma'amar Satoom</i>) of the Hidden Thought (<i>Machshava HaStoomah</i>), until the aspect of the Simple Essential Thought, as discussed before.
As known, <i>Elohi”m</i>-אלהים consists of the letters<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar, Introduction 2a; Also see <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Na”Ch</i> p. 472</i> “<i>Mi Eileh</i>-מי אלה,” which is the aspect of the division [of letters], as in [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 40:26</i> “lift your gaze heavenwards and see] Who-<i>Mi-</i>מי created These-<i>Eileh</i>-אלה.”
Now, the upper <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם is the <i>Binah</i> and hidden thought of <i>Arich Anpin</i> and <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, while the lower <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> and <i>Leah</i> etc.
This is as stated in the <i>Zohar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar 112c; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Vayikra Vol. 2, p. 625; Devarim Vol. 2, p. 651; Drushei Chatuna Vol. 1, p. 45; Torat Chayim, Noach p. 46c.</i> that the thirty-two [times that is says] “And God said-<i>VaYomer Elohi”m</i>-ויאמר אלהי״ם” [in the account of creation,]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1</i> refer to the thirty-two pathways<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 128b; 129a; 136a; Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1, The Gate of His Title (<i>Shaar HaKinuy</i>).</i> that open up in <i>Binah</i>.
All these are the aspect of the hidden, “Closed Saying” (<i>Maamar Satoom</i>) of speech of thought, from which the thought of the speech of <i>Malchut,</i> which is called the “Open Saying” is made, as will be explained on the subject of the aspect of the Closed letter <i>Mem</i>-ם and the open letter <i>Mem</i>-מ etc.)
However, in regard to the root of this power of division; although it comes in an aspect of constraint (<i>Tzimtzum</i>), nonetheless, it is from higher than the power and source of the comprehension itself etc.
This is as stated in the Zohar regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 2:12; Zohar I 97b; Also see Sefer HaMaamarim 5568 Vol.1, p. 488.</i> “And the voice of the turtledove (<i>Tor</i>-תור) is heard in our land etc.” That is, this refers to the aspect of the voice of <i>Binah</i> that is heard in an aspect of divisions of combinations by means of the five severities <i>MaNTzePa”Ch</i> (מנצפ״ך) etc., which is when the illumination comes into an aspect of speech, this being the revealed world that is called, “our land-<i>Artzeinu</i>-ארצנו” etc.
This is as explained above at length from the analogy of an infant, that he does not have thought in divisions of letters until he speaks etc.
For as soon as there is the power to combine in speech from <i>Chochmah</i>, that is, from the inner aspect of <i>Chochmah</i>; then there is a power to combine the letters of thought from the innerness and source of <i>Binah</i> etc.
However, the power that makes the combinations is specifically from the aspect of the source of <i>Binah</i>, but the combinations themselves in their particular forms, specifically follow the intent of the specific comprehension, according to the constraint of the thought of the “Analytical Intellect” (<i>Sechel HaIyunit)</i> that gives order to the manner of the combinations etc., as discussed before.
In truth, this is an aspect of the Open <i>Mem</i>-מ. This is because in <i>Binah</i> itself there is a closed <i>Mem</i>-ם and an open <i>Mem</i>-מ,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Pardes Rimonim, Shaar 27, Ch. 16.</i> which are called <i>Maamar Satoom</i> (a Closed [hidden] Saying), and <i>Maamar Patuach</i> (an Open [revealed] Saying).
For, every <i>Maamar</i> (Saying) is within the thought of <i>Binah</i> itself.
This is [the explanation of] the matter of the difference between the encompassing lights of <i>Imma</i>, which are still in an aspect of the “Closed <i>Mem”</i> (ם) that encompasses from all sides and specifically is square, as stated in the <i>Zohar</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar <i>Terumah</i> 127a; Also see <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Dvarim</i> Vol.4 p. 1,228; <i>Torat Chayim, Noach</i> 57b.</i> regarding the <i>Mem</i> (ם) of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 9:6</i> “ל<b>ם</b>רבה המשרה” – “To increase authority,” as explained elsewhere; compared to the aspect of the illumination of this encompassing light to make the divisions of combinations through the aspect of the five severities <i>MaNTzePa”Ch</i> etc.; which is the matter of the “Open <i>Mem”</i> (מ), that is, the “Open [revealed] <i>Maamar”</i> (Saying).
That is, the closed [hidden] thought becomes opened through the divisions of letters, as indicated by the form of the open <i>Mem</i>-מ, as known.
Now, the explanation of the matter is as known regarding the explanation of the encompassing lights of <i>Binah</i>, in regard to the matter of<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 22:6</i> “The mother crouches over the chicks” etc.
That is, the emotions only receive from the aspect of the comprehension of the inner light of <i>Binah</i>, which is called, “<i>Em HaBanim</i>” (The mother of the children).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 219a; Zohar II 84a-85b; Imrei Binah, Shaar HaTefilin 99d; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Na”Ch pg. 312.</i> It is then that [the emotions] are called “chicks” etc., and the aspect of the maturation of the intellect of the emotions comes in a concealed manner from the aspect of the encompassing lights, that is, when “The mother crouches over the chicks” etc. This is in order to draw that which is above the intellect of <i>Binah</i> into the emotions.
(This is similar to love that is dependent on something.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna Avot 5:16; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,498; Ateret Rosh, Shaar Yom HaKipurim pg. 68.</i>
This something comes to be loved in an aspect of an inner illumination. Therefore, when the thing is nullified, the love is nullified.
Nevertheless, [the love] remains in an aspect of an encompassing light, which is the aspect of concealment from that thing. It can therefore return to be aroused and once more come in an aspect of an inner illumination, as known.)
For it hovers over them [the emotions], and is square, in that it actually “sits” directly upon them, as explained elsewhere regarding the <i>Mem</i>-ם of “To increase<i>-LeMarbeh-</i>ל<b>ם</b>רבה” etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See note above.</i>
The general matter can be compared by example to how the knowledge of the mind encompasses whatever it knows. For although the thing known is a separate thing, nevertheless, this knowledge surrounds and encompasses the thing on every side.
(This is like the Godly knowledge, in that He supervises and knows all creatures; in that He encompasses them with this knowledge, as explained in Tanya<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Tanya, Ch. 48, and elsewhere.</i> that, “With the knowledge of knowing the whole earth [He encompasses it] etc.)
This is similar to what it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:22</i> “And over the heads of the <i>Chayot</i> [angels] there was a firmament similar to ice etc.,” which also refers to the aspect of the encompassing light of <i>Binah</i> (from which the garment of the <i>Chashmal</i> is made, that is, from the aspect of the externality of <i>Binah</i>, as will be explained).
This is also explained elsewhere regarding the matter of <i>Ohr</i> (Light), <i>Mayim</i> (Water), <i>Rakia</i> (Firmament), that the comprehension of <i>Binah</i> is called “<i>Rakia</i> (Firmament).”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit 70a; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee Vayikra Vol.2, p. 451 and 472.</i>
This is because before the concept comes to be fully grasped, it still transcends the aspect of limitation in letters, such as the explanation of a deep concept that has yet to come into a limited form in the mind to be considered, grasped and comprehended.
This is called “Flowing Waters” (<i>Mayim D’Naidee</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, <i>Eruvin</i> 46a</i> in that it can come in many different manners etc.
This is not the case, however, when the concept comes in a limited manner that literally is grasped and comprehended in the organ (vessel) of his brain. It then it is compared to ice,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 77a</i> in which “the waters have congealed and remain as they are” (<i>D’Aglidee Maya v’Kayama</i>)<i>.</i>
[The term “grasped-<i>Hasagah</i>-השגה”] is of the same terminology as<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Erechin 17a (in the Mishnah)</i> “grasped by the hand-<i>Heseg Yad-</i>השג יד” [meaning, acquired] etc. As explained elsewhere, this is called “The Firmament” (<i>Rakiya</i>), which is the matter of the ice (<i>Kerach</i>-קרח) that is upon the intellect of the <i>Chayot</i> [angels] etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Na”Ch</i> p. 285</i>
However, the root of this ice, which specifically comes in an aspect that is completely concrete, is from higher than the aspect of the inner light of <i>Binah</i>.
Rather, it is drawn and made from the aspect of the encompassing light of <i>Binah</i>, which is called the closed <i>Mem</i> (ם) that altogether does not illuminate nor is drawn down into the emotions in a revealed manner.
Therefore, it is from there that an aspect of a “firmament” (<i>Rakiya-</i>רקיע) or “ice” (<i>Kerach</i>-קרח) is made upon the intellect of the emotions etc.
This then [is the meaning of], “And the mother crouches etc.,” and similarly,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:11</i> “He hovers over his young etc.,” which is the aspect of the garment of the <i>Chashmal</i> (חשמ״ל) that encompasses [the emotions] as a protector.
(This will be explained shortly regarding the matter of the, “Cloaks of Leather” etc., that encompass <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> (<i>Malchut</i>), until below the feet of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> (<i>Malchut</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 42, Ch. 13; Also see Torat Chayim, Noach p. 58a.</i> from which the veil that separates between <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i> is made etc.)
This then, is the aspect of the source of <i>Binah</i> from which the power that makes the divisions of combinations of the letters of thought is drawn.
It is called, “The Combiner” (<i>Metzaref</i>), as opposed to the combinations themselves, which specifically are in an aspect of the, “Open <i>Mem”</i> (מ) and the “Open Saying” (<i>Maamar Patuach)</i> etc. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 45

Now it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 3:21; Also see Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit 60d; Birchat HaMazon 115b; Milah 147a-148d; Biurei Zohar, Balak 149d; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 493; Torah Or, Lech Lecha 12c.</i> “And <i>HaShem Elohim-</i>יהו"ה אלהי"ם made for Adam and his wife cloaks of leather (<i>Ohr-</i><b>ע</b>ור) and garbed them.”
This refers to the aspect of the <i>Chashmal</i> of <i>Nogah</i> that encompasses <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah (Malchut)</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, who are called Adam and his wife, [which encompasses them] until below their feet, as known.
Now, in the Torah scroll of Rabbi Meir<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Midrash Bereishit Raba 20:12; Shaar HaEmunah 43a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereishit pg. 450; Bamidbar Vol. 2, pg. 560 &amp; p. 757; Devarim Vol. 1, pg. 115; Drushei Chatunah Vol. 1, pg. 66; Hanachot 5577 pg. 253.</i> this was written with an <i>Aleph</i>-א, that is, “Light-<i>Ohr-</i><b>א</b>ור.”
This refers to the upper radiance<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 36b – <i>Zihara Ila’ah</i></i> about which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:2</i> “He covers Himself with light as a garment,” this being after the rectification of the two-hundred and eighty-eight [sparks] etc.
Now, we must first have some understanding into the explanation of the matter of the shattering and rectification [of the vessels] in general.
This [took place] in the aspect of the letters (<i>Otiyot</i>-אותיות), which are called vessels (<i>Keilim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Tanya, Shaar HaYichud V'HaEmunah Ch. 4 and elsewhere.</i>
They shattered and fell because of the overabundance of light which they were incapable of containing, as stated in <i>Etz Chayim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 10, Ch. 5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,476.</i>
This is like the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 74:13</i> “You caused the sea (<i>Yam-</i>ים) to fracture with Your might.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The term “sea-<i>Yam</i>-ים” refers to <i>Malchut</i>, which is the letters, as it states (Ecclesiastes 1:7), “All the streams flow into the sea (<i>HaYam</i>-הים). See Shaarei Orah of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla translated as Gates of Light, Shaar 1 (<i>Malchut</i>); Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One.</i>
This refers to the aspect of <i>Tohu</i> (Chaos),<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Na”Ch pg. 5; Torat Chayim, Vayeishev 206c.</i> wherein the aspect of the letters fragmented, this being called, “The Shattering of the Vessels” (<i>Shvirat HaKelim</i>), as known.
The reason for this, as known, is analogous to a deep conceptual light that transcends the limitations of the organ (vessel) of the brain [to contain]. The letters of the thought of the concept will certainly become confused, because of their inability to contain the light, since it is too great for them.
The opposite is true when the organ (vessel) of the brain is able to contain the light of the deep concept. On the contrary, it becomes limited, settled and concealed within these letters (that is, it is absorbed).
However, when they are incapable of containment, then of necessity, the letters become fragmented.
It is as explained elsewhere at length,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Na”Ch pg. 5 and on; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Nevi'im pg. 5 and on.</i> that this is like when a word falls short of containing the great light [of meaning] that is within it; its letters scatter here and there, until nothing at all can be understood from them.
An example is the word “And He said-<i>Vayomer-</i>ויאמר.” When it cannot contain the depth of its intended [meaning], its letters scatter and all that remains is its <i>Vav</i>-ו and <i>Mem</i>-מ, out of order and displaced.
(This is similar to the letters of the fleeting thoughts of the heart during the day. They become disjointed, displaced and out of order when one dreams [at night].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 55b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Hanachot 5577 p. 244</i>
They come about from the combinations of thoughts one thinks during the day, but out of order. Rather, [they come in a jumble], one letter from this word and another letter from that word etc.
It thus states,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Zacharia 10:2</i> “dreams speak nonsense etc.,” as explained elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Torat Chayim, VaYechi 245d</i>)
This fragmentation is called a “Shattering” (<i>Shvirah)</i> into many small parts.
This is because when a letter that separated unto itself comes elsewhere, it only contains an exceedingly diminished portion of the full concept, as the word was in its complete form etc.
Moreover, it too undergoes one fragmentation after another, until it becomes completely alienated from its [original] meaning.
(This may be compared to the matter of dreams that come from the thoughts of one’s heart during the day. However, one cannot dream of,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, <i>Brachot</i> 55b; <i>Torat Chayim, VaYetze</i> 169d; <i>Miketz</i> 216a</i> “An elephant going through the eye of a needle,” but rather only reflections of the thoughts of his heart [during the day], as discussed elsewhere regarding Joseph’s interpretation of dreams,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Inyanim</i> p. 431; <i>Torat Chayim, VaYechi</i> p. 245c &amp; 248c.</i> and as will be explained later.)
Likewise, we may understand how it is supernally, in regard to the matter of the shattering of the vessels of the lights of <i>Tohu</i> (Chaos), that it is an aspect of the fragmentation and scattering of their letters, as stated, “You scattered [the sea (<i>Yam</i>-ים)] etc.”
This is to say that they fell lower and lower until they came into an aspect of being an “alien garment.”
This is the root of the matter of the coming into being of the aspect of the garment of the <i>Chashmal</i> etc., which is called garments of skin (<i>Or-</i><b>ע</b>ור).
Now, as known, these “Skins” are the aspect of the three kinds of letters; thought, speech and action,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See Biurei HaZohar, VaYeshev 21d; Tazriah 73b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 923; Na”Ch pg. 318; Kuntreisim pg. 209</i> which are rooted in the letters of the vessels of <i>Tohu</i> (Chaos) that fragmented and fell down, thus making the aspect of an encompassing garment to garb the aspect of the emotions of man etc.
Although it became an aspect of a separate garment, its root is from above the source of the intellect of <i>Binah</i> as it is in the emotions.
This also is the aspect of the externality of <i>Binah</i> that, “hovers over the chicks,” to protect them etc., which is from the aspect of the encompassing light of <i>Binah</i>, in the aspect of the previously discussed closed <i>Mem</i>-ם. This will suffice for the understanding.
Now, to understand this with additional explanation, it is known that this is also the root of the matter of analogies, such as the three hundred analogies of Rabbi Meir etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 38b</i> in that the root of the analogy is higher than the analogue,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMaamarim 5568 Vol. 1, pg. 393; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 522 and on.</i> as are the analogies [proverbs] of Solomon, which are exceedingly deep [concepts of] wisdom.
They thus do not have an aspect of “vessels of letters,” except through being enclothed in matters that are very separate from the essential wisdom. It is specifically there, [in the analogy,] that the depth of the wisdom may be grasped, just as one grasps the depth of a concept.
This may only be [accomplished] specifically through analogy, for it cannot be grasped even with abundant explanations etc.
Moreover, for an analogy to be made specifically according to the analogue, of necessity it must reach the depth and source from which the analogue comes out. If not, the analogy will not at all be in line with the analogue, as known.
This being the case, the root of the analogy is in the source concept of the analogue, and higher than it.
For this reason, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 1:6</i> “The words of the wise and their riddles”; that commensurate to the depth and source of the wisdom, so will be the depth of the riddles and analogies, such as the analogies of Rabbi Meir and the analogies of Solomon.
This is explained elsewhere regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Kings I 5:12</i> “And he spoke three thousand proverbs;” that is, [each analogy was] an analogy for [the previous] analogy, as explained in the Zohar that the very last analogy contains the very first depth and source of the analogue etc.
The same holds true of the root of the aspect of letters. It is specifically through them that the light of the intellect is grasped well etc.
(This may similarly be understood regarding the light of the intellect becoming concrete. To the degree that it comes to be concretely grasped and explained on the lowest level, it is specifically there that the aspect of the depth and inner light of the intellect itself is [grasped] etc.)
The [above] is also the case with the aspect of the externality of <i>Binah</i> from which the aspect of the <i>Chashmal</i> garment of <i>Binah</i> is made.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Or HaTorah, Noach Vol. 3, pg. 1338</i>
It is regarding this that it states, “And he made cloaks of skin-<i>Or</i>-<b>ע</b>ור etc.,” which is the aspect of the protector of the intellect within the emotions, so as not to come to an aspect of error.
(It is from this that the placenta for the fetus is made etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">As will be explained later regarding the development of <i>Klipah</i>.</i>)
This is as explained at length elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee VaYikra Vol. 2, pg. 494.</i> regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (<i>Ra'aya Mehemna</i>) 256a; Torat Chayim, Vayetze 170c; Biurei HaZohar, Noach 4c and on.</i> “The mother spreads her wings etc.,” and regarding the matter of “<i>baShalom</i>-בשלום-in peace,” which is the same letters as “<i>Malbush</i>-מלבוש-garment” etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur of the <i>Arizal</i>, end of <i>Amida</i>; Also see Emek HaMelech, Shaar 1, Ch. 55 (9c); Torat Chayim, Noach 58a.</i> and regarding the matter of the <i>Sechach</i> (covering) of the <i>Sukkah</i> and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar HaSukkot p. 257a and on.</i> This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 46

However, as mentioned above, in the Torah of Rabbi Meir it was written, “Cloaks of light-<i>Katnot Ohr</i>-כתנות <b>א</b>ור,” with an <i>Aleph</i>-א etc.
For as known, the aspect of <i>Tikkun</i>-Rectification is from the aspect of the <i>Shem Ma”H HaChadash</i> – the new name of <i>Ma”H</i>-מ”ה-45 [יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א] of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, and as discussed elsewhere, this is the aspect of the eighth king, which is the root of the rectification of <i>Ma”H</i>-מ”ה of <i>Chochmah</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim (<i>Shaar HaTikun</i>), Shaar 10, Ch. 2 &amp; Ch. 3; Also see Torah Or, VaYechi 103b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,482.</i>
(This is the aspect of <i>Yosef</i> who is the interpreter of dreams.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1 and on. Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 4, p. 1,376. Torat Chayim VaYishlach p. 188d; VaYechi 243d; Torat Levi Yitzchak, Taanit p. 11.</i>
For the exile is compared to a dream state,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Torah Or, Vayeshev 28c; Torat Chayim, Shemot, pg. 52.</i> and it resembles the thoughts of the heart of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> which is in an aspect of sleep that is called the <i>Durmita</i>-Slumber and the withdrawal of the intellect etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 29, Ch. 1; Mevo She'arim, Shaar 3, part 2, Ch. 17; Torat Chayim Shemot pg. 53b.</i>
And from the letters of the imaginations of the dreams he combines them into good, rectified combinations, according to the source of the depth of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> that is in the forehead etc.
This is why <i>Tofer-</i>תופר-tailor shares the same letters as <i>Porat</i>-פורת-fruitful<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Torah Or, Vayeshev pg. 29a; Likkutei Torah, Korach, pg. 55a; Torat Chayim, Vayechi, p. 242d.</i> and <i>Poter</i>-פותר-solver etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Agadat Bereishit Ch. 82</i> and it is for this reason that he is called <i>Avrech-</i>אברך,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 41:43; Also see Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar Chanukah 280c; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Devarim Vol. 1, p. 30; Bereishit p. 490.</i> as explained elsewhere at length.)
In other words, it is called a “garment of light-<i>Ohr</i>-<b>א</b>ור” with an <i>Aleph</i>-א after the rectification of the two-hundred and eighty-eight sparks that fell along with the scattering and fragmentation of the letters and vessels of <i>Tohu</i>, as we previously explained about the constricted intellect of the separated letters.
The explanation of the matter is as known, that the “garment of skins-<i>Katnot Or</i>-כתנות <b>ע</b>ור” that garb [<i>Zeir Anpin</i>] and is called the <i>Chashmal</i>, comes specifically in a way of coarseness, just like how an analogy [is coarse] relative to the analogue.
(This is also like the coarsening of an intellectual concept through many explanations until a small child can grasp it etc.)
This is the aspect of <i>Nogah</i>-luminescence, which is like a light that illuminates within the darkness, wherein its light is more recognizable, to the point that its light is more apparent and glaring than light that radiates in a bright place, as our sages stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chulin 60b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Hanachot 5577 p. 261</i> “A candle in the sunlight is ineffectual.”
In contrast, the light of a candle in thick darkness is much more glaring. This is specifically because it illuminates the thick darkness.
For, it cannot be said that, in and of itself, the light of the candle<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Shulchan Aruch Alter Rebbe, <i>Hilchot Pesach</i> 433:6</i> is essentially more luminescent in the darkness of night than in the day. Rather, it is only because darkness is its opposite that its light becomes more apparent.
This is not true radiance, in and of itself. It only appears more radiant to the eye specifically because in the darkness its light is more apparent, but only in the eye of the beholder.
This is similar to the radiance and glimmer of a precious stone when it is displayed on coarse material. It will appear to be more radiant than if it were to be displayed on clear, luminescent material, for the same reason.
(This is also like the understanding and comprehension of a deep intellectual light through an extraneous analogy, which is coarse and foreign [to the concept]. It is because of the same reason etc.)
This then, is the aspect of <i>Nogah,</i> which has two explanations, as known.
The first is like the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Job 22:28</i> “A light will shine (<i>Nogah Or</i>-נוגה אור),” or [the verse],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel II 22:29; Psalms 18:29</i> “illuminate my darkness (<i>Yagiah Chashkhi-</i>יגיה חשכי),” and the like.
The second is a term of outward protrusion.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Teshuvah 63a</i> This is like the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel II 20:13</i> “When he veered (<i>Hogah-</i>הגה) from the path etc.” and likewise,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 90a</i> “One who pronounces (<i>HaHogeh-</i>ההוגה) the Divine Name etc.” It also is like the contemplation (<i>Higayon-</i>הגיון) of the thought, as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua 1:8</i> “And you shall contemplate it (<i>V'Higita bo-</i>והגית בו) etc.” or,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 19:15</i> “The contemplation of my heart (<i>Hegyon leebee-</i>הגיון לבי) etc.”
Both these [explanations] amount to the same intended meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Imrei Binah, Shaar HaTefilin 97d.</i>
This was explained elsewhere, by way of example, from the light of the sun<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Imrei Binah, Shaar HaTefilin 97d; Maamarei Admor HaZaken al Maamarei RaZa”L, p. 479; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza'ee, Na”Ch p. 350.</i> as it radiates through a cloud; that its light is increased there and is more recognizable than [when looking at the light that comes from] the body of the sun itself.
For, because of the refined physicality of the cloud and the composition of the element of water in it, the details of the light are more recognizable there.
This is like the three primary colors of the rainbow, which is also called, “the appearance of the <i>Nogah-</i>הנוגה<i>,</i>” as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:28</i> “Like the appearance of a rainbow etc. so was the appearance of the <i>Nogah-</i>brightness.”
This is like how the specific elements and colors of a precious stone are not so recognizable except when it is set in a setting, but not in a coarse setting, but rather in a bright and shiny setting that causes its light to radiate more.
So likewise, is the matter of the second meaning of <i>Nogah</i>, in that it is an aspect of the protrusion in a refined substance, that has become somewhat more refined. There the light stands out and radiates, as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 18:29</i> “[<i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, my God[ illuminate my darkness (<i>Yegiah Chashchi</i>-יגיה חשכי),” specifically.
This is also like the contemplation-<i>Higayon-</i>הגיון of the analytical thought (<i>Machshavah Iyunit</i>), through which the light of the intellect comes to protrude outward into the substance of the letters of contemplative thought. It is specifically then that the grasp and radiance of the depth of the concept becomes more recognized.
It is regarding this that the verse states, “And you shall contemplate it (<i>VeHigitah bo-</i>והגית בו) etc.”
This likewise is similar to the matter of analogies, through which the light of the concept stands out and is more [easily] grasped, as discussed above.
This then, is the aspect of the <i>Nogah</i> of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> in general, that is, it is the aspect of their substance that is noticeable and protrudes.
(This is as explained elsewhere regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 26:12; See Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Maamrei RaZa”L p. 216; 5566 p. 91; Derech Mitzvotecha p. 62; Likutei Torah, Acharei 31d; Chukat 66c; Hemshech 5672 Vol.1 p. 177 &amp; p. 292.</i> “Have you seen a man, who wise in his own eyes etc.” and like the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 22:24; See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 4, p. 1,493; Torat Chayim, Noach 51a; Ohr HaTorah, Noach Vol. 3, p. 1202<i>;</i> Mevo She'arim, Shaar 6 Ch. 2 &amp; Ch. 5.</i> “And his concubine whose name was Reumah-ראומה,” that is, see-<i>Re'u</i>-ראו that I am nullified (<i>Mah-</i>מה) etc., or like ecstasy into Godliness that comes in a felt way etc.)
All this is the root of the aspect of the <i>Chashmal,</i> which is made from the externality of <i>Binah</i>.
(From here the aspect of “The Wings” are made,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar III (<i>Balak</i>) 204b; Biurei HaZohar Balak 109b.</i> as stated regarding the verse “He hovers over his young etc.,” that “the mother (<i>Imma</i>) spreads her wings etc.” It is likewise called<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 31a</i> “The <i>Kanfei HaShechinah</i>-The <b>wings</b> of the Indwelling Presence of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה<i>,”</i> which is the root of the souls of converts etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar, Introduction 13b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577, p. 10</i>
This is also the explanation of the statement in Zohar on the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Balak 204b; Biurei HaZohar Balak 109b.</i> “In the morning I will order (the letters of my prayer) and I will see,” [about which the Zohar comments,] “David prepared this canopy to cover over the morning of Yosef etc., he made a light to enrobe etc., until those that are called the upper wings etc.” as explained elsewhere.)
Until from this [<i>Chashmal</i>] chains down and descends even further to become an aspect of an actual <i>Masach</i>-screen that is called a “separator” which stops and separates between the [worlds of] <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i> etc., whereas the [<i>Sefirah</i>] of <i>Malchut</i> penetrates this screen (as will be explained).
However, the matter of the “garment of light-<i>Katnot Ohr</i>-כתנות <b>א</b>ור,” with an <i>Aleph</i>-א, is after the rectification and clarification of the aspect of <i>Nogah</i> of the <i>Chashmal</i>.
This is by means of the essential sublimation of the new <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה (יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א) of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> etc., which is the source of the aforementioned rectification, until the <i>Yesh</i>-somethingness of <i>Nogah,</i> that is noticeably felt, becomes transformed to an aspect of actual nullification to the Godly <i>Ein</i>-nothingness.
When the somethingness (<i>Yesh</i>) becomes an aspect of nothingness (<i>Ein</i>) then it is even loftier than the aspect of the nothingness of the <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה of <i>Chochmah-</i>חכ<b>מה</b> that rectifies it etc., as explained elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah, Bechukotai 47b; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2, p. 576.</i>
It therefore is called a “garment of light” as in the verse, “He covers Himself with light, like a garment.”
This refers to the aspect of the light of Torah after the clarification of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה (יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א) of the supernal <i>Chochmah-</i>חכ<b>מה</b> that rectifies the aspect of <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן (יו״ד ה״ה ו״ו ה״ה) of <i>Nogah,</i> which then ascends to be higher than the aspect of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 5, Ch. 1; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1, p. 5; Vol 2. p. 573; Vol 4. p. 1,213.</i>
(As known, the shattering was in<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 8, Ch. 1; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1, p. 5.</i> <i>Sa”G-</i>ס”ג which is “coarse<i>-Gas-</i>גס,”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shmot Vol 2, p. 566; Devarim Vol. 2 p. 379; Torat Chayim, Bereishit 9a.</i> but after the rectification of <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן<i>,</i> which [is what] fell during the shattering of the vessels, it ascends back to its source in <i>Sa”G-</i>ס״ג<i>,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah, Bechukotai 47c; Torat Chayim, Bereishit 16c.</i> which is higher than the name of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 5, Ch. 1; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1, p. 5.</i>)
This is called <i>Zihara Ila'ah</i>-The Upper Radiance, and is comparable to a very refined light within a refined and very radiant garment, through which one can gaze [and behold] a greater illumination and radiance with the eyes.
This is the opposite of the matter of <i>Nogah</i> prior to its rectification, when it is in darkness, so that it is only because of the light that radiates within the darkness that it appears to radiate brightly etc.
In contrast, the radiance of the light due to the essence of the light, when the garment itself is made of radiant and luminous light, is like radiant and clear glass, which is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 65b-61a and elsewhere.</i> “<i>Aspaklaria D'Nahara</i> - A lens that shines,” etc.
It is likewise called the upper radiance (<i>Zihara Ila’ah</i>) by means of which the souls gaze upon the ray of the Indwelling Presence of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה (the <i>Shechinah</i>) in the Garden of Eden etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Teshuvah pg. 58c. and elsewhere.</i> as discussed elsewhere. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 47

We now must understand the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> which is called <i>Olam HaDibbur</i>-The World of Speech,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar I 86b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2, pg. 382</i> the aspect of <i>Rachel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 4, Ch. 1; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol .1 p. 227.</i> <i>Alma D'Itgalia</i>-the Revealed World, and <i>Imma Tata'a</i>-The Lower Mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Tanya Ch. 52</i> It is the final <i>Heh</i>-ה of the Name <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Zohar Vayikra</i> 17a; <i>Torat Chayim, VaYetze</i> 167c.</i>
(As known regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 16:44</i> “Like mother like daughter,” that the upper <i>Heh</i>-ה of <i>Binah</i> lends the five <i>Gevurot MeNaTzePa”Ch</i> (מנצפ״ך) to the daughter, which is the aspect of the five organs of speech in the mouth, as mentioned previously.)
It is also called the <i>Maamar Patuach</i>-The Open Saying, as in,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3</i> “And God said-<i>Vayomer Elohi”m</i>-ויאמר אלהי״ם” or as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 33:6</i> “By the word of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה the heavens [were made] etc.” regarding which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 103:19</i> “His Kingship rules over all etc.” as known.
For as known regarding the matter of the <i>Nesirah</i>-Separation, that at first they were two (ד”ו) <i>Partzufim-</i>statures in one,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar 24, Ch. 1 &amp; 2</i> that is, the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> was included in the aspect of the back of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>. This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:23</i> “Bone of my bones [and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman (אשה)] because she was taken from man (איש) etc.”
However, after the <i>Nesirah</i>-Separation, <i>Malchut</i> was built into an independent <i>Partzuf</i>-stature with lights and vessels, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:22</i> “And <i>HaShem Elohi”m-</i>יהו"ה אלהי"ם built the side [that He had taken from man] etc.”
The explanation of the matter is as known from various places in Zohar and Etz Chayim, that <i>Malchut</i> is called <i>Asirit</i>-The Tenth,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar HaKlallim Ch. 7; Shaar HaHakdamot, Sod Mitzvot Aseh 179a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 795; Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 883.</i> because it is taken from the tenth of each of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, that is, from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of each <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
For example, from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> is drawn down and from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> the <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Malchut</i> is drawn down etc. And in this manner, all ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> are constructed.
Now, the explanation of the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the nine <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> is as known; that it is the aspect of the revelation of each quality and <i>Sefirah</i> as it comes forth in an aspect of revelation as a tangible existence (<i>Yesh</i>) that is recognizable etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaZaken al Parshiot HaTorah Vol. 1, pע. 408; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1, pg. 215; Kuntreisim pg. 353; Torat Chayim, Miketz 215b.</i>
An example is the quality of love when it comes forth into tangible revelation etc.
Now, this aspect of essential revelation is called the essential image (<i>Tzelem</i>-צלם) and form, like the essential image of a seal and the like, or like the form of the face itself etc.
This refers to the aspect of the organs (vessels) of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, regarding which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tikunei Zohar,</i> Introduction, 3b.</i> “He and His organs are one,” which is like the matter of the potential power to limit, as explained previously (in chapter twenty-nine).
However, the aspect of Likeness-<i>Demut</i>-דמות is in <i>Nukvah</i>-the female of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which is [only] called the,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 1:28</i> “<b>likeness</b> (<i>Demut</i>-דמות) of the glory of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה,” which is <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
This is as known regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:26; See Zohar III 35b; Maamarei Admor HaZaken al Parshiot HaTorah Vol. 1 pg. 173; 5563 Vol. 2 pg. 670; Shaarei Teshuvah 106d; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2 pg. 553</i> “Let us make man in our form (<i>Tzalmeinu</i>-<b>צלמ</b>ינו) and in our likeness (<i>Dmuteinu</i>-<b>דמות</b>ינו),” that <i>Tzelem</i>-Form refers to the male, whereas <i>Demut</i>-Likeness refers to the female (<i>Nukvah</i>) etc.
This is like the matter of letters that are engraved etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 15b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot Vol. 1, pg. 159</i> which is the aspect of a revelation of a revelation, like the letters of a seal that are imprinted into wax, and the like etc.
Similarly, the aspect of the revelation of the essential qualities of the heart, when they come forth in an aspect of revelation and tangibility in the speech of the five organs of the mouth, they become an aspect of an independent separate entity which is called <i>Yesh D'Yesh</i>-Something of something, as explained elsewhere at length.
For example, the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> in the heart which comes into revelation in a limited manner, is nevertheless still connected and unified with the essence of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Chessed</i> etc.
In contrast, its revelation in speech, as in the saying,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3</i> “Let there be light (<i>Yehiy Ohr</i>-יהי אור),” is a separate, independent thing, which is the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Malchut</i> that is drawn from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> in a manner of particulars.
The same is true with the construction of all of the specific ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> with their lights and vessels into an independent <i>Partzuf</i>-stature etc.
However, prior to the <i>Nesirah</i>-Separation they were two (ד”ו) statures [in one], similar to one’s back, which follows one’s front and has no independent existence of its own.
Likewise, the aspect of the revelation of <i>Malchut</i> was included in the back (<i>Achorayim</i>) of each <i>Sefirah</i> [of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>], because,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Bava Kama 74a</i> “Two hundred includes [one hundred] etc.”
(This accords with what is explained elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer Hamaamarim 5563 p. 223ץ</i> regarding the details of the matter of <i>Achor B’Achor</i>-Back to Back, and <i>Achor B’Panim</i>-Back to Face etc. or the opinion that,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 61a</i> “it was a tail” etc.)
Now at first [<i>Malchut</i>] was like a point under <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> etc., as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Esther 8:3; Also see Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Inyanim, p. 213</i> “And she fell before his feet.” This is as stated in Zohar<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 191a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot Vol. 2, p. 447.</i> about the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Palms 103:3</i> “That do his word” that it made itself small like a point etc., until it was a <i>Heh-</i>ה as before.
For afterwards it is built into a <i>Partzuf-</i>stature in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, until it becomes an aspect of <i>Panim B'Panim</i>-Face to Face etc.
This can be likened to the waning and waxing of the moon.
This then, is the primary aspect of the construction of <i>Malchut</i> as it still transcends the construction of <i>Malchut</i> as a stature within <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, wherein the entirety of its stature, which is in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, is concealed and only the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> penetrates the screen and becomes a stature in <i>Briyah</i>, as will be explained etc. This will suffice for the understanding.
This is the true meaning of the enlarged <i>Dalet</i>-ד of “One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד,”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 6:4</i> which is the aspect of the maturation of the stature of the female-<i>Nukvah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, specifically in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, with intellect and emotions, lights and vessels.
(This is as stated [about the verse,] “And <i>HaShem Elohim-</i>יהו"ה אלהי"ם built the side”; that this refers to <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> that built her etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:22; Zohar <i>Bereishit</i> 48b - 49a.</i> and told her,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar <i>Balak</i> 187a</i> “Go and guard your house,” to be the head of <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> etc.)
(This is as known regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 21:18; See Sefer HaMaamarim 5564 p. 173.</i> “The well that the princes dug etc.”)
The explanation of the matter is that the aspect of speech of thought, discussed previously, which is the enlarged <i>Dalet</i>-ד, becomes the thought of the supernal speech of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> in an aspect of ten <i>Sefirot</i> with lights and vessels, and is from the <i>Malchut</i> of the nine <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as mentioned above.
This then, is the meaning of [<i>Echad</i>-אחד, that is] <i>E”ch</i>-א”ח <i>Dalet</i>-ד,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar Kriyat Shma, Shaar 8, Ch. 12.</i> as explained elsewhere at length. This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 2:7 and Onkelos translation there.</i> “And man became a living soul - a speaking spirit” which is,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 8:4</i> “the word of the King rules” with the ten utterances of,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1</i> “And God said-<i>Vayomer Elohi”m-ויאמר אלהי״ם</i>,” as known.
Now, the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is the aspect of the power of speech before spreading forth in actual speech with the aspects of the intellect and emotions of speech, which are the [other] nine <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i>.
This is the explanation of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 119:89; <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Dvarim</i> Vol. 2, p. 382</i> “Forever, <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, Your word stands in the heavens,” that is, in the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>. In other words, the aspect of the power of speech is always connected to the chest of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> etc., as stated in Etz Chayim and explained elsewhere.
The spreading forth of <i>Malchut</i> garbs <i>Tiferet, Netzach, Hod</i> and <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin,</i> which is the aspect of <i>Dalet</i>-ד-four, for <i>Malchut</i> is called דל-<i>Dal</i>-poor.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 41:2; Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar 29 Ch. 3</i>
The root of the construction of <i>Malchut</i> is from the kindnesses (<i>Chassadim</i>) of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 16:5; Torat Chayim, Vayeitze p. 176a</i> “His throne is founded on kindness” and it is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 41:2</i> “Happy is he who considers the poor (<i>Dal-</i>דל)” and the word kindness-<i>Chessed</i>-חסד is a composite of “pity-<i>Chas</i>-חס [on the] poor-<i>Dalet</i>-דלית,”<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 22; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot, Vol. 2, pg. 643</i> for <i>Malchut</i> has nothing of her own,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 6, Ch. 6; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiot HaTorah, Vol. 2, pg. 511</i> only what she receives from <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.
This is as previously explained regarding the matter of a revelation of a revelation etc., or like the analogy of the moon that receives from the light of the sun, and as stated in Zohar,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 135b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577<i>,</i> pg. 24</i> “The moon has nothing of her own etc.”
This was not the case when <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> were equal in their statures,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Or HaTorah, Bereishit</i> p. 80</i> as they were before the lessening of the moon, when they were called,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:16; <i>Sefer HaMaamarim</i> 5565, Vol. 2, p. 593</i> “The two great luminaries,” and similarly about the coming future it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 30:26; <i>Sefer HaMaamarim</i> 5565, Vol. 2, p. 593</i> “And the light of the moon [shall be as the light of the sun] etc.”
However, there are also two levels in the construction of the female (<i>Nukvah</i>). The first is in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is the matter of the separation etc., and the second is that it becomes the head of <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.
(This is in accordance with what is written elsewhere about the statement<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chullin 60b; Biurei HaZohar, Acharei 77b; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Maamarei RaZa”L pg. 221; 5565 Vol. 2 pg. 594.</i> “Go and lessen yourself etc.,” that this refers to the aspect of <i>Malchut,</i> which becomes the,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar Chadash, Shir HaShirim 71a; Etz Chayim, Shaar 3, Ch. 1; Shaar 4, Ch. 6; Mamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1 p. 179.</i> “head of the foxes,” in <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>. This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:16</i> “the lesser luminary to rule the night.”
For in general the entire aspect of <i>Atzilut</i> is called day, whereas the quality of night refers to the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> as it becomes hidden in the head of <i>Briyah,</i> as will be explained in subsequent chapters regarding the matter of, “Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingship forever and ever etc.,” which is after it penetrates the screen etc. This will suffice for the understanding.)

Chapter 48

Now for more detail regarding the aspect of the construction of <i>Malchut,</i> which is called “The Bride-<i>Kalah</i>-כלה,”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Pardes Rimonim, Shaar 23, “<i>Kalah</i>-כלה.”</i> because it includes “Everything-<i>HaKol</i>-הכל” etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Pirush L'Maarechet Elokut, Ch. 4 (70a); Also see Torat Chayim, VaYeitze, 174b; Shaarei Teshuvah 16c.</i> this is the fact that everything becomes revealed in the aspect of speech in a tangible and separate way, like the letters of speech that reveal all.
This includes even the aspect of the essential pleasure and desire that is in the Essential Self of the light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) literally, that is, the aspect of the <i>Heyulie</i> desire for kindness, that was previously mentioned (in chapter ten), as it chains down in its great descent, until the desire and wisdom and emotions of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> and <i>Arich Anpin</i>, until the aspect of the desire, wisdom and emotions in the external vessels of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>. All this comes into the aspect of <i>Malchut</i>, which is the aspect of the Supernal speech with a revelation of somethingness in an aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>.
Regarding this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 44:6; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bamidbar Vol .3 p. 1,141</i> “I am first and I am last,” and it similarly states,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 32:39</i> “See that I, I am He,” that is, the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) [vested] in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is called<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II 56a; Zohar II 226a</i> “the end of all levels” etc.
Now, we must first understand in a detailed manner the <i>Partzuf</i>-stature of <i>Malchut</i>, from the aspect of <i>Keter</i> that is in it, until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> that is in it, which penetrates the screen to become the <i>Keter</i> of <i>Briyah</i> etc.
For, on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> the construction of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Nukvah</i>-the Female takes place etc., and this is why we say the ten verses of kingship etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 32a; <i>Siddur</i> of <i>Alter Rebbe, Rosh HaShanah</i>, 238b; <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Dvarim</i> Vol .4, p. 1,360; <i>Na”Ch</i> p. 502.</i>
In other words, this is in order to draw down anew the aspect of the pleasure and desire for kingship, that is, to awaken anew the aspect of the simple pleasure and desire of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), that,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 7 &amp; 10</i> “I will rule” etc.
(This is the explanation of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 103:20; Zohar III 191a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot, Vol. 2, p. 447.</i> “The mighty in strength that actualize His word etc.,” as mentioned in Zohar and as explained elsewhere regarding the words,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A hymn (<i>Piyut</i>) in high holiday liturgy; See Shaarei Teshuvah 106b; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiot HaTorah, Vol. 2 pg. 808.</i> “And they have given You a crown of Kingship etc.”)
For as known, the aspect of the aforementioned revelation of speech is called, “The Word of The King,” and is the quality of Lordship, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 93:1</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה reigns; He is clothed in majesty etc.,” or,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:13</i> “Your kingdom is a Kingship over all the worlds etc.”
This is analogous to the quality of lordship in man, which is a quality that is separate from one’s essential self, for it is specifically the quality of ruling over one’s fellow etc. This is not the case with the other qualities, which literally are part of one’s essential self.
For example, with the light of the quality of kindness, the soul itself is drawn after and becomes aroused by the kindness. For the primary essence of this quality is a drawing forth from the essential self [of the soul] and the same is true of wisdom, which is drawn from the essential self [of the soul].
However, in regard to the quality of lordship, even though the soul is aroused by it, nevertheless, it primarily comes into being by something that is separate from the self, that is, that [he rules] over his fellow, and if there were nothing aside for himself, there would be no arousal of this quality altogether.
And although the quality of kindness is also specifically in order to do kindness to his fellow, nevertheless the beginning of its arousal is within his essential self, even if there is no one to bestow his goodness to. This is not the case with [the quality] of lordship, which essentially does not come into being without someone over whom to rule.
Proof of this is from the fact that its entire construction of spreading to a length and breadth, depends solely on the submission of the people to him. When they exalt him, they arouse the ultimate depth of his dominion, but with the lessening of submission, the light of this quality likewise lessens etc.
However, with [the quality of] kindness, it will spread forth as it is in the essential self. And although there will be fluctuations of more or less [kindness] according to the manner in which the recipient arouses and requests [the kindness], with great pleading [or less pleading] etc., nevertheless, it is not primarily constructed from this etc. This will suffice for the understanding.
Now, we must understand the analogue of this as it is Above, because<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli Brachot 58a</i> “as the earthy kingdom is, so is the kingdom of Heaven,” in that,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbeinu Bachaye to Genesis 38:30; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiot HaTorah, Vol. 2, pg. 631</i> “There is no king without a nation,” specifically.
This is because although the Lordship of the aspect of the quality of <i>Malchut</i> Above, is like the other supernal qualities, nevertheless it is not an actual drawing forth from the aspect of the Essential Self of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, the Unlimited One, blessed is He.
(However, it nonetheless is there in potential and in a state of great concealment, for even in the aspect of a human being, even a small child possesses the aspect of lordship to rule over everything, including animals, for this is his nature immediately from birth, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:28; Also see Likkutei Torah, Emor 38b; Sefer HaMaamarim 5568 Vol. 1 pg. 259, 356; Ateret Rosh 41b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Kuntreisim, pg. 314; Hanachot 5577 p. 343</i> “[And God said to them...] have dominion over [the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that creeps upon the earth] etc.”
We observe in the nature of a child, that his desire is to control and dominate over animals, beasts and birds etc., as discussed elsewhere that this is a [quality] specific to mankind. In contrast, the qualities of kindness and mercy may also be found even in the beasts, such as the eagle, which is merciful etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi Pe'ah 1:5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 879.</i> )
Now even though [the essential hidden quality] is called the quality of lordship, nevertheless its primary construction is specifically to have dominion over something external to himself and it is specifically then that the pleasure and great desire to rule is drawn out. According to this we must understand how this is applicable Above in <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו"ה Godliness, for there is nothing outside of Himself upon whom to rule etc.
Therefore, it would not be possible for there to be the aspect of the construction of <i>Malchut</i> with desire and pleasure and emotions in the aspect of a complete stature in the aspect of <i>Atzilut,</i> were it not for the arousal of His desire that there should be a being separate from Himself over whom to rule, and it is specifically then, that this quality is aroused in the Emanator.
Regarding this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 93:1</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה reigns, He is clothed in majesty,” that is, He vests within this quality to be a King over a nation.
It is for this reason that it is specifically this quality that must be renewed from its essential source every <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, that is, all the way to the aspect of the essential thought, “I will rule,” within the Essential Self of the light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, the Unlimited One, blessed is He etc., which is the aspect of Lordship that arose in the aspect of His Essential Self before the <i>Tztimzum</i>-constriction.
It is for this reason that the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>-restraint, which is called the empty place<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 1, Anaf 2</i> (<i>Makom Panuy</i>), took place in order that there be something outside of His Essential Self upon which it would be applicable for the aspect of the light of Lordship of the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) [to rule].
(This is as stated elsewhere about the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 31:12</i> “She does him good etc.,” about the root of the idolaters who He separated from His Oneness in an aspect of darkness and <i>tzimtzum</i>-restraint etc., so that there would be the quality of <i>Tiferet</i>-mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar Yitro 87a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot Vol. 2 p. 635; Torat Chayim Noach p. 75c.</i> This is because the quality of mercy likewise only applies to a person who specifically is foreign and distant etc. This will suffice for the understanding.)
In this manner we may understand the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, the end of all levels of <i>Atzilut</i>, which is the desire and pleasure etc., of the quality of Lordship, to be the king over <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, for which purpose it was necessary for there to be the constriction of the screen between <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah,</i> for it to become the head of the foxes etc., as known.
This then, is the meaning of [“I am first, and I am last,”] that is, “I am first” in the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה Himself, blessed is He, and “I am last” in <i>Malchut</i> of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i> for,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:7</i> “Their beginning is bound to their end,” and this takes place each and every <i>Rosh HaShanah,</i> as known. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 49

We must now understand the specifics of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
That is, the aspect of the simple pleasure and desire that comes to be revealed in the light of this quality, is the aspect of the <i>Keter</i> that is within it in general, as discussed previously.
Afterwards, the light of the pleasure and desire that transcends the intellect and reasoning, becomes constricted in the aspects of the <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> for this desire. This is the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of the quality of <i>Malchut</i>, which is called <i>Chochmah Tata'a</i>-The Lower <i>Chochmah</i> (The Wisdom of Solomon).
This is the <i>Chochmah</i> at the end, that is rooted in the <i>Chochmah</i> at the beginning,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 26b; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 2 pg. 495 and on; Kuntreisim p. 212; Torat Chayim, VaYeishev 201c.</i> that is, the wisdom for this desire in the quality of <i>Malchut</i> is drawn from the aspect of <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו"ה essential <i>Chochmah.</i>
This is the meaning of the statement that,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Rosh HaShanah 32a</i> “<i>Bereishit-</i>בראשית is also an utterance [of creation],” that is, it is the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> of the speech of the ten utterances of <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם<i>,</i> as known. This is called the aspect of the brains [or intellect] of the <i>Nukvah</i>-female of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as known.
Afterwards, the aspect of the emotions of <i>ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Malchut</i> are drawn forth, like the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 29:4</i> “A King establishes [the land] with justice etc.”
(This is like what our sages stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Avoda Zara 3b; Also see Imrei Binah, Shaar HaKriyat Shma 67b.</i> “There are twelve hours in the day; three hours He sits and is occupied in the study of Torah” in the aspect of the intellect of the emotions, “three hours He sits and judges” according to the intellect, and “three hours He sits and sustains” in the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i> etc., as explained elsewhere at length.)
This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 104:24</i> “You have actualized (<i>Asita</i>) all of them with wisdom (<i>Chochmah</i>),” for it includes all the utterances of the other specific qualities in the word of the King etc., like the <i>Yerushalmi</i> translation [on the word] <i>Bereishit-</i>בראשית meaning “With wisdom-<i>B'Chuchmeta-</i>בחכמתא,” as known.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Targum Yerushalmi to Genesis 1:1</i>
And “He renews the act of creation every day” according to the intellect in the emotions of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> that descend into <i>Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> each day in various novel ways as <i>Malchut</i> receives from <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> etc.
This is because every day new intellect is drawn forth from <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> to <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah,</i> to the point that at every hour and moment there is a renewal of the light and influence from its first source, which is the simple pleasure and desire in <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, as it states, “Your Kingship [is the Kingship of all worlds] etc.,” as known.
Now at times, the aspect of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> are in an aspect of immaturity (<i>Katnut</i>) and at times they are in an aspect of maturity (<i>Gadlut</i>).
This is similar to what was explained previously about the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>; that they have mature and immature intellect [depending on how they receive from] the emotions of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> etc., even [including] the ultimate immaturity in the external vessels of <i>NeHi”Y</i> etc.
Likewise in the aspect of the revelation of <i>Malchut,</i> as it is built into an independent stature, at times there is an aspect of mature intellect in the emotions from the aspect of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of <i>Malchut</i>. This is like when the intellect spreads forth abundantly in the emotions that are revealed in speech.
At other times, however, it radiates in an aspect of immaturity, so much so, that sometimes the emotions of <i>Malchut</i> are in a state of complete immaturity.
(This is as stated in Zohar about the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 1:5; Zohar <i>Balak</i> 191a; <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shmot</i> Vol. 2, p. 447.</i> “I am black etc.” that she made herself small and became like a point etc., which refers to the point under <i>Yesod,</i> as it states, “And she fell before his feet” as discussed previously.)
(This is also like the difference between the days of the week and Shabbat, for Shabbat receives from the aspect of <i>ChaGa”T</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, as in,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Piyut Azamer Bishvachin</i>, Shabbat evening prayers</i> “The right, the left, and the bride in between them etc.” At times [influence] is received in an aspect of face to face (<i>Panim B'Panim</i>), such as on <i>Yom Kippur,</i> when <i>Malchut</i> ascends to the inner aspect of <i>Atik Yomin</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Dvarim</i> Vol. 3, p. 1,105</i>)
Now, the aspect of the vessels of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> is the aspect of the letters of speech of the ten utterances [of creation] and there are three levels in this, just as we described previously about thought.
That is, thought of speech is the aspect of the vessel for the <i>ChaBa”D</i> of <i>Nukvah</i>, and speech of speech is the aspect of the vessel of the breath of speech [that conveys] the emotions of speech, and action of speech is the aspect of the vessel of <i>NeHi”Y</i> of <i>Malchut,</i> until the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> that penetrates the screen etc.
The explanation of the matter is as known, that thought of speech can be compared to the thought that becomes garbed within speech, when a person speaks about something, that it is certain that in every particular word, there is vested the particular thought of that speech.
For the manner of the combinations of the letters of speech are patterned exactly according to the pattern of the combinations of thought.
(This is as discussed previously, that the heels of <i>Leah</i> enter into the head of <i>Rachel</i>; that the aspect of thought of speech is made from the aspect of speech of thought and included in this is also the thought of <i>how</i> to speak, both generally and specifically etc.)
For example, within the utterance, “Let there be light-<i>Yehiy Ohr</i>-יהי אור,” is vested the thought of this utterance.
It too is called a, “closed saying” (<i>Maamar Satoom</i>), because all that comes into [actual] revelation is only the speech of, “Let there be light-<i>Yehiy Ohr</i>-יהי אור.”
This thought is the aspect of the vessel for the <i>ChaBa”D</i> of this utterance “Let there be light-<i>Yehiy Ohr</i>-יהי אור” which is the aspect of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Malchut</i> etc., for the first thousand (of the six thousand) years<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This will be discussed in the next chapter.</i> (as will be explained).
And the thought of the second utterance of “Let there be a firmament-<i>Yehiy Rakia</i>-יהי רקיע” is in the quality of judgment (<i>Gevurah</i>) of <i>Malchut</i>, and is the aspect of the vessel for the intellect of this quality etc.
The same applies to all the six emotive qualities of <i>Malchut</i>; that their aspect of thought is the vessel for the intellect that they contain.
And the aspect of the vessels for <i>ChaGa”T</i> and <i>NeHi”Y</i> etc. which is the aspect of speech of speech, can be compared to the letters of the kindness or judgment of the speech itself.
This is because the word and decree of the King contains these three qualities; kindness, judgment and mercy, that is, the aspect of <i>ChaGa”T</i>, and this comes into the word of the King in actual speech and letters.
Now, the wisdom and emotions that become revealed in it, are the aspect of the form (<i>Tzurah</i>) of speech, which is called the Speaking Spirit (<i>Ruach Memalela</i>) or the Speaking Soul (<i>Nefesh HaMedaberet</i>) etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Chapter 38</i> as known.
The aspect of action of speech, which is the vessel for <i>NeHi”Y</i> etc., is when the speech comes to give a command for actualization in actuality, such as “and God said, and it was so” in actuality.
For example, when a king commands for something to actually be done, it first begins with a decree in the words of his judgment, that are called the word and decree of the king, that include [the qualities of] <i>ChaGa”T</i>. Afterwards the final ruling comes to a command to be actualized, which is called the aspect of <i>NeHi”Y</i>, and the aspect of the vessel for this <i>NeHi”Y</i> is the letters of speech [themselves], wherein he simply commands it to be done.
(Similarly, the movement of the lips<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli 90b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 3, p. 910.</i> is also [considered to be] an action and is called action of speech as well, for the essence of the matter is that the mouth cuts the words of speech to come forth in actuality and completion, as there is also speech which is not yet for action etc.)
It is in this regard that it states, “And God said, ‘Let there be light’” and “[let there be] a firmament,” specifically in action.
Now the aspect of the action that resulted from this speech, is as written, “And there was light-<i>Vayehiy Ohr</i>-ויהי אור” and the like, is like when the word of the king is really actualized, and this is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
This only occurs when the influence and light, comes forth to be an aspect of a source for the actual creation of something from nothing etc. This is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut,</i> which penetrates the screen to become a source for <i>Briyah</i>-creation, as will be explained. This will suffice for the understanding.
(However, this too is still in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i> and is called the aspect of <i>Asiyah-</i>action of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
For example, this is like the power in the action that is separate from the power of the one who acts, for although the power of the one who acts is an aspect of the power of actualization, nevertheless, the power that comes out from his power into the acted upon, is the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i>, as explained elsewhere.)

Chapter 50

Now, it is known regarding the particulars of the matter of the five judgments<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 1, pg. 237</i><i>MaNTzePa”Ch</i> (מנצפ״ך) of speech in the ten utterances [of creation] that<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Introduction to Zohar 2a</i> “the mother lends [to the daughter],” that these are the five organs of [speech of] the mouth.
[The letters] <i>Aleph-</i>א<i>, Chet-</i>ח<i>, Heh-</i>ה<i>, Ayin-</i>ע are from the throat, <i>Gimel-</i>ג<i>, Yod-</i>י<i>, Chaf-</i>כ<i>, Kof-</i>ק are from the palate,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 2:1; Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 2 &amp; 3 (The Letters of Creation) and Vol. 4 (The Vowels of Creation); Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee Dvarim Vol. 1, p. 105</i> and so forth, so that there are specific letters for each organ, in and of itself.
The combinations arise through their union and intermingling in various different manners.
This is in accordance with what it states in Sefer Yetzirah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 2:3; Sefer Yetzirah 4:5 and on; Sefer Yetzirah 4:12</i> “And He set them in the mouth etc., He made [the] letter [<i>Aleph-</i>א] reign etc., go out and contemplate that from five letters, one hundred and twenty combinations are made etc.”
This comes about by means of the aspect of the five judgments that divide the breath of speech.
For in speech there is substance (<i>Chomer</i>) and form (<i>Tzurah</i>). The breath of the voice of speech is the substance, which is comprised of fire, water and wind (אמ”ר),<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar II 184b; Ginat Egoz translated as HaShem Is One ibid.; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee<i>,</i> Vayikra Vol. 2, p. 651; Torat Chayim 39d.</i> and the voice is divided into various combinations. Nonetheless, a single voice unites the totality of all the combinations.
(This is as explained elsewhere about the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 1:10; See Maamarei Admor HaZaken 5564 pg. 9; Ketuvim Vol. 2, pg. 89; Likkutei Torah, Shir HaShirim 13a.</i> “Your neck with [a necklace of] beads” that it is like the single strand that unifies and binds the many stones of a necklace together.
It is likewise so, regarding the aspect of the letters of thought in speech, that there is a single general thought that encompasses and unifies all the particular letters of thought that [come out] in the particulars of speech.
The same is likewise so in regard to the voice of thought itself and the five judgments of <i>Imma</i> etc.)
Now, as known<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (Raaya Mehemna) 256b, 248a; 258a; Tanya Igeret HaKodesh 5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2, pg. 380, Kuntreisim pg. 547 and on.</i> “The father founded the daughter” as stated that the [power of] combination is of <i>Chochmah</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch</i> p. 120; <i>Kuntreisim</i> p. 547.</i>
This is in accordance with what was previously explained regarding thought, that is, that the combinations of speech themselves are by means of the aspect of the five judgments that restrain the manner that the intellect [is revealed] in speech, and that it is specifically according to this, that the combinations are drawn forth.
Therefore, the various different ways that the combinations [of speech] constantly change, is precisely according to the dictates of the intention of the thought that is [vested] in the speech.
The above explains the statement that it is specifically <i>Imma</i> that “lends [the clothes] etc.,” which is the aspect of <i>Binah</i> – that is, the upper <i>Imma</i> – that is drawn into the lower <i>Imma,</i> which is the aspect of <i>Binah</i> that becomes vested within the thought of speech, that is, within the specific manner of each combination of speech etc.
However, the statement that, “the [power of] combination is of <i>Chochmah,</i>” refers to the root and power to actually combine these various combinations that are in accordance to the intellect of <i>Binah</i>.
For, we observe that immediately upon the arousal of one’s desire to speak in various specific combinations, one need not delve into the intellect and comprehension of <i>Binah</i> to determine how to combine the letters, for even a small child who speaks, immediately knows to combine the letters of speech, without any preparation for it whatsoever.
This is because the root of this power to combine comes spontaneously from the radiance of the <i>Koach Ma”H</i> (כח מ״ה) of <i>Chochmah</i> (חכ<b>מה</b>) that transcends the comprehension of <i>Binah</i>. That is, it is from the aspect of the power of the intellect (<i>Koach HaMaskeel</i>) itself, which is the source of <i>Chochmah</i>.
(This is as explained elsewhere regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gensis 2:7; See Torah Or, Miketz 42b; Derech Mitzvotecha pg. 75;</i> “And the man became a living soul [<i>Nefesh Chayah</i>],” which is the inner aspect of the beginnings of <i>Chochmah</i>, and that it is specifically then that he is able to speak and is called a “<i>Ruach Memalela</i> – a speaking spirit etc.”)
This then, [explains] the statement that, “the father founded the daughter,” as known.
(In this respect, the statement that, “<i>Bereishit</i>-בראשית is also an utterance,” refers [only] to the <i>Chochmah</i> and intellect that is within the utterances, and does not refer to the power of combination that all speakers possess, which is called the “speaking soul” etc.)
This then, is the primary aspect of a human being, who is called a “speaker” (<i>Medaber</i>), referring to the power and root of the combinations of speech, in that he is specifically called a “speaking soul” etc.
(This refers to when the aspect of the root and source of the letters of the soul themselves, come to be revealed in the aspect of the speech of the soul itself, that it is called a speaking soul (<i>Nefesh HaMedaberet</i>) or speaking spirit (<i>Ru’ach Memalela</i>) etc.)
According to this we may understand the matter of the changes in the combinations of the six days of creation of the emotive qualities of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>.
For example, the combination of the first day, “Let there be light-<i>Yehiy Ohr-</i>יהי אור,” which is the aspect of <i>Chessed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:3; See Or HaChayim to Zohar Bereishit 46a; Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar HaKriyat Shma 76b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,446; Hanachot 5577 pg. 10; Torat Chayim, Bereishit 8c.</i> is the root of the first millennium of <i>Briyah, Yetzirah,</i> and <i>Asiyah,</i> as known regarding the verse, “In six days [<i>HaShem</i>] made etc.,” referring to the six upper days of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> etc., that are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 63:11; Deuteronomy 32:7; See Zohar III 15a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 1, pg. 225; Bamidbar Vol. 2 pg. 366.</i> “<i>Yemei Olam -</i> the days of the world” [in the masculine] and “<i>Yemot Olam</i> - the days of the world” [in the feminine].
And from the combinations of the second day,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 1:6</i> “Let there be a firmament-<i>Yehiy Rakia</i>-יהי רקיע,” come the aspect of judgment of <i>Malchut</i>, which is the source for the second millennium.
This is as known regarding the explanation of [the verse,]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 90:4; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch pg. 398; Devarim Vol. 1, pg. 207; Vol. 3, pg. 805.</i> “For a thousand years [in Your eyes] are but a day of yesterday etc.,” referring to the<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Rosh HaShanah 31a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereishit p. 53.</i> “six thousand years [that] the world exists,” which are drawn from the six emotions of <i>Malchut</i> etc., that is, from the different changes in the combinations of the speaking spirit of <i>Malchut</i>, which is called the speaking soul, as in “And God said-<i>Vayomer Elohi”m</i>-ויאמר אלהי״ם etc.”
In other words, [the changing combinations] are because of the aspect of change in the drawing forth of the intellect of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> in the emotions, whereby the manner of the combinations automatically changes from kindness to judgment, both generally and specifically.
These [combinations] are all according to the aspect of the light of the radiance of <i>Abba</i> which founded the daughter (<i>Barta</i>), for it is the root [of the power] to combine, as discussed previously, and it transcends the light of the intellect of <i>Chochmah</i> within the speech [itself] as mentioned above.
This [even] includes specific [changes] such as how Rabbi Chaninah Ben Dosa said,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Taanit 25a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot Vol. 2, pg. 332; HaNachot 5577 pg. 228.</i> “Let He who told oil to ignite [tell the vinegar to ignite] etc.” That is, let He who combined through the ten utterances of the title God-<i>Elohim-</i>אלהי״ם<i>,</i> this nature of oil to ignite; let Him say this combination and nature to vinegar, so that it should ignite.
This is as stated that,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Samuel II 23:3</i> “The righteous (<i>Tzaddik</i>) rules with his fear of God-<i>Elohi”m</i>-אלהי״ם,” that is, with the one hundred and twenty combinations of <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו"ה title <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Etz Chayim, Shaar 15, Ch. 6; Shaar 44, Ch. 5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee Shemot Vol. 1, pg. 137.</i> as known.
The primary aspect of this “ruling” are the changes in the manner of the intellect of <i>Nukvah</i>, that is, the <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> that is within the ten utterances from the very root of the wisdom and the root of the desire.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 135:6</i> “Everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה desired He did” with the ten utterances of the supernal speech of <i>Atzilut</i>, in the aspect of <i>Asiyah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> discussed previously.
From all of the above we may also understand the general [principle and unity of the] <i>Hitbonenut</i>-contemplation, with all its numerous details, that is, from the very root of the desire in <i>Malchut</i> of the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> and until the very final action, so that it literally is [understood] that “Everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה desired He did” in actuality, like actually making vinegar ignite, and the like. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 51

We must now understand the matter of the screen (<i>Masach</i>) that is between <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 42, Ch. 13-14; Torah Or Lech 12c;</i> and [that] <i>Malchut</i> penetrates the screen etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 42, Ch. 13; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim, Vol. 3, pg. 881;</i> as mentioned previously.
For it is known about the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 36:10; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereishit p. 185; Devarim Vol. 1, p. 178; Torat Chayim Vayeshev, 205a</i> “For with You is the source of life, in Your light is light seen,” that this is called an offspring light, like a light that is seen through a screen.
That is, the primary essential light remains above the screen and there is only a glimmer from the concealed essential light that is hidden within the density of the screen and penetrates and radiates [through], which is called a glimmer of a glimmer.
This is like the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar Bereishit 15b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shmot Vol. 1; pg. 159</i> “He engraved letters etc.” which is like the form of a letter that is pressed into the wax, which is only an impression of the concealed essential letter of the seal etc.
Likewise, it is only the aspect of a glimmer of a glimmer of the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> that penetrates and is seen to radiate from within the screen etc., and becomes <i>Keter</i> of <i>Briyah</i> etc., which is the [matter of], “in Your light is light seen etc.”
Regarding this it states about the creation of the world that,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 77b</i> “At first there was darkness and then light returned etc.,” or as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 18:12; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 1,057.</i> “He made darkness His hiding place etc.”
This is also the matter of the <i>Tzimtzum</i>-restraint of <i>HaShem</i>’s-<i>יהו״ה</i> title God-<i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 84:12; Tanya, Shaar HaYichud V'HaEmunah, translated as The Gate of Unity and Faith, Ch. 4; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Dvarim Vol. 2, p. 400; Na”Ch p. 395; Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1, The Gate of Intrinsic Being (<i>Shaar HaHavayah</i>) and The Gate of His Title (<i>Shaar HaKinuy</i>).</i> “For <i>HaShem Elohi”m-</i>יהו"ה אלהי"ם is a sun and a shield,” that is, it is like a sheath for the sun etc.
(This is as known regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 20:18; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiot HaTorah, Vol. 1, pg. 342; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,371; Torat Chayim Bereishit 36c; Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Vol. 1, The Gate of His Title (<i>Shaar HaKinuy</i>) and The Gate of The Name (<i>Shaar HaShem</i>).</i> “And Moshe approached the thick darkness where God-<i>Elohi”m</i>-אלהי״ם was etc.” and similarly,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Palms 91:1</i> “You who dwells in the Supernal concealment, in the shadow of the Almighty (<i>Shadai-</i>שדי) etc.” that is, the One who said to his world “<i>Dai</i>-enough.” etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chagiga 12a; Likkutei Torah, Shir HaShirim 4d; Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Vol. 1, The Gate of The Name (<i>Shaar HaShem</i>)</i>)
Now the root of the matter of this screen-<i>Masach</i> is that it is made from the aspect of the garment of the <i>Chashmal,</i> from the externality of <i>Binah,</i> that encompasses until beneath the feet of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 42, Ch. 13; Torat Chayim, Noach, 58a.</i> as previously mentioned.
This is in accordance with what is stated elsewhere about the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 31:52; <i>Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Inyanim</i> p. 313; 5567 p. 250; <i>Sefer HaMaamarim</i> 5650 p. 308; <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Drushei Chatunah</i> Vol. 2, p. 505 &amp; p. 537; <i>Torat Chayim, Vayetze,</i> 178a.</i> “This heap of stones shall be witness etc.,” that it is comparable to a heap of stones that separates etc.
This is because the essence of the matter of this screen and curtain is that it is made from the combinations of letters that are called “stones” in Sefer Yetzirah,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> 4:12; <i>Torat Chayim, Bereishit</i> 21d.</i> in which the letters are not properly ordered, are like a heap of stones, one upon the other, and are like the aspect of a screen that is woven of many threads and causes a break and separation.
This is comparable to what we observe with the letters of speech, that when they are properly ordered according to intellect, the light of the intellect clearly radiates within them, so that the recipient is able to understand [the matter] exactly as the influencer [intends].
In contrast, when they are not properly ordered, the recipient will not grasp them at all.
(This is also similar to the light of the intellect and wisdom that is concealed and hidden in an analogy or a riddle about a completely foreign matter. Nonetheless, through it, he is able to come to that intellectual light.
This too is called a penetration of the screen, similar to the light of the sun as it is seen when its rays break through the thickness of the morning mist, as explained elsewhere.)
Since there is no comparison between <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i>, therefore there needed to be this aspect of the <i>Tzimtzum</i> of the screen-<i>Masach</i>.
(This is similar to how there needed to be the aspect of the first <i>Tzimtzum,</i> which is called the empty place and vacant space between the Essential Self of the light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), to be the source for the drawing down of the <i>Kav</i>-line etc., as previously explained.
Only that there, [in <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו"ה Essential Self], it was an aspect of concealment and inclusion of the light within His Essential Self, and is called the Empty place (<i>Makom Panuy</i>), rather than an actual screen.
This was compared to the concealment of one's own expansive knowledge, at a time when he reviews it in summary etc., as discussed previously. This is because all this is still within the aspect of His Essential Self.
This is not the case from <i>Atzilut</i> to <i>Briyah,</i> because from an aspect of limitlessness to become the source of actual limitation, it is necessary for there to be a screen, in a way of complete separation.
Nevertheless, there is a great benefit in the fact that the screen itself is made by He who made the <i>Tzimtzum-</i>restraint Himself, like a person who [himself] makes the analogy for the analogue, or like one who [intentionally] mixes the order of the letters and the like, because of which, this separation of the screen is not a true break or separation for himself, but only in relation to the recipients.
This is analogous to a snail whose garment is of himself and part of himself etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereishit Rabba 21:5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 2, pg. 721.</i> as explained in Tanya.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Tanya, Ch. 21</i>)
(This is the meaning of<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 44:6</i> “[I am first, and I am last].” That is, “I am first” with the first <i>Tzimtzum</i> of the empty place, and “I am last” is the final <i>Tzimtzum</i> between <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i> etc., because this end action of <i>Atzilut,</i> arose first in the thought and desire of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>) etc. This will suffice for the understanding.)
Now, as known, this is the root of the matter of, “Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingship forever and ever etc.,” which is the aspect of the “Lower Unity” (<i>Yichuda Tata'a</i>) of <i>Malchut</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 56a; Zohar I 18b.</i>
That is, it is the radiance of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> within <i>Briyah,</i> in the aforementioned aspect of a “glimmer of a glimmer,” as it states, “In your light is light seen etc.”
Regarding this it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 4:35, 4:39</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, He is <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי"ם etc.,” and as known regarding the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar <i>Terumah</i> 135a</i> “Just as they are unified above” referring to the union of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, “so likewise is she unified below” referring to <i>Malchut</i> in “the Throne” (which is called) <i>Briyah</i> etc.
This then, is what the tribes, who are rooted in the six directions of <i>Briyah,</i> said to Yaakov, who is the master of the world of <i>Atzilut</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 56a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 1,063; Shaarei Teshuvah p. 60d.</i> “Just as in your heart there is only One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד” – in the aspect of the upper unity of <i>Atzilut,</i> wherein He and His life force and His organs are one – “So likewise in our hearts there is only One-<i>Echad</i>-אחד,” in the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut,</i> as it is in <i>Briyah</i> in the lower unity.
This is the meaning of<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Zachariah 14:9; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereishit pg. 537.</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה is One and His Name is One,” as known.

These [aspects] are also called by the names <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה (יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א) and <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן (יו״ד ה״ה ו״ו ה״ה). The name of <i>Ma”H-</i>מ״ה refers to<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 17, Ch. 4</i> <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and the name <i>Ba”N-</i>ב״ן is in <i>Malchut</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 18, Ch. 3; Shaar 29, Ch. 2; Shaar 34, Ch. 2 Klal 13; Shaar 39, Drush 7.</i> as they come forth in a way of expansion (<i>Miluy</i>) and expansion of expansion (<i>Miluy D'Miluy</i>) etc.
(The matter of expansions (<i>Miluy</i>) is known by way of example from the letter <i>Yod</i>-י. When it is pronounced (as a word) it has an expansion of <i>Vav</i> and <i>Dalet</i> (<i>Yod</i>-יו"ד), which is the explanation and expansion of the point of the written letter <i>Yod</i>-י.
And when one needs to explain the expansion of the <i>Vav</i>-ו and <i>Dalet</i>-ד, they too expand into additional letters of <i>Vav-</i>וא”ו and <i>Dalet</i>-דלי”ת. And so on with the expansions of the <i>Vav</i>-וא”ו and <i>Dalet</i>-דלי”ת until there are multiple expansions upon expansions (<i>Miluy D'Miluy</i>) etc.
All this is merely the flow and chaining down of the ray of light and influence as it comes in a manner of the specifics of the specifics, from concealment into revelation, and revelation upon revelation, until the final most specific detail.
This is similar to what is explained elsewhere regarding the matter of, “He spoke three thousand analogies” which are like the multitude of combinations that come in a way of chaining down, one after the other, each one internal to the next, like an analogy to an analogue, that descends and chains down. For, [even] the analogy for this analogue, itself requires an analogy, as stated in the Zohar.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II 145a; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiot HaTorah, Vol. 1, pg. 350; Torat Chayim Lech Lecha 81d; Also see Sefer HaMashalim of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as The Book of Allegories.</i>
This is likewise the matter of the expansions (<i>Miluy</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit 51a; Biurei HaZohar, Tisa 53a and on.</i> that come into revelation from concealment, like a specific detail that comes forth from a general principle etc.
There is also the aspect of expansion in the opposite sense, in which there is concealment upon concealment, as explained elsewhere that this is the matter of the garment of the screen-<i>Masach</i> etc. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 52

Now, in regard to the aspect of the specifics of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> as they are in <i>Briyah</i> after penetrating the screen (<i>Masach</i>), it is known that the aspect of <i>Keter Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> which is called <i>Atik</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> is what is drawn forth from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> etc., and is the aspect of the desire and pleasure for the aspect of the source of actual creation (<i>Briyah</i>) of something from nothing.
This is like the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar I 86b</i> “When it arose in His will to create the world,” for just as it arose in His will to emanate (<i>Atzilut</i>) etc., so likewise His will descended to create something from nothing etc., and this is what is called <i>Keter Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i>.
(This is as explained elsewhere regarding the matter of,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 7a; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, EtHalech Liozhna pg. 70; Inyanim pg. 382; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereishit pg. 25; Na”Ch p. 599; Drushei Chatunah Vol. 1, pg. 261.</i> “Yishmael my son, bless Me; and he answered Him, “May it be desirable before You etc.” That is, Rabbi Yishmael, the High Priest, was in the Holy of Holies of <i>Briyah</i>-Creation, wherein there descends the light of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut,</i> to become the Crown (<i>Keter</i>) of <i>Briyah</i>-Creation. He therefore said to him, “My son, bless Me (<i>Barcheini</i>-ברכני)”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The term “<i>Brachah</i>-ברכה” also means “to draw down” (see Mishnah Kilayim 7:1).</i> to which he responded, “may it be desirable before You etc.”)
From this pleasure and desire to bring about the creation (<i>Briyah</i>) etc., it was drawn down [further] into <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of this desire and pleasure, which are called <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> of <i>Briyah</i>.
From <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma,</i> which are the aspects of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of this desire and pleasure, the emotions, which are called <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> were drawn down.
From <i>Zeir Anpin</i> [it was drawn down] to <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> which is the source that brings the world of <i>Briyah,</i> with its souls and angels, into being from nothing into actual something etc.
Similarly, in the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Briyah</i> there also is the aspect of lights (<i>Orot</i>) and vessels (<i>Kelim</i>), garments (<i>Levushim</i>) and chambers (<i>Heichalot</i>).
This is as known regarding the seven chambers<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 40, Drush 13</i> (<i>Heichalot</i>) of <i>Briyah</i>-Creation;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Sefer HaMaamarim 5565, pg. 805; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, BaMidbar Vol. 3, pg. 995 and on.</i> that the union of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> occurs in the chamber of the Holy of Holies, which is the seventh chamber<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II (<i>Heichalot</i>) 258b; Etz Chayim, Shaar 46, Ch. 1 &amp; 5</i> etc.
Now, from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> the aspect of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Atik Yomin</i> of the world of <i>Yetzirah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 46, Ch. 2, 5, and 6.</i> made, and this too is through the penetration of a screen (<i>Masach</i>) between <i>Briyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>, similar to what was previously discussed regarding the screen between <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Briyah</i>.
For, just as it arose in His desire to create, so likewise did it arise in his desire to form (<i>Yetzirah</i>) and to actualize (<i>Asiyah</i>), only that it is necessary for there to be a break and a screen between the end action of the desire for <i>Briyah</i>-Creation and the beginning of the desire for <i>Yetzirah</i>-Formation.
This is as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 43:7</i> “For My glory I have created it (<i>Barativ</i>), I have formed it (<i>Yatzartiv</i>), I even have actualized it (<i>Af Asitiv</i>).”
Now, as known, the [worlds of] Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i>, and Action-<i>Asiyah</i> are called the three separate worlds [that] actually [come into being in a manner of] something from nothing.
This is similar to the coming into being of the letters of thought, speech and action, which truly come forth in a way of tangible somethingness (<i>Yesh</i>), separate from oneself.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577 pg. 202</i>
Likewise, from the aspect of the letters of thought of the Godly emotions of <i>Briyah,</i> which is called <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> as mentioned above, there was created the aspect of the “hidden worlds that are not revealed,” which are the souls and angels of the world of <i>Briyah,</i> [that are] actually [brought into being in a manner of] something from nothing.
For example, the soul of,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 51:8</i> “Avraham who loves Me,” is from the aspect of the inner vessels of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of [the world of] <i>Briyah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh<i>,</i> Epistle 15; Sefer HaMaamarim 5565 Vol. 2, pg. 276.</i> and [the angel] <i>Michael</i> of the world of <i>Briyah</i> is from the aspect of the externality of the vessels and letters of <i>Chessed</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Briyah</i> etc.
Similarly, the upper garden of Eden (<i>Gan Eden HaElyon</i>) of [the world of] <i>Briyah,</i> is from the aspect of the light of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> which is the Supernal pleasure that is called <i>Atik</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> as it constricts within <i>Binah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i>, wherein the souls in <i>Briyah</i> derive pleasure from the ray etc.
(As known,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 6, 23a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1, pg. 262; Kuntreisim pg. 423.</i> “The supernal mother (<i>Imma</i>) settles in the throne,” which refers to the [descent of the] light of <i>Binah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> through multitudes of chainings-down until <i>Binah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> [settles] within <i>Binah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i> etc. In this same manner <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> settles in [the world of] <i>Yetzirah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 6, 23a; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, HaKtzarim pg. 552; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch, pg. 14.</i> and <i>Malchut</i> settles in [the world of] <i>Asiyah</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 6, 23a</i>)
This is likewise the case in regard to the matter of the <i>Serafim</i> [angels] that are in the world of <i>Briyah</i> etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 40, Drush 13</i> They are the,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Or HaTorah, Acharei Vol. 2, pg. 540</i> “Sons of <i>Elohim</i> who stand before <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה,” which is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of [the world of] <i>Briyah</i>.
The aspect of the vessels of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Briyah</i> is the aspect of <i>Metat”ron-</i>מטטרו״ן,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 16b in Tosefot; Shaarei Teshuvah 29b.</i> the minister of the world of <i>Briyah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 217a-b, and commentary of Rabbi Chayim Vital there; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch p. 334</i> about whom it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 23:21; Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 38b</i> “For My Name is within him” which is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of [the world of] <i>Atzilut</i> etc.
(He is called a lad<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Tosefot to Yevamot 16b referenced above.</i> (<i>Na'ar</i>-נער) or the “small face [or stature]” relative to the “large face [or stature]” of the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chagiga 13b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaeee, Dvarim Vol. 3, pg. 901; Kuntreisim pg. 343.</i> as known.)
In general, the world of <i>Briyah</i> is called the “World of Thought,” which is the aspect of the concealed worlds etc.
(This is similar to [the statement that,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Menachot 29b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bamidbar Vol. 3, p. 1,255.</i>] “The coming world was created with a <i>Yod</i>-י” which refers to the <i>Yod</i> of the thought of <i>Binah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Briyah</i> etc., “and with a <i>Heh</i>-ה this world was created” [which refers to] the aspects of <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.)
The world of <i>Yetzirah</i>, however, is the “World of Speech,” that is, the revealed worlds etc.
(This is like the [difference between] the prophecies of Isaiah regarding the <i>Serafim</i> [angels] of <i>Briyah,</i> who say,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 6:3</i> “Holy, [Holy, Holy etc,]” and the [prophecies] of Ezekiel regarding the <i>Chayot</i> [angels] and <i>Ophanim</i> [angels] who say, “Blessed [be the Glory of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה from His place] etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 3:12; Talmud Bavli, Chulin 92a and Tosefot there; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577 pg. 22.</i>)
Now, just as it was explained above regarding the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Briyah</i>, it is the same way with the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> and the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> to the finest particulars, with lights and vessels, garments and chambers etc. and the coming into being of angels and souls in <i>Yetzirah</i>; for example [the angel] <i>Sandal”fon-</i>סנדלפו״ן etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 47, Ch. 6; Torat Chayim, Vayera 99c.</i>

And in the same manner there is a screen that separates between <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 42 referenced above.</i> and the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> becomes <i>Keter</i> and <i>Atik Yomin</i> for <i>Asiyah</i>, regarding which it states, “Everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה desired He did (<i>Asah</i>).”
This refers to the souls and angels of [the world of] <i>Asiyah</i>, including the aspect of the lower garden of Eden (<i>Gan Eden HaTachton</i>), until the <i>Ophanim-</i>אופנים angels who receive from the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah,</i> as known.
And it is from the aspect of the excretions of the <i>Ophanim</i> angels<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2, pg. 484, Torat Chayim, Noach 59d.</i> that influence is drawn down to influence the cycles of the constellations (<i>Mazalot-</i>מזלות), which are the root of all inanimate, plant life, animals and humans, in all climates,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See note of the Rebbe to Sefer HaMaamarim 5708, p. 204 and Igrot Kodesh Vol. 19, p. 239; Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 2 &amp; 3 (The Letters of Creation).</i> as well as the root for the composition of the foundational elements of fire, air, water and earth from spirituality to physicality etc.
This is similar to the statement,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaar HaEmunah 61a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 2, p. 634; Shaarei Teshuva 20a.</i> “A land that cultivates wise [people] etc.,” because [it receives from] the <i>Mazal</i> of <i>Machkim</i> [<i>Chochmah</i>-Wisdom] etc.,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 156a</i> or [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 33:14</i>] “The choice fruits of the sun etc.,” to the point that there is even a <i>Mazal</i> for inanimate objects, as in [the statement],<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chulin 40a</i> “the luck of the mountain,” until there is even a <i>Mazal</i> for the inanimate of the inanimate, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishit Rabba 10:6; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 848 &amp; 876 and on.</i> “There is not a blade of grass that does not have its <i>Mazal.</i>”
The constellations (<i>Mazalot</i>) are ruled by the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, as known regarding the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 103:19</i> “His Kingdom rules over all etc.,” and as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 145:13; Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shacharit p. 53d.</i> “[Your Kingdom is the Kingdom of all worlds” and “Your dominion [is throughout all ages”] etc., as will be explained with the help of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה.

Chapter 53

Now after all the above, a person who contemplates it, will understand the general point of the entire <i>Hitbonenut</i> – contemplation, from the simple essential desire [that arose] in the actual Essence of the Light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One, because of the aspect of the essential desire for kindness that arose in His simple will (as discussed in chapter ten) etc., all the way to the aspect of the most final desire, which is the aspect of the desire to bring the world of <i>Asiyah-</i>Actuality into being, both generally and specifically, and is called <i>Keter</i> and <i>Atik Yomin</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, regarding which it states, “Everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה desired, He did (<i>Asah</i>).”
For certainly, just as it arose in His desire to have a desire and will to emanate [<i>Atzilut</i>], so likewise the desire and will to create [<i>Briyah</i>] and the desire and will to form [<i>Yetzirah</i>] and the desire and will to do [<i>Asiyah</i>], were all included in the Essence of His simple will in His Essential Self.
For example, this is just as when it arises in a person’s essential desire to have a desire for some specific matter; although this desire immediately divides into multiple desires from level to level, until the most final desire, which is the desire for the actual final action, nonetheless, it all arose instantaneously within his essential will etc., without divisions of levels whatsoever.
(This was explained in chapter seven, that there is no division of levels in the aspect of the <i>Keter</i> of the worlds of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, even though in the chaining down, the aspect of the <i>Malchut</i> of the upper level becomes the <i>Keter</i> of the lower level etc.)
Likewise, relative to the essence of His simple will in the aspect of the Essence of the light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), blessed is He, there is no differentiation of levels between the desire and will to emanate (<i>Atzilut</i>) and the desire and will to do (<i>Asiyah</i>) etc.
This is the meaning of,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 44:6</i> “I am first,” in the desire of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), blessed is He, which is the source for the desire to emanate (<i>Atzilut</i>), and “I am last,” in the most final desire of <i>Malchut</i> of the world of Action (<i>Asiyah</i>)<i>,</i> to bring into being the most lowly and final world, which are the <i>Ophanim</i> [angels] and the <i>Mazalot,</i> that are the root for the existence of the spirituality of the four elements of fire, air, water and earth, and the spirituality of the physical levels of inanimate, plant life and animals.
(This is as stated at the end of <i>Etz Chayim</i>), that everything is included in the verse, “Everything that <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה desired” – in His Essential Self – “He did,” which includes the entire chaining down of the <i>Kav</i>-line until the end of the world of <i>Asiyah</i>; that is, He includes them all.
[Relative to Him] it all is considered to be an action (<i>Asiyah</i>), because relative to His Essential Self the root of <i>Atzilut</i> and the root of <i>Asiyah</i> are literally equal, etc.
This then, is the meaning [of the continuation of the verse, “Everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה desired He did] in the Heavens,” referring to the general encompassing light (<i>Sovev</i>) of the upper purity (<i>Tihiru Ila'ah</i>), “and in the earth,” referring to the aspect of how He fills all worlds (<i>Memaleh Kol Almin</i>) in the lower purity (<i>Tihiru Ta'taa</i>) etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Likkutei Torah, Naso 21c; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577 pg. 329; Kuntreisim pg. 593; Torat Chayim Vayigash 230d; Shaar HaEmunah 58a.</i> It all is equally one [before Him].
(This is as known that the heel of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> concludes at the end of <i>Asiyah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Tanya, <i>Igeret HaKodesh,</i> Epistle 20; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 1 pg. 15.</i> and his head is in the general thought at the beginning of the <i>Kav</i> (As it says about <i>Adam HaRishon-</i>The first man, that prior to the sin his feet were in <i>Asiyah</i> and his head was in <i>Briyah</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer HaGilgulim, Ch. 18; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Bereishit pg. 72; Vayikra Vol. 1 pg. 15, Bamidbar Vol. 4 pg. 1,456; Torat Chayim Bereishit 30a.</i> but <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [is nevertheless] called <i>Adam</i> of <i>Briyah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaZaken, beginning of Inyanim</i> that is, [created] something from nothing etc.)
(This is [also] the meaning of,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Shacharit prayer of Shabbat and Yom Tov; Torat Chayim Bereishit 30a.</i> “Every stature shall bow before You etc.,” as discussed elsewhere.)
This then, is the primary intention of the entire contemplation of every detail within the chaining down of the <i>Kav</i>-line, from before the first <i>Tzimtzum</i>-restraint until the end of the world of <i>Asiyah</i>. That is, [the intention] is to unite everything in the simple unity, which is in the aspect of the Essence of the light of the Singular Preexistent Intrinsic Being, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, the Unlimited One, blessed is He, until the order of <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו"ה Godly supervision of every detail, is engrained in one’s soul, even to the very last detail.
That is, even in the world of the planetary cycles and constellations (<i>Mazalot),</i> that only come from the nine external vessels of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, [one must recognize] that it literally is only according to His simple will within the Essential Self of the light of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה, the Unlimited One (<i>Ein Sof</i>), blessed is He.
This is as we say [in our prayers],<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Aravit prayer; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee Hanachot 5577 pg. 53, 67, 90, 163, 330.</i> “He – specifically – orders the stars in their watches within the firmament according to His will,” that is, literally according to His simple will in His Essential Self, for the aforementioned reason.
The explanation of, “in their watches,” refers<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shaarei Teshuva</i> 20a</i> even to the aspect of the chambers of the husks of <i>Kelipat Nogah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>; because the constellations (<i>Mazalot</i>) that are fixed in the heavens, are in the aspect of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>.
This is because the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> in its aspect of lights, vessels and chambers etc., are all in an aspect of total nullification of the something (<i>Bitul HaYesh</i>) to the nothing (<i>Ein</i>) [from which they are brought into being], as known regarding the chamber of the Holy of Holies in <i>Asiyah,</i> where there is the union of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> and <i>Nukvah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>, such as in the Holy Temple below etc.
Even the souls and angels of <i>Asiyah</i> are in a state of total nullification, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemiah 9:6</i> “The hosts of the heavens bow to You,” referring to the <i>Ophanim</i> and <i>Chayot</i> [angels] of <i>Asiyah</i>.
Even the substance and vessels of the <i>Ophanim</i> are in an aspect of absolute nullification, as understood from the chariot [prophecy] of Ezekiel regarding the <i>Chayot</i> and <i>Ophanim</i> [angels] of <i>Yetzirah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel Ch. 1</i>
Similarly, this is the case regarding the chariot of black and red horses of Zachariah's<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Zachariah 6:2</i> [prophecy, which refers to] times of exile, in which <i>Malchut</i> is vested within the seventy ministering angels<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar Bereishit 46b; Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar HaMilah 145c; Shaarei Teshuvah 74a.</i> of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>. They too are in a state of total nullification, like a horse to its rider.
This is as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 19:1</i> “Behold <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה rides upon a swift cloud-עב קל etc.,” and as explained in the Zohar,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II 43a</i> that they are, “like a cloud upon which He rides etc.” This is similar to the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 10:15</i> “Can an axe glory over the One who chops with it etc.”
Even though there are many different levels in them, with numerous chainings-down, even those who receive through a multitude of screens, in an aspect of the back of the back of <i>Elohi״m-</i>אלהי״ם, from the forty-eight (מ”ח) last combinations [of <i>Elohi”m-</i>אלהי״ם] which is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Blessing of “<i>Emet V'Emunah</i>”; Pri Etz Chayim, Shaar Chag HaMatzot, Shaar 21, Ch. 5; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 1, pg. 327; Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 1,061; Shaar HaEmunah 30a &amp; 49a.</i> “the land of the children of Cham (ח”ם-48),” in a way of ultimate concealment and <i>Tzimtzum</i>-restraint with various different types of screens and separations, so much so, that it is called a garment of sackcloth and skin, as in the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 50:3; Also see <i>Siddur</i> Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Milah 45c; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 2 pg. 896.</i> “I will enclothe the heavens with darkness and I will put sackcloth as their covering etc.,” as known, and as stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Havdalah</i> prayer; Shaarei Teshuva 113c</i> “He who separates etc.” Nonetheless it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 47:9</i> “God reigns over the nations etc.,” and,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 10:7</i> “Who will not fear You, O King of the nations etc.,” for,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 103:19</i> “His kingdom rules over all.”
Proof of this is from Bilaam, who was the, “evil aspect of <i>Nogah”</i> (<i>Ra D’Nogah</i>), the aspect of <i>Da'at</i> of the external husks<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 194a; Etz Chayim, Shaar 32, Ch. 2; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2, p. 643.</i> (<i>Kelipah</i>), as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 24:16</i> “he who knows the knowledge of the Most High (<i>Yodeah Da'at Elyon</i>) etc.” Nevertheless, even he said,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 24:13</i> “I cannot transgress the word of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה to do even the smallest thing etc.”
(Even his donkey, which was the aspect of <i>Nukvah</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of the <i>Kelipah –</i> the female of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of the external husks,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 107a; MeOrei Or, <i>Erech Aton</i> num. 138.</i> which is even more severe (for as will be explained about the opposite of holiness (<i>Sitra Achera</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 7:14; Biurei HaZohar, Pekudei 59b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Shemot Vol. 2, pg. 495; Shaarei Teshuvah 69a.</i> the aspect of the female-<i>Nukvah</i> is the most severe of them all<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 231b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch pg. 33.</i> etc.), [However even about his donkey] it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 22:23</i> “and his donkey turned away [from the angel of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה] etc.,” and even Bilaam said,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 22:34</i> “If it displeases You, I shall return etc.”)
Now, although there are those [<i>Kelipot</i>-husks] that are in an aspect of total somethingness and separation, so much so, that they say,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:17</i> “My power and the strength of my hand [brought me all this affluence] etc., such as the ministering angel of Egypt who said,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Ezekiel 29:3; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577, pg. 275; Bamidbar Vol. 2, pg. 814.</i> “My river is mine and I made myself etc.” and as the sages, of blessed memory, have stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Torat Kohanim to Leviticus 26:14; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereishit pg. 98</i> “They know their master and intentionally rebel against Him.” These are from the aspect of the three totally impure husks (<i>Kelipot</i>), and they too submit at times, when <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה visits punishment upon them.
This is as explained about the various prophecies of the prophets regarding some of the ministering angels of the idolatrous nations of the world etc.
However, in the aspect of <i>Nogah</i>, even the aspect of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Asiyah,</i> which is mostly evil with a minority of good,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Etz Chayim, Shaar</i> 43, introduction; <i>Shaar</i> 47, Ch. 4; <i>Shaar</i> 49, Ch. 6.</i> they are in a state of constant submission, such as the planets and constellations, that are [influenced by] the seventy ministering angels about whom it also states, “The hosts of the heavens bow down to You,” and “They sing His praise every day” etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Torat Chayim, Bereishit</i> 1c.</i>
As known, this is in accordance with the reason for the constant orbit of the physical planets [and constellations] that this is due only to their forms and souls being in a constant state of praising and spiritual bowing to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה etc., as explained elsewhere. This will suffice for the understanding.

Chapter 54

Now, in order to understand the chaining down of the “opposite side” in a detailed manner etc., in regard to the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of the husks of <i>Kelipah</i> of <i>Atzilut, Briyah, Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> etc., we must first preface with the root of the aspect of the <i>Kelipah-</i>husks and understand what it is.
Now, it is known that the reason it is called by the name <i>Kelipah</i>-husks, is because it is likened to the husk of a fruit, which is the dross of each thing that comes about because of the admixture of good and bad etc. due to the shattering of the vessels etc. of the seven kings [of <i>Tohu</i>] who died and fell below etc.
The husk precedes the fruit,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar II 108b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 1, p. 209.</i> just as in the growth of any fruit, the peel always grows first. This is like the relationship of the placenta to the fetus, which comes about from the dross of the seminal drop etc.
Now, the root of these matters is known; that even within the aspect of pleasure, there is the aspect of its opposite. This is pain which is the opposite of pleasure, just as the letters <i>Nega</i>-plague-נגע are the opposite of the letters <i>Oneg</i>-pleasure-ענג.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 2:4 and the commentaries there; Also see Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Kuntreisim p. 210; Shaar HaTeshuvah 53d.</i>
(Similarly, <i>Pesha</i>-transgression-פשע is the opposite letters of <i>Shefa</i>-abundance-שפע.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III (<i>Idra Rabba</i>) 133a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol.1, p. 307; Torat Chayim Bereishit 28b.</i>)
This is because certainly, everything that comes into an aspect of spreading forth from the essence, has its opposing power, which also comes from the essence.
Therefore, even the aspect of the spreading forth of the light of pleasure and desire has an opposing power that opposes it. For example, this is when one is prevented from delighting in that pleasure. Likewise, if there is something in opposition, which is the opposite of that pleasure, it is called pain and suffering etc.
Likewise, within the wisdom and reason for the pleasure and desire there automatically is an opposing reason that opposes the desire. This is likewise so of emotions and thought, speech and action etc.
This is like a servant who transgresses and opposes the will of his master. In doing so, he opposes all the particulars included in the will [of his master] etc.
Similarly, [it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ecclesiastes 7:14</i>] “God made one thing opposite the other etc.,” so that there should be an aspect of opposition. This is called the dross (<i>Pesolet</i>), the husk (<i>Kelipah</i>) and the concealment that preceded at first etc.
This comes about by means of the aspect of the <i>Tzimtzum</i> and concealment that precedes all light and influence of desire, pleasure and wisdom etc.
This is like [the verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 7:11</i>] “Who knows the strength of Your anger and Your wrath is like the fear due You etc.” This is the aspect of the opposition to the desire. It is there that anger and wrath are applicable to those who oppose and transgress the will etc., until,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 23:19 &amp; 30:23</i> “The wrath of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו"ה shall rest upon the heads of the wicked etc.”
(This is as explained elsewhere about the matter of, “At first there was darkness [and then the light returned],” therefore,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereshit</i> p. 179; <i>Torat Chayim, Vayishlach</i> 185a.</i> “The insolent amongst the nations of the world are powerful at first etc.”)
Now, it is known that the principal shattering [which brought about] an admixture of actual good and evil, was in the aspect of <i>Sa”G-</i>ס״ג (יו״ד ה״י וא״ו ה״י), which is the aspect of the seven lower <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Binah</i>.
These are the aspect of the emotions of the intellect that give rise to the emotions of the heart, including bad emotions, such as anger, murderousness, evil lusts, evil love and fear, conquest and boastfulness for [the sake of] evil etc.
However, in <i>Chochmah</i> there was no shattering.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 8, Ch. 2, Ch. 3, Ch. 6</i> Rather, only the externality of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> fell,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 8, Ch. 2, Ch. 3, Ch. 6; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 3, pg. 1,116.</i> this being the root of external wisdoms [and sciences].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 1, pg. 9; Vol. 4, pg. 1,225; Na”Ch pg. 365; Sefer HaMaamarim 5649, pg. 267.</i>
Now, [in <i>Chochmah</i>] too there is the matter of [the verses],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 8:12; See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 2, pg. 532; Torat Chayim, Noach pg. 79a</i> “I am wisdom, I dwell with craftiness,” or,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:12; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Devarim Vol. 4, pg. 1,496.</i> “My father was [nearly] destroyed by the Aramite,” which refers to <i>Chochmah</i> of the <i>Kelipah</i>-husks, that is only for the sake of wickedness, as in,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah 4:22</i> “They are wise to do evil,” but not to do good whatsoever. This is not true <i>Chochmah</i>-wisdom, but rather only craftiness and falsehood, as known.
Even from the aspect of the “Supernal Pleasure,” the aspect of its externality was lowered.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Etz Chayim, Shaar 8, Ch. 3; Shaar 9, Ch. 2.</i> This is the root for the existence of the pleasures of this world.
Nevertheless, the principal aspect of evil is in the emotions, which branched far down into the husks (<i>Kelipah</i>) of <i>Asiyah.</i>
These are the wicked accusers who carry out actual evil, whose very [pleasure] in life is only to kill, like agents of death etc.
Below in this world, these are destructive creatures, such as snakes or predatory beasts etc., whereas in mankind these are the murderers.
Therefore, regarding the coming future when evil will be negated, it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 11:9 &amp; 65:25</i> “They will neither injure nor destroy [in all of My sacred mountain; for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה as the water covers the ocean bed],” because then, the remnants of the seven kings [of <i>Tohu</i>], that have not yet been rectified, will have been purified, as known.
Now, in the “other side” of <i>Kelipah</i> there [also] is an aspect of the form of man. He is called, “Man without a yoke-<i>Adam Bleeya’al-</i>אדם בליעל,” and is the aspect of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Kelipah</i>, like it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 32:25; Shaar HaTeshuvah 49c</i> “And there wrestled a man with him etc.”
This is the aspect of the emotions with the intellect of <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i> of the <i>Kelipah</i>-husks, including the aspect of <i>Keter</i> and <i>Atik Yomin</i> of <i>Kelipah,</i> which is called the depth of evil (<i>Omek Ra</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Sefer Yetzirah 1:5; Shaar HaTeshuvah Vol. 1, pg. 4a.</i> because it is the depth of the desire and pleasure for all wickedness, which is the source for all wicked desire.
In the Zohar these are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar III 41b; 70a;143a-b.</i> the “Crowns of Impurity - <i>Kitrin D'Mesavoota</i>” and in the terminology of the Talmud they are called,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See also Shaar HaTeshuva Vol. 1, pg. 4b</i> “The gates of impurity etc.”
Now generally, there is the aspect of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Kelipat Nogah</i> in [each world] of <i>Atzilut, Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>.
However, in the aspect of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> there is no evil whatsoever, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 5:5; Maamarei Admor HaZaken, Parshiot HaTorah Vol. 2, pg. 829; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch pg. 191.</i> “Evil shall not dwell with You etc.” Rather, it is the aspect of, “the sense of somethingness,” which is very pronounced and felt, such as the aspect of a person’s awareness of his own kindness, in that he glories in the kind deeds that he does.
Similarly, in regard to <i>Chochmah,</i> this is when he is very aware of his own wisdom. The same holds true of all one’s qualities and positive qualities. He knows and is aware of them in a very pronounced way.
What branches out as a result of this, leads to an aspect of actual evil. For example, in one who feels himself to be kind, there will branch out kindness that is only for his own self-aggrandizement and benefit, such as the kindness of Ishmael<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Siddur Im Divrei Elokim Chayim, Shaar HaSukkot pg. 259c; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Na”Ch pg. 534.</i> and the like.
This then, is an example of the chaining down of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Briyah,</i> which branches out from <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, in that, all in all, it has a minority of evil,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See the previous chapter.</i> which is the aspect of doing something for one’s own benefit, with the pride and haughtiness of a “something-<i>Yesh</i>,” separate and apart [from <i>HaShem</i>-יהו"ה] etc.
(For example, because of fervor during prayer, which is pronounced, in that he is aware of himself, a person will become angered against anyone who opposes him, to the point of striking and pursuing him, if his honor is slighted.)
Similarly, it states that,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 16a; See Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Vayikra Vol. 2, p. 476.</i> “Satan and Peninah’s intentions were for the sake of heaven” – which is the aspect of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> – however, “he set his eyes on the first Temple and destroyed it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Sukkah 52a; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Bereshit pg. 98.</i>
This was from the aspect of the envy of the primordial snake,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 59b; Maamarei Admor HaEmtzaee, Hanachot 5577, pg. 231; Torat Chayim, Bereishit 33a &amp; 16a.</i> [which is] the aspect of, “somethingness for the sake of oneself,” with a minority of evil, even though this envy came about because of his recognition and closeness, as [it states],<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Avoda Zarah 55a</i> “Envy applies primarily [when the wise envies the wise, the mighty envies the mighty and the wealthy envies the wealthy] etc.”
<i>Nogah</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> however, is half evil, with actual accusations, as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Job 1:6 (2:1)</i> “And the Satan also came [amongst them] etc., and he said,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Job 1:9</i> ‘does Iyov fear God without personal benefit etc.?’”
[It then descends further] until the aspect of <i>Nogah</i> of <i>Asiyah,</i> which is mostly evil, to actualize every harsh judgment, which literally is its vitality.
This is called,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to Zohar 11b.</i> “An evil whip with which to smite etc.” Moreover, it is like a leech that draws out the dross of the blood etc., as it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Proverbs 30:15; Talmud Bavli, Avodah Zarah 17a</i> “The leech has [two daughters called] give, give etc.” This is the root of the aspect of hell (<i>Gehinom</i>) that will, “rest upon the heads of the wicked,”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 13b</i> as known.
Now, the three impure <i>Kelipot</i>-husks are like the snake, serpent and scorpion in the, “desert of the nations.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 8:15<i>; Likkutei Torah, Naso 20a; Shaar HaTeshuvah Vol. 1, p. 4b.</i></i>
[This is] the aspect of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Kelipah,</i> which is completely evil without any admixture of good whatsoever.
This is called<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 7a; Tanya Ch. 11</i> a “<i>Rasha v'Ra Lo</i> - A wicked one who has bad,” for which as of yet, there is no rectification whatsoever, but rather, only in the future, about which it states,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Zachariah 13:2</i> “I will – completely - remove the spirit of impurity” etc., as known. This will suffice for the understanding.
