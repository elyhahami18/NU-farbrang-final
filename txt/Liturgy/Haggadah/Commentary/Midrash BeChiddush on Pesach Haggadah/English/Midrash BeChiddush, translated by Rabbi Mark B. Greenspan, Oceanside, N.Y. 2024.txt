Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah

Introduction

<b>Midrash B’Chiddush</b> <br>By Rabbi Eliezer Nachman Foa<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Eliezer Nachman Foa was an Italian rabbi and author. His teacher was Rabbi Menachem Azariah of Fano, and his disciple was Rabbi Moses Zacuto - both respected members of the Italian school of Kabbalah. He was a member of an ancient illustrious Italian family and he served as Chief Rabbi of the Duchy of Modena. In Reggio he founded a society called "<i>Ḥevrat ha-'Alubim</i>." (The Association of the Modest Ones). Foa wrote a commentary on the <i>Haggadah</i>, to which was added a preface by members of the above-mentioned society. The book was published by them during the lifetime of the author (Venice, 1641). Foa also left a work named "Goren Arnon," containing five collections of sermons on the Pentateuch.

Preface <br><b>(<i>Yichadu</i>)</b> Let Israel declare the unity of the God who redeems the needy and let them speak of the mighty acts of the One who sows salvation! Let not human beings, who are mere maggots, (Job 25:6) refrain; let them speak of God's greatness and the wonders He performed in Egypt so that they may fulfill the words of the commandment, “In order that you may remember the day that you went forth from the land of Egypt all the days of your life.” (Deut, 16:3) I will seek assistance from the Blessed Holy One so that I may reach my intended goal. May God endow me with wisdom, understanding, knowledge and insight. “Open my eyes so that I may perceive the wonders of Your teaching.” (Ps, 119:18)
First, we will analyze why God decreed that Israel should be subjugated (to Egypt) so completely.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is not surprising that Rabbi Foa draws heavily on Lurianic Kabbalah. One of his teachers was Menachem Azaria of Fano who was a student of Moses Cordovero. The Italian community was deeply influenced by the sages of Safed - Italian Rabbis even visited Safed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Rabbi Foa’s primary teacher, Rabbi Menacham Azariah of Fano was one of the primary scholars who taught and communicated these teachings. See the article, Safed Kabbalah and Renaissance Italy by Moshe Idel. Safed Kabbalah and Renaissance Italy - Tablet Magazine</i> There can be no doubt that all of the deeds that God performs are for the purpose of achieving wholeness, as is written, “The Rock! Whose deeds are perfect.” (Deut. 32:4) This is so even when one is different, such as one who is born blind or lame, etc. All of God’s ways are proper<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishpat</i>, literally just.</i> , according to the nature of its matter, time, and the inborn nature which is as complete as possible for that person. God is faithful; even if we do not know the whole truth so that it appears as if God did not judge righteously. God desires righteousness and not evil. If that is so, why did He decree subjugation for the children of Abraham, His beloved, who are called His offspring. “For it is through Isaac that offspring shall continue for you.” (Gen. 12:12) And is not the line of Isaac continued through Jacob and his offspring are also called offspring of ‘Abraham, my beloved?’ Yet since God saw that Israel would one day sin and be deserving of enslavement, it was inevitable that this would happen once God made this decree. Rabbi Alsheikh<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Moshe Alsheikh</b> (1508–1593), known as the <i>Alsheikh Hakadosh (the Holy)</i>, was a prominent rabbi, preacher, and biblical commentator in the latter part of the sixteenth century. Alsheikh was born in 1508 in the Ottoman Empire, and was the son of Hayyim Alsheikh. He later moved to Safed (now in Israel) where he became a student of Rabbi Joseph Caro. His students included Rabbi Hayim Vital and Rabbi Yom Tov Tzahalon. He died in Safed in 1593. Wikipedia</i> writes in his essay, that as long as God did not decree enslavement, this could change… But once God made this decree it could not be changed, as Scripture states, “For as the rain or snow drops from heaven, so is the word that issues from My mouth: it does not come back to Me unfulfilled, but performs what I purpose…” (Is. 55:10) But if Israel was not guilty of wrongdoing and transgression was not found in them, making them worthy of such punishment, why would they be subjugated?
Now if we do say that it was fitting for them to be enslaved, we must explain why God sent them to Egypt, a place of greater impurity, filth and witchcraft than any other place in the world! Also why did God punish the punishers with all the plagues that were inflicted on them? Further, why did God personally smite Egypt and not do so through the agency of an angel or a <i>saraf</i>? (Along the way, we will explain the reason for the fifty plagues which struck the Egyptians in Egypt as well as the two hundred and fifty with which they were smitten at the sea.) I have already shared my thoughts on this in my book, <i>Goren Arnon</i>; I have explained there what came to me from heaven. Even so, in order to fulfill the commandment, “You shall tell your child on that day,”(Ex. 13:8) I will offer two or three reasons for the verse that occurred to me and which I explained there.
Firstly, one should note that Abraham was greater in the eyes of God than any human being from the time the world was created. Because of God’s great love of Abraham, God placed His name on him. He was the first person to say that Hashem was his God, and that he was “My (God’s) friend.” (Is. 41:8) In an hour of such great joy God said to Abraham, ““That one shall not be your heir but your very own issue shall be your heir,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See continuing passages</i> (Gen. 15:4) and, ‘I shall make your offspring like the stars in the heavens.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 13:6 and 32:13 - This statement is not a biblical quote; the authFor conflates these two statements with Genesis 15:5</i> Why did God also decree such suffering on Israel, subjugation and affliction for four hundred years without giving a reason? (Gen. 15:13-14)
<b>(<i>Omnan</i>)</b> Rather it is fitting to believe that the suffering, illness and affliction that come upon the many or the individual is meant to refine and repair corruption, as is stated, “Every word of God is pure…” (Pr. 30:5) This means that every statement that comes forth from God is from the attribute of judgment and is meant to refine. Based on this, the sages state that there is no suffering without sin; about this there is no disagreement in the<i> Talmud Shabbat</i> Chapter 5<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Shabbat 51b</i>. The sages disagree about whether there is death without sin. They conclude that there is death without sin but there is no suffering where there is no sin. Therefore, it is fitting to ask why the offspring of Abraham suffered in Egypt.
(<i><b>V’ulam</b></i>) We have received a tradition that Adam had two wives, one after the other. The first was created like him in height and form. Regarding the first wife, it is stated, “Male and female God created them…when they were created.” (Gen: 5:2) Because she was similar to Adam in form, she refused to accept his authority (over her) and she tried to lord over him. When she couldn’t, she fled. Her name was also Eve - she was the first Eve who is mentioned by the sages. When God saw that it was “Not good for man (adam) to be alone,” (Gen. 2:18) the Holy One took a rib and made a wife for him, so that she might recognize that since she was made from one of man’s limbs, she could not lord over him. This is what the <i>Ravad<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Abraham ben David</b> (c.1125-27 Nov. 1198), a Provençal rabbi, an important commentator on the Talmud, <i>Sefer Halachot</i> of Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi and <i>Mishne Torah</i> of Maimonides, and is regarded as a father of Kabbalah and one of the key links in the chain of Jewish mystics.</i></i> writes in the book, <i>Ba’alei Nefesh.</i> When she was given to Adam, the first Eve became jealous, as the sages say, “A woman only becomes jealous regarding the offspring of her neighbor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Megillah 13a</i> She thought that Adam might pursue her and she could act with him as her heart desired, whoring with her former husband as an adulterous woman, as Solomon said in his wisdom. When this did not happen she became disappointed and began to cry and lament (<i>yillel</i>). That is why she is called <i>Lillith. She</i> continues to desire to couple with man. Each night she wanders through the world and finds men whose thoughts are not pure or who are sad and sighing and she warms herself with them, causing them to have nocturnal emissions. She collects the seed and uses it to impregnate herself. That is why the sages warn us not to meditate on sinful matters lest we become impure at night. They also warned men not to be sad, for impurity only exists in a place of sadness. When holiness cannot dwell in a place, impurity enters. Because Adam was sad and mournful, he separated himself from his second wife for 130 years. According to the laws of fasting, he also refrained from intercourse and warmed himself with Lillith so that she robbed him of many sparks of purity that came from him. When the sages say that Adam immersed himself in the Gihon 130 years it does not mean he did so day and night. He did so in order to prevent sexual heat . He did so each day to prevent himself from having an emission…
Since these sparks come from one who is God’s creation, they are neither extinguished nor are they completely impure. They can be returned to righteousness through repair and refinement. But not every person is fit for this. The worst people cannot benefit from these sparks nor, hopefully, do they cause complete damage. One may silence such a person by quoting the sages who said, “It is forbidden for an <i>am ha’aretz<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">An ignorant person or one who is not scrupulous in the observance of the commandments.</i> to eat meat for He doesn’t know its secret origins and reason…”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Pesachim 49b and Shaarei Orah, Sixth Gate, Fifth Sefirah 6, Sixth Gate, Fifth Sefirah - Shaarei Orah</i> God brought forth people in each generation to refine the sparks but they caused damage. God knows that a person includes within himself every one who will come after him and all of them are part of the sin that was committed by eating the fruit in the Garden of Eden. This fruit led to idolatry, sexual immorality, and bloodshed,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">These are the three cardinal sins for which one must be willing to die and not transgress them.</i> as the sages say. God tried two or three times to repair this corruption. The first time was in the generation of Enosh. God gathered up all the sparks in order to repair the sin of idolatry but they caused corruption. As Scripture states, “Then they began to profane the name of <i>Adonai</i>….”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. 4:26, See Rashi commentary - this translation is based on Rashi's interpretation. “The word הוחל must be connected in meaning with חולין “profane matters “ viz, calling the names of men and the names of idols after the name of the Holy One, blessed be He — making them the objects of idolatrous worship and calling them deities (Gen. Rabbah 23:7).”</i> It was then that the sea (Okianus) began to inundate the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Tanchuma Yitro 16:2</i> God tried again to bring about a repair in the generation of the flood. Instead of correcting the sin of sexual immorality, the sparks caused the world to be wiped out with boiling water. He tried third time in the generation of the Division (<i>Dor Haflagah</i>) . Instead of repairing the sin of bloodshed they caused more damage with the building of the tower of Babel and it became necessary to confuse the people’s languages. They began killing one another so God spread them out over the earth. The people of Sodom came along and caused damage by committing all three cardinal sins, as is stated, “The people of Sodom were evil with one another;”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This does not appear in Scripture.</i> that is, with bloodshed, the sin of sexuality immorality and with idolatry. God struck them with blindness, similar to the punishment of Adam who was left in darkness. Then they were expelled from the world just as Adam was expelled from the Garden of Eden.</i>
<b>(<i>Biroto</i>)</b> When God saw that His great benevolence caused damage and did not bring about repair, God decreed, in great wisdom, set one nation apart from the others. That nation would not reject suffering and their righteousness would sustain them so they would not become so entangled or mixed with the other nations or return to their former nature. In this way they would cleanse and purify all the dross and filth around them. God chose the offspring of Abraham, His servant, for He knew that, “he would instruct his children and his posterity after him to keep the ways of God.” (Gen. 18:19) In this way when God afflicted them, they would cause righteousness and justice for the divine sparks and they would have compassion upon them.
This is what is meant when God made known to Abraham, “Know well (<i>yado’a teida</i>) that your ancestors will be strangers in a land not their own….” (Gen. 15:13) It would seem obvious to conclude that if they were strangers, they must be in’ a land not their own.’ That is why the<i> Torah</i> says, “<i>yado’a teida</i>,” “know ( you shall know well).”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The expression <i>yadoa teida</i> repeats the verb <b>ידע</b> <i>t</i>wice. It is translated above as “Know well.” The repetition of the verb is meant to teach us that there were two things they would come to know from this experience and not the more obvious thing that they were “strangers in a land not their own.”</i> There are two things that were made known to them: first, that the essential reason for humanity’s presence in the world was to repair the sparks that were corrupted; and second, that Abraham’s offspring were fit to accomplish this task. So, this may be compared to lead mixed with silver. When one wishes to refine the silver one places it in a furnace and heats the coals until it removes all of the dross mixed in with the silver. So too, it is impossible to purify impure souls without the fire of affliction. The afflictions must be accepted in this world or they will be purged in Gehinnom.
God has said, “For your offspring shall be strangers in a land not for them (<i>lahem</i>).” (Gen. 15:13) La<i>hem</i> should be understood as, “not for their sake.” They had not committed a sin that made them worthy of subjugation and affliction. Rather Abraham’s offspring were chosen because they were fitting to refine the sparks. Also, Abraham was not distressed when he learned the purpose of this decree. He recognized that he was being informed of good news; his offspring would purify the multitude of nations. Abraham began seeking converts so that the sparks would be repaired. In Egypt, the people of Israel sought to create a fence around themselves against sexual immorality in order to speed up the repair of the generation of the flood. Those who could not be purified (among the Israelites) were cast into the Nile. There were others who refused to change their names and thereby repair the damage done by the generation of the division (when the languages of humankind were confused). Others remained in Goshen so that they could come closer to the worship of God. Those who were unworthy were killed while building in Egypt. There were no slanderers in Israel, thus purifying the damage done by the people of Sodom, who slandered their guests and killed the righteous in Sodom. The few who were not purified (of sins) died during the three days of darkness.
It would appear that Israel’s presence in Egypt was directed at the generations that preceded them. Just as there was one righteous person in each generation who could uphold the world so that it was not destroyed, so, too, in Egypt. Moses was equal to all of the people and so whatever happened to them, happened to him…. In the beginning, Seth was born when Eve was 130 years old and from him the world was established. Similarly, Moses was born to Yocheved when she was 130 years old. In the generation of the flood, Noah was born circumcised just as Moses was born circumcised. Both Moses and Noah were saved in a <i>teivah</i>, an ark. Abraham rose after the generation of the division and he cursed the builders of the tower of Babel and he went out from among them. Similarly, in Egypt Moses rose up and killed the Egyptian and then fled from Egypt. Even though the people of Sodom were wicked sinners against God, Abraham prayed on their behalf. Similarly, in Egypt Moses prayed to God on behalf of Pharaoh and his servants even though they denied God. (Ex. 10: 17-18) This is sufficient reason to explain why Israel had to be subjugated even though they had not sinned. The whole reason was to refine the sparks and to repair the damage done by the earlier sins.
<b>(<i>Ta’am</i>)</b> The reason why Israel was exiled to Egypt and not somewhere else was because Egypt was closer to the holy land than any other place. Exile is a person’s exit from his/her own special place. Israel’s special place was a place of holiness. When they left that place they entered a land of impurity. Just as the earthly Jerusalem is parallel to the heavenly Jerusalem, as Scripture states, “Jerusalem is built up, a city knit together,” (Ps. 122: ) so Egypt neighbors (<i>meitzranit</i>) the land of Israel below and above.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">I believe that below and above here implies that it is below in the nether world and above in this world.</i> That is why it is called by the name <i>Mitzrayim;</i> it is the neighbor of the holiness of the land of Israel. See what is stated in the book <i>Shaarei Tzedek,</i> p. 8, on the declaration, “Now Hebron was founded seven years before Zoan of Egypt.” (Nu. 13:22)<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla (1248 – after 1305) ("the very little one") was a Spanish kabbalist, student of Abraham Abulafia. Shaarei Tzedek 1:33</i> Also see the <i>Zohar</i>, <i>Lech Lecha</i>, Page 81b where it explains with a similar reason why Abraham went down to Egypt, more so than any other land. It states, “Why to Egypt? Because it is equivalent to the garden of <i>Adonai</i> as it is written, “Like the garden of <i>Adonai</i>, the land of Egypt,” (Gen. 13:10) For there one river on the right plunges, as it is written, “The name of the first is Pishon, the one winding through the whole land of Havilah,” (Gen. 2:11)... Once Abraham knew and entered perfect faith, he sought to know all the rungs linked below, and since Egypt drew from the right, he went down to Egypt.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 81b Volume 2, pages 19-20 in Matt translation</i> It pointed to the holiness. Therefore God exiled them there so that they would not be far from their place (of holiness). We have explained why Egypt accepted nine out of ten measures of witchcraft which descended upon Egypt and why Israel went out of Egypt before the allotted time. Are the answers to these questions not written in the book <i>Goren Arnon, Parshat Lech Lecha!</i>
<b>(<i>Od</i>)</b> There is another reason why Israel was exiled to Egypt and not another land. In order to declare God’s divinity and greatness in the world, it was necessary to chose one who was close to God so that those far away would hear of it and fear God, as Scripture states, “Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.” (Lev. 10:3) Egypt was (physically) closer to the land of Israel’s holiness more than any other nation, as has been mentioned. Regarding their heavenly prince, it is stated, “He had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command…” (Gen. 41:43) Joseph rode second in order to publicize (his stature) to the whole world. Had God smote another prince of lower status, people would have said that God didn’t have the ability to smite a prince of higher status. Now they could no longer make this claim. <sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The argument seems to be that by placing Joseph second, it showed that there was no one higher. Here too, the heavenly supernal prince of Egypt was second only to God and higher than all the other supernal princes - so by smiting them God showed he was all powerful.</i>
<b>(<i>Od</i>)</b> Also it was God’s intention to carry out justice in the future through this nation, as is stated, “but I will execute judgment on the nation they shall serve,” (Gen. 15:14) That is to say, ‘Is it not proper that I myself should bring justice to a far off nation, and that a far off neighbor should receive ‘this honor,’<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Foa uses this expression ironically - they have the honor of being struck with plagues.</i> and be punished with plagues and their death? I shall explain this later on with the help of God.’ 
Once we know the reason for the exile and the place we will be able to explain the <i>Haggadah</i> completely with more reasons.

Paragraph 3

As the <i>Maggid<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Maggid</i> refers to the central part of the <i>Haggadah</i> which contains the story of the Exodus but here Rabbi Foa uses the term for the speaker who tells the story of the Exodus.</i></i> begins, he tries to fortify our children during this long exile so that they will believe that the Holy One will redeem us. He explains the reason for the long exile; this is the essence of the <i>Haggadah.</i> The <i>Haggadah</i> contains a record of all the things that happened to our ancestors in Egypt. It records the plagues with which God smote Egypt, and similar acts that God will bring for the future redemption. When we recall these things, we arouse God’s compassion so that we will be redeemed, saying, ‘See how fitting it is that God performed these miracles for Israel! ‘For I have performed these miracles which they continue to mention many years ago and they are not ungrateful.’ To this we say, “Anyone who increases the telling of the Exodus is praiseworthy,” since it arouses God’s great compassion. This is stated in this book; we will mention this later on. But it begins with, “This is the bread of affliction.” <br><b>(<i>Tehilah</i>)</b> First let us consider why this <i>Midrash</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Foa correctly refers to the <i>Haggadah</i> as a <i>Midrash</i> both here and in the title of his work, <i>Midrash B’Chidush</i>. The title might be translated “A Midrash with Novel Interpretations.</i> begins in the language of the <i>Targum</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"> The word <i>Targum</i> means translation - but it generally refers to the Aramaic translation of the Bible.</i> (Aramaic) but it doesn’t continue in this language. It is well known that <i>Targum</i> (Aramaic) is the language of <i>Aram, th</i>e language of the <i>Ramai,</i> the liar,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The liar is none other than Satan. Also <i>Hametz</i> and <i>Se’or,</i> leaven is associated with the demonic, which we remove from our homes.</i> the one who constantly accuses Israel. That is why the sages said that one should not ask for one’s needs in Aramaic; the heavenly angels do not understand the language of “the Aramean who sought to destroy my father.” (Deut. 26:5) Despite this, the sages decreed that we give Satan his portion, by reciting certain prayers in Aramaic, such as the <i>Kaddish</i> and the K<i>edushah D’Sidra</i> so that Satan will not prosecute us. In this way he will feel that he is glorified and consider himself important because we recited certain prayers in his language.  <br>Now (on Passover) when he (Satan) is expelled from our homes, as God commanded us, “No leaven shall be found in your houses,” (Ex. 12:19) and, “For all leaven (<i>s’or)</i> and leavening (<i>hametz</i>).” These are also names for Satan, who is also called the evil inclination. There is no question that he is meticulous in this matter. Therefore, we make a point that a portion of our prayers be given to him like the goat that is sent to <i>Azazel</i> (on Yom Kippur). This is similar to the proverb which the sages said, “When a dog barks in the king’s house, the king says, ‘Throw him a bone,” so he won’t disturb the meal. That is why we begin the Seder in the Aramaic language so that Satan will not disturb our meal. <br><b>(<i>V’hitchilu</i>)</b> We begin with this statement (in Aramaic) so that Satan will hear that we are still subjugated, in exile, and he will not look unfavorably on our festivities. We say to him, if we actually had left Egypt would we still be eating the bread of affliction as we did there? And if Satan wishes to join our meal, we invite him to do so. That is why we say, “All who are hungry, let him come and eat,” fulfilling the words of Scriptures, “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat,” (Prov. 25:21) He is also invited so that we don’t forget the destruction of our Temple and our place of beauty, thereby fulfilling the statement, “If I have not placed Jerusalem above my greatest joy.” (Ps. 137:6) This is according to the version of the <i>Sefaradim</i>, Rambam, and Abudraham, “Now we are here, slaves….”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">This is different from the Ashkenazic version which separates the two statements from one another. A - Now we are here; next year in the land of Israel. Now we are slaves; next year we will be free. S - Now we are here; next year in the land of Israel. Now we are here as slaves; next year in the land of Israel as free people.</i> <br><b>(<i>Ulam</i>)</b> However, it is not clear what <i>Ha lachma anya</i>, “This is the bread of affliction,” means. If it refers to the type of bread our ancestors ate in Egypt, then it should be, “This is like (<i>k’ha)</i> the bread of affliction,” the version in some Ashkenazic <i>Haggadot</i>. But even this version is problematic. For our ancestors in Egypt did not eat <i>matzah</i> like ours. Scripture testifies that when they left Egypt they had <i>matzah</i> because they had been expelled and could not tarry. Therefore the bread they ate in Egypt was still called <i>lechem oni,</i> the bread of oppression, because they ate while they were being oppressed and subjugated. According to this, it should have said, “The bread which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt is the bread of affliction.” Also, why should this bread be considered worse than any other type of affliction? To this, we answer that since the recitation of the <i>Seder</i> is set before the meal, we call the <i>matzah</i>, l<i>echem oni</i> so that we would not fall asleep, preventing telling the story as we should and keeping us awake. <br><b>(<i>Akh</i>)</b> The word <i>lachma,</i> here, does not mean “bread” (<i>lechem</i>) but rather “meal,” as is said, “A great banquet (<i>lechem rav</i>)”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“King Belshazzar gave a great banquet <i>(lechem rav)</i> for his thousand nobles, and in the presence of the thousand he drank wine.”</i> (Dan. 5:1) This is also demonstrated by our actions. We recite this expression as we lift up the plate containing the <i>matzah</i>, the vegetables and the other items. This is also implied by the statement in the <i>Gemara,</i> “One must remove the table and afterwards one says, <i>Ha lachma anya</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">I am unable to find the source in the Talmud. See Tur Orech Chaim, 486, Beit Yosef Orech Chaim 437</i> in order to encourage children to ask questions. Similarly, when Abaye was a youngster in the house of Rabbah, his teacher, he asked, “Since we have not yet eaten, why are we taking the table away?” Rabbah then answered, “You have exempted us from reciting the <i>Mah Nishtanah</i>!”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">BT Pesachim 115b Note the source is in Aramaic and not Hebrew: אַבָּיֵי הֲוָה יָתֵיב קַמֵּיהּ דְּרַבָּה, חֲזָא דְּקָא מַדְלִי תַּכָּא מִקַּמֵּיהּ, אֲמַר לְהוּ: עֲדַיִין לָא קָא אָכְלִינַן, אָתוּ קָא מְעַקְּרִי תַּכָּא מִיקַּמַּן?! אֲמַר לֵיהּ רַבָּה: פְּטַרְתַּן מִלּוֹמַר ״מָה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה״</i> This implies that <i>lachma anya</i> is the meal that our ancestors ate in Egypt: that is, meager bread, greens and not much more. They built habitations of clay and bricks - that is why we place <i>haroset</i> on the <i>Seder</i> plate according to the <i>Talmud</i> and the <i>poskim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Posek</i> is the term in Jewish law for "decider" - a legal scholar who decides the <i>Halacha</i> in cases of law where previous authorities are inconclusive. The decision of a <i>pose</i>k is called a <i>p’sak din</i> or <i>p’sak halacha</i> ("ruling of Jewish law") or simply a "<i>p’sak"</i>.</i> There is also a cooked or roasted shankbone, a reminder of the festive and Passover sacrifices. Thus the only items in the meal are things that a needy person would have: bread that has not risen and is meager and scanty like the bread the poor would eat in small amounts, greens that would leave their faces pale<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Playing on the similarity between <i>Yarak</i> and<i> Horee</i>k</i> from oppression, and <i>haroset</i> which is a reminder of the clay. There are also some things to eat and to feed others: wine in plenty since even the needy in Israel should not have less than four cups of wine and all the regular items - meat, fish and all types of tasty things that they can imagine rich people having. In this way we can also say, “All who are hungry come and eat…” The reason we don’t say “This is like the bread of affliction,” is because it is well known that things are never like the thing it is supposed to resemble. And we say this is the bread of affliction in order to make clear that this meal is not worse than the meal that our ancestors ate in Egypt.  <br>By way of a midrashic and allegorical explanation, the opening expression comes to describe the way things are and to comfort our children in exile since we were not redeemed in the present month of <i>Nisan</i> as we expected. And making us aware that in a future month of <i>Nisan</i> we are destined to be redeemed, when the time comes, with God’s help. <br><i><b>(V’hitchil)</b></i> One begins with this text in order to fulfill what the sages stated: a person is obligated to give thanks (<i>livarekh</i>) for the bad as well as the good. One acknowledges and offers praise to the Master of All for exiling us from our land, for had we not been exiled, we never would have been able to give thanks to God for anything! As the sages said, “The first Temple was only destroyed because the people did not recite blessings for <i>Torah</i>, or other blessings. It seems obvious that this was the reason for the destruction of the first Temple, for the blessings were only decreed in the time of Ezra and his Beit Din. The second return then was not a redemption but a return. The reason for the destruction of the second temple was that the people gossiped, just as people do today. That is why we say, <i>Ha lachma anya</i>, as the sages explained it, “This is the bread about which we say many things…”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Pesacim 115b Shmuel said that the phrase: “The bread of affliction [<i>leḥem oni</i>]” (Deut. 16:3) means bread over which one answers [<i>onim</i>] matters, i.e., one recites the Haggadah over <i>matzah</i>. That was also taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <i>Leḥem oni</i> is bread over which one answers many matters.</i> <br>Our ancestors in Egypt ate it without a blessing, is implied by the statement, “All who are hungry come and eat, all who are needy come partake of the Passover offering.” This implies that at that time there was such great hunger that they would come and immediately jump into the meal. The word <i>yeitei</i>, “come,” should be read as present tense, as in, “This is what Job always does (<i>yei’aseh</i>),”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Job 1:5 Normally we would read the verb <i>yei’aseh</i> as future tense - Rabbi Foa suggests here we should read it in the present tense as I have chosen to translate. Similarly, he reads Yeitei as They are coming - immediately and not a future verb.</i> Also, in the verse, “At such times as the cloud rests (<i>yihiyeh</i>) over the Tabernacle for but a few days,” (Nu. 9:30) and in other such verses. Similarly, the verse, “We remember the fish we ate for free in Egypt;” implies, it was free from heavenly command.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Numbers 11:5 See Rashi’s comment on this verse.</i> But what commandment was associated with the eating of fish? It is the commandment to recite a blessing which they did not do!  <br>Now, however, before we eat <i>matzah</i>, we recite seven blessings. That is why, after saying “as we did in Egypt,” we pray for our redemption. It is as if we are making a <i>kal va’chomer</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>A kal va’chomer is an argument a fortiori, meaning</i> “from the stronger case.” For example, one may make the following logical reasoning and support it using the basis of this rule: If, as a given, a parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, surely the parent will punish his or her child should the latter return home with scuffed shoes, ripped pants and a torn shirt. The reasoning is based on pure logic: if the parent is so upset about one item of clothing, surely he or she will be at least that upset about the child's entire ensemble. List of Talmudic principles - Wikipedia</i> If while the Israelites were in Egypt, they did not recite blessing on the food they ate so they did not recognize God’s loving kindness, and yet they were still redeemed, we, who recite blessing (every day), how much more so do we deserve to be redeemed! Therefore, may it be God’s will that what we eat this year in slavery, we may eat next year in the land of Israel as free people who did not withhold blessing God in holiness and purity.

Four Questions



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

One might ask, why do the sages, ob’m,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Of blessed memory - this abbreviation will be used throughout this essay.</i> arrange the <i>Haggadah</i> with questions and answers?<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Foa is not only talking about the Mah Nishtanah. Other questions appear in the Haggadah as well: the four sons and Rabban Gamliel’s statement as well as Echad Mi Yodea. He also quotes the Talmud where we are told the Seder must begin with a question. See Note below as well.</i> We are taught: “If he has a son, etc, if he has a wife she should ask him, and if not, he should ask himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">BT See Pesachim 116a. This is not the first time that Rabbi Foa appears to paraphrase the Talmud text. I believe this is the passage he is quoting: תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: חָכָם בְּנוֹ — שׁוֹאֲלוֹ. וְאִם אֵינוֹ חָכָם - אִשְׁתּוֹ שׁוֹאַלְתּוֹ, וְאִם לָאו - הוּא שׁוֹאֵל לְעַצְמוֹ, וַאֲפִילּוּ שְׁנֵי תַּלְמִידֵי חֲכָמִים שֶׁיּוֹדְעִין בְּהִלְכוֹת הַפֶּסַח — שׁוֹאֲלִין זֶה לָזֶה.</i> When a person studies something difficult and then arrives at a satisfying solution, the answer stays with him and never leaves him. <br>The Exodus from Egypt is the root and essence of all the commandments. Therefore, “Even if we are all sages, all discerning, elders,and knowledgeable about the<i> Torah</i>, it is incumbent upon us,” to analyze the Exodus with all our intellectual tools in order that it be completely set in our minds and not leave us. Concerning <i>p’shat</i>, one might say, “A verse never leaves its literal meaning.”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">BT Shabbat 63a, Yevamot 24a, Rashi - ואע"ג דדרשינן ליה לדרשא מידי פשוטו מיהו לא נפיק לגמרי: Even though we interpret a verse homiletically, it still has its literal meaning.</i> Because Scripture states, “And when, in time to come (<i>machar</i>), your child <b>asks</b> you, saying, ‘What does this mean,” (Ex. 13:14) and also, “And when your children says to you, ‘What do you mean by this rite,’” (Ex. 12:26) it would appear that questions are preferable in the eyes of God. The word <i>machar</i> does not mean ‘tomorrow's here but (as translated above) ‘some time later.’ It implies that the answer to the child will come whenever it will come because God wants the child to find the answers to his/her own questions. That is why the sages saw fit to fashion <i>Haggadah</i> in the form of a question (and answer). Or it might be because they understood that any question is fitting to God, as we see from the simple child who asks, “What is this?” Therefore, they organized the <i>Seder</i> so that even a single person who is a scholar must ask himself, even if there is no basis for asking. Anyone who asks should not be embarrassed to do so. <br>Why do we ask these questions rather than others? If the purpose of the questions is to teach us about the subjugation as with the case of <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror,</i> then why ask, “Why…do we recline?” And if the purpose of the questions was to teach about both slavery and freedom, why doesn’t the passage also mention drinking four cups of wine? We are all obligated to drink four cups of wine, as we are taught in the <i>Mishnah,</i> “Even a poor person, should not have less than four cups of wine.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Pesachim 10:1</i> There is yet another reason to ask about wine. (According to the <i>Mishnah</i>) We just poured the second cup of wine before reciting the<i> Mah Nishtanah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">As the Seder is presented in the Mishnah.</i> The child should be asking questions about the things that they have just seen and not things that they are going to do after reciting the <i>Haggadah.</i> <br><b><i>(Amnam)</i></b> However, <i>Mah Nishtanah</i> can be explained in the way we interpreted the first passage in the <i>Haggadah.</i> The leader of the Seder comes to comfort those who are suffering through this long exile. The leader asks, “Why is this exile which is also called, “this night,” different from other nights/exiles?” As is written, “Morning has come and also night,”<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Isaiah 21:12 See Abarbanel</i> (Is.21:12) of all the exiles that have passed. (He then explains the way that this “night” is different from all the other “nights.”)<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the four statements that follow, “How is this night different,” are not answers to the question but explanations of how this night/exile is different.</i> <br>1. “Know that during the other nights/exiles through which we have passed, we consumed <i>chametz</i> and <i>matzah,</i> after being redeemed. <i>Chametz</i> and <i>matzah</i> are allusions to the good and evil inclination; that is, one who is ruled by a good or an evil inclination. But when we escape the exile on this night/exile, it will be because we are entirely ruled by the good inclination and the evil inclination will be completely banished. Thus, the <i>shin</i> on the word s<i>h’bechol</i> means <i>bishveel</i> - ‘because’ or ‘for the sake of:’ because of other nights/exiles we continue to eat <i>chametz</i> and <i>matzah</i> but at the end of this night/exile, there will only be <i>matzah</i>/the good inclination. <br>2. There is another reason why this night/exile is longer than all other exiles. “On all the other nights/exiles we ate all types of vegetables…” This can be understood based on <i>Perek HaSefinah</i>: (Baba Batra ch.5) “In the world to come, every righteous person will be burned by embarrassment at the size of the canopy of the other.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Baba Batra, Ch. 5, BT 75a <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> This <b>teaches that each and every one is burned from</b> embarrassment at the size of <b>the canopy of the other,</b> and says: <b>Woe for this embarrassment, woe for this disgrace,</b> that I did not merit a canopy as large as his. אָמַר רַבִּי חֲנִינָא מְלַמֵּד שֶׁכׇּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד נִכְוֶה מֵחוּפָּתוֹ שֶׁל חֲבֵירוֹ אוֹי לָהּ לְאוֹתָהּ בּוּשָׁה אוֹי לָהּ לְאוֹתָהּ כְּלִימָה</i> <br>3. This is referring to a type of jealousy that is permitted in this world. It is the type of jealousy that increases a sage's desire for wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">When scholars are jealous of the level of knowledge of their colleagues it causes them to work harder to increase their level of understanding.</i> This is the type of jealousy which the righteous experience in the Garden of Eden from the canopy of his fellow. It will not be considered the bad type of jealousy that causes pain from the honor bestowed on his fellow. Rather the sage experiences pain because he did not increase his commandments and good deeds in this world so that he would merit what his colleague merits in the world to come. Because of this suffering he will n0w merit a greater reward. This is what is stated: On all other nights/ exiles we eat all other all types of vegetables (<i>yirakot/יְרָקוֹת</i>); that is, that cause us to experience jealousy, both good and bad, for jealousy causes a person's face to pale (<i>morikot/מוֹרִיקָה</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote"><i>The word yirakot is connected to morikot</i> both come from the same root hebrew word - <i>yarak</i></i> “But on this night, <i>maror,</i>” we experience (good) jealousy which is like <i>maror</i> because there is no vegetable as bitter as <i>maror</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">It is referring to <i>kinat sofrim</i> - the jealousy that a sage feels at the level of good deeds and commandments of his fellow.</i> <br>4. Further, “On all other nights we do not even dip once…” Dipping/<i>matbilim</i> is related to <i>tevilah</i>/immersing<i>.</i> This is meant to suggest that the troubles of the other nights of exile did not require us to immerse ourselves even once, while the suffering of this exile requires two immersions, one for the body and one for the soul which takes place in <i>Gehinnom</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Originally the name of a location outside of the old city of Jerusalem, Gehinnom later came to be associated with Hell, or the place to which we go to make atonement for our sins after death. See: Gehenna - Wikipedia</i> <br>5. Further, “On all other nights we eat either sitting or leaning…” There are those who experience part of the pleasure of the world to come such as people who rejoice in the Sabbath, which is one sixtieth of the world to come as well as those who participate in intimate marital relations. “But on this night, all of us lean…” since all of us will merit this rejoicing. And since all the things that have been mentioned need to be free from dross and impurity, God causes us to suffer and lengthens our exile so that this good will be experienced by all of us in the future. <br><b>(<i>Od</i>)</b> It is also possible that the question (<i>Mah Nishtanah</i>) should be understood according to its plain meaning: “<b>How</b> is this night/exile different,” and it is answered with the differences that are mentioned, “On all other nights….” - all the other exiles, we eat <i>chametz</i> and <i>matzah, etc…</i> and the other differences that are mentioned here. The <i>Maggid</i> understands that this exile/night is different from the other nights/exiles because there are four things that cause suffering to those living through the present exile.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, why are all these differences necessary on this night…</i> First, we suffer because “there are those who rise up over us in every generation to destroy us;” if we were redeemed we would be free of such suffering. Secondly, during the present exile our evil inclination incites us and causes us to sin against our Creator; if we were redeemed we would certainly not be harmed by the evil inclination. As the sages say, in the future, the Holy One will capture the evil inclination and slaughter it.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Source is unknown.</i> Third, during the present exile we do not receive an immediate reward for performing the <i>mitzvot,</i> and for most people waiting for a reward in the world to come is a, “Hope deferred that sickens the heart.” (Isaiah 21:12) Fourth, the wonders are hidden during this night/exile. The <i>Haggadah</i> frames the question according to these four causes that make the present night/exile so harsh. If you ask, “why is this night/exile so much more harsh than all the other nights/exiles,” it is because of these reasons. <br>1. During the other exiles God did not wait until we had completely removed the evil inclination ( compared to c<i>hametz)</i> to redeem us, but during the present exile, redemption won’t come about until we completely remove the evil inclination. Rather, God knows that we are still consuming <i>chametz</i> - there are some who are sometimes ruled by the evil inclination and sometimes by the good inclination - this did not stop God from redeeming us in the past. But during the present exile/night, until we only consume <i>matzah</i> and we completely remove <i>chametz/the</i> evil inclination from our midst we will not be redeemed. <br>2. The other nights/exiles were different because we were allowed to eat all types of vegetables. That is, we experienced all types of bitterness from various sources. But during this night/exile, we cannot be redeemed until we experience the most harsh type of bitterness. It is a bitterness caused by the length of the exile and also because of the disgrace that we experience that is caused by the filth and refuse. (Lam. 3:45) Such bitterness clings to our souls and it is bitter beyond comparison. <br>3. Further, on all other nights/exiles we did not even have to immerse even once… Why is there such a big difference between this exile/night and all the other exiles/nights? During all the other exiles, there was no confusion about when we would be redeemed. During the exile in Egypt we knew that subjugation would not last more than four hundred years, and the Babylonian exile was only seventy years. This is the meaning of the expression, “We did not immerse (<i>matbilin</i>)” - this means we were not confused.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The connection between the words <i>murbavim and matbilim</i> - between immerse and confuse is not clear to me. The linguistic connection seems to be more related to the second expression תִּפָּ֣עֶם רוּח֔וֹ, “his spirit became agitated.” Maybe the idea here is that we are extremely agitated.</i> <i>Afilu pa’am achat</i>,”Even one time” - this expression is borrowed from the expression <i>tipa’em rucho</i>, תִּפָּ֣עֶם רוּח֔וֹ, “his spirit became agitated.” (Gen. 41:8) But during the present exile, we are doubly agitated, firstly because we might not merit redemption and secondly, there might be other forms of suffering that will yet take place. <br>4. Finally, “On all other nights we eat either sitting or leaning.” One who is leaning, does not have it in his mind to suddenly stand up, unlike the person who sits upright, without leaning. As the sages say, “If they were reclining, one recites a blessing (standing) on behalf of them all,”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Berachot 6:6 See Sefaria Commentary by Rabbi Joshua Kulp: If they are reclining, one blesses for them all. If they are reclining, then they are eating a formal banquet together and one person can bless on behalf of them all.</i> since it is their intention to remain together until the end of the meal. Therefore, when it says, “On all other nights we eat either sitting or leaning,” it means, sometimes they would sit without leaning as if they were prepared to rise in redemption and sometimes they would lean like ones who were napping, having despaired of being redeemed. As the sages say,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">BT See Megillah 11b - 12a</i> “Balshazar calculated and erred, Achashveros calculated and erred, Daniel calculated and erred, as it says, “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, consulted the books concerning the number of years that, according to the word of <i>Adonai</i> that had come to Jeremiah the prophet, were to be the term of Jerusalem’s desolation— 70 years.”(Dan. 9:2) When they were close to the allotted time they would sit upright without leaning like someone who is ready to get up. While some regularly leaned when they ate, like the great majority of the Jewish people <i>in Babylonia and in Spain,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Italics are mine - this comment is telling and meant to be a criticism of the Jews who left Spain - they were unprepared for redemption or for their exile.</i> others were also sitting upright because they were prepared for the imminent redemption. “But on this night/exile all of us were leaning…” because we don’t know how long this exile will last. <br>To all of these matters we answer with light words<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:13:1 This one ate <i>light foods</i> and he was harmed… The answer provided by the <i>Haggadah</i> is easy to digest though it contains great depth.</i> that includes many matters. We begin with, “We were slaves in Egypt…” In other words, all of this has happened because we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and God took us out from there before the allotted time with great strength and a mighty hand as shall be seen. Actually God wanted to wait so that God could remove all the oppressors so that the Israelites would never have to be in exile again. <br>

We Were Slaves in Egypt



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

It is well known that fruits that are prematurely picked before they ripen will not be preserved and will quickly rot. Even those that ripen by means of artificial watering will not sweeten like those that ripen on their own, as Scripture states, “With the bounteous yield of the sun,” (Deut. 33:14) Similarly, because God, “Leaped over mountains and bounded over hills,” (Song 2:8) redeeming Israel before the allotted time, the Israelites were like prematurely gathered fruits. This was the cause of all the evils that happened afterwards. It was due to all the idolatry of Egypt which made Israel impure, as is stated in Scripture, “Cast away, every one of you, the detestable things of his eyes and do not defile yourselves with the fetishes of Egypt.” (Ezek. 20:7) As a result, they entered forty-ninth of the fifty gates of impurity. If God had not rushed to bring Israel out from Egypt, they might have entered the fiftieth gate and would never have escaped from Egypt. The impurity would have surrounded them on all sides and Israel would have become a strange people. It is possible this would have been caused by the sparks referred to earlier. <br>Regarding this, the <i>Haggadah</i> states that, “We, our children and our children’s children would have been subjugated in Egypt…” (Three generations) are mentioned since the compassion of a father for his children extends (for three generations),<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Exodus 22:2</i> and it doesn’t need to mention additional generations. The statement implies that all the continuing generations would have been subjugated to Pharaoh in Egypt. <br>Since God said to Abraham, “And afterwards they shall go out with great wealth,” they began counting (the subjugation), the four hundred years, from the birth of Isaac and not from the descent into Egypt as would have been fitting. It was through the haste of the Divine Presence and the haste of Israel that caused them to leave before the allotted time. If it had been possible for them to wait, evil would not have come upon them in the wilderness and afterwards in the land of Israel, and impurity would not have overwhelmed them. When God decrees greatness to a person and, even more so, to a nation, it is decreed for all generations. This was the great strength and the mighty hand that was necessary (so to speak) to bring us out of Egypt. It wasn’t that God had trouble redeeming Israel, for the other nations were nothing in comparison with God. All the inhabitants of the earth are non-existent (in comparison with God). While God is a righteous Judge, the Exodus had to take place before its allotted time which was against the judgment so that it took extra strength and a mighty hand (to redeem Israel). It was necessary to speak in defense of Israel, (Ex. 20:2) and find a way to establish God’s words forever. After all, if God had decreed, “They shall be afflicted and serve them four hundred years,” (Gen. 15:13) this must be so! That is why they began the count from the birth of Isaac. That is, God wanted Pharaoh to say, “Rise up and go out of my nation,” (Ex. 12:31) so that the accuser (Satan) could not make a claim. Despite this, the accuser still complained about the extra 190 missing years.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is a common theme in many of the other commentaries: how do we account for the four hundred years of slavery? If we account for slavery from the time that Jacob’s children went down to Egypt, then we are missing 190 years. And if we account for the years from the birth of Isaac then there is a lengthy period in which they were not enslaved. Rabbi Eliezer Nachman of Foa argues that we counted from the birth of Isaac but that the prosecutor still held us as guilty of evading 190 years of actual slavery.</i> He was appeased with the promise that the years would be completed during Israel’s other exiles, as I have explained in the commentary on <i>Parshat Lech Lecha</i> in <i>Sefer Goren Arnon</i>. <br><b>(<i>Ho’eel</i>)</b> Just as gathering fruit before it is ripe causes it to spoil, so, too, Israel was warned during this exile not to force the end-time to come. To bring about redemption prematurely might cause things to happen to us during that exile; it might cause us to go back into exile. And so Israel was warned, as Scripture states, “I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem…do not wake or arouse love until it please!”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Song of Songs 2:7 It is not without significance that this commentary was published in 1641, shortly before Shabbatai Tzvi was pronounced the Messiah. There was a great deal of Messianic speculation during this period throughout the world among both Jews and Christians. No doubt the speculation at least influenced the rise of the infamous False Messiah.</i> It is better for us to joyfully wait for the fruit to ripen so that it can be gathered in its time and then the messianic era will be established for all time.
<b>(<i>V’afilu</i>)</b> “<b>Even if we are wise ... .it is a commandment to tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt:”</b> For this story is not like the stories of Roman wars or other wars which took place around the world. It is forbidden to incline one’s ear to listen to them since they are vain matters. It is a commandment to speak of the war which God waged against Egypt so that it will remain in one’s consciousness as a matter to contemplate. <br>When one thinks about the Exodus, one wonders, how is it possible that Pharaoh was so lacking in common sense that he rebelled against God and was so stubborn in his denial of God so many times? And how could God forgo His honor, sending Pharaoh the message, “Let My people go,” when he could have told Moses, “Gather the Jews who are in Egypt and take them out?” And if a person wished to show God’s power, there are many ways that he could have done so! Similar to these questions, a person could derive from these supernal matters and discussions that there are many new ideas to be derived. Also, one would see how Pharaoh in his wisdom could do these things as we shall explain, with the help of God. Pharoah should have concluded that God is faithful to His covenant and keeps His word. Pharaoh’s error was that he thought, ‘God already said to Abraham, “They shall be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years.” (He reasoned),’ It is impossible that they already began (this count) from the Covenant of the Pieces<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Torah, the <b>Covenant</b> of the Pieces or Covenant Between the Parts in Genesis, Chapter 15 was an event in which God revealed himself to Abraham and made a covenant with him. God announced to Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved in Egypt but would eventually inherit the Land of Israel.</i> <br>for thirty years would pass before the birth of Isaac.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">If I understand this correctly, the <i>Brit bein habetarim</i>, the Covenant of the Pieces was made thirty years before the birth of Isaac. Some people count the four hundred years from Isaac’s birth. However the Covenant predicts that the people would be enslaved and afflicted by another people for four hundred years - so the count could not be until the Israelites went down to Egypt with Jacob. That would mean that they were only in Egypt 215 years. Pharaoh erred in thinking that they had not completed the full four hundred years and so he was not obligated to free them.</i> The Covenant of the Pieces also had to refer to a time when they were enslaved and afflicted. Therefore, Pharaoh didn’t believe Moses and stubbornly refused to free Israel. Pharaoh said: ‘Joseph said to his brothers, “God sent me before you…”<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 45:7 God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance.</i> Your God sent you to be enslaved by me, and now you are coming to me and saying in the name of your God that I should send you forth? You haven’t completed the four hundred years of slavery, yet!’ <br><b>(<i>U’b’emet</i>)</b> Actually Pharaoh was correct (in his calculations) but the outcry of the people of Israel caused God to subvert the original judgment. There are other reasons which we shall mention. That is why we are obligated to tell the story of the Exodus. Even if one offers nothing new in telling the story, this should not prevent one from doing so because whenever one mentions God’s wonders it arouses God’s supernal power above and renews goodness. This is the implication of the expression, <i>kol hamarbeh lisaper</i>, instead of saying <i>kol hamoseef,</i> or <i>kol hamisaper bitziyat mitzrayim</i>, <sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kol hamarbeh lisaper -</i> one who speaks at length, as opposed to <i>kol hamoseef,</i> - one who adds, or, <i>kol hamisaper bitziyat mitzrayim</i> - one who tells the story of the Exodus from Egypt.</i> implying that even if his words seem excessive and repetitive, it should not prevent him from this effort. This is what the sages state in <i>Midrash Tehilim (Tilin</i>), Ps. 70 say: “(For the leader. Of David, <i>Lehazkir.</i> Hasten O Lord to save me!”<i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalm 70:1-2 The meaning of the word <i>Lihazkir</i> in this context is not clear.

And for every time you remember me, my heart yearns for you, as is stated in Scripture, “That is why My heart yearns for him.” (Jer. 31:20) He appointed Levites to minister before the Ark of<i> Adonai</i>, to invoke (to remember), to praise…” (I Chr. 16:4) What did they remember? It is a remembrance of the wonders that God performed for them at all times. God only redeemed me to save me so that I could recall His wonders. David said, ‘If so “I remember him, as it states, “For the leader Of David,<i> lehazkir</i>.’” Thus, they decreed remembering the Exodus each day; possibly God will have mercy on us and redeem us.” (Zech. 10:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> Psalm 70 which Foa quotes at length - however it appears that his version of the text is incorrect - I have based the translation on the original version of the text in MT. למנצח לדוד להזכיר. אלקים להצילני. זה שאמר הכתוב (זכריה י ט) ואזרעם בעמים. ובשכר שמזכירים אותי בכל פעם אני מזכיר אותם בכל זמן שאתם מזכירים אותי מעי הומים עליכם שנאמר (ירמיה לא יט) הבן יקיר לי אפרים וגו' המו מעי לו.

We arouse God’s compassion since, “In <i>Nissan</i> Israel was redeemed and in <i>Nissan</i> they will be redeemed. By adding to the memories of wonders it is as if we are adding to the power of God’s might (<i>koah gevurotav</i>) above. Thus, it is written in the <i>Zohar, Parshat Bo</i>, “Thus we have established: a people who speaks about the Exodus from Egypt, and rejoices in that story - in the future they will rejoice in the <i>Shechinah</i> in the world to come, which is the greatest joy of all. For they are like a person who rejoices in his/her Master, and the Holy One of Blessing rejoices in this story. At that time [when the story of the Exodus is told], the Holy One gathers together all of the heavenly hosts and says to them: "Go and listen to the telling of My praises, for right now my children are speaking and rejoicing in My salvation." Immediately, they all gather and unite themselves with the people of Israel, and listen to their story of praise. For when [Israel] rejoices in the joy of their Master's salvation, the [heavenly hosts] give thanks to the Holy One of blessing for all of these miracles and feats, and they give thanks to God for the holy nation that God has on the earth who rejoice in the joy of their Master's salvation. At that time, strength and power are increased on high; and in their telling of the story, Israel grants strength to their Master.`` <sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Zohar</i> Volume 2, Parshat Bo 42b Translation taken from Sefaria</i>

Story of the Five Rabbis



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

One might ask, since the actual exodus happened during the day, as Scripture states, “None of you shall go outside of his house until morning.” (Ex. 12:22) and, “For on that very day I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt,” (Ex. 12:17), why do we remember the Exodus at night? The sages sought a reason from the following verse, “‘It is because of what<i> Adonai</i> did for me when I went free from Egypt.” (Ex 13:8) Even though the <i>Haggadah</i> explains, “One only says this at the time when <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror</i> are before the person,” the main event was during the day.  <br>However, since the first part of the obligation is for a person to behave<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">This text follows the version of the <i>Haggadah</i> of the <i>Rambam</i> and used by most Sephardic Jews. In other texts it says “A person is obligated to see himself/herself <i>(lirot)</i> as if…” בְּכָל דּוֹר וָדוֹר חַיָּב אָדָם <b>לְהַרְאוֹת</b> <b>אֶת</b> <b>עַצְמוֹ</b> כְּאִלּוּ הוּא בְּעַצְמוֹ יָצָא עַתָּה מִשִּׁעְבּוּד מִצְרַיִם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר וְאוֹתָנוּ הוֹצִיא מִשָּׁם</i> as if one personally went forth from Egypt, this is best done in the evening when one eats the Passover sacrifice.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Even though they had not yet been liberated from Egypt on the night of the first Passover, they acted as if the liberation had already taken place.</i> Therefore it is an obligation to go on at length before the meal and afterwards recall the miracles that were performed. Or (one might explain), the remembrance of the suffering in Egypt should happen at night, as Scripture states, “Arise, cry out in the night at the beginning of the watches,” (Lam. 2:19) and it is also stated, “Bitterly she weeps in the night,” (Lam. 1:2). Since, “the sound of which could be heard from afar.” (Ezra 3:13) it is fitting to announce the redemption at night. The redemption from Egypt hints at the future redemption and “night” arouses compassion for our redemption, and that “Merit is brought about by means of one who is meritorious.”<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Baba Batra</i> 119b</i> One might also explain that since the people engaged in much singing, praise, and rejoicing in Egypt, on the night before the Exodus, as is written, “For you, there shall be singing, as on a night when a festival is hallowed,” (Is. 30:29) they offered supplications to God, that He might have compassion on them and not listen to the one who prosecuted them, asking permission to enter their homes to cause destruction. As Scripture says, “Nor let the Destroyer enter and smite your home.” (Ex. 12:23) From this we may conclude that the Destroyer had to ask permission to enter (their homes). So, too, we also behave as if we went forth from Egypt as our ancestors did, singing, praising, and speaking of God’s wonders in order to arouse God’s compassion so that the Holy One may again do with us as He did with our ancestors. <br>The sages say, “The days of your life,” refers to this world; “All the days of your life,” refers to the coming of the Messiah. The sages interpreted this verse as referring to the future with a <i>Gezera shawa,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Gezera shawa,</i> “equal category,” according to which an obscure passage might be illuminated by reference to another containing the same key term. (Britannica)</i> with the verse, “And dirt shall you eat/all the days of your life.” (Gen. 3:14) Everyone admits that this also refers to the messianic period, since Scripture also states, “The wolf and the lamb shall graze together/And the lion shall eat straw like the ox/And the serpent’s food shall be earth.” (Is. 65:25) “One may heal oneself with any substance except for it…”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">See Pesachim 25a, I am not certain what the connection here is to this passage to the Gezera shawa.</i>

Paragraph 1

Let us<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Foa begins this passage with the expression, <i>rayui ladaat</i>, literally,”It is fitting to know” - I have taken liberties in translating it to make it fit the context.</i> understand why the sages refer to God as <i>Makom.</i> If (the purpose of this expression is) to separate God from the finite, then calling God “Place of the world” still leaves us in doubt.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Makom suggests God has spatial limitations.</i> When we call God <i>Makom</i>, it implies that there is a place that is not God’s place. However, if we are speaking of the supernal light that is found at the beginning of existence, the first cause, we would not know what to call it, since it fills up everything. Before God created this world, the light that filled everything was so luminous that it was impossible to imagine the world (outside of it). God contracted Himself, so to speak,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kivaychol</i>, כִּבְיָכוֹל is the word used when speaking in metaphorical terms about divinity. So to speak - Don’t take these words literally.</i> in the way that He contracted Himself within the ark, leaving a place free outside of God’s essence. But since the light was still too great, God contracted a second time as Scripture states, “Let there be light…and there was light” (Gen. 1:3) “Let there be light” allowing the emanation of the <i>Sephirot<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><b>Sefirot</b> meaning <i>emanations</i>, are the 10 attributes/emanations in Kabbalah, through which Ein Sof (The Infinite) reveals itself and continuously creates both the physical realm and the chain of higher metaphysical realms (<i>Seder hishtalshelus</i>).

The first sparks of light of contraction led to emanation, creation and fashioning. In the second contraction, God created all that Moses our teacher knew as well as much more. The second contraction was a second removal of light from “the place of the first <i>Makom,</i> before the contraction. This is referred to in Scripture, ““See, there is a place near Me.” (Exodus 33:21) Since the light of God’s Presence is similar to it at first, and nothing in all of creation can speak of its praise, therefore, all the names, praises and blessings are referred to as the “Place.” And it is to this <i>Makom</i>, “Place,” that we are referring when we say <i>Baruch HaMakom</i>, “Praised is the Place.” <br>All the words of the sages are true and certain; they are meant to be understood literally, and not as metaphors or analogies. This is true in all places and one who understands them can find answers. The Exodus was a renewal of the world both in general and in particular, as both ancient and contemporary sages state, each according to the <i>Pardes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Pardes (פרד"ס) is a Kabbalistic theory of Biblical exegesis first advanced by Moses de León. The term, sometimes also rendered PaRDeS, is an acronym formed from the initials of the following four approaches: Peshat (פְּשָׁט‎) – "surface" ("straight") or the literal (direct) meaning. Remez (רֶמֶז‎) – "hints" or the deep allegorical meaning beyond just the literal sense. Derash (דְּרַשׁ‎) – from Hebrew <i>darash</i>: "inquire" ("seek") – the midrashic meaning, as given through similar occurrences. Sod (סוֹד‎) – "secret" ("mystery") or the esoteric/mystical meaning, as given through inspiration or revelation. Each type of <i>Pardes</i> interpretation examines the extended meaning of a text. As a general rule, the extended meaning never contradicts the base meaning. Pardes (exegesis) - Wikipedia</i> Therefore the <i>Maggid</i> uses the language in the <i>Haggadah</i> to give thanks and praise God as much as possible based on the kindness that God did for us and our ancestors. We bless God for giving the <i>Torah</i> to the people of Israel through which we are able to know the wondrous miracles God performed for our ancestors in Egypt, like the fifty plagues with which he smote the Egyptians, as we shall explain with God’s help.
<i><b>Kineged Arba’a Banim:</b></i>  The <i>Torah</i> speaks in general terms about four types of children. There is the wise one who explains the<i> Torah</i> properly. There is the wicked who reveals aspects of <i>Torah</i> that are not according to Jewish beliefs. Even if these hints are alluded to in the <i>Torah</i>, they are not pure and it is forbidden to reveal them as is written in <i>Zichron Avot</i>, Ch. 2. One is simple who adds nothing to what he has learned and believes whatever the sages said literally without seeking an explanation. And there is one who doesn’t know how to ask because he doesn’t understand the basics. Thus, in matters of the laws of Passover and in the <i>Torah</i> allusions are found to all four types of children who have been mentioned, each being satisfied with his method of understanding.

Paragraph 2

The wise one asks about every aspect of the <i>Torah</i> including: <i>eidut</i> (testimonies), <i>chukkim</i> (statutes), and <i>mishpatim</i> (ordinances),<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"> See Deut. 6:20 When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: ‘What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which<i> Adonai</i> our God hath commanded you?</i> because he seeks to understand all the Torah's content deeply. Even though the wicked one performs some commandments so he will be recognized as a Jew, he considers them bothersome and refers to the <i>Torah</i> as <i>avodah</i> (work) because in his eyes, it is burdensome. He calls the <i>Torah, avodut,</i> slavery. The simple person doesn’t distinguish between one matter and another (in the <i>Torah</i>) so he asks, “What is this?” That is, “What is<i> <b>Torah</b></i><b>,”</b> since the <i>Torah</i> is called<i> zot</i> (this), as in the verse, “This (v’<i>zot</i>) is the <i>Torah</i> that Moses set before the Israelites.” (Deut. 4:44) <br>The wise one’s question, “What is this testimony…” is not an expression of astonishment like the statement of the wicked person.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the statement of the wise one in Deuteronomy includes the word “questions” while the wicked one uses the word, “states.”</i> Rather he asks a valid question that deserves a fitting answer. As the <i>Zohar</i> states, “The difference between <i>mah</i> (What) and <i>mi</i> (Who) is that <i>mah</i> poses a question and not a statement.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">See Introduction to <i>Zohar,</i> Volume 1, 3:8. I have adapted this passage in the commentary so that it fits the statement in the <i>Zohar:</i> And there is another below, called WHAT [M"H]. What is between 'WHO' [M"I] and 'WHAT' [M"H]? The first one, which is called WHO, is concealed. It remains a question: Once man has searched and inquired in order to understand and climb from one level to another, and has finally reached the end level of all, he is asked: WHAT? WHAT have you learned? WHAT have you seen? WHAT have you investigated, since everything is still concealed, just as it was before?</i> The question of the wise child is, “What is the nature of the testimonies, statutes and ordinances?” Do we observe the testimonies, statues, and judgments because they serve some useful purpose or simply because they were commanded by God? This is especially the case with regard to judgments (<i>mishpatim</i>) since it is not necessary to command their observance as they can be derived through reason.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Thou shall not kill is a mishpat. We might arrive at this law without divine commandment because it makes sense.</i> It is not necessary to declare him guilty because he said, “which<i> Adonai</i> our God commanded you,<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">When the wise child says “commanded you,” he sounds uncomfortably close to the wicked child who says, “Which God commanded you.”</i>” It was not necessary to say <i>otanu</i>, “us,” (“Which Adonai our God commanded <b>us</b>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 6:20 But the verse says “Which the Lord our God commanded you.” The LXX, and some rabbinic statements use the word <i>otanu,</i> us.</i> When the wise one said, “<i>Adonai</i> our God commanded” he shows that he has accepted God’s sovereignty and deserves to be judged favorably. Also he did so because he did not expect merit for himself. Also when he said “Adonai<i> our</i> God,” he showed that he had not removed himself from the community of Israel. <br>By saying,<i> etchem</i>, “You” (“the Lord your God commanded <i>you</i>,”) the<i> Torah</i> is more exacting in its language. The wise child wonders, why not be more explicit in mentioning <i>etchem</i> for the <i>hukkim</i>, statutes (since one could not derive these laws on his own) when a righteous person could derive the testimonies and judgements on his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, the chukkim needed the expression “GOd commanded you,” But the other two categories of commandments did not since they could be derived on their own through human reason. So why does the Torah say, “Statutes, testimonies and judgments which the Lord our God commanded you. “ It would have made more sense to simply say, “The statutes which the Lord our God commanded you..”</i> Therefore the Torah states, “Adonai our God commanded you,” for the “testimonies, <i>statutes</i> and ordinances”<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Italics are mine</i>.</i> (to teach us that God commanded all of them. The wise child’s question, then, is, ‘why is it necessary to mention <i>etchem</i> for all these various laws in the Torah?’ <br>That is why the <i>Torah</i> says <i>machar</i> (for the wise and simple children) as it states, “When, in time to come (<i>machar</i>), your children ask you…” (Deut. 6:20) This is also the case with regard to the simple child’s question: “And when, in time to come (<i>machar</i>), your child asks you…” (Ex. 13:14) They are saying, “Would that in the time to come (<i>machar</i>) there will be a sign so that your child asks, “What is this?”<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that both the wise and the simple child include the word <i>machar</i> in their question, suggests that we hope for a time when the simple child will ask insightful questions like the wise child.</i> But the word <i>machar</i> is not included for the wicked child<i>,</i> suggesting that we are saying, “Would that he never ask such questions and such matters never be expressed by him!”
<b>“One should tell him the laws of Passover, (including), ‘one should not eat anything after the Passover sacrifice.’”</b> Eating the Passover offering with gusto is not permitted. This is God’s commandment, expressing two opposite ways: first, even if one is hungry after eating the Passover offering, it is forbidden to eat more of it since the offering is not meant to satisfy one’s hunger. Secondly, eating it when one is hungry would be considered to be excessive eating (<i>acheelah gasa</i>). One is not supposed to eat enough (of the Passover sacrifice) to satisfy oneself. It is enough to eat an olive-worth of the offering. Just as one cannot go back to eating of the Passover offering, so too, one should not be troubled by what is written in the<i> Torah</i> regarding the different commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">(uncertain meaning) Possibly the idea is that there is no explanation for the statutes so don’t be troubled if you can not explain them - any more than you explain why you cannot go back and eat after the Passover offering even though you only had an olives-worth of it,</i> <br>Similarly, if one studies the laws of the Passover sacrifice, one can find a correct explanation. The Passover offering follows the festive offering and one is supposed to satisfy himself with festive offering and all types of other desired goodies (during the festive meal). Only then one eats an olive-worth of the Passover offering. This is a reminder that one should not cling to or busy oneself only with worldly matters. The Passover offering reminds us that one’s fear of Egypt is small and minor. He should have the Passover offering only after he has satisfied himself with the holy offerings. If he were to eat other delicacies after the Passover offering, it would be as if he had not satisfied himself with what is most essential. The same may be said of the statutes and judgments. If the testimonies and ordinances did not appear in the <i>Torah,</i> and the righteous person thought he could derive them on his/her own, there would be no completeness like that of the Divine’s wholeness unless we consider them as part of God’s commandments. If not, we might add to or subtract them as we saw fit, according to the times and to the customs of the nations. Thus, we observe them according to God’s will and not personal desire. That is why the<i> Maggid</i> is so exacting in his language and says, “You shall instruct him in the all laws of Passover…” For these (<i>chukkim</i>) and these <i>(eidut</i> and <i>mishpatim</i>) are similar in their divine nature.

Paragraph 3

The wicked one tries to deceive the one who is being asked by quoting Scripture, “You shall observe this rite.” (Ex. 12:25) But his true intentions are revealed in that he never allows the name of God to pass his lips, He chooses this verse from a number of verses to show that he doesn’t really include himself in the community (of believers) of the holy people and that he considers the commandments to be bondage, like one who forcibly performs them and does not perform them of his own will. He also reveals an aspect of the <i>Torah</i> that is not according to Jewish belief. God’s intention is not what the wicked one thinks, that God troubles people by giving them the commandments. Rather God bestows merit on them by allowing them to perform the <i>mitzvot</i> willingly. Therefore, you should blunt his teeth and separate him from Israel by saying to him, “It is because of this.” That is, it is because of what you have quoted, (equating) <i>Torah</i> and <i>avodah,</i> that God has shown me kindness and has taken me out of Egypt, as is stated, “And when you have freed the people from Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain.” (Ex. 3:12) If the wicked one had been in Egypt he would not have been redeemed because he did not desire the<i> Torah</i>. He would have died during the plague of darkness just like the other wicked Israelites died. <br>Even though the answer in the <i>Haggadah</i> is not the one that appears to the wicked child's question in the <i>Torah,</i> the <i>Maggid</i> derived its answer from what is written there, “You shall say, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to <i>Adonai</i>, because He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but saved our houses.’” (Ex. 12:27) Since the verse does not say, “But saved us,” but, “saved our house,” what new understanding does it add? This means those households into which the Divine Presence could enter. This is related to what we have written concerning the statement of Rabban Gamliel, above. Since the appearance of the Divine Presence saved us and brought about redemption, if this wicked one had been there, God would not have entered his house and as a result the wicked one would have died and would not have been redeemed. This would have extended beyond the three days of darkness.

Paragraph 4

The <i>tam,</i> as we have said, is one who believes the words of the sages literally and does not have the intellectual capacity to understand the reason for things in their full depth. (The Maggid suggests that we should) make a brief but true statement to this person and not speak disrespectfully to him. For this is the way of <i>Torah</i>: a person begins as a <i>tam</i>, seeking to know the reasons for things. One begins with a weak intellect, particularly with regard for the reasons for <i>Torah.</i> If he allows it to arise in his mind, it will be like all matters of wisdom and he will begin to understand things that are not simple. From them, he will come to learn the whole<i> Torah.</i> In the beginning he will believe in a simple minded way all the teachings of the sages according to their plain sense and with innocence. As a result he will be called a <i>Yirei Khayt,</i> one who fears sin, because he is afraid of transgressing the words of the sages. He will certainly become wiser and with time his wisdom will increase because his fear of sin preceded his wisdom. As a result of studying <i> Torah</i> for its own sake, secrets of <i>Torah</i> will be revealed to him. That is why Jacob is first called an <i>eesh tam,</i> a simple man.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">How lovely. Eesh Tam is not meant to be a compliment but an expression of Jacob’s intellectual attainment. He began as a simple person and with time he came to have a deeper understanding of God’s teachings.</i>

Paragraph 5

When you see someone who doesn’t know how to learn by himself but tends to backslide, you must open an approach to <i>Torah</i> for him. Say to him, ‘How can we be obligated to know the wonders which God performed for us and our ancestors?’ This is (the meaning of), “You shall tell:” words of <i>Haggadah</i> are meant to “draw the heart closer.” <sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"> A common interpretation of the word<i> Vayaged</i> is that it means to draw the heart closer - see Maarechet Heidenheim on the four sons where this interpretation also appears: “The word v'heegadita, "You shall tell," implies that one should tell the story in a way that draws his heart closer. This means one should answer him with soft words and tell him all that the Torah teaches. The Torah doubles the force of the language by saying v'heegadita…laimor, "You shall tell…saying: the first word implies drawing the child's heart closer to the Torah and the second implies in a soft manner.” This is however a later source but it is a common idea - that va’yaged means to draw the heart closer.</i>
<i><b>Yachol meirosh chodesh:</b></i><b> “One might think this was from the beginning of <i>Nisan</i>:''</b> Explain this passage in the following way: One might think that one is only obligated to teach the person when he first becomes a backslider and has not yet become mired in impurity. But after he becomes impure in his ways, one need not relate to him. Therefore, the <i>Torah</i> states, <b>“On that day.” (Ex. 13:8)</b> that is, when you see him; even if he has been following an evil path for years, one should not avoid him. “If one says “on that day,” one might think it means <b>“while it is still day;”</b> that is, when one has time to teach him. This is because then he would have time to instruct him in the proper way and to convince him to leave his former way. But if one is only able to rebuke him one is not obligated. Therefore the verse teaches, <i><b>baavur zeh</b></i><b>, “Because of this: only when <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror</i> are before him.</b> That is, When you see him leave the right path, you should still have hope that your words might serve some purpose. This is (the meaning of) <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror. Matzah</i> alludes to the right way and the good inclination and <i>maror</i> alludes to the evil way, the evil inclination. If he is entirely wicked, however, “Do not be vexed by evil people,” (Ps. 37:1) just as it is a commandment to speak to someone who will listen, so one should remain silent if the person won’t listen. If you do not know that he is definitely wicked, one should try to bring him close (to <i>Torah</i>). As it is said, “Love your fellow and bring them close to <i>Torah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Avot</i> 1:12</i>

In the Beginning Our Fathers Were Idol Worshipers



Paragraph 1

The <i>Maggid</i> begins by telling the story (of the Exodus) with the disgrace that our forefathers experienced, as the sages stated: “One begins with the Jewish people’s disgrace and concludes with their glory.”<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Pesachim</i> 10:4</i> We shall explain this. It would have been better if we began with the disgrace of Israel; why do we begin with the disgrace of the forefathers, and even more so, the disgrace of Terach (who worshipped idols). Didn’t he repent before his death?<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">According to the sages, Terach, father of Abraham, was not only an idolator most of his life but also ran an idol boutique. However in his latter years he came to understand the error of his ways and became a believer in God.</i> It doesn’t seem right to mention his wickedness.  <br>However, one might argue that since Terach committed many sins before the end of his life but died having performed repentance, it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to mention his disgrace. Telling his story lightens his guilt and brings atonement. This is what the sages stated: “The first report of the incident of the Golden Calf, (Ex. 32:1–20), is read and translated, but the second reported, (Aaron’s report to Moses of what had taken place Ex. 32:21–24) is read but not translated.” <sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BT Megillah</i> 25a Even though we recall the sin of the Golden Calf, by doing so we bring atonement to the sinner.</i> We do not worry about the sinners of Israel since they are received in atonement. <br>Similarly, we are taught, “Three kings and four commoners in the Bible have no share in the World-to-Come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Sanhedrin</i> 10:2 “The three kings are: Jeroboam, son of Nebat, Ahab, both kings of Israel, and Manasseh, king of Judea. Rabbi Yehuda says: Manasseh has a share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And he prayed to Him, and He received his entreaty, and heard his supplication and brought him back to Jerusalem unto his kingdom” (II Ch. 33:13). The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: He regretted his actions, and his repentance was effective to the extent that God restored him to his kingdom, but did not restore his portion in life in the World-to-Come. The four commoners are: Balaam, son of Beor; Doeg the Edomite; Ahithophel; and Gehazi.<b>”</b></i> One should not think that Menasheh did not receive a portion in the world to come! I would like to have the merit that Menasheh, King of Judah, had, since during the final days of his life were spent in complete repentance. Rather this is included in the <i>Mishnah</i> since it served as atonement. When we recall his actions, his words speak from the grave. So, too, when one's actions are recalled in disgrace, the dead hear it and are distressed and they ask for atonement for their sins.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b - “How does he honor him in his death? If he says a matter he heard from his father’s mouth, he should not say: So said Father. Rather, he should say: So said Father, my teacher, may I be an atonement for his resting soul. And this <i>halakha</i> applies within twelve months of his death. From this time onward he says: May his memory be for a blessing, for the life of the World-to-Come.” And Yevamot 97a.</i> Similarly, we learn, “When Rabbi Ashi concluded his lecture by saying, ‘Tomorrow we will begin our lecture with our colleague, Menasheh,” Menashe appeared to him in a dream and said, ‘How can you call me “colleague”’ <sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 102b Manasseh said to him angrily: You called me your colleague and the colleagues of your father? How dare you characterize yourself as our equal? This suggests that Rabbi Ashi did not merit to call even Menashe, his colleague.</i> So, too, here, we recall the sins of Terach so that it would be an atonement for him. <br>And if the sages stated that we should not speak (poorly) about the dead, it means when we are speaking about those who did not cause others to sin. If, however, they not only sinned but caused others to sin as well, it is permissible to speak disparagingly about them with this intention, even if they repented. Or the sages meant that we should not mention the wicked in the world in which they are found because we don’t punish them for the sins they committed if they have repented.  <br>(<i><b>V’hanakhon</b></i>) It is also correct to say that this statement brought here to teach, “One appoints a leader over the community only if he has a box full of creeping animals hanging behind him,” Why is that? It is so that if he exhibits a haughty attitude toward the community, one can say to him: Turn and look behind you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Yoma</i> 22b, i.e., he has something inappropriate in his ancestry that preceded him. The story of the Exodus reminds us to remain humble…</i> <br>God chose Israel from among all the nations so they would follow His path and do so in the future when the redeemer comes, as is stated, “And nations shall walk by your light…” (Is. 60:3) and it is also written, ““Come, let us go up to the Mount of <i>Adonai</i>, to the House of the God of Jacob; that He may instruct us in His ways, and that we may walk in His paths.” (Is. 2:3) This was also God’s will when the Israelites left Egypt. That is why God commanded them to set up several large stones on the other side of the Jordan and to write the<i> Torah</i> clearly on them in seventy languages. (Deut. 27:8 See <i>Rashi</i>) This was so the nations would see that the ordinances and teachings of <i>Torah</i> are true. Then they will say, “Israel’s teachings <i>(Torah)</i> is truly the teachings (<i>Torah</i>) of God and then they will come to Israel so that they can learn the ways of God and they will come to fear them in the way that students should show reverence to their teacher. But since there was concern that Israel might become arrogant when they saw their superiority, and that God brought them close in a way that He did not do so with the other nations, therefore they were instructed to first say, “At first our ancestors worshipped idols…” That is, “Look behind you and see where you have come from…” <br>It is also possible to explain, “At first our ancestors worshipped idols…” as follows: when Israel left Egypt they were raised above the other nations. Israel’s ascent was their inheritance even though they were feeble. In order to keep them from becoming haughty, they were told to look back (at the past) from whence they came; at Terach, the father of Abraham. God will desire us because we humble ourselves. <br>The correct understanding of this passage is to begin by explaining that the descent to Egypt was meant to purify them of the idolatry assciated with Adam, the first human being and not about purifying the other transgressions and sins in the Garden of Eden. They were all included in the sin of idolatry. As the sages state, “Anyone who worships idolatry denies the <i>Torah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Lekach Tov Deuteronomy 11:28</i> However, the passage continues, “And now He has brought us close…” because when we went out of Egypt, God brought us to the service of the divine. <br><i><b>(Akh)</b></i> It has been said that when the Israelites left Egypt, the Omnipresent (<i>HaMakom</i>) brought them closer and closer to God’s service so that they cleaved to the Holy One, as is explained later, in the passage, <i>Al achat kama v’kama</i>, “How much do we owe thanks to God…”<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The passage after <i>dayyenu.</i></i> Sin caused them to lose their ability to cleave to God, when they said to Moses, ““You speak to us and we will obey; but let not God speak to us, lest we die,”<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">The last half of this verse does not appear in the commentary but is necessary to understand its implication.</i> (Ex. 20:16) causing the evil inclination returned to its place,<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">The people experience <i>Devekut</i>, pure cleaving to God, at Mount Sinai. But when they turned to Moses and told him to act as an intermediary, they destroyed the moment of <i>Devekut</i>, cleaving, and this allowed the evil inclination to re enter their lives.</i> so that only they “come near” (<i>keiruv</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">But not cleave to God.</i> In order to sense what was lost, and improve their actions so that we would return the crown to its former glory through cleaving to God, we say, “And now the Omnipresent has drawn us near.” This was meant to exclude the time when we could cleave to God, as is stated, “while you, who held fast (<i>hadevekim</i>) to <i>Adonai</i> your God, are all alive today.” (Deut. 4:4) Even though this was stated after the evil inclination had returned, even so the Israelites had the ability to improve so that they would eventually cleave to God again. This was taught to them when they were commanded regarding the making of the flags.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Midrash Bemidbar Rabbah</i> 2:3</i> It is known that it is an allusion to the four camps of the Divine Presence. At first one might think that when sin occurred, Israel lost its ability to cleave to God and all that remained was the ability to come close. Therefore we say, "And now we come close…” Therefore Moses prayed and said, “Oh, let him give me kisses of His mouth,-For your love is more delightful than wine.” (Song 1:2) <br>

Paragraph 2

“.... And I gave Isaac, Jacob and Esau.” (Josh. 24:2-4) This verse is quoted here since the <i>Maggid</i> wanted to say afterwards, “Blessed is the one who keeps His promise…” If Israel complained, “Where is God’s promise which he made to our father, Abraham, in the Covenant of the Pieces that he would give them the land in which they were dwelling? Why did Esau inherit Mount Seir and they are still dwelling in their inheritance while Israel is in exile from their land. Therefore, the <i>Maggid</i> comfort Israel and says, “Blessed is the one who keeps his promise…”<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">At first glance this comment appears to be backwards. The quote from Joshua, according to Rabbi Foa, is offered as an excuse to comfort Israel with the words, “Blessed is the one who keeps his promise.” The first of the verses from Joshua 24:2-4 appear to have been fulfilled by God - the last part has not been fulfilled - the <i>Maggid</i> reassures us by telling us that God keeps his promise and this too will be fulfilled. The verse then is a set up for us to say that even if it doesn’t appear to be so, God keeps God’s promises.</i>

Paragraph 3

It would have been more appropriate to say, “Blessed is the One <b>who kept</b> His promises….” if we are speaking of the Exodus. Also our text states, <b>מְחַשֵּׁ֥ב</b>, “The Holy One calculates the end, to do…” It should have stated, <b>חִשֵּׁב</b> “Who calculated.”<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Note that many Sephardic and Ashkenazic texts actually do have <b>חִשֵּׁב</b> <i>Hishev,</i> calculated, while Rabbi Foa’s text says <i>Michashev, “</i>calculates.” Many of the variations in the manuscripts of the <i>Haggadah</i> text have, <b>מְחַשֵּׁ֥ב</b>. He now asks why the text doesn’t say <b>חִשֵּׁב</b> “calculated” instead of <b>מְחַשֵּׁ֥ב</b> “calculates.”</i> But the intention of the <i>Maggid</i> is to make known to us what God is doing for us. God continues “To keep” the promise that was made to Abraham (and is still calculating the endtime). <br>The word <i>shomer</i>, is similar to the language in the verse, “And his father kept ( שָׁמַ֥ר ) the matter in mind.”<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">That is, Jacob kept the matter private regarding Joseph’s dreams… Similarly in our verse God kept the promise of four hundred years of slavery private but never forgot his promise to Abraham’s descendents.</i> (Gen. 37:11) That is, God hid and kept the promise in mind until they had completed the four hundred years that God told Abraham his descendents would be enslaved and afflicted (before being redeemed.) Since they were only enslaved in Egypt for two hundred and ten years, there remained another hundred and ninety years for our people to complete the exile. If Israel had not continued to sin the exile would not have continued more than one hundred and ninety more years. But since they had to atone for the sins and guilt that they committed day after day, causing troubles and afflictions to overcome them constantly. As a result, they only deducted a small number of the extra years after the golden calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Sanhedrin 102a - “Rabbi Yitzḥak says: You have no punishment that comes to the world in which there is not one twenty-fourth of the surplus of a <i>litra</i> of the first calf. When weighing a substance, there would often be a disparity of up to one twenty-fourth of its weight. as it is stated: “On the day when I punish, I will punish their sin upon them” (Ex. 32:34), indicating that atonement for that sin is incomplete, and the Jewish people will continue to suffer for it. “ (Sefaria) The idea here is because of all their sins - they only remove a small amount of their guilt for worshiping the Golden Calf with each act. Thus the 190 years get added on to their other transgressions drawing out their punishment. When the 190 years are complete, redemption will come.</i> When they complete the 190 years, the redeemer will come and redeem them. That is why we calculate the redemption/end time based on the 190 years - the <i>Ketz.</i> If Israel had been meritorious (and not sinned) then redemption would have hastened and their suffering would have taken place in the count of 190 years. It is to this that <i>Maggid</i> refers when it states, “Blessed is the one who keeps His promise.” The <i>Maggid</i> states that God calculates the end and it does not say that God calculated the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">With each sin and transgression God has to recalculate the end time…..</i> God constantly calculates all of the oppressions that will come upon us during this exile, and how much will be added to the reckoning of 190 years in order to fulfill what God said to Abraham at the Covenant of the Pieces. Was not the purpose of the Covenant of the Pieces to judge the nations that afflicted Us, as it states, “But I will execute judgment on the nation they shall serve…” (Gen. 15:14) This means not only those nations that afflicted us by taking our wealth and our lives will be judged for such judgment would not purify Israel. Rather, “the nation that they served” is Egypt. It would appear that this was not meant to be seen as a punishment of the Egyptians since God had decreed that Israel would be enslaved. Rather God decreed that they should be judged for the abominations they committed, how they committed evil acts, and Egypt’s stubborness in not listening to God.

Paragraph 4



Paragraph 5

“<b>It is that which has sustained us</b>…” This is the promise which the Holy One made to Abraham, that God would sustain our ancestors until the completion of the four hundred years. If God had abandoned Israel, they would not have been able to go forth as was said. 
“<b>And us</b>” also; God’s eye is constantly on us to protect us from those who rise up against us to make us impure and to take us out from their service. We have constantly seen that the Holy One saves us from their hands

Paragraph 2

An Aramean tried to destroy my father; he went down to Egypt, and he resided there with a small number and there he became a nation, great, powerful, and numerous.(Deuteronomy 26:5) <br><i>Tzei U’lemad</i>: “Go out and see…” that what I have just said is true! In every generation there were those who sought to wipe us out. “The deeds of our ancestors are a sign to their children.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">See<i> Ramban</i> on Genesis 12:6</i> Laban was the father of Rachel and Leah, and their children were like Laban’s children. If someone had risen up to harm them, Laban should have risen up against such a person to save his grandchildren. And yet, just the opposite was the case; Laban sought to destroy them. How much more so would this be the case with the rest of the nations who had no relation with Israel? They intended to destroy Israel, had not the Holy One saved Israel from their hands. <br>Further, the matter of Laban is mentioned here so that we will not be afraid of anyone who rises against us. For the actions of our ancestors are a sign to their children. Just as Laban was unable to harm Jacob and wipe out his children, as he planned, so it is a sign that the Holy One will save us from anyone who rises up against us.

Paragraph 3

<b>וַיֵּ֣רֶד מִצְרַ֔יְמָה<i> Vayered Mitzrayma</i>: “He went down to Egypt.”</b> This comes to teach us that when Jacob said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.” (Gen. 45:28) it was his intention to go down to Egypt but to stop at the border. He thought that Joseph would come up and meet him there. Once Jacob saw Joseph, he would return to the land of Canaan. Immediately after the <i>Torah</i> states, “I will go and see him,” it states, “So Israel set out with all that was his…” (Gen. 46:10), meaning he took what he needed for the trip. It didn’t occur to him to take his herds, flocks, and his possessions, as it said afterwards. “That night God appeared to Jacob and said, “Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt…” (Gen. 46:3 ) Thus, the statement, “Compelled by the word of God….” teaches us that he was then told that he must go down to Egypt. Only then does it state, “and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:” (Gen. 46:6)
<b>וַיָּ֥גׇר שָׁ֖ם<i> Va’yagar sham</i>: And he sojourned there:</b> “This teaches us that our ancestor Jacob did not intend to settle in Egypt.” This verse teaches us that from the moment that Jacob went down to Egypt and while he was there, even though he lacked for nothing and had a comfortable life because Joseph supported him and his children ministered to him, even so he acted as one who planned to live there temporarily. He constantly expected the Holy One to tell him to return to the land of his ancestors, as God said, “I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will bring you back,” (Gen. 46:4) Jacob was convinced that this would happen in his lifetime. That is why it states, “And he sojourned (<i>Va’yagar</i>) there.” Though he said to Pharaoh, “Pray, then, let your servants stay in Goshen,” he did so that it appears that he planned to stay in Egypt permanently, he only came because of the famine. However, when they (the brothers) found it so good, they decided to remain permanently in Goshen. If this had not been the case they would have returned to their land as soon as the famine ended. This verse comes to teach us that originally, “They came to sojourn,” there and that they did not go down to Egypt to settle there. <br>This teaches us that we should not make our dwellings in exile permanently by purchasing homes, fields and vineyards. Rather one should live like temporary residents in the land and will one day return to our land. One who does so will be called, “One who expects redemption,” as we are obligated to be.

Paragraph 4

<b>בִּמְתֵי מְעָט <i>B’matei mi’at</i>: “Few in number”</b> (Deut. 26:5) If it were not for the words of the <i>Maggid</i>, I might have thought that the end of the verse, “...and now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky," (Deut. 10:22) is the proof text for what is stated (next), “and he became a great nation there.” (Deut. 26:5) But since the <i>Maggid</i> quotes the entire verse here when explaining, “Few in number,” it must be because one might not understand, “Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons in all,” to mean, “Few in number.” After all, the head of a household who has seventy children and grandchildren would not call such a family, “Few in number!” Therefore the proof (that seventy) is few in numbers is what is stated in the second part of the prooftext, “The Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky," (Deut. 10:22) The Maggid’s intention was to add something else regarding, "And he became there a nation," (Deut.26:5) -”this teaches that Israel became distinguishable there, great, mighty. This means that they became a strong,mighty, and healthy nation. When the Egyptians saw how great their strength was, they were startled and hinted with their hands to one another, “Look how great their strength is!” <i>Metzuyanim</i> מְצֻיָּנִים means, “They pointed out.”

Paragraph 6

<b>וָרָב. כְּמוֹ שֶּׁנֶּאֱמַר, רְבָבָ֗ה "And numerous" (Deut. 26:5) - as it is stated, "I have given you to be numerous <i>(rivava)</i>…” (Ez. 16:7)</b> The word, <i>rivava</i>, רְבָבָה, does not mean thousands or tens of thousands.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 33:17, Num. 10:36, and Micah 6:7. See BT Sota 11b. Foa is saying that the word רְבָבָה is not used here as a numerical term but as botany metaphor</i> Rather, the <i>Maggid</i> wants to explain what the sages stated; that the women would go out and give birth in the fields. The babies were then swallowed up by the earth and when they were older they would spring forth like the foliage of the land. Also they quickly grew in stature like plants so that a year old child was like a twenty year old. This is what is stated regarding the verse, “And made you walk erect,” (Lev. 26:13) - “With erect stature.”<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi and Sifra on the verse Leviticus 26:13</i> This is also what is meant by the verse, “and you continued (<i>rebui</i>) to grow up…” (Ez. 16:7) The increase (<i>rebui</i>) is not numerical, as has already been said, but rather an increase in the size and erectness of the person.

Paragraph 7

<b>וַיָּרֵ֧עוּ אֹתָ֛נוּ הַמִּצְרִ֖ים וַיְעַנּ֑וּנוּ וַיִּתְּנ֥וּ עָלֵ֖ינוּ עֲבֹדָ֥ה קָשָֽׁה׃ The Egyptians dealt harshly with us and oppressed us; they imposed heavy labor upon us. (Deuteronomy 26:6) וַיָּרֵ֧עוּ אֹתָ֛נוּ הַמִּצְרִ֖ים<i> Vayarei’u otanu:</i> “The Egyptians dealt harshly with us…”</b> (Deut 26:6) <br>One might ask, after stating, “The Egyptians dealt harshly with us,” along with all the other verses describing (Israel’s oppression), why was it necessary to bring a verse from the <i>Torah</i> (to explain Deut. 26) that does not seem to offer any additional information? What do we learn from one verse about the other? <br>However, one might say that since the verses<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Deuteronomy 26:5-8</i> (in the <i>Haggadah</i>) are from Deuteronomy, one might claim that Moses said this of his own volition. Because he was grateful for all the kindness that God did for him, he exaggerated. Therefore, we bring a proof for each and every detail (in Deuteronomy 26) to show that it is exactly as it happened. Everything in Deuteronomy only adds to what is not stated in the other books of the <i>Torah</i>, as has been said regarding the commandments. All of the commandments taught in Deuteronomy are meant to add something (that has already been taught in the other books of the <i>Torah</i>). We will explain this later. <br>(<i><b>Atta</b></i>) Now, <i>Maggid</i> informs us of the bodily and physical injuries the Egyptians inflicted on us. It does this so that no one should ask why God smote the Egyptians with all of the plagues that have been mentioned. That is why Scripture states וַיָּרֵעוּ אֹתָנוּ "And the Egyptians dealt harshly with to us" (Deut. 26:6) and not וַיָּרֵ֥עוּ לָ֛נוּ “The Egyptians ill-treated us,” as is written elsewhere, וַיָּרֵ֥עוּ לָ֛נוּ מִצְרַ֖יִם וְלַאֲבֹתֵֽינוּ “Egypt ill-treated us and our fathers” (Num. 20:15)<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">There isn’t a good way to translate these two expressions so they are different from one another. Both include the word <i>vayarei’u</i>, one includes <i>lanu</i> and the other <i>otanu. Vayerei’u otanu</i> might be translated as, they made us evil, while <i>vayerei’u lanu</i> would be they dealt harshly or harmed us.</i>  <br>It intends to tell us that the Egyptians made the Israelites look guilty before Heaven. They did this by keeping them from studying <i>Torah</i> and performing commandments, as the <i>Midrash</i> states when it gives the reason for each plague. The sages said that the Egyptians did not deal harshly with the Israelites in order to injure their bodies or possessions. Rather they did so because God is holy and those who serve God are holy. However when one sanctifies oneself the divine presence rests within them, while one who makes oneself impure one is distanced from God. <br>Therefore, the heavenly prince who was appointed over Egypt put the idea in the minds of the Egyptians to make Israel perform acts that would make the Israelites impure. It was as if he said to them, if Israel is not holy, God will reject them. He tried to remove from them the things that sanctified them so that they would be removed from their domain (of holiness). The first effort was to prohibit them from studying<i> Torah</i>. Jacob had established a house of study in Goshen, as the sages said regarding the verse, “He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to point the way <i>(lihorot)</i> before him to Goshen.”<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on the verse: BEFORE HIM — means before he should arrive there. A Midrashic comment is: להורת לפניו (in the sense of, “that there might be teaching before him”) — to establish for him a House of Study from which Teaching (הוראה or תורה) might go forth (GR 95:3).</i> (Gen. 46:28) And so the Egyptians decreed against the study of <i>Torah</i>. This is what the sages said, for their stratagems, they decided to punish them with water. Water is none other than <i>Torah</i> - that is why they were judged with water (at the Reed Sea). The Egyptians also tried to abrogate their daily recitation of the <i>Sh’ma</i> and the <i>Amida</i>; and so they smote them with the plague of frogs, as is stated in the <i>Zohar. Va’era</i> page 30a: This is the way of Israel: “At midnight, those who desire to remember the Holy One of blessing, do not allow their hearts to be restful. They rise up from bed to make mention of the Holy One. When the sun rises they go early to the synagogue and praise the Holy One. Similarly after noon, the time of Minchah. And when it becomes dark and the darkness clings to the night, when the sun has set. Regarding them, it is written, “By day or by night, O you, Adonai’s remembrancers, take no rest. This is the way of the people of Israel. Therefore, the Holy One remembered them in Egypt and sent those who did not subside neither day nor night against Pharaoh. Who are they? The frogs whose voices never subside! For Pharaoh seized hold of the Holy people who never stopped praising the Holy One…” Because he kept them from reciting the <i>Shema</i> evening and morning, and similarly kept them from the other commandments, therefore, “He treated them harshly/ he made them bad.”<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">See full translation of this passage with variations in Daniel Matt’s translation of the Zohar, Volume 4, Pages 121-122, Volume 2, 30a</i> <br>

Paragraph 8

<b>וַיְעַנּ֑וּנוּ<i> Va’yanunu</i></b><i>:</i><b>“And oppressed us.”</b> One should know that the actions of Pharaoh and the Egyptians were planned with great shrewdness. God’s words to Abraham in the Covenant of the Pieces were not ignored , “And they shall be enslaved and oppressed.” (Gen. 15:13) Therefore they began to fulfill God’s word by placing heavy taxes and tributes upon them so that they would become impoverished. The possessions of the entire nation were reduced, similar to what the sages stated, “Like a lily among thorns…” (Song 2:2) “Just as a lily, when it is situated among the thorns, a north wind blows and tilts it and the thorn pierces it, a south wind blows and tilts it and a thorn pierces it, a west wind blows and tilts it and a thorn pierces it, and so with the four directions…”<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 23:4 and Song of Songs 2:2 for two variations on this <i>Midrash.</i> It strikes me, that Rabbi Foa was quoting these texts from memory both here and elsewhere in the commentary and so he changes the actual version of the <i>Midras</i>h</i> So, it was with the people of Israel; they made their homes subjugated among the nations. These ones said to them, “Give us taxes (פִּיסִּים)!”<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">[<i>distributions</i>, cmp. Lat. tributum,] <i>taxes</i>, esp. <i>pissim, pissin</i>, name of a <i>Roman tax</i> laid on the community and distributed by the latter according to assessments, Jastrow.</i> and these ones said to them, “Give us your appointed service (זימון)!” and these ones said to them, “Give us your tribute!” and these ones said, “Give us your head tax.” (גִּלְגּוּלֵ). Thus, they were like a lily among the thorns. Similarly, when they rented them houses they charged them ten times the amount compared to what they would charge gentiles. They did the same with anything they sold them. <br><b>(<i>Akh</i>)</b> “They neither know nor understand, they go about in darkness,” (Ps. 82:5) God said, first, “They shall enslave them,” and afterwards, “They shall oppress them.” (Gen. 15:13) (Because they did it the other way around - first oppressing and then enslaving) the Egyptians never succeeded. They did just the opposite.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of enslaving and oppressing the Israelites as is stated in Genesis 15:13, first Egyptians oppressed them and then they enslaved them.</i> The more they oppressed them, “the more the Israelites increased and spread out.” In other words the more they oppressed Israel the more the Egyptians enriched the Israelites.” The word <i>yifrotz</i> <b>יִפְרֹ֑ץ</b> comes from the verse, “the man grew exceedingly prosperous <b>פְרֹ֥ץ הָאִ֖ישׁ</b>,” (Gen. 30:43) which is said about Jacob. The Egyptians then saw that their decrees did not have an effect and their actions turned against Egypt. The wealth that they took from the Israelites actually destroyed the wealth of the Egyptians, as is written, “the more they increased and spread out,” (Gen. 1:12) this is to be interpreted, “The more the Israelites’s wealth increased and the more the possessions of the Egyptians were lost,” based on the verse,<b>פָּרַ֖צְתָּ עָלֶ֣יךָ פָּ֑רֶץ</b> “What a breach you have made for yourself!” (Gen. 38:29) This was especially true for Pharaoh who had the intention of building a treasury, and it turned into garrison cities <b>עָרֵ֤י מִסְכְּנוֹת֙<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">Some translate the expression as store cities. Here Rabbi Foa plays on the connection between <i>miskenot</i>, <b>מִסְכְּנוֹת֙</b> and sakanah, which means danger.</i></b> which became a danger to the Egyptians. As a result, “the [Egyptians] came to dread the Israelites,” (Ex. 1:12) that is, the loss of their wealth caused the Egyptians pain that was like thorns in one’s flesh. <br>Therefore, the Egyptians took counsel and decided to leave their wealth and only to enslave them. As it is written, “The Egyptians ruthlessly imposed slavery upon the Israelites and they made their lives bitter with hard labor…” (Ex. 1:13-14) From this point forward, the Egyptians only imposed hard labor and slavery are mentioned. It also says, “The Israelites were groaning under the bondage and cried out… their cry for help from the bondage rose up to God.” (Ex.2:23) And if you say, “, “I have marked well the oppression <b>עֳנִ֥י</b> of My people in Egypt…” (Ex. 3:7),<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote"> He just said that “Oppression” wasn’t mentioned once they enslaved him and yet here we do find mention of the oppression brought upon the Israelites.</i> I have already answered this question in <i>Goren Arnon</i>: two explanations of the word <b>עֳנִ֥י</b> are offered. One is imposed upon them. <b>עֳנִ֥י</b> is an allusion to exile besides the exile experienced in Egypt, as God said, “I will be what I will be,” (Ex. 3:14) which the sages explained as, “I will be with them in this exile and I will be with them in other exiles.” See what I wrote there at length.  <br>And even if it was their intention to do this evil to Israel by oppressing them, they were not able to, “oppressed us,” since the Holy One combines thought with action…and even more so when the thoughts involve action.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">I am uncertain about the last section of this passage. Possibly, Rabbi Foa is saying that thoughts of oppression are the same as actual oppression because they lead to action, and therefore the Egyptians were punished for their “thoughts.”</i> <br>
<i><b>Aray Miskanot</b></i><b>: Store Cities.</b> The expression עָרֵ֤י מִסְכְּנוֹת֙ “garrison/storage cities,” is derived from the word<i> sakanah</i>, danger, since the builders were in constant danger. The ground was moist so that if one built a tall building it would not remain standing. When the Israelites built a tall and lofty building according to Pharaoh’s will they were constantly afraid that the walls would collapse on them. God performed wonders, so that the buildings only collapsed at night. That is why they called the place Pithom, from Pi Tehom, the mouth of the abyss swallowed it up. <br>
<i><b>Ramses</b></i>: “They (the garrisons) collapsed [<i>mitroses</i>] one by one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">See BT<i> Sota</i> 11a, <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 1:10</i> The rest of “Egypt enslaved them… ruthlessly... with harsh labor at mortar and bricks and with all sorts of tasks in the field.” (Ex. 1:13-14) When the verse states, “Egypt enslaved them,” instead of “They enslaved them,” it teaches that many Egyptians together would command one Israelite. They did so with cruelty, בְּפָֽרֶךְ <i>b’farekh</i> (ruthlessly). It was in this way that they made their lives bitter.  <br>Further, since it says, וַיַּעֲבִ֧דוּ <i>vaya’avidu</i>, “they enslaved,” (Ex. 1:13) it teaches that they acted according to their law, which states that a master can say to his servant, “Do as I say or I won’t feed you!” Thus, even though the Israelites were not the property of the Egyptians they subjugated them and refused to feed them, as is stated in Scripture, “We remember the fish that we used to eat free in Egypt…” (Num. 11:5) If the Egyptians had given it to them as payment for their efforts, it would not have been free. Rather, the Egyptians dismissed the Israelites with nothing! The fish that the Egyptians threw at them were already dead fish, as implied wherever the word <i>daga</i>, fish, is used. They would take it without payment as is implied by the word <i>chinam</i>, free. <br>

Paragraph 9

<b>וַיְעַנּ֑וּנוּ וַיִּתְּנ֥וּ עָלֵ֖ינוּ <i>Vayitnu alaynu</i>, They placed upon us</b>: <b>(Deut. 26:6)</b> They placed hard labor on the Israelites both at home and in the field. At home they would cut wood, move rocks, and other such work. They were burdens that they carried on their shoulders. And the work of building which is explicitly stated in Scripture: “With mortar and bricks…” (Ex. 1:14) <br>
<b>“With mortar”</b> (Ex. 1:14) because the land in Egypt was moist, it was not stable so that the Israelites had to seek dry earth to combine with the moist earth. They then had to knead them together in order to make it stable. <br>
<b>“And with bricks” (Ex. 1:14)</b> - They place a daily quota of bricks, according to the number that they made on the first day when they asked with “a gentle tongue” (<i>peh rakh),</i> so that they would work quickly, saying the matter is urgent for the King, and that he, in his great majesty was also helping. They assumed that they would only have to help on the first day. As a result they all helped out with all their might in order to curry favor with the king. The Egyptians then obligated the Israelites to bring the same quantity every day. <br>
<b>“And with all manners of work in the field…” (Ex. 1:14)</b> digging trenches, plowing, seeding, planting, pruning, winnowing, and herding the flocks.  <br>“With hard labor”- it is the practice of shepherds to attend to the flocks in one place, cattle in another, horses in yet another because the cattle won’t graze in the same place as the flocks because of the smell of what they leave behind. And when they are together in one place one group goes to one area and the other to another area so that they can find grazing land that is good for them. The<i> Midrash</i> says that the Egyptians insisted on grazing all five types of animals together: horses, donkey’s, camels, cattle, and sheep. This made it especially hard to watch over all of them together. The Egyptians also commanded them to go to places without trees so they couldn’t stand guard in the shade. Further, the Egyptians didn't allow them to cool off with pickled foods and vegetables which are good to have in the heat. They enslaved them also at night by placing torches and lamps before them (so they could continue to work). <br><i><b>(Od)</b></i> Furthermore, the Egyptians told the Israelites to collect insects and reptiles like crabs, frogs and the like. The Israelites were careful not to eat them and it was difficult to hunt for them.  <br>The Egyptians told them to hunt for bears and lions. Another type of hard labor mentioned in the <i>Midrash</i> involved men doing women's jobs and women doing men's jobs. This was hard labor even when the labor was less strenuous. It is hard for one to do a job who doesn’t know how to do it. Further, since it says, “They ruthlessly enslaved the Israelites,” (Ex. 1:13) and not, “They enslaved them,” it implies that it was Egypt’s intention to first enslave the most important Israelites. It also states, <b>בְּפָֽרֶךְ</b> “Ruthlessly, and they embittered their lives…” (Ex. 1:13-14) to teach us that the Egyptians sought to make them feel disgust in their food and drink things that were to eat. Their bread was made filthy with mortar as is stated in the Zohar. It seems to me that they made their food detestable by forcing them to scrape and clean their privies when they were about to eat. This is hinted at in the abbreviation of <b>בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּפָֽרֶךְ</b> Bnei Yisrael B’farekh<b>- בִּיב</b> (sewer) and juxtaposed to this is the verse, “And they embittered their lives.” In other words, that which maintains life - food was made bitter for them because of the terrible stench which followed them from the drainage ditches. <br>

(Ex. 2:23) "And the Lord heard our voice" - as it is stated (Exodus 2:24); "And God<i> (Elohim)</i> heard their moaning.” (Ex 2:24)</i> <br>We do not learn from this verse that they cried out to<i> Adonai</i> but rather that they simply cried out. Further, the verse states, “<i>Adonai</i> heard our plea,” (Deut. 26:7) and the proof text states, “God (<i>Elohim</i>) heard their moaning,” (Ex. 2:24) and not <i>Adonai</i>. However, this comes to teach us that if one doesn’t know how to direct his prayers in the proper fashion, depending on what his request is (for the sages have said, “One who wishes to become wise should face south, etc…”)<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">See BT <i>Baba Batra</i> 25b; Also see the<i> Shulchan Aruch,</i> <i>Orech Chaim</i>, <i>Rama’s gloss on</i> 94:2</i> then he should simply pray to the One in whose hands are his wishes. Then if he had deep intention from his heart, he will be judged by the heavenly court above and the attribute of compassion will overcome the attribute of justice and grant his request.. So too, Israel was becoming impure in Egypt and had forgotten the proper order of prayers and to which attribute of God to direct their prayers so that they will be accepted, as we have now. Regarding our generation the sages have said, “Why are Israel’s prayers not answered? Because we no longer know how to address God by the (proper) name.” <br>There must have been a tradition in the hands of (of the Israelites) regarding God’s name for when our teacher Moses had asked about God’s name, what use would that have been if they didn’t already know God’s name? Also haven’t we already heard that Pharaoh said, “I do not know God,”I do not know <i>Adonai,</i>” (Ex. 5:2)<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that Moses said the name of God and Pharaoh claimed not to know it.</i> Rather Israel knew God’s special name but they did not know which aspect of God would be responsible for redeeming them. This is what Moses asked of God. God answered “I will be what I will be,” (Ex. 3:14) this is the special name of God from which redemption shall come. <br>And so, Israel cried out to God generically; it was as if they were crying out to the God of their forefathers. Their cry rose up to <i>Elohim,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Elohim is associated with the attribute of judgment; while Adonai is associated with the attribute of mercy.</i></i> the attribute of judgment and it then judged whether they were worthy of redemption. The attribute of judgment said that there were many wicked among them and that they had not yet completed the four hundred years of slavery. And the Attribute of Mercy recalled the covenant of the forefathers, saw their oppression, labors and suffering so that the attribute. They agreed that the wicked (among the Israelites) would die during the plague of darkness that would last three days and the good would be redeemed. <br>

Paragraph 14

<b>וַיַּ֧רְא אֶת־עׇנְיֵ֛נוּ <i>Vayar et Onyeinu</i> “He saw our plight,”</b> The sages have said that they didn’t allow the Israelite women to immerse themselves so that they wouldn’t be able to increase in number. He made the men shepherd the cattle in the mountains and valleys so that they were far from home and from their wives. <br>
<b>וְאֶת־עֲמָלֵנוּ. אֵלּוּ הַבָּנִים</b> <i><b>V’et amalainu - elu habanim,</b></i><b> “And our toil - this refers to the sons.”</b> First Pharaoh commanded the midwives, “look at the birthstool: if it is a boy, kill him…” (Ex.1:16) But the midwives feared God and did not do what the King of Egypt commanded. When Pharaoh saw this, he slaughtered many babies each day and bathed in their blood for his leprosy, because his doctors told him that the blood of the baby boys would help him. But doctors don’t work for nothing; they treat the sick with contradictory cures and apply what is generally helpful. We find Isaiah cured King Hizkiyahu, with a cake of figs which is generally helpful even on healthy flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, he seems to be saying that doctors don’t really know what they are doing and simply give common sense cures that have nothing to do with the illness.</i> But the illness became worse in the way the doctors treated Pharaoh. When Pharaoh saw that the cure didn’t help, he still didn’t want to reject it without reaching his goal; he wanted to decrease the Israelite nation. Therefore he commanded that every male child be cast into the river. Then, “Catch us the foxes, the little foxes…” (Song 2:15) The Egyptians would enter the Israelite houses with their young children. They would then pinch them and make them cry so that the Israelite children who were hidden would hear the child crying and they would also begin crying - this is the way of infants. The Egyptians would then follow the sound of the children and take them against the parents will and throw them in the river.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">BT Sota 12a</i> When the Israelite women saw that it didn’t help to hide their children in their homes they would go out and give birth in the fields and hide them in the ground. They would then come and nurse them there. When the Egyptians figured this out, they would plow over the field, as Scripture states, “Plowmen plowed across my back; they made long furrows. ” (Ps. 129:3) God would cause the ones who were most worthy to be redeemed from Egypt were place deep enough until they were at the level of rocks and there they would nurse on honey and oil, as Scripture states, “He fed him honey from the crag and oil from the flinty rock,” (Deut. 32:13)<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Sota 11b Much of this passage is drawn from Sota.</i>

Paragraph 15



Paragraph 16

<b>וְאֶֽת־לַחֲצֵֽנוּ׃ <i>v’et lachatzeinu,</i> “ And our pressure,”</b> The Egyptians would press the Israelites to work faster, as is stated, “And the taskmasters pressed them, saying, “You must complete the same work assignment each day…” (Ex. 5:13) They acted like bears and lions toward the Israelites. They would order them to perform several tasks at once and then not allow them to rest even for a short while from their toil and labors. The Egyptians would come up with new evil decrees. They made them clean the marketplace and courtyards, and they forced them to attend to the bathhouse who warmed the water for their baths. They made them attend to their gardens and orchards, plant their fields, draw water, and carry the wares from place to place. They also made them dig ditches and care for the children, This was the <b>זֶו הַדְּחַק “</b>This refers to the pressure,” They pressed them to do all of these chores. Furthermore, the Egyptians subjugated the Israelites to all of their other slaves, as it states, “...because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage,” (Ex. 6:5). It is written, <b>מַעֲבִדִים אֹתָ֑ם.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">It is written without a yud. Mabidim with a yud would mean “subjugated them”, while מַעֲבִדִ֣ים without a yud might be interpreted as “they enslaved them to others”</i></b> <br>“And in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor,” (Ex. 1:14) this verse teaches us that even if the Israelites could figure out how to accomplish a job more easily, such as bringing up <i>seah</i> in three trips, the Egyptians would insist that they do it in one trip. Similarly, if the Israelite wanted to take one of the animals to carry the wares or the wheat of the Egyptians to its place, the Egyptians would not allow them to do so. Instead he insisted that he carry it on his shoulders. They acted similarly in all things. They did all this to weaken them so that they would not be fruitful and increase. None of this mattered because the Israelites continued to grow stronger, “Through the favor of the Presence in the bush.” (Deut. 33:16) <sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi -ורצון שכני סנה — the last two words are the equivalent of שוכן סנה (the י being the suffix that that sometimes appears in participles, for the most part in poetry). The-meaning is: And may his land further be blessed through the favor (רצון) and satisfaction of the Holy One, blessed be He, who first revealed himself to me in the thorn-bush (סנה‎).</i> <br>Further, if an Israelite died they would not let the other Israelites bury them; instead the Egyptians would throw them out in the field, as it says, ““Was it for want of graves in Egypt that you brought us to die in the wilderness?” (Ex. 14:11) In other words, the only reason you redeemed us was because there were no graves in Egypt. <br><b>(<i>Hayn</i>)</b> These were but a few of the evils that the Egyptians inflicted on us and our souls; there were many more! It was part of Egypt’s intention to anger God, the Creator, as is written in the <i>Midrashim</i> regarding the reasons for the plagues that the Holy One brought upon them. (As a result,) the plagues struck the Egyptians measure for measure. The Israelites were subjugated with rigor by the Egyptians because they were God’s chosen and to whom God wished to give His holy <i>Torah</i> which is compared to water. Because they were blessed with, “Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth…” (Gen. 28:14) Because they were compared to animals over which human beings had no ascendency. Because they gave their lives in martyrdom. Because Israel was the offspring of Abraham, God’s beloved one. Because in the future God would wipe away their sins and make them white like snow. Because they are the hosts and troops of God, separated from the other nations. Therefore he divided the night to Abraham, giving half to his offspring. This is the conclusion of the Midrash… <br>It would seem that it was the Egyptians' intention to anger God. Does it not make sense that after restraining Himself for some time, in the end He would send the angel of His face to warn them. And when they became stubborn and hardened their hearts, continuing to perform such abominations against Israel, that God would rightfully send, “His burning anger upon them, wrath, indignation, trouble, a band of deadly messengers,” (Ps. 78:49) to punish them for their sins. God is righteous in all His ways and kind in all his deeds. With all this God performed great kindness with them as we shall explain.

Paragraph 17

<b>וַיּוֹצִאֵ֤נוּ יְהֹוָה֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם בְּיָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ וּבִזְרֹ֣עַ נְטוּיָ֔ה וּבְמֹרָ֖א גָּדֹ֑ל וּבְאֹת֖וֹת וּבְמֹפְתִֽים׃ <i>Adonai</i> freed us from Egypt by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm and awesome power, and by signs and portents. (Deut. 26:8)</b> <br><b>וַיּוֹצִאֵ֤נוּ יְהֹוָה֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם <i>Vayoteinu</i>, “Adonai took us out from Egypt,”</b> (Deut. 26:8) Since a verse states, “God sent a messenger (<i>malakh</i>) and took us out from Egypt,” (Num. 20:16) the commentators state that this verse is speaking of Moses, our teacher. Because the prophets are emissaries of God, they are considered, <b>מַלְאָכִים֙</b> <i>malakhim</i> (angels). The <i>Maggid</i> comes to say that this is not that type of <b>מַלְאָכִים֙,</b> <i>malakh</i>, nor is it the type of <i>malakh</i>, our forefather, Jacob, was referring to when he said, “The angel who has redeemed me from all harm…” (Gen. 48:16) Jacob is not referring to an angel among the ministering angels for he would never have said that an angel should bless his grandchildren. Rather the term<b>הַמַּלְאָךְ֩</b> <i>hamalakh</i>, “the Angel,” refers to the Shechinah, the Divine Presence and that God Himself took them out of Egypt. <br>One might say that these verses contradict one another! One says that God “Sent an angel to take us out…” (Num. 20:16) and the other verse says “ <i>Adonai</i> took us out…” (Deut. 26:8) and yet <i>Maggid</i> says, “Not by an angel…” However one should note that the verse does not say, “He sent an angel to take us out,” but rather, “He sent an angel and He took us out.” (Num. 20:16) He wishes to explain that God had already sent, “the angel of His presence,”<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">This is another term for the Shechinah.</i> (Is. 63:9) to Egypt. This is what the sages meant when they stated, “The Divine Presence (<i>Shechinah</i>) was exiled to Egypt with them, as is stated, “I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will also bring you back.” (Gen. 46:4) This suggests that God will bring us out of Egypt through<i> Shechinah</i> itself and will perform miracles and wonders. This is what will happen in the future when God brings us out from this exile, as is written, “In that day, I will set up again the fallen booth of David,” (Amos 9:11) Therefore, it won’t be through a <b>שָׂרָף</b> <i>Saraph</i>, a fiery being, even though it is written, “I will bore you on the wings of eagles.” (Ex. 19:4) This refers to the face of the eagle in the divine chariot, (Ez. 1:1) It was not the <i>Sarafim</i> who took us out completely; rather it was God who took us out of Egypt and these eagles served to carry us to the land of Israel so we could eat the Passover offering, as the liturgist wrote, “They built and flew off to the bright and fairest of heritages… There they shall eat the<i> Pesach</i> offering with praise and songs, This is because outside of the land of Israel the <i>Pesach</i> offering was not allowed. On that night they shall return to the Valley of Kaftorim. I will perform miracles with all the gods of Egypt, I and not an emissary, The emissary is Moses who was sent on a mission by the Blessed One to Pharaoh and to the people of Israel, and not as the people who complained said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt?” It was not so - rather it was God who brought us out, and against all the Gods of Egypt did he bring judgment.

Paragraph 18

<b>וַיּוֹצִאֵנוּ ה' מִמִּצְרַיִם. “And I will smite every firstborn in the Land of Egypt” (Ex. 12:12)</b> - I, and not a <i>Saraph</i>.” The Torah states, ‘I passed by (<i>al</i>) the houses of the children of Israel…’ (Ex. 12:13)<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the verse that he apparently is quoting is not the same as the actual language of the verse in Exodus. Here and in many places, Rabbi Foa is not exacting in his quotations - probably because he is delivering this as a teaching orally.</i> One might presume that the verse is suggesting that God passed through the houses of the Israelites since it says “I passed by (<i>al</i>) the houses,” rather than, ‘I passed over (<i>mei’al</i>),’ that God hopped over the homes of the Egyptians and did not enter them.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, by passing over the Egyptian homes the angel of death could strike them down while the Israelites passed through their homes protecting them.</i> If one would presume this is the case then the plague would not have been carried out by God but by a <i>Saraph</i>. Therefore, the <i>Midrash</i> comes to tell us that this was not the case. Rather it was the Holy One and not a <i>Saraph</i> who performed the tenth plague. It was a great merit for the Egyptians that they were not killed by the angel of death (but by God). It allowed them to presume that their death was an atonement and allowed them to be sanctified.

Paragraph 19



Paragraph 20

<b>בְּיָד חֲזָקָה<i> b’yad hazakah</i> “With a mighty hand” (Deut. 26:8)</b> Since the <i>Torah</i> states “With a mighty hand,” after stating, “And Adonai took them out of Egypt,” “mighty hand” must be referring to the last plague. This is to teach us that in the final plague, the Egyptians were stricken with, “pestilence,” “ sword,” “with great awe,” with “staff” and with “blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">All the associations made in the rest of the Midrash on this verse.</i> ” We have a principle, that “anything that is included in a generalization or is learned from a generalization, applies not only to that one thing but to the entire generalization. Because of this principle, all of the plagues which struck the Egyptians were included with one another so that the ten plagues were really like one hundred plagues. As stated in the following parable:<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta D’Rebbe Yishmael</i> 14:5. With slight differences from Rabbi Foa’s version of the parable. It also appears in the <i>Mekhilta D’Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai</i> 14:5 and in <i>Rabbeinu Bachy</i>a 12:33. One of the main differences is that the master gives three choices - the first and second are the same - the third involves paying 100 maneh (instead of 1000 zuz) . Note the original context in which the Parable appears: “In the past, Pharaoh's servants said to him (Ex. 10:7) "How long will this one be a stumbling block to us?" and now (Ibid. 14:5) "What is this that we did in sending Israel away from serving us?" They said to him: If we were smitten and we had not sent him away, that would have been enough for us. Or if we were smitten and had sent him away and he had not taken our wealth from us, that would have been enough for us. But we have been smitten, and we have sent him away, and he has taken our wealth from us!”</i> A person said to his servant, “Go buy me a fish in the marketplace.” The servant went and bought him a spoiled (stinking) fish. The master became angry and said to the servant. He said, “I will punish you in one of three ways: either eat the spoiled fish, or accept one hundred lashes or pay me a thousand zuz.” The servant said: “I’ll eat the spoiled fish!” When he ate half of it, he became nauseated and wanted to throw it up. He said to his master, “I can’t eat it! I’ll accept a hundred lashes.” When he had received fifty lashes, he thought he would die from the pain. He said, “I will pay a thousand <i>zuz</i>!” In the end, he ate, was whipped and he paid! So to with Pharaoh: he ate, he was whipped and he paid. <br><b>(<i>U’techilah</i>)</b> First, we have several questions about this parable. Why does the parable mention that the master sent his servant to buy a fish rather than meat? Further, in the parable, the servant is Pharaoh; where do we find that he ate fish? Also, the master in the parable is upright and righteous; how could he make the servant pay a thousand <i>zuz</i>? If that was the cost of the fish then he should have told him to pay for the fish. If this was more than the cost of the fish, why punish him in this way? It makes sense to punish him with lashes or to make him eat the fish. This would appear to be a more appropriate judgment for one who was not careful in performing the task the master had assigned him. But let the master charge him as much as the fish cost and not a thousand times the amount! <br>(<i><b>Omnam</b></i>) We have already commented that God sent Israel to Egypt to be purified and refined through the suffering of subjugation. We also know that as long as a person is not ‘whole’ he is like a fish, as<i> Habakuk</i> states, “You have made mankind like the fish of the sea…” (Hab. 1:14) This is referring to the wicked who were caught in a great snare, which was Nebuchadnezzar. In his wisdom King Solomon wrote, “A man cannot even know his time as fishes are enmeshed in a fatal net…” (Ecc. 9:12) Rashi explains, “Like large fish that are caught in an inferior and weak net, and our Rabbis explained: “This is a fishhook, which is no more than a type of needle, by which a large fish is caught,” so it is with human beings on the day that evil is visited on them with something simple.<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi ad locum,</i> That is why the wicked are compared to fish. <br>God sent Israel beneath the hand of Pharaoh in order to refine them as has been said. It was as if he said to (Pharaoh) “Buy one fish for me.”For Israel is one of five possessions of the Holy One, as is said in <i>Avot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Avot 6:10</i> It was as if God said to Pharaoh, refine them so that they will be worthy to sit at My table. The servant went and bought a spoiled fish; that is, he turned the refining upside down by not allowing them to study Torah or to fulfill the commandments as was written above regarding the verse, “The Egyptians made us look bad…” (Deut. 26:6) The verse doesn’t say “They dealt harshly with us.” <sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary on this verse above.</i> The Holy One said to Pharaoh: “I shall place one of three punishments upon you: either you must eat the fish,” so that you acknowledge that I am God and all powerful. From this the Israelites shall reason, ‘If Pharaoh admits that God is God, how much more so should we acknowledge that the Holy One is God!’ and then the stink will depart from it. Pharaoh began to say, “I do not know <i>Adonai,</i> nor will I let Israel go.” (Ex.5:2) In other words (he meant), ‘Even if I knew <i>Adonai</i>, I would not free the Israelites, because I don’t want to release them from my corruption, which is the realm of impurity!’ He then commanded that their labor should be more severe, making men’s work harder so that they were not free to purify and refine themselves. When he began to eat the fish which were the plagues of blood and frogs, he became nauseated and he began to vomit because there were frogs in their innards, causing the Egyptians to throw up. Pharaoh then said to Moses and Aaron, “Entreat your God and ask Him to remove the frogs from me and my people and I will send you out. When he didn’t keep his word, it was as if he invited lashes upon himself. Then when they had completed their lashes, each man asked his male neighbor and each woman her female neighbor silver and gold utensils and the Egyptians emptied out everything. When the Egyptians wanted to pursue the Israelites the people said to Pharaoh, “We don’t have our fine jewelry to adorn ourselves!” Pharaoh opened his treasury to them and gave them what they wanted; this became the booty that they collected at the sea which was even greater than what they took in the land of Egypt. It seems that all of the collection was from Pharaoh’s pocket. <br>In answer to the question, why did he punish the servant with a thousand <i>zuz,</i> it is to teach an essential lesson. A person should never say, “I want this punishment, for my sin.” Rather he should say, “ God should do whatever is fit in God’s eyes.” A person cannot know what is good for him and what is bad.Do we not see this when the Holy One asked King David what punishment he desired: either to turn him over to his enemies for three months, or that his children should die. David chose to be turned over to his enemies for three months.<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">See 2 Samuel 24. I assume this is the story to which Rabbi Foa is referring, though the version he talks about here is different.</i> In the end, it was necessary for him to change his mind and Avishai helped him by praying for him. Here too, the master decreed all of these judgments against his servant for bringing him a spoiled fish, and what the servant thought was the worst was the easiest for it was the one he could bear.. Therefore a person should be careful not to say anything because God in heaven judges justly, and all of a person's words come before Him. When a person chooses his own judgment, it can never be taken back except with great and mighty merit. Rather it is better for one to say that he has fallen before God (and accepts his decree) because God’s mercy is great. <br><i><b>(Nachzor)</b></i>  We will now return to,<b>עׇנְיֵ֛נוּ,</b> “our plight.”(Deut. 26:7) Each plague included all the others so that together they were equal to 100 lashes which are mentioned in the <i>Midrash.</i> Rabbi Akiva said that each plague had five (derivatives), that were aspects of the plague itself, as we shall explain. According to our approach, each plague included the other plagues, when the Torah states that the plagues came about with a “mighty hand” meaning with pestilence, it means that there were deaths from each of them. In the case of blood, there were deaths for those who drank the blood since not everyone could suffer its quality and its heat. In the case of the plague of frogs, some of them were so big that they swallowed the Egyptians. The lice were so large they were the size of a chicken egg as we have mentioned; it is not far from common sense that they would cause death to those who were delicate. During the plague of darkness people died of hunger and so on with wild animals.<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote"> The word <i>dever,</i> pestilence implies that people died as a result of each of the plagues. This is what the Torah means when it says God freed us with a mighty hand - pestilence. Each plague caused some type of death to the Egyptians.</i> <br>

Paragraph 21

<b>וּבִזְרֹ֣עַ נְטוּיָ֔ה “And with an outstretched arm,” (Deut. 26:8) This refers to the sword.”</b> (Hag.) This comes to inform us how God smote them. Even though the <i>Torah</i> states, “then the hand of <i>Adonai</i> will strike,” (Ex. 9:3) and, ““This is the finger of God!” (Ex. 8:15) there was nothing in God’s hands. It is similar to what is written about the ministering angels who placed their finger on them and burned them up. So too, God’s (proverbial) sword was a sword of retribution.

Paragraph 22

<b>וּבְמֹרָ֖א גָּדֹ֑ל “And with awesome power” (Deut.26:8) - this is this [refers to the revelation of] the Divine Presence,” (Hag.)</b> This does not mean that the Egyptians benefited by seeing it as the Israelites benefited from the brightness (of the <i>Shechinah</i>). Rather when the Divine Presence was revealed to them, terror, fear, and trembling took hold of them. About this the Torah states, “You shall venerate My sanctuary,” (Lev. 19:30) which means that as long as the Divine Presence dwells among people, they shall experience fear of God. This causes awe upon the whole world. That is why it has been taught, “Pray for the welfare of the kingdom for were it not for fear, people would swallow one another alive.”<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Avot 3:2</i> Similarly Job said, “When I passed through the city gates… young men saw me and hid… Nobles held back their words… The voices of princes were hushed…” (Job 29:7-10) because he was complaining that his friends considered him a sinner. So Job said this to them. When he went out to the marketplace, anyone who was talking who saw him became silent because of their awe of him. This was only because the Divine Presence accompanied him, and the Divine Presence caused people to feel terror.

Paragraph 23

<b>וּבְאֹתוֹת. זֶה הַמַּטֶּה, “Signs” (Deut. 26:8) - this is the staff. (Hag.)</b> When the Egyptians saw the staff they began to tremble like a young child who sees (his father’s) strap, and he thinks about the punishment that it will inflict. For this reason, Israel had these thoughts, as Rashi explains regarding the verse, “Take the rod with which you struck the Nile…” (Ex. 17:5)<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Exodus 17:5: What is the force of the words “wherewith thou smotest the river” — they are apparently superfluous? But these are added because the Israelites had said of the staff that it was intended only for punishment.</i>

Paragraph 24

<b>וּבְמֹפְתִים. זֶה הַדָּם, “Wonders,” (Deut. 26:8) - this is a reference to the blood.</b> (Hag.) This is not like the blood that spills from their bodies when they die. They did not die like the sick since the angels do not disfigure them when he slaughters them. Rather, he slaughtered them as one slaughters an animal causing their blood to spill out. <br><b>לפי</b> Since the plagues that we have mentioned were not individual plagues for the entire group, there were some that felt some plagues and some that felt other plagues. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva did not interpret them. Instead they interpreted the plague that smote all of them (together). One said there were forty, one said there were fifty as shall be explained with God’s help.

The Ten Plagues



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3



Paragraph 4



Paragraph 5

<b>אֵלּוּ עֶשֶׂר מַכּוֹת These ten plagues,</b> are <i>avot</i>, <b>primary categories</b>,<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Literally it is <i>Avot</i>, “Fathers' ' as opposed to the <i>Toledot,</i> literally, “Offspring. These terms are used in relation to the primary prohibitions on Shabbat as opposed to the secondary acts which are similar to them but also different.</i> for all the other plagues which the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt. There are <i>toledot, or</i> derivatives<b>,</b> as Rabbis Eliezer and Akiva show.<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> and Toledot - literally Fathers and Offspring. These words are used in a variety of settings to define primary acts and their derivatives, such as the 39 <i>Avot Melacho</i>t which are forbidden on the Sabbath, each one having toledot, derivative acts that are similar to but not the same as the primary forbidden acts.</i> One says there are three derivatives for one and the other says there are four derivatives for each primary plague.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">“He inflicted (5) His burning anger upon them, (1) wrath, (2) indignation, (3) trouble, (4) a band of deadly messengers. (Ps 78:49) This is the order in which Rabbi Foa presents them.</i> What they have in common is both rabbis believe there are derivatives for primary plagues. Rabbi Eliezer does not include <i>apo</i>, “His anger,” among the derivatives for individual plagues. Possibly he thought that the attribute of “anger” was included in all of the plagues that afflicted the Egyptians; that is, that God, the blessed one, used it to punish them according to the literal meaning of Scripture. “He inflicted His burning anger upon them.” (Ps. 78:49) Rabbi Akiva thought that just as “a band of deadly messengers.” (Ps. Ibid) refers to an individual plague which God brought about, so too was there a destroying angel, whose name was <i>af</i>, “Anger”one that he brought about. Thus, according to this, Rabbi Akiva believed that there were five categories of destroying angels, each one different from the other, while Rabbi Eliezer thought there was one angel who brought about four plagues. We will now explicate them.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, according to Rabbi Eliezer there are five derivatives: “God inflicted (1) His burning anger upon them, (2) wrath, (3) indignation, (4)trouble a band of deadly messengers.” - “Burning anger” and “trouble a band of deadly messengers are each. Are each a subcategory unto themselves. For Rabbi Akiva there are five derivatives: “He inflicted (1) His burning (2) anger upon them, (3)wrath, (4) indignation, (5) trouble, a band of deadly messengers.</i>

Paragraph 6



Paragraph 7

<b>דָּם <i>Dam,</i> Blood</b> - Since Rabbi Eliezer does not consider<i> Apo,</i> “His anger” to be a separate derivative for a plague, we will deal with it last. <br>1. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b>, “Wrath,” (Ps. ibid) - at first when the Egyptians tried to draw water to drink, it turned to blood in their mouths. But when the Israelites and the Egyptians tried to drink water together, the Egyptians were able to drink the water. The plague initially was that the Egyptians could not drink water unless the Israelites were thirsty and drank with them. <br>
2. <b>וָזַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation,” (Ps. Ibid) - If an Egyptian was thirsty and could not find an Israelite to drink with him, he would force the Israelite to do so since Egyptians were used to lording over the Israelites. Therefore, God became “indignant” and caused the Egyptian to drink blood even when the Israelite was drinking water . As a result, the Egyptians had to pay for the water from the Israelites with money (<i>damim</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Damim</i> means money but it also means blood!</i> Thus, the <i>Midrash</i> states that the Israelite and the Egyptian would fill their cups together. The Israelite found water in his cup and the Egyptian found blood. The two then went back and filled the cup and the Egyptian said, “We will drink (from the same cup). So that the Egyptian was forced to drink from the same up as the Israelite. But when an Egyptian and an Israelite tried drinking from the cup, implying that they had figured out how to outsmart God. That is why the Egyptian said to the Israelite, “We will drink together as we have done until now.” But when they put their mouths to the cup, the Israelite drank water and the Egyptian, blood. That is what Rabbi Avin said: All the water that the Egyptians drank they had to buy from the Israelites with <i>damim</i>, blood-money. And so the Israelites were enriched.  <br>
3. <b>וְצָרָ֑ה</b> “trouble,” (Ps. Ibid) Scripture states, “and the fish in the Nile will die.” (Ex. 7:18) Most of the Egyptians' lives depended on fish, whether as food or as a livelihood. This is stated in Scripture, “The fishermen shall lament; All who cast lines in the Nile shall mourn…shall languish….The flax workers, too, shall be dismayed, both carders and weavers chagrined” (Is. 19:8-9) This was because their work was to catch and search out fish. And concerning their food, it is written, “We remember the fish that we used to eat free in Egypt…” (Num. 11:5) There were so many fish in Egypt, it seemed like nothing and everyone ate them freely. During this plague the fish all died and the livelihood of the Egyptians was taken from them. <br>
4. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers” (Ps. Ibid) - This is what is written, “The Nile will stink.” (Ex. 7:18) This was an especially horrible plague, particularly for those who took pleasure in spices and perfumes, which is the way of the promiscuous in which the Egyptians were absorbed. Now the stink rose up from the Nile, overtaking the perfumes and causing them great distress. <br>
5. <b>אַפּ֗ו “Anger”</b> (Ps. ibid) According to Rabbi Akiva, “Anger” is a separate plague, since the blood was throughout the land of Egypt, even in the trees and rocks. (see Ex. 7:19)<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">And <i>HaShem</i> said to Moses, “Say to Aaron: Take your rod and hold out your arm over the waters of Egypt—its rivers, its canals, its ponds, all its bodies of water—that they may turn to blood; there shall be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone.” <br></i>
6. The verse does not say<i> ba’eitz u’va’even</i> (singular), “in the tree and rock.” but <i>ba’eitzim u’va’avanim</i>, “In the trees and rocks,” in the plural to make known that the blood was present wherever people dwelled. This was because all matter is made up of the four basic elements: fire, wind, water and earth so that part of the water that was present in any place turned to blood. In this way their garments became soiled with blood - in particular the prince who wore garments of white linen, as we learn from Joseph, “And he had him dressed in robes of fine linen,” (Gen. 41:42) so that their clothes became disgusting.

Paragraph 8

<b>צְפַרְדֵּעַ</b> <i><b>Tzfardia,</b></i><b> “Frogs”</b> This is the second plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗ו</b> “His Anger” (Ps. 78:49) - As a result of God’s anger, they had no place for the people to stand, as it states, "But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief.” (Ex. 8:11) If Moses had not prayed for the frogs to die, they would have no space. They were exceedingly cramped (by the frogs) so when (Moses prayed) and Pharaoh saw that there was room, he initially softened and decided to obey God’s command. <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “Wrath” (Ps. 78:49) The frogs croaked so loud the people were not able to sleep or speak to one another. That is why it is states, “they shall come up and enter your palace, your bedchamber and your bed,” (Ex. 7:28) <br>
3.<b>זַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation,” (Ps. 78:49) When the Egyptians put flour in the bowl, the frogs went into bowl and ate the dough. They would quickly heat the oven to bake the loaves in the oven but the frogs would cause it to cool off, as it states, “and your ovens and your kneading bowls.” (Ex. 7:28) The verse states “your ovens,” and then “your kneading bowls,”to teach us that the Egyptians were troubled by the cooling of the ovens when they put their dough in it the frogs ate it. <br>
4. <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> “Troubles” (Ps. 78:49) The frogs would enter their stomachs while still alive and croak while in their bodies, as Scripture states, “The frogs shall go up in you and <b>in your people</b>,” (Ex. 7:29) The sages state this was the most difficult thing of all. It was because of this that Pharaoh asked Moses, “Plead with HaShem to remove the frogs from me and my people,” (Ex. 8:4)  <br>
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers,” (Ps. 78:49) The frogs castrated the Egyptians, as Asaf wrote, “He inflicted upon them swarms of insects to devour them, frogs to destroy them.” (Ps. 78:45) Rashi explains this verse: “They would pull off their testicles.” (<i>Rashi ad locum</i>) This is from the <i>Midrash</i> which Rabbi Yochanan said: Any place the Egyptians rested, frogs appeared. Did they actually appear in houses of alabaster or bricks? Rabbi Ishmael ben Yossi said to him: this is one of the few times where the soft ruled over the hard. The frogs would come up (to the walls) and say, “I am the emissary of the Holy One,” and the alabaster would crack open and the frogs would come up, as is stated, “frogs to destroy them.” (Ps. Ibid) As is written elsewhere in Scripture, “for they are mutilated, they have a defect.” (Lev. 22:25)<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">This verse in Leviticus is speaking about castration or damage to the genitals - the same verb is used here.</i> <br>It is helpful to clarify here - how could the alabaster be broken open before the frogs since God does not change the nature of the world without reason. But when God comes down to perform a miracle, we are obligated to magnify Him as much as possible.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, it is OK to over exaggerate when speaking of God’s miracles!</i> But here Scripture proves their word. It is written, “And they shall come up and enter your house…” (Ex. 7:28) “Come up,” must mean from below to above. “In your house,” must mean, into the bed chamber of Pharaoh. Certainly the house of Pharaoh was made of alabaster, and if so it must be that the floor broke open before the frogs so that they could go up.

Paragraph 9

<b>כִּנִּים</b> <i><b>Kinim</b></i><b>, Lice</b> were the third plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗וֹ</b> “His Anger” - The soil turned to lice to a depth of one <i>amah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">An<i> Amah</i> is between between 18-22 inches</i> When they walked it was as if they were treading on lice the way one treads on grapes in a winepress. <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “Wrath” - Lice were on humans and animals and stung them like needles. The <i>Midrash</i> states that there were fourteen types of lice which the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians. The smallest of them were the size of a chicken egg and the largest was the size of a goose egg. There were fourteen types so that the Egyptians would know that this was not an ordinary plague, as the Egyptians said, “It is the finger of God.” (Ex.8:15) Rather it was <i>Yad HaShem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>Yad</i>, hand is equivalent to fourteen, “the hand of God,” that was brought upon them. Further, since Scripture states, “strike the dust of the earth, and it shall turn to lice…” (Ex. 8:12) it made known to us that the lice were swarming from their actual bodies since human beings are a combination of fire, wind, water and dust.</i>
3. <b>וָזַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation” - they scratched against their skin and the scratch caused boils that made wounds in their flesh.
4. <b>וְצָרָ֑ה</b> “Trouble” - It weakened their sight, as is said, confusion of the mind causes blindness. Confusion of clothing causes boils.<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">See Teshuvot haRashba part IV 326 . וגרסינן התם אמר שמואל: ערבוביא דרישא, מייתא לידי עורונא. ערבוביא דמני, מייתא לידי שעמומיתא. ערבוביא דגופה, מייתא לידי שיחני וכיבי. I have been unable to find the source for this statement in rabbinic literature.</i> 
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers.” - The lice entered into all their pots and dishes and in their food making them nauseous and causing them to vomit out their innards.

Paragraph 10

<b>עָרוֹב</b> <i><b>Arov</b></i><b>, A mixture of wild animals</b>, is the fourth plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗וֹ</b> “His anger” - Bears and lion would maim and kill them. <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “ Wrath” - Rabbi Yeshaia said: Why is this plague called <i>Arov</i>? Because it darkened the planetary lights. This darkness was not like the plague of darkness . Rather, there were birds that darkened the sky much as the locust darkened the sky. Or else,the people were so agitated that they ran in fear of the wild animals. They were like someone who was walking in a dark and slippery area. <br>
3. <b>וָזַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation.” When they<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">There is no mention of <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> indignation for this plague. However, this would appear to be a separate step - and it should appear here.</i> closed themselves in their homes because of the fear of the wild animals, it didn’t help them because God brought eagles and ravens and many types of birds that entered through the windows and the porches so that they could kill the Egyptians. <br>
4. <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> “Trouble” - When the wild animals left, not one of them remained behind, even those that they had killed and whose skins they had flayed were missing so that they would not benefit from the plague. <br>
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers” When the animals left they destroyed the earth with their footprints, making furrows, ditches, and pits on the roads and in the houses so that it was difficult to walk. In the fields they destroyed plowed areas, as Scripture states, “the land was ruined because of the animals.” (Ex. 8:20)

Paragraph 11

<b>דֶּבֶר <i>Dever</i>, pestilence</b> is the fifth plague in which God killed all types of domestic animals such as horses, donkeys, camels, cattle (cows), and herds (sheep). They died one after another so they were considered five plagues. For this plague, Scripture states, “then the hand of HaShem will strike…” (Ex. 9:3) This is difficult since regarding the other plagues it states, “finger of God,” why does it now say, “Hand of God?” But because this plague involved five species of animals it was considered like five plagues. This Is what the author of <i>Sefer Toldot Yitzchak</i><sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote"> Commentary on the Torah written around: 1475 - c.1535 A commentary explaining the simple and midrashic meaning of the text, most of the book's content can already be found in earlier works. (Sefaria)</i> writes.

Paragraph 12

<b>שְׁחִין</b> <i><b>Shechin</b></i><b>, boils</b> is the sixth plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗וֹ</b> “His anger.” - There was no one in all of Egypt who was not plagued by boils, as Scripture states, “It shall become a fine dust all over the land of Egypt, and cause an inflammation breaking out in boils on man and beast throughout the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 9:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">Note that Rabbi Foa often does not quote verses exactly as it appears in the Torah. It could be that he is writing from memory and he often is not exacting in his text.</i> Each person writhed in pain so that he or she was unable to treat others or place bandages on his neighbor’s wounds. <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “Wrath” - It is the way of boils to only be an eruption on a scab. But these also included blisters. <br>
3. <b>זַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation.” The plague of boils was unnatural. Generally, boils result from itching and sores when scabs appear on one's flesh. Once you remove the secretions one finds fresh flesh. The inflammations are a result of infections which appear between the skin and the flesh. Here, however, when scratching with their nails on the dry scabs, and uncovering the outer layer , they would find scabs beneath it with secretions. This is what the sages say in <i>Baba Kama Perek HaMirubeh</i> (Ch. 7)<i> : “</i>R. Joshua ben Levi said: the boils that the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians were moist on the outside and dry on the inside, as it is stated: “And it became a boil breaking out with oozing upon man and upon beast” (Ex. 9:10)<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">BT Baba Kama 80</i> <br>
4. <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> “Trouble” - The Egyptian magicians were unable to stand in Moses’ presence. While they couldn’t stand before Moses, they could stand before Pharaoh. But they felt even greater pain when Moses was present as a result of the boils. <br>
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers” - While all the other plagues lasted seven days or three weeks, this plague never left them until they died. This is what is written regarding boils, that they were unable to heal them. It is also stated in <i>Pirkei D’Rebbi Eliezer.</i>

Paragraph 13

Barad,  <b>ברד</b>  Hail is the seventh plague.<br>1.	<b>אַפּ֗וֹ </b>“His anger” - Thunder and lightning caused their heart to be overwhelmed and the Egyptians to become distressed. That is why Pharaoh said to Moses, “Plead with <i>HaShem </i>that there may be an end of God’s thunder and of hail and I will let you go...” (Ex. 9:28) Because of Pharaoh’s great fear his heart became overwhelmed.
2.	<b>עֶבְרָ֣ה </b>“Wrath” - The rain was so heavy that each drop of rain was equal to the  amount of water in a <i>Mikvah</i>, 40 Sea. The proof of this is what remained (of the rain) pending, as it states,  “No rain came pouring down upon the earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi no rain came pouring down upon the earth. לא נתך means [RAIN] DID NOT REACH the earth (i. e. no fresh rain came down) — that rain, too, which was already in the air at the moment when Moses was praying remained there and did not reach the ground.</i> (Ex. 9:33) The rain was called hailstones (<i>gav’eesh</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Ezekiel 38:23, <b>and great hailstones</b> They were hailstones that glisten like precious stones named גָּבִישּׁ, crystal, as the matter is stated (Job 28:18): “Coral and crystal (וְגָּבִישּׁ).” Our Sages said (Ber. 54b): עַל גַב אִישּׁ: Hailstones that started to fall on Egypt, and stood in the air over the man (עַל גַב אִישּׁ), Moses, who prayed that they not fall, as the matter that is stated (Exod. 9:33), לֹא נִתַּךְ אַרְצָה “[it] did not reach the ground.”</i> which then fell in the time of Joshua. It was bound up by a mighty storm. The sages presumed that the rain drops weighed <i>40 Seah,</i> as they have explained.
3.	<b>זַ֣עַם</b>  “Indignation” - At first there was rain, as is stated, “as <i>HaShem</i> rained down.” (Ex. 9:23) From the power of the wind it became hail, as Scripture states, “Storm wind that executes His command,” (Ps. 148:8) 
4.	<b>צָרָ֑ה  </b>“Trouble” - There was a burning fire within the hail so that the hail smashed trees and the fire burned them and dried them out. This is what the sages explained, “but the wheat and the emmer were not hurt, for they ripen late.” (Ex. 9:32) God caused wondrous things to them. But the real wonder was that the fire was within the hail, mixed together. Normally the trees would have damaged the wheat and the emmer but God caused this miracle (that it remained undamaged) This is explained by the author of Toldot Yitzchak.
5.	<b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים </b>“A band of deadly messengers.” - It is explained in the <i>Midrash</i> that since the hail was like a wall before the flocks, it blocked the flocks and they were unable to leave. The Egyptians said, “Woe to that person who allows the flock to be slaughtered without feeding his children.” When they slaughtered one of them and placed it on their shoulder (to take it away) a bird flew down and grabbed it from their shoulder (and flew away), as is stated, “Just as the children of sparks  fly upward.” (Job 5:7)

Paragraph 14

ארבה, <b>Arbeh</b>, Locust is the eighth plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗וֹ</b> His anger” - The sages explained that there were so many locust, the land was too narrow to contain them - so much so that they couldn’t see the earth. <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “Wrath” - They also weren’t able to see the sky (above them) - this is <i>Ein kol ha’aretz</i> (Ex. 10:15)<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote"> See Ibn Ezra on Exodus 10:15</i> And as a result they stumbled when they tried to walk. <br>
3. <b>זַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation,” - They ate all the plants and all the fruits. <br>
4. <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> “Trouble,” - When the locust could no longer find anything else to eat, they began to consume the Egyptians. That is why Pharaoh said, “Plead with <i>HaShem</i> your God that He remove this death from me.” (Ex, 10:17) This implies that the Egyptians were dying because of the locust. <br>
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers” - There were no locust left within the borders of the land of Egypt, even the locust that were pickled or cooked which they had before hand…

Paragraph 15

<b>חֹ֖שֶׁךְ</b> Darkness was the ninth plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗וֹ</b> “His anger” - people could not see their fellow for three days , but if they were sitting, they could stand, or if they were standing they could sit down. <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “Wrath” - For the next three days they could not even stand up from their place. <br>
3. <b>זַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation,” - They were hungry and thirsty because they could not eat or drink. <br>
4. <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> “Trouble,” - They did not lose their senses but were aware of what was happening. <br>
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers,” - They could hear the Israelites entering and searching their homes so that they were afraid they were robbing them of the wealth.

Paragraph 16

<b>מַכַּת בְּכוֹרוֹת The death of the first born</b> was the tenth plague. First we will explain why this plague was worse than all the others, so that it was the culmination and Pharaoh agreed to let the Israelites leave. If it was because of the death that occurred during the plague of the first born, weren’t there many who died during the other plagues? <br>However, at first God sent a message to Pharaoh, saying, “Israel is my first born.” (Ex, 4:22) When Pharaoh heard this, he said to Moses, “You are a liar! For even if you can prove that your God is the God of all gods, my god is the first born, and I and my people are his first born. Pharaoh continued with this assumption throughout all of the plagues until he saw that the Israelites took a sheep and tied it to their bedpost. Then, the Israelites slaughtered and roasted them, its aroma wafting (through the land), and then the Israelites threw its bones to the dogs. When the first born of Egypt were slaughtered, it became clear to Pharaoh that what Moses had said was true, and that the Israelites were the first born of the Blessed One and that Pharaoh could not prevent them from going to the wilderness to worship God since this is what God desired. <br>
We will now enumerate the five plagues that were included in this plague. <br>1. <b>אַפּ֗וֹ</b> “His Anger,” - First the firstborn of Egypt killed their fathers, as is stated in the <i>Midrash</i>. The firstborn went to their fathers and said, “Send these Hebrews away!” If not they will die.” Their fathers answered, "Even if all our first born die we will not send the Israelites out!” They said the same thing to Pharaoh, and he answered, “Break their legs.” The first born immediately drew their swords and they killed six hundred thousand of their fathers, as it says, “smiting Egypt by their first-born…” (Ex 136:10)<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">Tanchuma Buber Bo 18, <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 136:6</i> <br>
2. <b>עֶבְרָ֣ה</b> “Wrath,” - The death of the firstborn. <br>
3. <b>זַ֣עַם</b> “Indignation,” - Pharaoh rose up at night, and drew his sword, killing all his advisors and servants who advised him not to send the nation away. This is found in the <i>Zohar, Parsshat Shelach</i>, “When Pharaoh sent the nation forth,” What is written above it? “And Pharaoh arose in the night…” (Ex12:30) Come and see the supreme vengeance that the Holy One wreaked upon Egypt. There were three fatal plagues. One: the firstborn passed through the land of Egypt and killed whoever they found. Another: When the Holy, Blessed One, were killed at midnight. Another: When Pharaoh saw the plague in his house, among his sons and servants, he rose and armed himself and killed the commanders, officers, and all those who had advised him to refuse the people, - until the <i>Torah</i> testified against him that he rose at night precisely. Just as night killed and wreaked vengeance, so Pharaoh rose in the land of Egypt killing and wreaking vengeance upon his officers, commanders, supervisors and upon all those nobles as it is written, Pharaoh rose at night - night precisely - to kill and destroy. <sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar 2:28, Vo. 2 45a-b</i> <br>
4. <b>צָרָ֑ה</b> “Trouble,” If a woman was pregnant with her first born, the first born fetus would die along with the mother. This is found in <i>Midrash Rabbah</i>: “For when <i>HaShem</i> goes through to smite the Egyptians,” (Ex, 12:23) The word <i>ligof,</i> smite only means to cause a miscarriage of a pregnant woman, as Scripture states, “When men fight, and one of them pushes (<i>v’nagfu</i>), a pregnant woman and a miscarriage results ” (Ex. 21:22)<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Shemot Rabbah 17:5</i> In a house in which there was no first born the oldest child would die. <br>
5. <b>מִ֝שְׁלַ֗חַת מַלְאֲכֵ֥י רָעִֽים</b> “A band of deadly messengers,” Those who did not want the Israelites to leave also died (during this plague). This is also found in a <i>Midrash</i>: “It may be compared to a king who made a great celebration for his son… regarding the good people in Egypt who came and participated in the Passover meal with the Israelites and went out with them, as is stated, “Moreover, a mixed multitude went up with them,” (Ex. 12:38) Anyone who didn’t want the Israelites to be redeemed died with the firstborn, as is stated, “there was a loud cry in Egypt….” (Ex. 12:30)<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">Shemot Rabbah 18:10</i> It is possible that those who died were from other nations; none of the Egyptians wanted them to leave. They were even among the Egyptians who left with Israel. They were not Egyptians but from other nations (living among the Egyptians. Therefore, they were juxtaposed with one another.

Paragraph 17



Paragraph 18

<i><b>(Ilu)</b></i> These are the fifty plagues which afflicted the Egyptians in Egypt, in addition to the (primary) plagues. It is possible that Rabbis Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva were referring to others when they spoke of the forty and the fifty plagues. The way that the plagues are explained, that, “They were afflicted upon the Egyptians,” refers to all the plagues, all of which were evil. May God protect us from them and things like them! And after we have merited to have God help us find the fifty (plagues), we will now seek help to detail the number two hundred and fifty which struck them at the sea. May God remove blindness from the eyes of Arnon.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">An abbreviation for the authors name, Eliezer Nachman Foa</i> “And the tongue of the dumb shall shout aloud.” (Is. 35:6)
<i><b>(Bo)</b></i> Rabbi Yossi informs us that the magicians admitted that what Moses did was from God, and not a result of witchcraft, as they had first thought. They did not mean to suggest that the plague of lice alone was, “the finger of God,” but it was whatever punishments God brought upon them, even though they did not know how else God would smite them in the future. Therefore it is fitting to enumerate the fifty plagues at the sea. From these plagues Rabbis Eliezer and Akiva conclude that just as the plagues that struck them in Egypt were “ten primary plagues” and the derivatives, making up forty plagues<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Or fifty plague - I am not certain why he does not include this here.,</i>, or four derivatives for each primary plague, so too the plagues that struck them at the sea were fifty, each of which is made up of five derivatives. Before we specify them, we will preface them by proving that the Egyptians were plagued with all the punishments enumerated in <i>Torat Kohanim</i> (Leviticus) and in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (Deuteronomy). This is based on the verse, ““If you will heed <i>HaShem</i> your God diligently…then I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians.” (Ex 15:26) and it is also written, “But if you do not obey <i>HaShem</i> your God… then all these curses shall come upon you and take effect,” (Deut 28:15), singling the punishments out. It is as Moses said, “If you do not obey the voice of the Lord your God,” regarding the two hundred fifty plagues which God brought upon the Egyptians at the sea, and the fifty plagues that struck Egypt only these<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">Only these 250 plagues shall come upon Israel and not additional plagues. .</i> shall come upon you. Because God never punishes Israel more severely; even when God is angry He acts with compassion. Therefore, all the Reproofs<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tocheichah</i>, The portions of the Torah containing the curses or warnings that the Israelites will incur if they do not follow the commandments (Lev. 26 and Deut. 28).</i> that are mentioned there are included in the sicknesses of Egypt. If that is not so, then why say, All “All the diseases which I brought upon the Egyptians,I will not bring upon you…” for one might think, those I will not bring upon you but there are others that I will bring upon you. But the truth of the matter is that the diseases in Egypt are the ones which are now detailed.
(<i><b>Amnam</b></i>) The chastisements (<i>tokhechot</i>) mentioned in the <i>Torah</i> were meant to terrify the people of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus ch. 26 and Deuteronomy ch. 28 are referred to as <i>Tokhechot</i>, chastisements since they contain a list of punishments that Israel will endure if they fail to remain faithful to God’s teachings.</i> Some of the names of the chastisements the Egyptians experienced in Egypt were changed slightly according to the needs of the narratives, but they are basically the same. For instance, (in Deut.) it states, “<i>HaShem</i> will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth ....a nation whose language you do not understand.” (Deut. 28:49) In Egypt there were bears and lions, other types of wild animals, and birds that came during the plague of <i>Arov</i> which were a, “A ruthless nation, that will show the old no regard and the young no mercy. It shall devour the offspring of your cattle and the produce of your field.” (Deut. 28:50-51) If they closed the door of their houses, the wild animals would beat on them and break them down. “<i>HaShem</i> will drive you, and the king you have set over you, to a nation unknown to you or your fathers…” (Deut. 28:36) refers to Pharaoh who the Egyptians placed over themselves as is stated in the book of Chronicles,<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">This is probably not the biblical book of Chronicles but more likely the Midrash Divrei HaYamim Moshe Rabbeinu, a medieval work.

There are many other g examples like these even though the literal meaning doesn’t seem to agree with them. If we cannot identify them - the absence (emptiness) is our own! Based on all this we shall search out and explore (Lam. 3) this method to answer some of the questions logically based on the strength of the verses and the statements of the sages so that we can arrive at the 250 plagues which were brought on the Egyptians at the sea.
Further, one needs to believe that the Egyptians didn’t think about what would happen when they entered the sea and that the Egyptians did so without thought. For the Egyptians were extremely wise, Pharaoh most of all. But since the astrologists knew that Israel would leave under the star whose name was <i>Ra’a</i>, as Scripture states,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote">I have loosely translated the expression <i>Sh’ne’emar</i> and<i> Hayyinu D’Kativ</i>, both of which introduce a Biblical verse loosely throughout with this and related expressions.</i> “For evil (<i>Ra’a</i>) is before your face,” <sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">This is a literal translation. New JPS translation: “But he said to them, “HaShem be with you; the same as I mean to let your children go with you! Clearly, you are bent on mischief.”</i> (Ex. 10:10) then certainly Pharaoh would have also foreseen his and his people’s fate. When Pharaoh was told that the Israelites had fled, he gathered his people and chastised them in this matter, concluding that the Israeliteswere not worthy to leave Egypt. Even though God had performed signs and wonders that they had all seen, they trusted the pronouncement of Moses when he said, “I will bring but one more plague … upon Egypt…” (Ex. 11:1) They said, “Since he said, “One”, there are no more plagues with which to smite us. God has already finished showing us the extent of His power, much as evil Haman said, “God has already grown old!”<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">See Esther Rabbah 7:13 “Haman immediately said to them: ‘The God who drowned Pharaoh in the sea and performed miracles on behalf of Israel, and the mighty acts of which you heard, He is already old and is unable to do anything. Nebuchadnezzar has come and destroyed His Temple and burned His Sanctuary, has exiled Israel and dispersed them among the nations. Where is His power and His might now that He has grown old?”</i> As proof, (he said), “behold they are fleeing. If they were not afraid, they would have traveled more slowly, in the daytime and not at night, in a straight path and not in a crooked path.” Despite this, Pharaoh managed to be king of all the monarchs on the earth. He gathered 600 chariots from all the nations, besides the chariots of the Egyptians. His intention was to make sure all the heavenly princes were helping him, since each one would try to save his own nation. This number is stated in the <i>Zohar</i> as equal to the 600,000 Israelites who left Egypt. He then looked to see what would happen if he entered the sea. First he looked at the power of the One who was helping Israel. He saw the merit of Abraham, their elder, who was a man of great kindness toward them. Because they were his people, they were not smitten by any of the plagues which struck Egypt. This was not a matter of justice, but of kindness. It was possible that Abraham might help Israel and harm those who opposed them. Yet Pharaoh was certain that God would never bring another flood (because of the promise to Noah); based on this logic he had drowned the Israelite boys. Therefore, he said, “When the sea splits before them, my nation and I will pass through on foot...” Then Pharaoh contemplated the names of <i>hesed</i> which are equal to (three times) the numerical value of <i>Hesed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Kabbalah. The 72 Names of God consist of 72 (= <i>Hesed</i>, חסד) three-letter combinations each, and contains a total of 216 (= <i>Gevurah</i>, גבורה) letters. The name in its entirety is first mentioned in <i>Sefer HaYashar</i>, attributed to Rabbi <i>Akiva</i> (<i>Midrash Lekah Tov</i> on <i>BeShalach</i>). The 72 Names of God | Live Kabbalah</i> These letters equal 216. Pharaoh said, “Behold, the Israelites only stayed in Egypt 210 years and they were certain they could now flee because the Gematria of 210 equals <i>barah</i>, flee (counting the letters). But God would not be their help for 216 years. That is why Pharaoh took 600 chariots from all the nations as we have said. The chosen among them was wicked<i> Satan</i>, the central force who unites all those who oppose Israel. And with all this, Pharaoh also additionally brought the chariots of Egypt; that is, the magic and witchcraft which was associated with the decrees and supernal judgments, as we have said, Why are they called <i>kesafim</i> (witchcraft)? Because they contradict the heavenly entourage.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">See BT <i>Sanhedrin</i> 67b - Why is sorcery called <i>keshafim</i>? Because it is an acronym for: Contradicts the heavenly entourage [<i>shemakhḥishin pamalia shel mala</i>]. Sorcery appears to contradict the laws of nature established by God. Also see Rabbeinu Bachya 22:17</i> All of this was meant to protect Pharaoh and Egypt from the things that occur on dry land and on sea. Thus it is written, “He prepared his chariot and took his men with him.” (Ex. 14:6) This is not referring to an actual chariot, for it is not dignified for a king to prepare his own chariot. And if it was to make known the great hatred which upset the normal order of things as the commentators wrote, then we have already learned this from the story of <i>Balaam</i>, when he harnesses his own donkey. Rather, we learn that he made ready and connected all things to the powers of impurity. This explains the addition of the words <i>et richbo,</i> his chariot, “And he made ready his chariots.” (Ex. 14:6) The word <b>רִכְבּ֑</b> <i>Rikhb</i> <i>,</i> his chariot, which has the same gematria as the word <i>mazikin</i>, demons… The letter <i>Vav</i> of the word <b>רִכְבּ֑וֹ</b> is a pronoun as in His chariot, so it means “the demons that were in his domain.” Then it says, “And his people he took with him, in other words, he took them by using words to convince them to come. He told them not to be afraid to come with him because all the heavenly princes would help them,as has been mentioned, besides all the “chariots/demons'' of Egypt…”with officers in them,” as the Zohar states, “And teams of three, upon them all'' (Ex. 14:7) All in wisdom, corresponding to the supernal rungs, two and one.”<sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zohar,</i> Vol 2, 46a This is the Matt translation.

We will now explicate the fifty primary plagues at the sea that struck Egypt: 1. It is written<b>, “<i>HaShem</i> hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the Israelites.”</b> (Ex. 14:8) Rashi explains, “Pharaoh was in doubt whether to pursue or not, so God hardened his heart to pursue.” <sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Ex 14:8, Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 14:8:1</i> Therefore, God hardened his heart so he would pursue them. One wonders, what reason did Pharaoh have, after inciting his people, saying, “What is this we have done, releasing Israel from our service?” “Come with me and I will not behave with you as other kings. It is the way of other kings that their subjects go in front of them into the battle, but I will go in front of you…It is the way of other kings to have first pick of the booty, but I will be equal to you in the division of the booty.” <sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Ex. 14:6 Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 14:6:2</i> “And he made his chariots ready…” (Ex 14:6) “He himself.”<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Ex. 14:6 Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 14:6:1</i> After all of this trouble he would have reconsidered if the Holy One had not hardened his heart so he would pursue the Israelites. Rather, it teaches that the saying, “Cursed are you when you go out,” (Deut. 28:19) was established about him. In order to speed up the pursuit, the sages said, they tethered mares in front of male horses so that the male horses would want to overtake the mares and the mares would try to escape. In this way they would all run with all their might. They did not get far from the city when chariots began to break down because of the speed. Some of the chariots broke or were broken by neighboring chariots. Their weapons began to fall off; this was taken as an evil omen that they were masters of witchcraft. As a result their thoughts were divided. It arose in their minds to go back. Therefore, “HaShem hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he pursued the Israelites,” (Ex. 14:8) when he saw, “the children of Israel went out with a raised hand.” (Ex. Ibid) There was for Pharaoh, “ no end of scorn and provocation” (Est. 1:18) When the Egyptians saw their king lead them they too chose to pursue the Israelites. This was the first plague; there can be no doubt that it included more than five parts. There was not one of the Egyptians who did not experience confusion, trembling, or injury from the unnatural speed of the chariots. We do not find any <i>Midrashim</i> that inform us of the events that happened, and I was only able to describe some of the things that make sense. It is not our job to complete the task before God makes sense of it!
2. <b>“All the chariot horses of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his warriors overtook them encamped by the sea, near <i>Pi-hahiroth</i>, before <i>Baal-zephon</i>.” (Ex. 14:9)</b> In the Masoretic text<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic text refers to the authoritative version of the Hebrew Bible used universally by Jews today. This version was codified around the ninth century by a group of Jewish scholars known as the Masoretes, whose name derives from the Hebrew word <i>masorah</i>, meaning tradition.</i> of Baal-zephon appears (<i>haser</i>) defective<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Haser</i>, defective, is a technical term for writing a word without the letter vav.</i> twice and it is necessary.

The Tree of Life usually refers to the <i>Sefirah</i> of<i> Tiferet</i> and is also associated with the Hebrew letter <i>Vav.</i></i> This tells us that even this God, <i>Baal-zephon</i>, fell because of a lack of vitality. The numerical value of (בַּ֣עַל צְפֹ֔ן) is the same as shachav, שָׁכַב, lie down (322). We already learned that the Blessed One wanted to mislead Egypt so God had Israel camp out before them, that they might say, “That they should say that their god was a difficult one to overcome.”<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi on Exodus 14:2</i> In their certainty they began to pursue Israel because they said, “They have gone astray in the land; the wilderness has closed in on them.” (Ex. 14:3) When Egypt arrived there, they saw this god<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi, Exodus 14:2 - Baal-zaphon alone had been left by God of all the gods of Egypt and, this, too, in order to mislead them — that they should say that their god was a difficult one to overcome.</i> had also fallen, destroyed and broken into many pieces, just like the other gods, their faces fell and they didn’t have the strength to move from their place. They stood there and grieved. When Pharaoh saw that he would not receive help from this god, he drew Uzza<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Uzza</i> is a demon often associated with <i>Azazel</i>.</i> closer to battle for him. That is why the text says, “as Pharaoh caused to come near” (וּפַרְעֹ֖ה הִקְרִ֑יב) (Ex. 14:10) -rather, it says, Pharaoh drew near (ופרעה קרב )<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi Exodus 14:10,</i> He caused Uzza, the prince, to stand before God and argue Pharaoh’s case against Israel, saying, “These are idolaters and these are idolaters…” “The Israelites caught sight of the Egyptians advancing (נֹסֵ֣עַ) upon them.” (Ex. 14:10) It does not say <i>Nosi’im</i> (plural) but <i>Nosea</i> (singular). This refers to the prince of the Egyptians they saw advancing toward them while the Egyptians were standing in one place for a while. They were astonished at the sight,and powerless. For if that is not the case, why didn’t the Egyptians kill the Israelites when they overtook them at the sea? (See Ex. 14:9) Rather, it teaches that the Holy One did not want the Israelites to begin moving forth from their place until the Egyptians were next to them and the two nations were almost touching one another. This is similar to what God commanded David, “And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the <i>baca</i> trees, then go into action, for <i>HaShem</i> will be going in front of you to attack the Philistine forces. David did as <i>HaShem</i> had commanded…” (II Sam. 5:24-25) The sages said that the Philistines were so close that the swords reached Israel’s heads but David could not move until he heard the sound (of marching. So too here, when the Egyptians overtook them, they were terrified by the fact that the gods they had trusted were destroyed. They stood there not knowing what to do and Israel did not begin moving. But when the Egyptians saw Uzza before them they began pursuing the Israelites. They went forth from their place and pursued them.
3. “<b>The angel of God, who had been going ahead of the Israelite army…Thus there was the cloud with the darkness, and it lit up the night.”</b> (Ex. 14:19-20) There was darkness for the Egyptians and light for the Israelites. The darkness was a little like the darkness that afflicted Egypt (during the plagues), in which a person could not see his fellow. Similarly, all the other plagues affected Israel for seven days but the plague of darkness only affected Egypt for six days. For 3 days, a person could not see his fellow and for 3 days they could not rise from their place; the seventh day was at the sea. During the darkness at the sea, the Egyptians could not see one another but they could see the Israelites for the person sitting in darkness can see the one who is sitting in light. They began shooting arrows and catapulting rocks but the cloud of glory caught them. In other words, when they reached the cloud, the rocks and arrows weakened and fell. It might be that because they saw this they began killing each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly because the arrows and rocks fell from the sky on them.</i> One might think that it was because of the darkness that they did not come closer to one another, they were traveling all night but they didn’t get any closer to each other. It is the nature of things that they could not see the path they were traveling on, like drunk people screaming in the Egyptian camp, either because they were injured or because of the failure of their fellows. According to the sages, “so that one could not come near the other all through the night.” (Ex. 14:20) This means, “The ministering angels wanted to sing their song<b>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">BT Megillah 10b, Sanhedrin 39b The angels would sing to each other, but God did not allow them to do so.</i></b> It is possible, “This one to this other,”as it is said, “This is my God and I will adore him.” (Ex. 15:2) The angel here is the redeeming angel. While on all other nights they come closer, on that night they did not come closer. Therefore on that night the administering angels did not sing their song. Understand this!
4. <b>“<i>HaShem</i> drove the sea back with a strong east wind all that night…” (Ex. 14:21</b>) The wind confused and stupefied them until they didn’t know where they were, as if they were blind. So wrote the <i>Baal HaTurim</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob ben Asher (1270-1340) was an influential Medieval rabbinic authority. He is often referred to as the Ba'al ha-Turim after his main work in halacha, the <i>Arba'ah Turim</i>. Jacob ben Asher - Wikipedia</i> The word <b>וַיּ֣וֹלֶךְ “</b>God drove back” appears four times in the Masoretic text: “HaShem drive the sea back” (Ex. 14:21) “And he led them to Samaria,” (II Kings 6:19) regarding Elisha when God struck the servants of the king of Aram with blinding light. <i>Hizkuni</i> also wrote that they were not affected until they entered the sea following the Israelites and the servants of the king of Aram were stricken with confusion. This implies that the blindness did not strike them only because of darkness which we have mentioned because it happened in the light of day. If that was so there (in the case of Elisha) so here when the light was shining they could have seen one another bot they were confused because of the mighty wind as was mentioned. There are, here, there was blindness, confusion, an inability to find their way and other plagues.
5. <b>“The Egyptians came in pursuit…”</b> (Ex. 14:23) <i>Siftei Kohen</i><sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen (1621–1662) a noted 17th century talmudist and halakhist. He was known as the <i>Shakh</i>, an abbreviation of his most important work, <i>Siftei Kohen</i> on the Shulchan Aruch. Shabbatai HaKohen - Wikipedia . However this would mean that he was extremely young at the time. Possibly there was another work with a similar name.</i> writes, The Egyptians tried to overcome Israel with all their might but were unable to do so. They were very distressed to see Israel moving slowly along; the Egyptians were running yet they could not overtake them. They tried to cut them off in order to get ahead of them. But they were unable to do so because the water was a wall to their right and left. Therefore, Scripture states, “came in pursuit after them.” (Ex. 14:23) Did we not know all this; yet it comes to teach that the Egyptians were behind them against their own will and desire. There was further trouble (for the Egyptians): The Egyptians recognized their silver and gold that had been in their hands. There is an allusion to this in the words <b>כֹּ֚ל ס֣וּס פַּרְעֹ֔ה</b> “Every horse of Pharaoh;” The abbreviation of these words is <i>kesef</i> <b>כֶּ֣סֶף</b>. In other words, they chased the Israelites for the money that Israel had taken from them. Further, they tripped as they chased the Israelites and fell on their faces. For the sea became a smooth highway for the Israelites, as Scripture states, “He led them through the deep as through a wilderness.” (Ps. 106:9) This was because the sea was higher than the land, “He summons the waters of the sea, And pours them over the land” (Am. 9:6) But it was also deep like an abyss. This was because part was high above them like a tent, as Scripture states, “You have pierced the skull with war,” (Hab 3:14) <sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael</i> 14:15:2</i> Also the abbreviation of, <b>אֶת־הַיָּ֖ם לֶחָרָבָ֑ה</b> “He turned the sea into dry ground,” (Ex. 14:21) is ,<b>אֹ֖הֶל</b>, <i>ohel</i>, tent. There was the water (above them) that was not frozen and beneath the sea, the ground turned hardened and frozen, as Scripture states, “The deeps froze in the heart of the sea.” (Ex. 15:8) It would appear that the Israelites had water at their sides and above them, and beneath them they had a road of ice like a straight pathway. When the Israelites passed over it it broke into pieces but when the Egyptians traveled on it they were injured by the blocks of ice and were broken. As a result there were a number of plagues here: they were running but they couldn’t catch up to the Israelites, they were unable to cut the Israelites off, they saw their wealth as mentioned, they fell while running and they stumbled.
6. <b>“The horses of Pharaoh, with his chariots and horsemen, went into the sea;”</b> (Ex. 14:23) We must say that the Egyptians were not yet in water for afterwards, Scripture states, “Then Moses held out his arm over the sea and <i>HaShem</i> drove back the sea,” (Ex. 14:21) This implies that until that time the waters did not return. If so, it must have appeared to them as if they were drowning in the sea in the way that we shall explain, with God’s help. At first, they knew that they would be walking on dry land just like the Israelites. Then it seemed to everyone that the water had come back and covered the entire Egyptian encampment except for Pharaoh; they thought everyone else had drowned. That is how Scripture reads, “The Egyptians came in pursuit and they came after them, all of Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen, into the sea.” (Ex. 14:23) “Into the sea,” are superfluous, and should be interpreted according to what is written before. “All of Pharaoh’s horses,” is attached to what is stated before, “They came after them,” that is, after the Israelites. It appeared to Pharaoh that he alone was still pursuing the Israelites, and that the chariots and horses of the Egyptians were (drowning) in the sea. Similarly, to the chariots it appeared that the horses were (drowning) in the sea. So too : רִכְבּ֖וֹ, “His chariot,” appears to be separated from the other details But there is a <i>zakef katon</i> on the word, “Pharaoh,” as if it were attached to, “After them,” as was mentioned and the rest of the verse attached to, “Into the sea.” There is also a <i>tipchah</i> on the word רִכְבּ֖וֹ, “His chariot,” which is a separating cantillation as if it is connected to Pharaoh. The word, “His horse,” also, as has been mentioned.<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear to me how Rabbi Foa is reading this verse - also there does not appear to be a<i> zakef katan</i> or a<i> tipchah</i> in the standard <i>tikkun.</i> However it would appear that he is reading the verse as follows: <b>“The Egyptians came in pursuit, all of Pharaoh’s horsemen, into the sea; his (Pharaoh’s) chariot came after them” based on the grammar</b>.</i> All of the Egyptians were troubled and aggrieved: Pharaoh was grieved because he could not use witchcraft to control the events that happened when they left Egypt, saying, “Where will I carry my shame? (II Sam. 13:13) Behold every chariot driver and horse has died for me, similar to what God said of Sannherib!” Therefore, when he was the only one who was saved from the sea, he could not find it in his heart to return to Egypt because of the shame, and he went to Nineveh instead. His soldiers and chariot drivers were grieving because they heard that Pharaoh had pursued the Israelites and had said to them, “I will pursue, I will overtake.” (Ex. 15:9) “Certainly he saw this with his astrologers.” The soldiers overtook them in the sea,” (Ex. 14:23) thinking, I will overtake them and divide up the booty. They too were grieved when they saw the sons, and brothers, and friends drowned.
7. “<b>All the horses</b><sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Note the noun is written in the singular (sus) and not the plural even though it implies many horses. This is crucial to understanding the interpretation here.</i><b>of Pharaoh.”</b> (Ex. 14:23) The word “All” is meant to add or increase something beside what we have already stated. It appeared that all of the horses had water over their heads, and that they were also drowning. Horses swim on the surface of the water so that their heads are out of the water. If someone is riding on the horse he is strengthened and is not afraid when the horse enters the water, he knows that he will go with it. When one sees the head of the horse still has hope of surviving. But if the horse's head goes under he is out of luck. Therefore, when the verse states “All the horse of Pharaoh,”<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote"> The verse should be read according to this interpretation, “the entire horse of Pharaoh.”</i> it means that even its heads went under the water. The same is implied about “his chariot and riders.” When the Egyptians saw that they were drowning, they began to yell to Pharaoh and say, “Save us because the water has reached our neck.” (Ps.69:2) “Save us as you promised.” Then Pharaoh and his magicians began to perform magic according to what is written in their books. This is alluded to by the abbreviation,<b>ס֣וּס פַּרְעֹ֔ה רִכְבּ֖וֹ וּפָרָשָׁ֑יו</b>, “Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen” which spells <b>סַפְּרו , “</b>his book.” Nothing helped them because the hand of God was intent on their destruction and desolation. When the Egyptians saw that nothing was helping them they began to curse their gods , and to pull out their hair and devour their own limbs. This is alluded at in the verses in the Reproofs; the words <b>פַּרְעֹ֔ה רִכְבּ֖וֹ וּפָרָשָׁ֑יו</b> , “Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen'' have the same gematria (numerical value) as <b>אִ֥ישׁ בְּשַׂר־זְרֹע֖וֹ יֹאכֵֽלוּ “</b>Each devoured the flesh of his own kindred” (Is. 9:19) come and see how many ways they were smote in this plague; even more so when suddenly they lost their hope of magic.<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">The Gematria does seem to add up here!</i>

Gematria is not an exact system of math….</i> Therefore, it is written afterwards, “Then <i>HaShem</i> said to Moses, “Hold out your arm over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians…” (Ex 14:26) Since it says, <b>וְיָשֻׁ֤בוּ</b> “May come back,” it implies that the water had already covered them and now God sent the waters back again. Then the Egyptians were happy and calmed. But their happiness did not last because God “looked down” (for evil) “upon the Egyptian army from a pillar of fire.” The <i>Mechilta</i>: “The pillar of cloud descended and made the sea-bed clay, and the pillar of fire made it so hot that the horses' hooves fell off.” <sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mechilta D’Rebbe Ishmael</i> 14:24</i> “And the pick of his officers are drowned in the Sea of Reeds.” (Ex. 15:4) That is close to the shore where there is no mud but rather sand. According to the laws of nature this is not a place where one would naturally drown. This is also written in the <i>Tanchuma.</i> Further, groups of them drown in the mud, So the sages said, ”Since they, “made our lives bitter with mortar and bricks,” so you led their horses into mud. But the Holy One did not kill them there but rather God gave them strength and grieved them. This is five more plagues: mud, their horses hoofs were cut off, the officers drowned in a place where there was no mud, their feet were stuck in the dry land, and God looked down on them for evil.
9. <b>“A pillar of fire and a cloud,”</b> (Ex. 14:24) The cloud was so thick and heavy that the Egyptians thought from moment to moment that it would descend on them and absorb them. This also happens to travelers when daylight suddenly darkens because of thick clouds, and they become frightened lest they be swallowed up. That cloud has no limits and there is thunder, lightning, and powerful waves associated with it. Terrible things happen to people who experience this while traveling. I myself had such an experience!!
10. <b>“And threw the Egyptian army into panic.”</b> (Ex. 14:14) It caused panic and confusion. They could not find their deputies so that the Egyptian army did not know what to do. <i><b>Peirush</b></i>: At first they followed their encampments, princes at the lead, deputies in the middle, and all of them in order, according to the plain meaning, “with officers in all of them.” (Ex. 14:7) They were thrown into a panic and confusion, the people in a tumult. Authority was taken from the leaders and the deputies so that all of the Egyptians did not know what to do, whether to go back or to pursue without any plan. There are five plagues here: panic, confusion, losing their leaders, fleeing, and stumbling.
11. <b>This tumult caused faintness of heart</b> (Lev. 26:36) Combined with the cold and strong wind that blew on that night, their blood froze until they were afflicted with the consumption that comes before a fever. It is known that the consumption causes vomiting, stomach and intestinal pain. As they trembled from the cold, their bones broke and all of them were afflicted. This is hinted at in the expression, “the Egyptian army,” suggesting that it increased everywhere.
12. <b>“God took off the wheels of their chariots,”</b> (Ex. 14:25) <i>Mechilta:</i> “Rabbi Yehudah says: Because of a fire on high caused the wheels below to burn, chariots axles continued turning the chariots toward the sea, the chariot being filled with silver, gold, precious gems and pearls for Israel to take as spoil. Rabbi Nechemiah says: Because of the thunder on high, the pivots below flew off, “The rumble of your thunder caught the wheel; lighting lit the world," (Ps 77:19) , and the axles and the chariots ran by themselves. In the past, the horses would pull the chariots. Now, the chariots were pulling the horses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mechilta DeRebbe Yishmael</i>, Ex 14:25</i> There were three plagues here: the breaking of the chariots, moving of their own volition, and the loss of the wealth they were carrying with them.
13. <b>“So that He caused them to move forward וַֽיְנַהֲגֵ֖הוּ with difficulty/heaviness.”</b> (Ex. 14:25) Since it does not say “so that they moved <b>וַֽיְנַהֲגֵ֖וּם</b> with difficulty/heaviness,” it comes to teach that He caused them to move backwards toward their first leader who led the camps of Egypt with seriousness, ’ that is, because of the warmth of the fire and their traveling, fever overcame them… For it is stated in the Reproofs, “Will smite you with… inflammation, with scorching heat. ” (Deut. 28:2) These are different types of fevers. Inflammation <b>דַּלֶּ֗קֶת</b> is a higher fever than regular fever <b>קַּדַּ֜חַת</b>. In Deuteronomy they are threatened with it. Scorching heat, <b>חַרְחֻר֙</b> is a sickness that includes two different types (of inflammation) and there is no cure because what helps one hurts the other. It is called <b>חַרְחֻר֙</b> from the expression, “for kindling strife.” (Pr. 26:21) It is known that one who has a fever has many pains, especially when he has several different types of fevers as mentioned.
14. Further: <b>“So that God caused Him to move forward…”</b> (Ex. 14:25) refers to wicked Samael as mentioned. When he saw that his authority had been removed (from the Egyptians), he no longer wanted to go with them and he was forced to move forward with them with great difficulty when he saw the judgments that was brought upon their celestial prince. This made him reason with a <i>Kal Vachomer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote"><i> A Fortiori</i> argument: A <i>kal vachomer</i>, literally "lenient and strict" derives one law from another through the following logic: If a case that is generally strict has a particular leniency, a case that is generally lenient will certainly have that leniency. The argument can also work in reverse, and also in areas where <i>lenient</i> or <i>strict</i> might not be precisely applicable. (Wikipedia) The kal vachomer appears to be if, Sama’el the celestial prince of Esau failed to help the Egyptians when own prince failed then surely he would not be able to assist his own nation of Edom. Edom is often associated in Midrash with Rome and With Christendom.</i> for the future: For him, too, would come the cup (of retribution) as is written, “I will show him wondrous deeds as in the days when You went forth from the land of Egypt.” (Mic. 7:15) This caused great pain to the Egyptians who put their trust in Samael, for the nation could not be victorious except through the strength of the celestial prince of Esau, who is none other than Samael. “and I will break your proud glory…. so that your strength shall be spent to no purpose,” (Lev. 26:20)
15. <b>They were smitten by terrible boils/ hemorrhoids</b> on their knees and legs. They were called ‘boils of Egypt’ (Deut. 28:27)<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 28:27 - This interpretation is based on this verse: “<i>HaShem</i> will strike you with the Egyptian inflammation (<i>shechin Mitzrayim</i>), with hemorrhoids, boil-scars, and itch, from which you shall never recover.” Note that the written text is <i>ofalim</i> while the pronounced text is <i>techorim</i>. Both mean hemorrhoids; but the word in the written text is not read because it was considered to be a vulgar word. See Tigay, The JPS Torah commentary on Deuteronomy.</i> because they did not heal until the day of one’s death. It seems that they were healed on that day. This must be the case; were it not, when the chariot wheels came off, as was stated, and their bodies were so afflicted, they would have had to travel on foot, if they were able. But if they were afflicted with boils on their legs and knees, from the sole of their feet to their heads, they would have had to hold on to the sides of the chariots. They would not have been able to rub their hands on it without having even more pain. There are five plagues here: The boils would have appeared in four places as they are counted in the Reproofs (<i>tochechah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">Reproofs or Tokhecha is used throughout this commentary It refers to the chapters in Leviticus chapter 26 and Deuteronomy chapter 28 that contain the curses and warnings for Israel lest they disobey God.</i> . It also refers to the pain of the scabs, just as we found in the book of Job, that it was necessary for him to take potsherds to scratch his wounds. This was a plague unto itself.
16. <b>Their legs were afflicted with hemorrhoids טְּחֹרִ֔ים.</b> This is what happens to those who travel during the summer months - they develop a type of dry scab between their thighs that is painful. The Egyptians were afflicted with these. This appeared not only on the thighs but on the opening of the rectum where they became hemorrhoids. That is why in the Reproofs (In Exodus and Deuteronomy) boils of Egypt are connected with scabs and itches. There is no doubt that swelling on the legs was a natural occurrence among those who travel. They continue to grow until they become a plague. Thus, the sages state in the <i>Mekhilta</i>: "Confounding" is plague, viz. (Deut 7:23) "And He will confound them with great confusion until they are destroyed."<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mekhilta DeRebbe Yishmael</i> 14:24</i> Thus, there are plagues here: scabs between one’s thighs, hemorrhoids in one’s rectum, some of which were opened and some of which were closed, some on the inside of the rectum and some on the outside, and all of them infected. There are also dry legs and bubonic plague<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">Literally it says the plague of the plague. This is a surmise on my part.</i> .
17. <b>“<i>HaShem</i> will let loose against you confusion… and frustration,”</b> (Deut 28:20) Rashi explains that <b>הַמְּאֵרָ֤ה -</b> means “paucity,” as in “a fretting leprosy (ממארה).”(Lev. 13:51) <sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">A leprosy that wears away the flesh, thus attenuating it.</i> It teaches that these plagues made the flesh heavy until those who were in their homes were imprisoned until a surgeon cut away the dead flesh. Further it states, <b>מְּהוּמָה֙</b>, this confusion was the confusion of loud and shocking noises, besides the sounder of thunder. <b>הַמִּגְעֶ֔רֶת</b> is similar to what is written, “He sent His blast against the Sea of Reeds,” (Ps. 106:9) The blast was so terrifying that the people were silenced like mutes.
18. <b>“Egypt said, “I will flee from the Israelites,” (Ex. 14:25)</b> Since it does not say, “The Egyptians said,” it might refer to Egypt’s celestial prince who is also called Egypt. He said, “I will flee from Israel Saba <sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">Literally Old man Israel. Usually refers to the <i>Sefira of Tiferet</i>. This <i>Sefira</i> is also associated with the tetragrammaton, the four letter name of God</i> because God (<i>HaShem</i>) is fighting for those who have entered my territory. <b>“For <i>HaShem</i> is fighting for them against Egypt <i>(Bi’Mitzrayim</i>).</b>” <b>“Against (b’) Egypt;''</b> that is, “Because of Egypt,” in other words “because of me.” Scripture doesn’t state, “ for them because of me <i>(b’shevili</i>),” to leave room for the other of the interpretations. The <i>Mechilta</i> states: The wicked ones said, “We must flee before Israel because we are being afflicted and aggrieved; now we are even doubly aggrieved,”<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon Ben Yochai</i> 14:23</i> it is necessary for us to flee before Israel since it may appear to them as if we have sinned against them. Pharaoh is the one sinned when he commanded us to subjugate them. Since we afflicted them it is necessary to flee from them lest we add to their subjugation. Further, “I will flee before the Israelites,” teaches us that when the Egyptians saw the face of an Israelite they were afraid as if they were looking at the face of a lion. This was measure for measure. Just as they made themselves appear to the Israelites like bears or lions as mentioned above, now they changed and were afraid of the Israelites. They fulfilled Scripture, “Your foes shall dominate you. You shall flee though none pursues.” (Lev. 26:17) …
19. <b>“For <i>HaShem</i> is fighting for them,”</b> (Ex. 14:25) God is too powerful for celestial princes. For the Egyptians said, if the prince of Israel who is one of the celestial princes, and is like our prince, we might be able to succeed over them. For the celestial prince of Egypt had many to help him, and even more, Israel would be judged by a heavenly court as to whether it would succeed or fail. This Heavenly court is made up of the seventy celestial princes of the nations, most of whom have claims against Israel. Now that they saw that God was fighting for them in Egypt, how many would be inclined for them?
20. <b>“Fighting for them,”</b> (Ex. 14:25) For those who came to fight against the Egyptians in the land of Egypt, for God is aiding them. For when the other nations around Egypt saw that the Egyptians were pursuing (Israel) they gathered and came to plunder the city, fulfilling for them, “<i>HaShem</i> will bring a nation against you from afar,” (Deut. 28:49) They are described as “far” because though they were close to Egypt, they were far from this knowledge and they “issue of your womb and the produce of your soil, your new grain and wine and oil, the calving of your herd and the lambing of your flock.” (Deut. 24:25)
21. <b>“Is fighting for them because of Egypt.”</b> (Ex. 14:25) <i>Mekhilta</i>: this teaches that the people in Egypt were afflicted just like the people at the sea. God lifted up the land of Egypt so they could see one another and in that way everyone could feel sorry for himself and for his neighbor; the fathers for the son and the sons for the fathers; the wives for their husbands and their husbands for their wives, and for all their relatives.
22. The pregnant women miscarried after seeing their husbands drown in the sea and afflicted by all types of plagues. These words of Scripture were fulfilled through them, “Cursed shall be the issue of your womb.” (Deut. 28:16) Also, “Your sons and daughters shall be delivered to another people, while you look on; and your eyes shall strain for them constantly.” (Deut. 28:32) There are five plagues here: women will experience birth pangs, it will happen prematurely, they shall miscarry, their sons and daughters will be taken captive, their eyes shall weaken because they have no savior.
23. <b>“And the Egyptians fled at its approach.”</b> (Ex. 14:27) <i>Mekhilta:</i> Wherever the Egyptians fled, the waters pursued them.<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon Ben Yochai Ex. 14</i> <i>Peirush</i>: Do not think that they lost their minds and were so terrified that even though there were other places for them to flee, they still ran into the water. Rather they had clear minds but God caused them to stand so that they would feel even greater pain from the plagues. They tried fleeing away from the water, but the water surrounded them. It might have been that this happened only on one side, (but not so); rather to whichever side they turned, they encountered water. If they fled to the east, the water came towards them; if they turned the other way the water came toward them, It then left open ways for them to flee and when they went, the water surrounded them and the water would surround them and come towards them.
24. <b>“But <i>HaShem</i> hurled (<i>vayina’er</i>) the Egyptians….”</b> (Ex. 14:24) <i>Mekhilta</i>: When one stirs up (<i>yina’er</i>) a pot, the ones on top go to the bottom and the ones on the bottom come up to the top. (God did this) in order to increase their agony. Another interpretation: God gave them the strength of youth in order that they continue to receive punishment. God did this for all the plagues so that they wouldn’t die from the plagues. Another: he put them in the hands of young and cruel angels, as Scripture states, “Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him,” (Pro. 17:11) and “They die in their youth…” (Job 36:14) In <i>Minchah Bilulah<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">Porto, Abraham Menahem ben Jacob ha-Kohen 1520 - after 1594</i>,</i> the author writes that since the people knew how to swim, he stirred up the water so that their feet were up and their heads were down, so they were unable to swim. I have written that he took some of them and stirred up others. How so? Pharaoh “took 600 of his picked chariots,” (Ex 14:7). He 216 of them to fight the powers of God’s great name, from the verses וַיִּסַּ֞ע “He traveled,” (Ex. 14:19), וַיָּבֹ֞א “He came” (Ex. 14:20), וַיֵּ֨ט “He stretched out his arm,” (Ex. 14:21) these add up to 216 letters, and שפ"ד, <i>Shaf”ad.<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shapad,</i> שפ"ד, adds up to 384 together with 216 they equal 600. <i>Shapad</i> is equal to the word Egypt if one adds the letters minus the letter <i>yud</i>.</i></i> What did God do? First He killed the celestial prince of Egypt, as is stated, “Horse and driver He has hurled into the sea,” (Ex.15:1) This is written in the singular.<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, first God killed the one celestial prince of Egypt.</i> First he lifted him high up and then cast him down into the abyss of the sea. Now all that remained were the lees, adding up to 215. All of them drowned in the Reed Sea, as is written, “Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea.” (Ex 15:4) All that remained were שפ"ד who were called שפוד <i>shippud,</i> a skewer, that is, the thing that held them all together and served as a kind of skewer. God began to mix them up with the other 216 who were mentioned in the sea. It is written, “I will incite Egyptian against Egyptian…” (Is. 19:2) <i>Mitzraim</i>, Egypt, along with the letters in Gematria equals <i>shapad</i> (384) so that all of them were destroyed
25. <b>“But <i>HaShem</i> hurled the Egyptians into the sea.”</b> (Ex. 14:24) We have seen in the <i>Midrash</i> that the Egyptians performed magic so that they rose out of the sea but God threw them back in. Further, the author of <i>Keli Hemda</i><sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote"> Possibly, Samuel ben Avraham Laniado (d. 1605), Syrian rabbi, biblical commentator, and preacher, known from the title of most of his works as <i>Ba'al ha-Kelim</i>. Laniado was a grandson of Samuel Laniado who settled in Adrianople after the expulsion from Spain.</i> writes that the Egyptians held on to the Israelites and said, “If they are saved we will be saved!” But the Holy One shook them off as one shakes dust off one’s garment, and in this way they fell into the sea. It is possible that the clinging was not actual but it was a result of magic. Furthermore, they melted into the water, so that they mixed, water in water. That is what is stated, “The waters turned back and covered the chariots and the horsemen, all Pharaoh’s army... ” (Ex. 14:28) It does not say, “All Pharaoh army,” but, “ To all Pharaoh’s army.” In other words, the chariots and horsemen that had become water covered the army of Pharaoh. Just as their heads led them in their life so they led them to their death. They returned to life similar to what happened to Titus,<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Titus was not only responsible for the destruction of the second Temple but committed the ultimate sin by entering the holy of holies. There are many versions of the story of how he was punished, including that a gnat flew into his ear and remained in his brain, driving him mad!</i> may his bones crumble, who is created anew each day and then burns and becomes ash again.
26. <b>“The waters turned back and covered…”</b> (Ex. 14:28) I have heard from sages who wrote this prominently, that (the waters that drown the Egyptians) was the same water that was used to drown the Israelite children, from the Nile River. That very water now came back to punish the Egyptians and fulfill what they had said, “<i>HaShem</i> is greater than all gods, yes, by the result of their very schemes against [the people].” (Ex 18:21) “For in the pot with which they boiled others, they were boiled.” In <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> it states, “וְיָשֻׁ֤בוּ הַמַּ֙יִם֙, “The waters came back,’ is stated in the plural and not the singular,<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states <i>Vayashuvu Hamayim</i> instead of <i>Vayashev Hamayim.</i></i> implying that all the waters of the world overtook the Egyptians. The most essential waters came from four rivers; The Nile which is called Pishon, Gihon, Hidekel, and Perat<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Hidekel and Perat are the Tigris and Eurpharates.</i> as well as the waters that were already present. There are five bodies of water here, each of which is different from the others. There are those that are warm, others that are frigid, those that flood, and those that are turbid, and those that are salty. Each one causes its own special suffering separate from the other. Each smote the Egyptians.
27. <b>“They covered the chariots and the horsemen.”</b> (Ex.14:28) The <i>Tzror HaMor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham Saba (1440–1508) was a preacher in Castile who became a pupil of Isaac de Leon. Abraham Saba - Wikipedia</i> writes that until now the horses swam on the surface of the water, but now the waters came back and covered them. Further, since it say, לְכֹל֙ חֵ֣יל פַּרְעֹ֔ה “For Pharaoh’s entire” army when it could have said כֹל֙ חֵ֣יל פַּרְעֹ֔ה “Pharaoh’s entire army,” it teaches that the chariots and horsemen were turned over by the surge of the water, similar to what was already been said about the water. This is what was stated, “And I will heap your carcasses upon your lifeless fetishes.” (Lev. 26:30) - they are the feet. The word<i> Et</i> implies the inclusion of two things, after the waters covered the army of Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states, וְנָֽתַתִּי֙ אֶת־פִּגְרֵיכֶ֔ם the word et is also meant to be inclusive of something - in this case the two legs of the Egyptians</i>
28. <b>“Not one of them remained.” (</b>Ex. 14:28)<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">The strange formation of the words could be translated - Nothing remained even until one.</i> It does not say “Not one among them remained,” to teach us that not a single limb of the Egyptians remained unafflicted. When it said <b>עַד־אֶחָֽד</b> “there did not remain even one” when it could have stated “there did not remain among them one,” it implied when afflicted their limbs God did not begin with the main limbs, first, so that the other limbs remained unconscious and unfeeling the pain of the plagues. Rather each and every limb was afflicted until they reached the one upon which a person is most dependent. Some of the sages state that this means that no one remained except for Pharaoh so that he might see the power of the Blessed One. Or else, so that he might see that God sent His own messenger, Moses. That is why only Pharaoh remained of all the firstborn of Egypt during the plague of the first born.
29. <b>“But the Israelites had marched through the sea on dry ground,”</b> (Ex. 14:26) This is written another time: “And the Israelites went into the sea on dry ground,” (Ex. 14:22) The reason for the repetition is, to teach us that despite the Egyptians being drowned in the sea and being turned upside down by the powerful waters, they saw the Israelites marching through the dry ground. God gave the Egyptians the power to see this to increase their suffering. They would see the great love for Israel by God and would be humiliated by what God did for them. Among the thing (they saw) was the Israelites eating and drinking as they marched along. Thus, it is written in the <i>Mekhilta</i>: The Israelites ate and drank and rejoiced (as they walked through the sea). God caused fresh water to come out from the salty water,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">See M<i>ekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael</i> 14:16:1, <i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Ishmael</i> 14:15, 15:8</i> as it says, “He brought forth streams from a rock…” (Ps. 78:16) <i>Nozlim</i> (“brought streams”) always refers to fresh living waters. Scripture states, “Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.” (Pro. 5:15) “Sixty discomforts come to one who hears his friend eating and he cannot eat” <sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Baba Kama</i> 92b - in other words the discomfort for the Egyptians was that they saw the Israelites drinking fresh water and eating when they could not.</i>
30. <b>“The waters formed a wall for them on their right and on their left.”</b> (Ex. 14:29) “For them,” refers to the Egyptians as mentioned above. The water formed a barrier, blocking the way. Read the word not as, חֹמָ֔ה, <i>chomah</i>, wall, but as חֹימָ֔ה <i>cheimah</i>, anger; that is, all the waters were fighting with them, from the right or the left. In the right hand waters whose way is for merit (would not let them pass). Now all of them were a wall against them. This is also stated in the <i>Mekhilta</i> on the verse, “The deeps covered them.” (Ex. 15:5) “Now are there depths (at the bottom of the sea)? Is it not dry ground?” <i>Peirush</i>: The powerful waters and the depths were placed at the bottom of the waters but this teaches that he brought up the lower depths to the higher depths and the waters fought with them with all types of divine punishments.
31. <b>“Thus <i>HaShem</i> delivered Israel that day from the Egyptians.”</b> (Ex. 14:30) <i>Mekhilta:</i> Like a person who releases a fetus from the womb of a cow. <i>Peirush:</i> As the cow suffers because the fetus is still attached in the womb of the mother, so Israel was attached to Egypt. Because of this, the Egyptians did not want to send them out. This is the meaning of the verse, “"Or has a God ever done miracles to come and take for Himself a nation from the midst of a nation…” (Deut. 4:34) <sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Mekhilta DeRabbi DeRebbe Shimon bar Yochai</i> 14:28</i> It is also implied by what is stated, “Thus <i>HaShem</i> delivered Israel,”implying that Israel was still in between Egypt and their own domain, and God delivered them, taking them out against Egypt’s will. There were a number of plagues here: taking out of the fetus before its time since they had not completed the four hundred years that was decreed to Abraham. The pain that was caused when Pharaoh said, ““What is this we have done, releasing Israel from our service?” (Ex. 14:5) There was great pain but not like a woman in labor when the fetus has died and removing it from her womb takes away the pain, but like a living fetus who has to be taken from her.
32. <b>“Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea.”</b> (Ex. 14:30) <i>Mekhilta</i>: This teaches that each Israelite saw his own oppressor, he took off his shoe and smacked him across his face. There were those who smote the Egyptians with whips and stones. Some placed gravel in the mouths of the Egyptians. Some pulled out the hair of the Egyptians, as he wished. Further it states there, “Israel saw the Egyptians dead.” What did the Israelites do? Each person took his dog and went and placed his foot on the neck of the Egyptian and said to his dog, “Eat the hand that subjugated me! Eat the forearm of this one who had no compassion for me!” Know that this is based on what is stated, “that your feet may wade through blood, that the tongue of your dogs may have its portion of your enemies.” (Ex. 68:24)
33. <b>“Israel saw the Egyptians dead (<i>Mitzrayim mayt</i>) ...”</b> (Ex. 14:30) An unusual death, one more grievous than the next. <i>Mekhilta</i>: another interpretation: Egypt had died but not died. As in the Scripture, “But as she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni,” (Gen. 35:18) which is said regarding Rachel, she was on the verge of passing away when she named her son, <i>Ben-oni</i>. So it was with the Egyptians - they were dying but had not yet died to cause them much pain and so they would see the glory of Israel, and not say, “Just as they are lost, so too is Israel…” They suffered the pain of being a person who will die imminently, and yet they would have the awareness to understand and see Israel’s glory, and how many judgements are passed against a person at that hour when all of them are afflictions..
34. <b>“And when Israel saw the wondrous power which <i>HaShem</i> had wielded against the Egyptians…”</b> (Ex. 14:31) when the Israelites left the sea. For there they saw the Egyptians dying but not quite dead, as we have said, fulfilling Scripture, “Cursed shall you be in your going out;” (Deut. 28:19) that is, when you go out of the sea. For the Egyptians were afflicted with as the Reproofs, “<i>HaShem</i> will drive you, and the king you have set over you, to a nation unknown to you…,” (Deut. 28:36) The Egyptians saw Pharaoh was saved and they were troubled because he was more deserving of death than they were, for he pressed them to pursue Israel, and he had said, “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;” (Ex 15:9) Thus the words of Scripture were established about them, “You shall be a consternation, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples,” (Deut. 28:37) “and you shall become a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.” (Deut. 28:25) as it is written, “The peoples hear, they tremble; agony grips the dwellers in Philistia. (Ex. 15:14)
35. <b>“The stranger in your midst shall rise above you higher and higher,”</b> (Deut. 28:43) refers to the Egyptians. It refers to the <i>Erev Rav</i>, the mixed multitude,<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote"><i><b>Erev Rav</b></i> was a group that included Egyptians and others who had joined Israel on the Exodus. According to Jewish tradition, they were accepted by Moses as an integral part of the people. Their influence is said to have been involved in the golden calf and other incidents where the people questioned Moses and his laws. Erev Rav - Wikipedia</i> who were not Egyptians. They rose higher and higher while (the Egyptians) descended lower and lower. Further, it is established that, “He shall lend you,” (Deut. 28:44 ) should be read, “They shall lead you ( ילוו),” from the word (לויה), <i>leviyah</i>, as in, they led them to their grave. Similarly, “he shall be the head,”(Deut. 28:43) and also, “If you pay the bride-price for a wife, another man shall lie with her.” (Deut. 28:30) This is because most of the Egyptians who pursued the Israelites were married but had not yet consummated their marriages when they died. Not only that but they saw other men lying with their wives.
36. <b>“If you build a house, you shall not live in it.”</b> (Deut. 28:30) We find that when Joshua bin Nun cursed the ones who built Jericho, he said, “he shall lay its foundations at the cost of his first-born, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest.” (Josh. 6:26) He learned this curse from what happened to the Egyptians when they built their homes. Now that they had drowned and could not live in their homes, they were reminded that their children had died so that it was as if they were all dead. It is similar to what Jacob said when he sent Benjamin with his brothers back to Egypt so that it seemed all of them might be dead now.<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Genesis 43:4 - And may <i>El Shaddai</i> dispose the man to mercy toward you, that he may release to you your other brother, as well as Benjamin. As for me, <b>if I am to be bereaved, I shall be bereaved.”</b></i>
37. <b>“If you plant a vineyard, you shall not harvest it.”</b> (Deut. 28:30) The fruit of the land and their efforts shall be consumed by a nation that they do not know while they were busy and oppressed with work every day. “And you will be driven mad by what your eyes behold.” (Deut. 28:34) These verses refer to the Egyptians because until that hour they were convinced they would be saved, since God had given them the strength to withstand the plagues because their nature had helped them making them strong and healthy. Or else they might have withstood the plagues their magic helped them. These things gave them back their vitality but now as they felt their impending death they were driven mad by the sight of their eyes and their dashed hope and loss of prospects. Until now the plagues were listed according to the order of the verses, and therefore they did not occur according to the order in which they occurred. From now on they are listed according to the allusions in the song of the sea.
38. <b>“His horse and driver God has hurled into the sea.”</b> (Ex. 15:1) Since the verse states “His Horse and driver,” and not “Their horses and drivers,” it must be referring to the celestial angel of the Egyptians. It is also possible that it is referring to Pharaoh, because he had assured the people that they would be victorious. Now that they saw that they were the first to drown, they grew weak. It is written that the Egyptians had seen Israel was saved, because we have already said that the Egyptians had died, come back to life and died again several times. When they came back to life, their appearance changed from moment to moment. Also the word <b>רָמָ֥ה</b> “he has hurled,” is from the word, <b>רִמִּיתָֽנִי , “</b>deceived me.” For the Holy One deceived them by making it seem that the chariot horses in the waves were female horses, as was stated in the <i>Midrash</i>. Further, the word <b>רָמָ֥ה</b> is from the verse, “It became <b>וַיָּ֤רֶם</b> infested with maggots and stank.” (Ex. 16:20) Their flesh was afflicted with boils and other plagues, along with them being in the salty water which made their flesh stink. The salty water caused endless pain to the afflicted.
39. <b>“Horse and driver…”</b> (Ex. 15:1) This teaches that the horses and drivers were connected to one another and they were unable to separate from each other and others like them. If they had been able to go down (in the sea) they might have been saved by swimming in the water or through magic. Further in<i> Tanhuma</i>: “<i>rama bayam</i>” teaches us that they were thrown up high, that is by the waves which lifted them up and then afterwards they fell into the water. This happened many times.
40. <b>“Pharaoh’s chariots and his army God has cast (יָרָ֣ה /<i>yara</i>) into the sea;”</b> (Ex. 15:4) This teaches that they fell into the sea all the way to the abyss. Another interpretation: They were shot (יורה /<i>yoreh</i>) like an arrow which they cast from the shore of the sea to the middle of the sea many times, each time with a different pain.
41. <b>“Your carcasses shall become food for all the birds of the sky,”</b> (Deut 28:26) was established about the Egyptians. They were like fish that swallow one another. For each fish there is a larger one which swallows it so that the first fish dies in the belly of the second fish. The Egyptians suffered in it as if they were inside it, like we see in the story of Jonah, who said, “From the belly of Sheol I cried out,” (Jonah. 2:3) This was because the fish that swallowed him died, as the sages said. They suffered many different types of afflictions at that time. The (fish) were called birds because they had fins. The word הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם of the sky is an abbreviation of “From the water” as was written in the work of heaven.
42. <b>“The deeps covered them,”</b> (Ex. 15:5) <i>Mekhilta</i>: This teaches us that the firmament covered them up and the stars darkened, this can be derived from the fact that it says תְּהֹמֹ֖ת, abysses and not תהום abyss. This implies that there were two abysses, one above and one below, as Scripture states, “where deep calls to deep in the roar of Your cataracts.” (Ps. 42:3) If the abyss covered them, then the stars were darkened and the rain and hail were not far from falling on them.
43. <b>“They went down into the depths like a stone.”</b> (Ex. 15:5) <i>Mekhilta</i>: Because they (Pharaoh) said, “When you …look at the birthstool (הָאָבְנָ֑יִם),” (Ex 1:16) therefore, God made the water like stones, and the Egyptians had many bruises and wounds from being struck and they had great pain as if they were dying.<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon Ben Yochai</i> 15:5</i> So wrote the sages in M<i>asechet Chulin</i>, in chapter <i>Elu Terefot</i>: “The blood of a wound affects atonement like the blood of a burnt offering….”<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Chulin, 7b. Rabbi Foa writes that this is chapter 3 but actually it appears in chapter 1 of Chulin Rava does have a statement but it is not the one in the talmud</i> The wound causes great pain that is similar to death since it is like a sacrifice. Or else, “they went down into the depths like a stone,” should be understood literally, that they quickly went down into the depths like a stone. Or it might mean God made their bodies heavy like a stone. Or else, they felt like a stone. Or else, they appeared like a stone. And it is possible that it was all of them!
44. <b>“Your right hand, <i>HaShem</i>, shatters תִּרְעַ֥ץ the foe!”</b> (Ex. 15:6) The meaning of the word תִּרְעַ֥ץ is, breaking, as when one falls on ice and they break the head, then their legs, then their thighs, then their knees. And still all of these limbs are connected to one another. Afterwards they are destroyed as is written, “In Your great triumph You break Your opponents.” (Ex. 15:6)
45. <b>“In Your great triumph You break Your opponents.”</b> (Ex. 15:6) The destruction is stated on something that is firm and is then torn down, as in, “They may build, but I will tear down.” (Mal. 1:4) So too, here, they were destroyed and their limbs torn apart several times, so that they were afflicted in several plagues.
46. When their limbs were torn apart, they were like straw on the surface of the water; their flesh peeled away from their bones. God gave them the vitality to feel the full effect of the plagues. In the <i>Mekhilta</i> it states, “All woods, when they burn, their sound is not heard; but stubble, when it burns, it crackles and is heard. Thus did the sound of Egypt, in its destruction, make itself heard because of retribution. All woods, when they burn, leave a trace; but stubble, when it burns, leaves no trace because of retribution.”<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Mekhilta DRebbe Shimon bar Yochai 15:7 N</i>ote that the words in italics do not appear in the Midrash text.</i> Aterwards because the water was salty their flesh because completely diluted and it became a type of mash הרסנא this is what Scripture states, “Break תַּהֲרֹ֣ס Your opponents,” (Ex. 15:7), from the expression, כָּסָא דְהַרְסָנָא.<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">Small fried fish. See BT <i>Shabbat</i> 118b, and other citations. I am not sure what the connection is to this comment.</i> After that they dissolve into the water as was written above. But this is difficult, according to the order of the verses (in chapter 15). First it states that they were destroyed and gathered up, (Ex. 15:7) and then it states, “I will pursue, I will overtake,” (Ex. 15:9) If they had already died how could they say they would now pursue Israel? But the truth is that the Holy One reanimated them anew, as we have written, and the Egyptians thought this wasn’t performed by God, and depended on themselves, thinking the God of Israel cannot defeat us, and therefore, they said, “I will pursue, I will overtake,” (Ex. 15:9)
47. <b>“At the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up (<i>ne’ermu</i>),”</b> (Ex. 15:8) This is a proof for what we had said earlier: after the waters rose up in a form, God returned and gathered them up as a great stack, causing them to freeze, mighty and standing tall. And so in the <i>Mekhilta</i>: He stood them (the waters) up like stacks (<i>areimot</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael 15:8:1-4</i></i> Since the Egyptians thought that their magic was effective for them, what did the Holy One do? He created stacks of water which battled with them and retributions, as is said, “ the waters piled up,” from the word<i> areima</i>. This was a response to what Pharaoh had said, "Come and let us outsmart them." (Ex. 1:10) You, likewise, gave wisdom ("armah" as in "<i>ne'ermu"</i>) to the waters, and the waters embattled them in all kinds of torrents.<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i>
48. <b>“The floods stood straight like a wall;”</b> (Ex. 15:8) The Egyptians were bound up with the Israelites so that they could not go out (of the sea). They were enthralled by the smell of the sea. The Israelites gave off an aroma, as is stated, "He bubbles up the sea like a pot, etc." (Job 41:23) And to Israel, the sea was like a bed of spices, viz. (Ibid.) "He makes the sea like a spice-bed." (Song 4:16) "Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, blow over my garden that its spices may flow." (Ex. 15:8) "The depths were congealed ("kafu") in the heart of the sea, etc." He made them like a<i> kuppah</i> (a dome) in the midst of the sea. How so? A man's heart consists of two chambers and its arch. Thus did He arch the sea over them. The sea has no heart, and He gave it a heart. Thus far is the <i>Mekhilta</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael 15:8:1-4</i></i> In the <i>Tanchuma</i>: “Congealed (Ex. 15:8). He fashioned them into a kind of vault <i>(kippah</i>). <i>I</i>n the heart of the sea (Ex. 15:8)). Where is a man’s heart located? It is located just above two thirds of his height.” It is possible to explain the difference between <i>kuppah</i> and <i>kippah.</i> <i>Kuppah</i> alludes to the retribution against the Egyptians in which it did not allow them to escape, as the <i>Midrash</i> suggests. <i>Kippah</i> alludes to something to save the Israelites, as it was stated that the water became like a tent over their heads. ‘
49. “<b>The foe said, “I will pursue, I will overtake…”</b> (Ex. 15:19) “...I will divide the spoil” of the Egyptians, before I kill them in order to make them suffer. Afterwards, “My desire shall have its fill of them. (Ex. 15:9) “I will draw my sword, My hand shall subdue them.” (Ibid.) teaching that each and every Egyptians so hated the Israelites that they said, “I wish I might fill myself with them and all of them would be in me and in my guts so that I could draw my sword and kill myself and thus kill them!” This is similar to what Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” (Jud. 16:30) But the opposite happened - they were killed by God’s sword. In the <i>Mekhilta</i>: A parable: A renegade stands and blasphemes behind the king's palace: If I find the king's (minister), Pharaoh stood and blasphemed in the land of Egypt: “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide spoi.l” And the Holy Spirit mocked him and said: "You blew with your breath" — "the sea covered them"; "you inclined your right hand" — "the earth swallowed them." and the sea returned and covered him completely.<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael 15:9 - the text varies slightly - in the actual text it says the King’s son</i></i> There is no doubt that the Egyptians were greatly pained at that time, for it states, “They sank like lead in the majestic waters.” That is, their bodies became like lead which is a heavy metal found beneath the ground - that is why it is called <i>oferet</i> (<i>afar</i> is earth), and is unlike the other metals which are lighter. Similarly the bodies of the Egyptians swelled until they weren’t able to lift themselves - they became like lead.
50. <b>“You put out Your right hand, The earth swallowed them.”</b> (Ex 15:12) <i>Mekhilta</i>: It is said that the sea poured them out on dry land and then from the dry land to the sea. This happened a number of times until the dry land finally said, “If I was cursed for swallowing the blood of a single person, (Cain), how can I accept the blood of this entire population?” The dry land only acquiesced when God promised that he would not bring it to judgment, as it states, “You put out Your right hand,” (Ex. 15:12) and “<i>HaShem</i> has sworn by His right hand, By His mighty arm:” (Is. 62:8) They were still barely alive but each person could recognize his oppressor. Maybe maggots and worms were eating them while they were alive. Or the Egyptians repented in the manner that Korach did.
There are 50 primary plagues each of which include four or five secondary plagues with them - that afflicted the Egyptians by the sea. And if the details do not seem correct in the reader’s eyes, let him come up with his own interpretation, according to the method I have placed before him<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Sota</i> 40a This is a profession of humility suggests that while his list of plagues may be wrong, his approach is correct - Rabbi Foa, based on the Talmudic statement “Even if one doesn’t agree with his interpretation, by using his approach and the other person’s interpretation, God will be exalted.”</i> , and “Through one or the other God will be exalted.” 
And even though the Egyptians were deserving of all these plagues, the Holy One brings revenge upon his enemies was an act of kindness and compassion, as is stated, “God of retribution, <i>HaShem</i>, God of retribution” (Ps. 94:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">God is called “God of retribution” but this title is associated with the tetragrammaton which is always associated with compassion. Also the four letter name appears between two expressions of retribution.</i> Retribution mediates with kindness and compassion. For if we look at their outcome, we find that Egypt was more fortunate than other nations, besides Israel. The nation of Egypt merited to be an altar of atonement for Israel; it was the place where the Israelites were circumcised, and the site where they offered the Passover sacrifice and cast the blood of the sacrifice, just as one dashes the sacrificial blood on the altar. Even more so, while offering the blood of the sacrifice is only one gift, here, (in Egypt) there were three gifts (to the Egyptians). It is well known that a sacrifice that includes many gifts is considered more important than the others, as they are ordered in <i>Masechet Zevachim</i>, <i>Perek Eizehu Mikoman</i> (Ch. 5). Furthermore, the land of Egypt merited, because the Holy One Himself passed through the land. Even when the holiness goes out of a place, it leaves a very real impression, unless impurity forces it to leave. This may be deduced through a <i>kal vachomer</i> from a perfume store<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">When there is a perfume shop in the neighborhood everyone benefits from the aroma.</i> or, a city which the emperor passes through for lodging; it is good for the lodging and good for the city. Furthermore, the plagues with which Egypt was afflicted were not carried out by angels of vengeance but by an angel placed over this matter and through the agency of Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">This implies that they were given special treatment - it wasn’t just vengeance but something more.</i> Finally, Egypt merited something all those who fear God and contemplate God’s name seek: that everything that happens to them comes from the Blessed One, whether good or not, since God is the ultimate goodness. Egypt was not put to death by the angel of death, (but by God) as it states, “I will strike down every first-born,” (Ex. 12:12) - I and not an angel…” Similarly it is written, “Horse and driver God hurled into the sea,” (Ex. 15:1) and, “You made Your wind blow, the sea covered them,” (Ex 15:10) Who wouldn’t want to die by God’s hand? For even if one’s body is racked by pain, one’s soul gains enlightenment (when death comes from God). One is raised up and merits enlightenment in the light of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalm 56:14</i>
This would seem to be the case from what I have written in this essay, the claim that the earth did not want to swallow the Egyptians. For the earth's claim was not a (valid) claim. For if they had been put to death with just cause, then the earth should not have accepted them. And yet the earth accepted them. And if the earth accepted the blood of Abel, though the place of his murder was not known, then the reason that Abel was accepted by the earth was because he was completely righteous and was murdered; even though he should not have been accepted into the earth until his murderer was (found guilty) and punished. Therefore, the Egyptians would have been considered righteous after they received proper punishment for what they had done to the Israelites. Now once they were punished by God in a way that fit their crime against Israel, the earth should have accepted them but it refused, even though God said there was no longer a charge against them. This is implied by what Scripture states, “Then I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and he will pursue them, that I may gain glory through Pharaoh and all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am <i>HaShem</i>.” (Ex. 14:4) Open your eyes and look at what Egypt tried to achieve at that time! They wished to attain what all righteous people seek; that no harm befall them and he would be lifted by God’s hand. Is it not to know and comprehend God’s name, as is stated, “I will set him on high, because he hath known My name?” (Ps 91:14) It does say, “Who fears my name,” because one who fears God is only saved by an angel, as Scripture states, “For He will order His angels to guard you wherever you go.” (Ps. 91:11) Rather it says one “who knows God’s name,” shall be exalted and saved by God. It is for this that we pray each day, (when we say), “We and our descendants [and the descendants of our descendants] and the descendants of Your people the House of Israel, all know Your Name.” <sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">From the Siddur, the blessings for Torah study.</i> So, too, here, “That Egypt may know that I am <i>HaShem</i>…” (Ex. 14:4) In other words, they should be so purified in their suffering that they become fit to truly know God’s name. This expression is stated in many places, in particular in the book of Ezekiel, when he prophesied the downfall of Amon, Moab and Edom, and that all of them will be prevented from comprehending the true nature of God except through God’s actions, wonders, and the awesome deeds . Only through these deeds would they come to recognize that God is the One who created them and come to know his all power. Because of all of this, the word, <b>ידיעה</b>, <i>Yediah</i>, knowing, it only means attaining full and complete understanding of God. It is impossible to contradict it in any way because it is based on God’s deeds, which is faith and not knowledge. But, “For the land shall be filled with knowledge <i>HaShem</i> ...” then the other nations will know clearly what human reason cannot make known now. The Egyptians at the moment of their deaths attained this knowledge. 
This is what the sages meant when they said, “A maid- servant beheld at the Red Sea what was not beheld by Ezekiel ben Buzi…”<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Rashi</i> on Exodus 15:2 <i>Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael</i> 15:2:2</i> According to its plain meaning, this is difficult. For where were the maid-servants at that time; hadn’t all the Israelites left Egypt? Further, it does not say what the maid-servants but maid-servant in the singular form. This maid-servant is the one Solomon speaks about when he states, “A slave-girl who supplants her mistress.” (Pro. 30:23) Even she merited to see great visions like those who were standing at the Red Sea. Among them were Egyptians. They merited to be among them who were included in the Jewish people after three generations, “Children born to them shall be admitted into the congregation of <i>HaShem</i> in the third generation.” (Deut. 23:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Part of the reward of coming to know God - as the Egyptians came to know God was that they would eventually be able to join the Jewish people. Allowing them to convert was not a privilege but a responsibility. See the previous verse: “You shall not abhor an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in his land.” (Deut. 23:8)</i> The language of this verse is an obligation, a promise to Egypt that shall be allowed to convert after three generations in ways known to God. This is because God is compassionate and merciful and therefore does not relate with the left, for the left is associated with judgment and anger, as is written, “For He is angry but a moment, and when He is pleased there is life.” (Ps. 30:6) And it is for this that Scripture says, ““You put out Your right hand, The earth swallowed them.” (Ex. 15:12)

Paragraph 1

The <i>Maggid</i> has said <b>כמה מעלות טובות למקום עלינו</b> “How many favors has the omnipresent bestowed upon us.” when it would have been more proper to say, <b>כמה מעלות טובות עלינו למקום</b> “How many degrees<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ma’alot</i> could be translated a number of ways. Rabbi Foa suggests that <i>ma’alot</i> are not favors but decrees of service.</i> have been bestowed upon us for the Omnipresent.” One should not be surprised, for it is similar to the language we are taught: “These are the commandments for the parents that are incumbent on the child…”<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Mishnah</i> 1:7</i> This should be explained as follows: these are the commandments that are placed on the child to perform for his/her parent. Similarly here, (this should be explained), “These are the degrees of service placed us so we can praise God.” It then begins with, “God took us out of Egypt…” since this is the one thing for which we asked. But it is also possible to explain that this statement comes to answer the question which Rabbi Elazar asked his father, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai: “If a person has a slave and promises to free him and give him a lot of money, wouldn’t it be appropriate for the master to be praised? But if a regular person does a favor for his fellow and then constantly reminds him of it, is it not unseemly? This is the statement of King Solomon, “In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride; but the lips of the wise shall guard them.” (Pro. 14:3) This verse means: The fool is prideful even though he only has one good ‘rod’ or ‘branch' of something good while the wise person, even though he has many ‘branches,’ keeps them to himself and does not constantly mention them. How much more is this the case with the Blessed Holy One! If that is so, why does God mention the Exodus so many times in the <i>Torah</i>? One answers this - this is a reflection of God’s humility. God mentions the Exodus from Egypt fifty times to make known that they went forth through the divine aspect of <i>.</i> This is alluded to in the statement, “Now the Israelites went up armed (<i>chamushim</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote"> The actual meaning of the word <i>chamushim</i> is uncertain; however it is closely connected in kabbalah with the number 50, <i>chamishim</i>. Israel is redeemed from the fiftieth gate of impurity through which is associated with the fifty gates of purity. This is hinted at by the fifty times the Exodus is mentioned in the Torah. Note that Rabbi Foa’s commentary refers to the exodus with the letters mem-yud which add up to fifty. By mentioning the Exodus God alludes to the true miracle which was Israel’s redemption through the mystery of <i> without ever mentioning it!</i></i> out of the land of Egypt.” (Ex. 13:18) This is the mystery of the fifty gates of understanding. It was through the power of , that Israel was redeemed from Egypt for that is the source of their redemption. And it is from there in the future that redemption will again take place, as Scripture states, “Who (<i>Mi, Mem-Yud</i>) can heal you?” (Ex. 2:13) <br><b>אמנם</b> However one might explain the plain meaning (of the expression, <i>kama ma’alot</i>) as follows: God performed many deeds for us just as a person performs favors for his fellow, each greater than the one before. One should mention them (and give thanks for) them so as not to appear ungrateful and prevent the person from acting kindly again. Therefore, (the person who performs the favors) mentions the smallest favor first which he did for his fellow, and in that way it won’t appear that he mentioned it so as to be praised. If that was the case, he would have mentioned all of the favors at once, or he would have mentioned the greatest favor first and then the lesser ones. Also it is not appropriate to demean one who did favors for you but to praise him. In this way, one lessens the obligation one has to his fellow. This is what the Holy Blessed One did with us. By mentioning the Exodus from Egypt as the lesser kindness which God performed for us, God does so in a way that we won’t appear ungrateful for the favors God performed for us, and it allows us to mention one and then another.  <br>And to prove that it is the smallest among the many favors, the <i>Maggid</i> begins by saying, "If God had taken us out of Egypt…” which is such a small favor, that “would have been enough.” That is all we ask for and not that God also take vengeance on Egypt. We asked simply that God redeem us. But the Blessed One did so much more, passing judgment upon Egypt. God brought judgment upon Egypt to show the other nations that Israel is God’s children, as Scripture states, “Israel is My first born son.” (Ex. 4:22) Anyone who causes suffering to the child, causes suffering to the parent. <br>

Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3

The <i>Maggid</i> then states, “If God had brought judgment upon the Egyptians but not upon their god’s, it would have been enough for us,” <sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">In parentheses Rabbi Foa adds, “In the Haggadah which is published with this version it so states.)</i> to show us that the gods of the other nations are not real and (their gods) did not have the power to save them. That is why Israel believed in God and removed the other gods of Egypt from among them. In addition to the judgments against the Egyptians, God also passed judgment on their gods and the materials from which they were made. Those that were made of wood rotted, of stone were broken, etc, in order to distance Israel from idolatry.

Paragraph 4

<b>אלו עשה באלוהיהם, ולא הרג את־בכוריהם, דיינו</b> <b>“If God had judged their gods but had not killed their first born, it been enough for us!”</b> If God had completely removed the idols of Egypt so that they no longer became impure from them, it would have been enough. But God also killed their firstborn because Egypt was considered firstborn among the constellations (<i>mazalot</i>). By killing the firstborn, everyone realized that it did not have power.

Paragraph 5

<b>אלו הרג את־בכוריהם ולא נתן לנו את־ממונם, דיינו</b> “<b>If God had killed their firstborn but had not given us their money, it would have been enough for us.”</b> That is because the Israelites already had a great deal of wealth. The Egyptians did not take what belonged to the Israelites, as is written, “Our own livestock, too, shall go along with us.” (Ex 10:26) Also, the Israelites were enriched during the plague of blood, as we stated above. But (God did so) because God wanted to give the Israelites the wealth of the firstborn, since one inherits the wealth of the one who died.

Paragraph 6

<b>אלו נתן לנו את־ממונם ולא קרע לנו את־הים, דיינו</b>. <b>“If God had given us their money but had not split the Sea for us, it would have been enough for us,”</b> to make known to us that God is all powerful and whatever God wants, God can do in heavens or on earth. God can take from one and give to another; all according to justice. But God desired to split the sea for us to show us the glory of His kingdom, as it is stated, “The maid servant saw more at the sea than (Ezekiel and the prophets saw)....”

Paragraph 7

<b>אלו קרע לנו את־הים ולא העבירנו בתוכו בחרבה, דיינו</b> <b>“If God had split the Sea for us but had not taken us through it on dry land (<i>haravah</i>), it would have been enough for us.”</b> If God had left the sea bed as muck and mud (it would have been enough). Also, even if we had to struggle to pass through the sea bed it would have been enough since we were being redeemed. But God wanted to bring us through the sea on dry land; that is, there was water to their right and left and above them; only below them was (the sea bed) dry and parched. The reason that the <i>Maggid</i> chose the word <i>haravah</i>, rather than <i>yevashah</i>, as is stated, “But the Israelites marched through the sea on <i>(yabashah)</i> dry ground. ” (Ex. 14:29) It is because <i>haravah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">In Ex. 14:21 it uses the other word: “Drove back the sea with a strong east wind all that night, and turned the sea into dry ground (<i>b’haravah</i>).”</i> alludes to the water taking the form of a tent, as is stated, <b>אֶת־הַיָּם לֶחָרָבָה</b> “God turned the sea into dry land.” (Ex. 14:21) The abbreviation of the phrase is אה’’ל, <i>ohel,</i> tent.  <br>However it is also more exacting to ask why the <i>Maggid</i> chose the word קרע, as in the statement, “had not split <b>קרע</b> the sea for us” split instead of <b>וַיִּבָּקְעוּ</b> as in the verse, “The waters were split (יִּבָּקְעוּ)” (Ex. 14:21) Regarding this matter we will understand what my teacher of blessed memory said regarding the verse, “The sea returned to its normal state (לְאֵיתָנוֹ).” (Ex. 14:27) לְאֵיתָנוֹ means “to its original condition.” What is the “condition,” תנאי here? Are not the stipulations of a condition based (on the <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Kiddushin</i>), “Any condition that is not like the condition Moses stipulated with the children of Gad and the children of Reuben is not a valid condition and is not taken into account.” <sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mishnah Kiddushin</i> 3:4 Which does not specify both the result of fulfilling the condition and the result of the condition remaining unfulfilled.</i> <br>When God created the world, what conditions were met? The sages inform us, “At the time when the Holy One sought to create the world, He said to the minister of the sea: “Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of the world,” so that there will be room for land.” The minister of the sea said before God: “Master of the Universe, it is enough that I will stay within my own waters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Bava Batra</i> 79b</i> This is surprising - how could the minister of the sea refuse to accept a gift from its Master? However it is fitting to believe that the minister of the sea was the group of ministering angels who opposed the creation of humanity. And the angels said that the person who was about to be created would eventually sin. When God told the sea to receive all the waters of the world in order to prepare a dwelling place (for humanity), he said, “Since man would eventually sin, it will be necessary to drown him; therefore take back the gift that you are giving me. It is better that I stand in my own water!” This was a great transgression; even though humanity was created after the separating of the waters, when God said he wanted to create a space on which to place humanity, the minister of the seas gave a reason to prevent it and did not want to accept the waters, as has been said. “God immediately struck the minister and killed him; as it is stated: “By His understanding He smites Rahab” (Job 26:12)<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid <i>Bava Batra</i></i> The gathering of waters was the condition that it would continue to ebb and flow, as if it were going to spill on to the earth. And the gift was that the tide would return to its original place periodically. This is what we now see, the waters go forth and recede every six hours. <br>When Israel came close to the sea, God said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites to go forward.” (Ex. 14:15) Moses then spoke to the sea and said, “Split your waters!” The sea said to him, “I don’t want to!” Since this matter seemed wrong (to the sea), it said, “It is not enough that you obligate me to return the waters that were given to me, but you are taking from me my personal portion and making it dry so that the Israelites can pass through. Was it not the stipulation to give me back only my portion? In great fury the sea wanted to drown all the Israelites. Thus it is written, “The waters forming a wall for them on their right and on their left.” (Ex. 14:22) The word is written as חֹמָ֔ה<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>chomah</i>, wall, is written without a <i>vav,</i> and is interpreted as <i>cheimah</i>, fury.</i> wall, without a <i>vav,</i> meaning <i>cheimah,</i> fury. Moses then went to the Holy One and said, “The sea doesn’t want to divide its waters.” God immediately appeared to the sea. When the sea saw God and Moses, it fled before them, as is written, “The sea saw them and fled.” (Ps. 114:3) But God’s anger was not assuaged because the minister of the sea refused God’s commandments and was recalcitrant. What did God do? God grabbed hold of the sea and tore it into twelve pieces, just as a person tears up a garment. And at the sound of the tearing the water raised its voice and cried out, as is stated, “Above the voice of the mighty waters, more terrible than the breakers of the sea.” (Ps. 93:4) That is, the mighty waters raised their voice when they heard the splitting and smashing of the sea. The sea in particular raised its voice and cried, as Scripture states, “Have you penetrated the crying of the sea.” (Job 38:16) But since the gates of tears are never closed, the waters returned to their original “stipulation,” and the gift was returned to them as has been mentioned and it never again rebelled against any commandment that came to it from the righteous, those who are ruled over by fear of God. <br><b>The place of the split is still known.</b> As is stated in <i>Berachot, Perek HaRoeh</i> (ch. 9) “One who sees the crossings of the Red Sea and the crossings of the Jordan; and the crossings of the streams of Arnon...must give thanks and offer praise before God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">Berachot 54a</i> Granted that the place of the splitting of the Jordan was known to them - this was because the Israelites placed twelve stones there. Also the location of Arnon was known because it was between two mountains. But even if there was an impression left by the splitting of the Red Sea, how could one recognize it? Actually, the sea never returned to the way it was and its place (of the splitting) was recognizable. Regarding this the sages stated, “The task of providing a person’s food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea…”<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">BT Pesachim 118a</i> because God had to talk to the sea and force it to split. Similarly, it was difficult for the Holy One to provide food for someone who deserves to die of hunger because of his evil deeds. It is for this reason that the sages used this expression (“it is as difficult as splitting the sea…) since the statement, “The waters were split,” (Ex. 14:21) implies that it was split forever to publicize this matter. But <i>Dayyenu</i> states קָרַע, “the sea split” (and not וַיִּבָּקְעוּ). The <i>Maggid</i> chose this language to imply that God performed the splitting of the sea for our sake, and that God did so in the way that is implied by a full verse, as is stated, “For your ruin is vast as the sea: who can heal you?” (Lam. 2:13) The <i>Midrash</i><sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pekikta D’Rav Kahanah</i> 16:3</i> interprets this to mean, The one in the future who will heal the broken sea, will also heal you. Certainly the sea was broken, and it is still broken until God comes to heal it, as Scripture states, “The floods stood straight like a wall.” (Ex. 15:8) The Maggid implies that the sea no longer ebbed and flowed, but stood still and cried. <br>

Paragraph 8

<b>אִלּוּ הֶעֱבִירָנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ בֶּחָרָבָה וְלֹא שִׁקַּע צָרֵנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ דַּיֵּנוּ</b> <b>“If God had taken us through the sea on dry land but had not pushed down our enemies in the Sea,<i> dayyenu</i>.”</b> Instead, had God prevented the Egyptians from entering the sea, it would have been enough for us for we would have already been saved. But God wanted to drown them to reassure us that they would never return to cause us distress, as Scripture states, “For the Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.” (Ex.14:13)

Paragraph 9

<b>אלו שקע צרנו בתוכו ולא ספק צרכנו במדבר ארבעים שנה דינו</b> “<b>If God had pushed down our enemies into the sea but had not supplied our needs in the wilderness for forty years, <i>dayyenu.</i>”</b> Instead, if we had died immediately upon seeing the vengeance against our enemies, it would have been enough. Because it is the way of all human beings to say, “I would gladly die if I could witness the downfall of my enemies. But God wanted us to live in the wilderness for forty years, in a place of snakes and scorpions. God gave us everything we lacked; even clothing and shoes, as is written, “The clothes upon you did not wear out, nor did your feet swell these forty years.” (Deut. 8:4) The <i>Maggid</i> refers to this when he says, “ supplied our needs in the wilderness for forty years,” using the same language of the blessing for putting on shoes, “(Praised are You…) “Who has provided for me all of my needs.” This statement is placed before the eating of <i>manna</i> because “providing our needs,” came before the <i>manna</i>, which did not happen until the sixteenth of Iyyar, while clothing was provided as soon as they left Egypt.

Paragraph 10

<b>אלו ספק צרכנו במדבר ארבעים שנה ולא האכילנו את־המן דינו</b> <b>“If God had supplied our needs in the wilderness for forty years but had not fed us the manna <i>dayyenu</i>.”</b> Instead, God could have troubled us by making us plow, plant and harvest in the wilderness. He could have performed a great miracle for us even if we had to make it happen. After all, we had become used to all hard labor in Egypt, as is written, “with harsh labor at mortar and bricks and with all sorts of tasks in the field.” (Ex.1:14) But God wanted to feed us <i>manna,</i> the food the angels ate, in order to purify us of materialism so that we would become like angels.

Paragraph 11

<b>אלו האכילנו את־המן ולא נתן לנו את־השבת, דינו</b> “<b>If God had fed us <i>manna</i> and had not given us the the Sabbath, <i>dayyenu.”</i></b>  We would have become pure like angels (through consuming <i>manna</i>). But God wanted to give us the Sabbath because through it we would attain an additional soul (<i>neshamah yeteirah</i>), a precious gift from God’s storehouse. Through it we would become great like the ministering angels. For the <i>neshamah</i>, the soul is higher than them and we would be its partner, as is known.

Paragraph 12

<b>אלו נתן לנו את־השבת, ולא קרבנו לפני הר סיני, דינו</b> “<b>If God had given us the Sabbath but had not brought us close to Mount Sinai, <i>dayyenu</i>.”</b> (Had God given us the Sabbath but) not uprooted the evil inclination from us (by bringing us to Sinai), it would have been enough. For the holiness of the Sabbath would have increased our strength to defeat the evil inclination. But God wanted to bring us close to Mount Sinai to stop the poison of the ancient serpent (the evil inclination) as the sages said, “When Israel came close to Mount Sinai the poison stopped and it completely uprooted the evil inclination.

Paragraph 13

<b>אלו קרבנו לפני הר סיני, ולא נתן לנו את־התורה “If God had brought us close to Mount Sinai but had not given us the <i>Torah</i>, <i>dayyenu</i>.”</b> Since approaching (Sinai would cut off the poison (of the evil inclination), it would have enough for us to allow us to inherit the World that is Coming. But God wanted to give us the <i>Torah</i> as well which contains many commandments. Because there are so many of them wherever we would go we would find a commandment to perform which refines us. It was known and revealed to God that we would need it because we would eventually worship the golden calf. The <i>Torah</i> and the commandments would save us from all evil.

Paragraph 14

<b>אלו נתן לנו את־התורה ולא הכניסנו לארץ ישראל, דינו</b> <b>“If God had given us the <i>Torah</i> but had not brought us into the land of Israel, <i>dayyenu</i>.”</b> There are many commandments for us to fulfill in the <i>Torah</i> - enough to allow us to inherit the World that is Coming. But God also allowed us to enter the land of Israel where the fulfillment of additional commandments completes the soul.

Paragraph 15

<b>אלו הכניסנו לארץ ישראל. ולא בנה לנו את בית המקדש</b> <b>“If God had brought us into the land of Israel but had not built us the Temple (<i>Beit HaMikdash</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">In the Ashkenazic version of <i>dayyenu</i> it says <i>Beit HaBechirah</i>, literally the “Chosen House.” .</i> <i>dayyenu</i>.”</b> (If we did not have a Temple) each person would have built an altar in his or her own house and offered sacrifices, for it was taught (in the <i>Mishnah</i>), “When they arrived at Gilgal private altars were permitted…”<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Zevachim 14:5, BT Zevachim 112b</i> But this was not enough. Rather God wanted us to build a Holy Temple, for the place of the altar was the gate of heaven as our father (Jacob) witnessed when he rose from his dream on his way to the household of Laban. The <i>Kohanim</i> would offer sacrifices as special ministers for this, and this would be more acceptable to God. Therefore, once the Temple was built it was no longer permissible for the people to have their own altars.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">There is a statement here that appears to have been added by the more recent publisher. It is not clear what it means but it would seem to reflect the fact that the <i>dayyenu</i> has the language <i>Beit HaMikdash</i> while the following passage (<i>Al achat kamah…</i>) says <i>Beit HaBechirah</i>.</i>

Paragraph 16

<b>אלו בנה לנו לבית המקדש ולא בנה לנו את־בית הבחירה דינו “If God had built the <i>Beit HaMikdash</i>, the Holy Temple, for us, but God had not built the <i>Beit HaBechirah</i>, the Chosen House, (the Holy of Holies) it would have been enough for us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">This line appears in the printed first edition of Rabbi Foa’s Haggadah but does not appear in the Ashkenazic or most Sephardic versions of the Haggadah. See Haggadah Sheleimah, versions.</i></b>  For God would have willingly accepted our offerings made in the Temple. But God also wanted a Holy of Holy for us so that the Divine Presence could dwell there, an abode of God’s Presence. In that way God would always be with us, both then and forever God’s presence would never depart from the Western Wall. May this be revealed to the eyes of all the nations speedily in our days. <br><b>הנה</b> There is a difficulty here; why is it necessary to speak about God’s actions as, “the good that is doubled and quadrupled?” If it was for the actions that have been counted, hasn’t it already said, “How many favors did the God bestow upon us?” And even if we wish to strengthen God by speaking about the “good that is doubled and quadrupled,” above the good deeds that God bestowed upon us, there must be other acts beyond those we have already mentioned. It seems to me that the intention in mentioning every one of the favors that have been specified is to show something in addition to what has already been brought ( in <i>dayyenu</i>). <br><b>והתחיל.</b> The <i>Maggid</i> begins by saying “God took us out of Egypt.” In <i>dayyenu</i> it implies, that God took us out from the subjugation of Egyptians and in this passage, (in “How much more so is the good) it says that God took us out of Egypt, a place of great constraints, from the gates of impurity, as has been said, where we had entered forty nine gates of impurity. <br>
<b>וְעָשָׂה בָהֶם שְׁפָטִים “He judged them.</b>” He not only brought judgment upon the Egyptians but upon all of the gates (of impurity) as well. <br>
<b>וְעָשָׂה בֵאלֹהֵיהֶם</b> <b>“And he judged their gods.”</b> At first God brought judgment upon their gods with the exception of <i>baal Tzfon</i>. And afterwards God brought judgment upon this god as well, as was written above. Or else - gods are the ministering angels who were appointed upon these gates. This served the Israelites so that they didn’t have to worry that they would become impure again. <br>
<b>וְהָרַג אֶת־בְּכוֹרֵיהֶם</b> <b>“He killed their firstborn.”</b> The firstborn is the firstborn among the ministering angels who was called the ministering prince of Egypt, as was stated, “Israel saw the Egyptian<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">That is, singular referring to the celestial prince of Egypt.</i> dead on the shore of the sea.” (Ex. 14:30) <br>
<b>וְנָתַן לָנוּ אֶת־מָמוֹנָם</b> <b>“Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea.”</b> The Egyptians brought their wealth with them when they pursued the Israelites. For Rabbi Joshua ben Pedaya, “There wasn’t a single horse who was not carrying more than ten thousand pieces of gold upon it,” as was written in <i>Yalkut Shir HaShirim,</i><sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yalkut Shimoni, Nach</i>, 982</i> on the verse, “I am dark but comely.” (Song 1:5) Even though receiving the wealth of the Egyptians happened after the splitting of the sea it is brought before here in order to follow the original order. <sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Dayyenu,</i> the order is, “If God had given us their money and had not split the Sea for us…” while in the following passage it also states, “and gave us their money, and split the Sea for us.” Rabbi Foa suggests that even though the money followed the splitting of the sea, it is listed here in the same way in which it was previously listed in <i>Dayyenu.</i></i> It is also possible that “God gave us their money,” means the abundance which God wished to bring upon them to give them life. He gave it to us and from our hands we were sustained, as Moses said to Jethro, “We will extend to you the same bounty that <i>HaShem</i> granted us.” (Nu. 10:32) It does not say “from that bounty,” but “the same bounty.” It is as if that good which was appointed for us shall also be given to you. The whole world shall drink from the essence of the land of Israel. <br>
<b>קָרַע לָנוּ אֶת־הַיָּם</b> <b>“God split the sea.”</b> This does not refer to the “lower” Yam Suf, the Red Sea for if it did, then it would have said, “God split the Red Sea.” Rather it refers to the sea that is the higher sea, called <i>Yam Kinneret</i>, the Sea of Galilee. The lower sea is also called the <i>Yam Suf</i>, the Reed Sea since it is finally called the end for there is nothing below it - and God split it to bring them there.<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Yam suf</i> is possibly a metaphor for the Shechinah in Kabbalistic thought.</i> <br>
<b>הֶעֱבִירָנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ בֶּחָרָבָה</b> <b>“God led us through it on dry land….”</b> Since none of the water attached itself to them. Or else, it is possible to say that since God could have redeemed us with the lower <i>Sephirah</i> (<i>middah</i>) which is called <i>Yam</i>, sea, the redeeming angel about whom our forefather Jacob bore witness. But God only wanted to redeem us with the <i>Sephirah (middah)</i> that is called <i>Mi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">While <i>Yam</i> (the Hebrew word for sea) is associated with <i>Shechinah</i> - it is the sea into which all the other Sephirot flow, <i>Mi</i> ( the word who) is associated with the <i>Sephriah of</i> . <i>Mi</i> adds up to fifty - a number associated with the fifty gates of purity (and fifty gates of impurity. So there is a lower and a higher sea - <i>Shechinah</i> and <i>.</i></i> Who, as is stated in the book of the<i> Zohar</i>. Therefore, when it says that God split the sea for us and brought us through on dry land, it means that the divine plenty (<i>hashpa’ah</i>) came to us from a higher place as if the sea turned to dry land when it was filled with all goodness and everything was through God’s agency. <br>
<b>שִׁקַּע צָרֵנוּ בְּתוֹכוֹ</b> <b>“God pushed down our enemies (<i>bi-tocho</i>) the sea.”</b> The letter <i>bet</i> on the word <b>בְּתוֹכוֹ</b> <i>bi-tocho</i> means “for the sake of,” in other words, in order to take out the good that was still in them. That is, the death of the Egyptians included holiness, as has been said. <br>
<b>סִפֵּק צָרְכֵּנוּ בַּמִדְבָּר אַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה</b> <b>“God supplied all our needs for forty years.”</b> This passage continues to single out things that the Israelites received from a higher source… God provided all the things that we needed, even if we already had them. For instance, even if we had a number of outfits so that if one wore out we could exchange it with another, the first ones never wore out on their own. One can explain the <i>mem</i> of the word <b>מֵֽעָלֶ֔יךָ</b> <i>mei’alekha</i><sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">This word is taken from Deuteronomy 8:4, “The clothes upon you (<i>mei’alecha</i>) did not wear out, nor did your feet swell these forty years.” Rabbi Foa choses to read the verse, “Because the clothes upon you (<i>mei’alecha</i>) they not wear out, nor did your feet swell these forty years.”</i> as a causal <i>mem</i> ( which is on you). Further, the passage uses the word <b>סִפֵּק “</b>God supplied,” instead of <b>נתן לנו</b> “God gave us,” to make known that God only gave the Israelites as much as needed and no more as we see in the case of <i>manna.</i> They only collected as much manna each day as they needed to eat, in order that they not lose their trust in God. God did this in a barren and dry wilderness where the celestial princes did not desire people to settle or the presence of society. Rather the prince desired the complete destruction of everything that one could see so that the place would become a wilderness. In order that it not be difficult to understand, “God supplied whatever we needed,” even if we already had it, one might explain that the garments that were packed away began to deteriorate while the garments that they were wearing did not. This is the meaning of the statement, “The clothes that were upon you did not wear out…” This was similar to the <i>manna</i> for which any extra began to rot. <br>
<b>הֶאֱכִילָנוּ אֶת־הַמָּן</b> <b>“God fed us the manna.</b>” “The <i>manna</i>,” is written with a definite article (<i>hei hayediah)</i> since there are some places where <i>manna</i> that comes down is from a higher place, where it states, “I will rain down bread for you from the heavens.” (Ex. 16:4 It is explained that God rained down rain from a place that is called (<i>hashamayim</i>) “The Heaven.”<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">This is possibly a reference in <i>Kabbalah</i> to the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i>.</i> It would then descend with the dew from above and below as if it were placed in a box. The lower (earthly) dew was not like the higher dew; rather their order was based on their introduction - the higher dew came first, before the regular <i>manna</i>. The dew was higher because it is the dew of which Isaac spoke to Jacob, ““May God give you the dew of heaven…” (Gen 27:28) Enough has been said for those who understand…”<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Phrases such as this one are often used by the Ramban and others to allude to hidden mystical secrets in the text. Apparently the dew of which Isaac spoke was the divine plenty.</i> <br>
<b>וְנָתַן לָנוּ אֶת־הַשַּׁבָּת</b> <b>“God gave us the Sabbath.”</b> “To us,” specifically, and not to the other nations of the world, as the sages said, “A Noahide who observes the Sabbath is liable to receive the death penalty,<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">BT Sanhedrin 58b</i> as is stated, “It shall be a sign for all time between Me and the people of Israel.” (Ex. 31:17) This might be compared to a King who was sitting on his throne and His consort was sitting across from him. If someone passed between them he would be liable for the death penalty. From here we can understand how beloved this gift was that God gave us. For the Sabbath is the seventh day of the first week which God created. It is the mystery of God who dwells in among us. Since God dwells in our midst it is correctly compared to the parable of the king and queen who were sitting together. <br>
<b>קֵרְבָנוּ לִפְנֵי הַר סִינַי</b> <b>“God brought us closer to Mount Sinai.</b>” <b>סיני</b> <i>Sinai</i> in<i> gematria</i> has the same numerical value as the word, <b>סלם</b> <i>sulam</i>, ladder,<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Both words add up to 130 in Gematria</i> After we were given the Sabbath, God gave us other ways of coming even closer. God gave us another way to rise up the rungs of the ladder and reach supernal attainment so that not only would we be close but we could cleave to God. “For as the loincloth clings to the loins of a man…” (Jer. 13:11)<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Midrash Tanchuma Ki Tisa</i> 8:1 this verse is quoted: “The Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses: Bear in mind that Israel cleaves to my loins, as it is said: “For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of man, so have I caused to cleave to Me the whole house of Israel…” (Jer. 13:11).</i> so there is no space between them, as it is written, “While you, who held fast to<i> HaShem</i> your God, are all alive today.” (Deut. 4:4) It would be a chariot to the Divine Presence, as the Patriarchs were.<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly this suggests that coming close to Sinai implies receiving the Written <i>Torah</i> while the next stanza, “God gave us the <i>Torah,”</i> means the oral Torah</i> <br>
<b>נָתַן לָנוּ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָה</b> <b>“God gave us the <i>Torah</i>.”</b> God gave us the Oral <i>Torah</i> and not just its plain sense teachings but the parts that the angels desire, the mysteries about which the angels said, “What is man that You have been mindful of him,” (Ps. 8:5) that they should be worthy of receiving these important matters as this, “You who have covered the heavens with Your splendor!” (Ps. 8:2) It is the splendor and the beauty of the written <i>Torah</i>. <br>
<b>הִכְנִיסָנוּ לְאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל</b> <b>“God brought us into the Land of Israel,”</b> not to inherit the land or benefit from it.

Does this suggest that we cannot fully possess the land until the resurrection of the dead takes place?? In the meantime we must try to seize the land so that it is no longer in the possession of the Canaanites and the other nations that would try to hold on to it. Rabbi Foa ends by quoting the talmudic idea that land cannot be stolen from its owner - therefore whatever the situation we still have possession of it even if we are not holding on to it.</i> as Scripture states, “I will assign all these lands to you and to your heirs.” (Gen. 26:3) Rather, God brought us there to seize hold of it so that it would no longer be called the land of Canaan; instead it would be land of Israel.

Rabban Gamliel's Three Things



Paragraph 1

It would seem that the purpose of remembering the Passover offering in our time is so that we not forget the law of the Passover. For if we are meritorious and the Redeemer comes to redeem us we will know how to offer it as we were commanded. It is for this reason that, “Theodosius <i>[Todos</i>] of Rome instituted the custom for the Roman Jews to eat kids roasted [<i>mekulas</i>] whole with their entrails over their heads on the evenings of Passover…”<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">BT <i>Pesachim</i> 53a Rabbi Yossi said,....</i> However we also remember it because of the statement, “Instead of bulls we will pay, the offering of, our lips.” (Hos. 14:3) Or else (we may remember the Passover offering) in order to remember the Kindness which God performed for us on this night, for it was truly great. <br><b>הלא הוא</b> Doesn’t the Passover offering symbolize that God passed through the houses of our ancestors in Egypt against the will of the celestial princes who tried to prevent God’s will to redeem Israel. God passed by the Egyptians who were the obstacles of holiness. <br>
<b>ואת בתינו הציל</b> <b>“But our houses God saved הִצִּיל</b> (<i>hitzeel</i>).” <i>Peirush</i>: God took us for a portion, as was stated, “God has taken away <b>וַיַּצֵּ֧ל</b> (<i>vaytzeel</i>) your father’s livestock and given it to me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the story of Laban in which Jacob is able to take control of his flocks through genetic/divine manipulation.</i> (Gen. 31:9) So too here, God has lifted us on the wings of eagles and brought us to him. But it does not say God saved us since the Divine Presence (the <i>Shechinah</i>) entered the houses of the Israelites and enlightened it from its Glory within them, The word <i>hitzeel</i> is like the word <b>לְהַצְהִ֣יל</b> <i>Hitzheel</i>, as in the expression, “To make the face shine <b>לְהַצְהִ֣יל</b> from oil.” (Ps. 104:15) ….

Paragraph 4

<b>מַצָּה</b> <i><b>Matzah</b></i> is the central item that we must explain of the three things Rabban Gamliel says one is obligated to mention on Passover night. This is because it is an obligation to eat <i>matzah</i> on this night from the <i>Torah</i>. Even <i>maror</i> is only a rabbinic obligation. (We mention <i>matzah</i>) in order to make sure we are especially conscious of its observance, as is stated in Scripture, “You shall observe the [Feast of] Unleavened Bread…” (Ex 12:17) We mention <i>pesach</i> and <i>maror</i> in order to arouse God’s compassion so that when God sees our suffering, the Divine will pass over to the end of time and redeem us. When the <i>Haggadah</i> states, “To commemorate that our ancestors' dough was not yet able to rise…” it means to say that our ancestors “had not yet become leavened” while they were in Egypt, for they had only entered forty-nine gates of impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">And had not the fiftieth gate of impurity at which point they would become <i>hametz</i>. לְהַחֲמִיץ means both to become leavened, to rise, and to sour or spoil.</i> The word <b>מַצָּה</b> <i>matzah</i> comes from the word <b>מצץ</b> which means, to press, suck out, or to push out; in other words, God pushed us out from among the Egyptians. Therefore, that is why this special bread is called <i>matzah.</i> <br><b>ואולם</b> <b>However,</b> it is fitting to carefully read the language of the <i>Maggid</i> when he says, “To commemorate that our ancestors' dough did not to rise…” <b>לְהַחֲמִיץ</b> “To rise” is a transitive verb, like <i>lihatzdik</i> (to cause justice for X), <i>lihatir</i> (to entreat X ), <i>lihamtir</i> (caused to rain to fall on X) etc, when it could have said, <i>lichametz</i> or <i>lihitchametz</i> (it become leavened). Further, the <i>Maggid</i> states, “until (<i>ad</i>) the King of the kings of kings, the Blessed Holy One, was revealed to them and redeemed them…” which implies that after God was revealed God’s self, (their dough) became leavened. And if it had not become leavened at all, then the verse would have said, <b>על שנגלה עליהם</b> “Because God was revealed to them…”<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between עד ad, until, and al על because, would seem to be as follows. If the word is עד then it suggests that “only once God appeared” was there leavening. If it is al על, because God appeared, would suggest that when God appeared the dough stopped leavening.</i> Furthermore, what proof is there, in the verse, “And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt…” when it implies that the dough did not become leavened because God revealed God’s self? This verse implies that the dough didn't rise because they fled from Egypt hastily and there was no time to delay for the dough to become leavened! When they were traveling there was not enough time to allow leavening, because while they were making dough it did not have time to rise. <br><b>אמנם. However,</b> one needs to know that human beings are referred to as “dough” (in the <i>Talmud</i>) and that the sages compared the evil inclination to “the leaven in the dough that prevents (us from fulfilling God’s will).”<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">BT Berachot 17a</i> Also, the Sages said that, “Adam the first man,” is called “the <i>ḥalla</i> at the completion of the world.”<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshit Rabbah 14:1, 17:8, Based on a note in Sefaria - Challah is a portion that is separated after the completion of the making of dough, and is endowed with sanctity, given to a priest to eat. Adam was intended to be the sacred finale to the creation of the world.</i> In other words, in relation to the other nations who came into the world, Israel was considered holier than any of them, like the <i>challah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">While we often refer to challah as the bread we eat on Shabbat, in point of fact, challah is the bit of dough that we remove for the kohanim or today that is burned and destroyed.</i> that is taken from the dough. Just as there is a difference between one type of dough and another - some is made from wheat, others from barley and some from legumes, so too there is a difference between one nation and another. Israel is compared to wheat in many places, and therefore, the evil inclination rules over Israel more than other nations. <br>Behold, when Abraham came and made God known to the world, the other nations should have believed him. For he debated with the philosophers of his time and convinced them with many proofs that there is one God who rules over everything and that God created the world as was mentioned in the words of the elders. Despite this, since they were following their forefathers’ traditions, they didn’t think it was such a sin if they didn’t change their customs. Besides, it’s hard to change from one set of beliefs to another. Besides, Abraham did not perform miracles in order to convince them to believe in God and he did not speak in God’s name like the prophets because he was not commanded to do this. <br>But when the Israelites left Egypt, God’s Divinity and power was known throughout the world, and the nations should have converted or, at the very least, they should have come to believe that there is no god like Israel’s God. Even though they were filled with terror, they refused to rise up or tremble before God. Just the opposite, they sought to join others in battle, like Amalek, Sichon and Og, and the kings of Canaan. Their heart grew even more sour than it already was and they deserved to be punished. This is what the <i>Maggid</i> writes: “The <i>matzah</i> which we eat, for what reason? The dough of our ancestors' (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) did not cause “leavening'' in the nations.” That is, it did not make known the “leavening” in them so that they would be found liable and would be punished for their stubbornness. (This did not happen) until the Holy One revealed Himself before the Egyptians and redeemed them, as is stated, “God performed marvels in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, the plain of Zoan.” (Ps. 78:12) God appeared before them with miracles, wonders and many signs. Only then did they recognize their leavening <b>חימוצם</b>, their inability to believe in God and that there is only one God. Therefore we eat <i>matzah</i> so that our fear of God will constantly be before us. By remembering that God took us out of Egypt and commanded us to to obey the <b>מצוות</b> <i>mitzvot</i>. The word <b>מצות</b> <i>matzot</i> is spelled the same as <i>mitzvot.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">The words <i>matzot</i> and <i>mitzvot</i> are similar though Mitzvot has an extra<i> vav</i> - though it can be written without it.</i> The <i>Maggid</i> brings a proof from the verse, “"And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt into <i>matzah</i> cakes…” (Ex. 12:39) It would have been enough to say, “And they baked the dough into matzot when they fled from Egypt.” But the intention of the verse is to say that the dough was called <b>עוגות</b> <i>uggot</i>, cakes, but now they called it <i>matzot</i>, a reference to the <i>matzot</i> that were hinted at there. This was so their hearts would not become soured/leavened like the nations that had become soured/leavened and how they became soured/leavened when they were expelled from Egypt. They should have gone out in the same way as “Great multitude.”<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Erev Rav</i> refers to the many Egyptians and other peoples who followed the Israelites out of Egypt</i> <br>Since Israel committed evil in the eyes of God by making the Golden Calf, certainly one might say that it was better that Egypt did not leave with them since they accrued some merit by not leaving Egypt (with Israel). If they had left with Israel, there is no doubt that the other nations would have also converted, something that the other nations did not do when they saw how stubborn Egypt was, so that they were smitten by plagues. This allowed the nations to say that Egypt knew that the Holy One was only the God of the Hebrews. If they had reason to believe that there was no god but God they would have believed. If the Egyptians did not part from their service to their god why should we do more than them? But this was not enough of a claim because the other nations could also say, the Egyptians were fools and everyone knew that they were a stubborn nation and they could have prevented the plagues which struck them but they didn’t! <br>

Paragraph 6

<b>מָרוֹר זֶה שֶׁאָנוּ אוֹכְלִים</b> <b>“The maror which we eat…”</b> Let us examine why the sages chose <i>hazeret</i><sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">"A bitter vegetable, often romaine lettuce, placed on the seder plate"</i> <b>חֲזֶרֶת</b> (for the bitter herbs) over <b>מָרוֹר</b> <i>maror.</i> For Scripture commands us to eat <i>maror</i> with the Passover offering, and certainly if there was no herb found whose name is <i>maror</i> then it would have been good for us to use another, or something that causes the same results. Since there is an herb called <i>maror</i>, as the<i> Mishnah</i> states, “And these are the vegetables with which a person can fulfill his obligation to eat bitter herbs on Passover: <i>ḥazeret</i>, chervil [<i>tamkha</i>], field eryngo [<i>ḥarḥavina</i>], endives [<i>olashin</i>], and <i>maror</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnah Pesachim 2:6</i> why don’t we choose the one that is expressly called <i>maror</i> instead of <i>ḥazeret</i> (for the bitter herbs)? <br>It may be that this is because the sages said, the <i>mitzvah</i> is with <i>ḥazeret;</i> because <i>ḥazeret</i> is also called <b>חַסָּא</b> <i>hassa,</i> lettuce, because God had compassion (<i>ḥassa</i>) upon us<i> .</i><sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">BT Pesachim 39a</i> It is as if they were saying, “It is true that it would have been more appropriate to take <i>maror</i> since this is explicitly stated in the <i>Torah</i>. But since <i>ḥazeret</i> is also called<i> ḥassa,</i> and the Holy One, had compassion, <i>ḥassa,</i> upon us and redeemed us, it is appropriate to eat<i> ḥazeret.</i> But we still need to understand why this is the case and why it (<i>ḥazeret)</i> is what it is. Why is it that God had compassion upon us and yet we are still commanded to eat <i>maror</i>, and that the commandment came after the redemption? We shouldn't have had to exchange it with <i>ḥazeret</i> if the taste was not appropriate! It appears to say that the sages saw that the different types of herbs that are used for <i>maror</i> allude to the different exiles. <i>Maror</i> was an allusion to Egyptian exile and <i>ḥazeret</i> is an allusion to the present exile since we need to arouse God’s compassion to send a redeemer to redeem us.. That is why the sages said it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to use <i>ḥazeret</i> now. It could be that in each era they chose an herb that alluded to that exile. They were ordered as follows: <i>Maror</i> was for the Egyptian exile because they embittered our lives with hard labor. <i>Ḥarḥavina</i> alludes to the Babylonian exile because they destroyed our land and our Holy temple. <i>Tamkha</i> alluded to Media/Persian exile because the Holy One supported us and helped us in the rebuilding of the Temple. Or else it is because God supported us against the will of our enemies who sought to accuse us. Or it could refer to God’s support that we did not fall at the advice of Haman. <i>Olashin</i> refers to the exile by the Greeks who passed decrees against Israel so that they couldn’t study <i>Torah</i>. It is called <i>olashin</i> which is an abbreviation of <i>Ol Shin</i>, <i>Shin</i> from the word<i> shinun</i>, learning, that is, they took from them the yoke of learning. Or it (<i>olashin</i>) may come from the expression <b>שן סלעים</b> <i>shen selaim,</i> a rocky crag<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">See I Samuel 14:4 and Job 39:28 Also see Ramban on Deuteronomy 1:4 It literally means the tooth of the rock.</i> which means a strong hold because the whole world weighed down on them. Or it might be from the word , <i>sone’</i>, <b>שונא</b> hater or enemy, because we did not have an enemy who hated us as much as those who prevented us from studying Torah. <b>חֲזֶרֶת,</b> <i>hazeret,</i> refers to the present exile during which God will return us to our place as we originally were. Also <b>חֲזֶרֶת,</b> <i>hazeret, i</i>s from the expression<i> hazir,</i> boar/pig, “wild boars from the forest gnaw at it…” (Ps. 80:14) Why is it called<i> hazir</i>? Because in the future God will return the kingdom to the one to whom it belongs, speedily in our days.

Paragraph 7

<b>בְּכָל־דּוֹר וָדוֹר חַיָּב “In every generation…</b>” The proof text that is brought here is not really a proof! The <i>Maggid</i> says that, “In every generation one is obligated to see oneself as if one has gone out of Egypt, and that this obligation is even upon us who are living in exile. The <i>Maggid,</i> however, then brings a verse which states, “In order to bring us in, to give us the land which He swore unto our fathers." (Deut. 6:23) as if it had already happened. However it is possible to say that since the people in the land would say, "And He took us out from there,” (<i>Ibid</i>) even though they weren’t the ones taken out (of Egypt), we also can say, “We went out from there…” (even though we weren’t the ones who left Egypt) It is correct to say that if the Holy One had not taken our ancestors out then we, our children and our children’s children would still be subjugated there. That is why we are obligated to see ourselves as if we went forth from Egypt. God’s intention was to bring us out specifically to give us along with the rest of the Jewish people the land that God promised to our ancestors. Therefore, Scripture doesn’t say, “The land which God promised to our ancestors to give us,” since that strengthens only those who were possessing the land at that time. Rather, God said, “In order to bring us in, to give us the land which He swore unto our father,” meaning to them and us at the same time. If we had stayed in the land of Egypt even a little longer it would not have been possible for us to inherit the land because we would have become impure with Egypt.

Paragraph 2

<b>לְפִיכָךְ אֲנַחְנוּ חַיָּבִים לְהוֹדוֹת: “Therefore we are obligated to thank…”</b> Seven types of praises are brought here to the One who made all the signs, wonders, and miracles for the seven days of the week, and for the seven decades in a person’s life.<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote"><b>לְהוֹדוֹת, לְהַלֵּל, לְשַׁבֵּחַ, לְפָאֵר, לְרוֹמֵם, לְהַדֵּר, לְבָרֵךְ, לְעַלֵּה וּלְקַלֵּס</b> are the nine words of praise are found in the Ashkenazi Haggadah while only seven are in Rabbi Foa’s text<i>.</i>  <b>לְהוֹדוֹת. לְהַלֵּל. לְשַׁבֵּחַ. לְפָאֵר. לְרוֹמֵם. לְהַדֵּר. וּלְקַדֵּשׁ֙.</b> The <i>Haggadah</i> of <i>Eidot HaMizrah</i> has yet another version of this text: <b>לְהוֹדוֹת. לְהַלֵּל. לְשַׁבֵּחַ. לְפָאֵר. לְרוֹמֵם. לְהַדֵּר. וּלְקַלֵּס</b></i> This teaches that a person is obligated to set his eyes on all the kindnesses that God does. These acts were not meant to bring vengeance on Pharaoh because he refused to listen to the word of God but for our sake. Either it was because the Egyptians brought the weight of the world upon us, as Scripture states, “I will execute judgment on the nation they shall serve.” (Gen 15:14) (That is, God punished them because they subjugated the Israelites with more rigor.), or if it was because the Egyptians made them turn aside from the service to God, The <i>Torah</i> speaks of, “signs, wonders and miracles.” This is to teach that there are <i>otot</i> which are a sign to the world and are unlike the wonders which (had the power to) convince people to believe in God, like the plague of lice. When the Egyptian magicians saw this plague they said it was “the finger of God.” This was not the case with the blood and the frogs which were called signs (but not wonders). The wonders and miracles which involved overturning nature. God did all of these things in order to bring us out from slavery to freedom, from being slaves to Egypt and to enter into the service of God which is complete freedom. 
<b>מִיָּגוֹן לְשִׂמְחָה</b> <b>“From sorrow to joy”</b> The Israelites constantly worried about when the Egyptians would place a new decree on them making servitude harder on the people, since that is what the Egyptians did so regularly.
<b>וּמֵאֵבֶל לְיוֹם טוֹב</b> “<b>From mourning to festivities</b>” When the Egyptians took their sons against their will, the would mourn over them.
<b>וּמֵאֲפֵלָה לְאוֹר גָּדוֹל</b> “<b>From darkness to a great light</b>” This was the darkening of their intellect which became dense and covered so that they were unable to recognize our God, God’s ability, and the meaning of Torah which gives us the enlightenment to know God’s wonders as King David prayed, “Open my eyes, that I may perceive the wonders of Your teaching.” (Ps. 119:18) Since we are obligated in this, we should say <i>Hallelujah</i>” This refers to the <i>Hallel</i> prayers which follow that includes all the details that are mentioned.

<b>הַלְלוּיָהּ הַלְלוּ עַבְדֵי ה</b> <i><b>Hallelujah!</b></i> The matter of <i>Hallel HaMitzri</i><sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">The first two passages of<i> Hallel</i> are referred to as the Egyptian <i>Hallel</i> since they have reference to the Exodus and the splitting of the sea.</i> is an exalted matter, as is stated in the <i>Zohar,</i> Parshat Vayechi P. 232b.<sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">While Zohar Volume 1 Parshat Vayechi P. 232b does discuss the opening verses of Psalm 113, It does not appear to contain these comments or others referred to in this commentary. It seems unlikely that Rabbi Foa had a different text - he may have simply come to different conclusions based on the discussion here.</i> It is impossible to explain this according to its plain-sense meaning of the words. Rather, we need to part from the literal meaning of the verses in order to understand their intent (<i>kavanah</i>), since they are all difficult. One must do so in order to enlarge the <i>Torah.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">I believe this is a key passage understanding Rabbi Foa’s approach to text. Earlier he said that one should not part from <i>P’shat.</i> Here he adds to reasons we do so: First, when the text raises so many questions that we can only understand its intent (<i>kavanah</i>) in light of its broader interpretation. Second we use <i>Midrash</i>, a parting from the plain sense of the text in order to “enlarge the meaning of Torah.”</i> <br>(1)<sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the numbering of the questions is my addition.</i> It is fitting to raise questions about the repetition of praises in Psalm 113: “<i>Halleluyah</i>! Praise <i>(hallelu)</i>, servants of <i>HaShem</i>, praise (<i>hallelu</i>) the name of HaShem.” (2) And with whom is it speaking when it says, “<i>Halleluyah</i>?” (3) If it is with the servants of <i>HaShem</i>, it has already said so, that they should “praise <i>HaShem,</i>” and not “praise the name of <i>HaShem</i>.” (4) Further the psalm states, “from now and forever,” instead of “from the beginning and forever.” (5) Also, why does the psalm state, “From the rising of the sun in the East to its setting…” instead of “from the east to the west?” (6) And what is even more difficult is that it is known that the sun moves toward the south (in the daytime) and then toward the north (at night), as Rashi explains.<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi on Ecc. 1:5-6 - “The sun rises, and the sun sets, And glides back to where it rises. Southward blowing, Turning northward, Ever turning blows the wind; On its rounds the wind returns.” Rashi explains that the sun “always turns to the South in the daytime, and to the north in the nighttime.</i> If one praises God “from the place of its rising,'' which is the east, to “the place of its setting” in the west, then God is praised in the south but not in the north, and those who dwell in the North will not praise God. (7) What’s more, the psalmist states, “Above all nations is <i>HaShem</i>;” is this really a sign of God’s greatness? Shouldn’t God be described as “above all those above?” (8) What is the purpose of the additional letters, <i>Yud</i>, at the end of the words: <b>“</b>Who is like the Lord, our God, Who sits on high <b>הַמַּגְבִּיהִי</b>; Who looks down <b>הַמַּשְׁפִּילִי</b> upon the heavens and the earth? He brings up <b>מְקִימִי</b> the poor out of the dirt; from the refuse piles, He raises <b>לְהוֹשִׁיבִי</b> the destitute. To seat him<b>מוֹשִׁיבִי</b> with the nobles, with the nobles of his people.” (Ps. 113) <br>We have already explained above in the teaching of <i>Kama Maalot (Dayyenu)</i> that Israel was freed through the aspect of the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">In the Zohar, Jubilee almost always refers to the<i> Sephira of</i> , the third sephirah in the first triad. It is also associated with the fiftieth gate of purity. Because exists above the other sephirot before separation and differentiation takes place it is a space of complete freedom and possibility.</i> That is why the exodus is mentioned in the Torah fifty times, an allusion to the fifty gates of purity in which freedom resides. It is because of this that slaves that have had their ear pierced and now go free in the fiftieth year, and redemption is given to all of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">A slave may choose to forgo freedom in the seventh year of servitude in order to stay with his family or his master, but he still must go free when the Jubilee year arrives just as land must be returned to its original owners.</i> It is well known that the first letter <i>hei</i> in the Divine name<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yud Hei Vav He</i>i</i> refers to this <i>Sephirah (of ).</i> It includes the five ‘tens' which are 50 in the letters<i> Yud</i> and <i>Hei</i>. This is because there is no separation found between the <i>Yud</i> which alludes to the <i>sephirah</i> of <i>Chokhma</i>, and <i>Hei</i>, which alludes to the <i>sephirah</i> of /Understanding since they are always attached to one another. From this we may conclude that redemption comes from the divine aspect of which has <i>Chokhma</i> mixed with it. <br>That is why King David, begins his praise and thanksgiving with <i>Halleluyah (Hallelu Yud Hei)</i> and he does not say “Who is this who will praise the name <i>Yud Hei.”</i> He is referring to the complete foundation which also includes the final two letters of the Divine name (<i>vav hei</i>). For the <i>gematria</i> of the word <i>Hallel</i> is 65 like the value of the name HaShem <b>אדני</b> referring to the final <i>hei</i> of the tetragrammaton. And the <i>vav</i> stands for <i>Tiferet</i> in all places.<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">Thus the name <i>Halleluyah</i> contains all of the Sefirot It begins with <i>Hallel (Sefirat Malkhut</i>) or the divine name <i>HaShem; Vav</i> is for <i>Tiferet</i>, the central <i>Sefirah</i>, <i>Yud</i> hey is <i>Chokhma and</i> .This is the same as the Divine name <i>Yud (Chokhma) Hei () Vav (Tiferet) Hey (Malchut Shechinah</i>)</i> It is as if to say that <i>Hei</i> and<i> Vav</i> are praising <i>Yud Hei</i> for they are the source of redemption - this is <i>Halleluyah</i>. Afterwards the psalmist states “Praise the Servants,” this is Israel. It is their obligation to praise the name of God, that is the <i>Shechinah</i> because it was for Her that we were redeemed from Egypt so that She could be there with them, as is stated, “and God sent a messenger (<i>malakh</i>) and God freed us from Egypt.” (Nu. 20:16)<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">Possibly Rabbi Foa reads this verse, “God sent a <i>malakh</i> out of Egypt and then redeemed us to be with her!</i> as we have written above.

<b>מִמִּזְרַח שֶׁמֶשׁ עַד מְבוֹאוֹ מְהֻלָּל שֵׁם</b> <b>“From the rising of the sun in the East to its setting.”</b> It is well known that there are two opposing boundaries to be drawn. One is in space; for example, from east to west, and the other is height and depth. And for both of them one can say, “from end to end.” (Ex. 26:28, 36:33) For spatial boundaries one says, “Anywhere from one end of the earth to the other.” (Deut 13:8) And for heights and depths one would say, “Since God created man on earth, from one end of heaven to the other.” (Deut. 4:32)<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Note that the text does not quite match Rabbi Foa here. There is no text in the Bible that says “From the ends of the earth to the end of Heaven,” as far as I can tell.</i> Here the Psalmist says that God will be praised from the ends of the heavens until the ends of the earth. This means from the eastern place where the sun rises, which is the highest extreme of heaven, to its other extreme where it sets. In this way God will be praised in all of the worlds. <br><b>(עיין)</b> Consider what is written in the<i> Zohar Parshat Vayechi</i>, P. 232b.<sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">While <i>Zoha</i>r Vol. 1 <i>Parshat Vayech</i>i P. 232b does discuss the opening verses of Ps. 113, It does not appear to contain these comments or others referred to in this commentary.

The nations cannot be compared with them and those who dwell on earth are not like them. Even though it is not known on earth, God’s glory in heaven is known to the princes where they dwell. When God took us out of Egypt it was necessary for God’s power to be seen by them when they accused us, therefore they were brought here.
<b>מִי כַּיי אֱלֹהֵינוּ הַמַּגְבִּיהִי לָשָׁבֶת</b>, <b>“‘Who’ is like <i>HaShem,</i> our God, Who dwells on high.”</b> The psalmist is asking, “From where does redemption come to us?” First, one must understand the <i>Zohar,</i> about the verse, “Lift high your eyes and see: “‘Who’ (<i>mi</i>) created these.” (Is. 40:26)<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">See Zohar, Introduction 3:7, Terumah 1:2 I am uncertain which reference Foa is referring to here in his discussion or what the primary question is.

When King David said, “God lifts up the needy from the refuse heap…” it is because he saw with the holy spirit what the nations would eventually do to the site of the Holy Temple. But the Divine Presence will never leave the Western Wall. This is told to me in a story from the time of Sultan Suliaman.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">Suleiman 1494 – 1566 commonly known as Suleiman the Magnificent in the Ottoman realm, was the longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 until his death in 1566.  Under his administration, the Ottoman Empire ruled over at least 25 million people.</i> He did not know the location of the Holy Temple so he commanded (one of his subjects) to search Jerusalem for it. It came to pass that the person who was responsible for the search was about to give up, when he saw one woman with a basket filled with filth and garbage on her head. He asked her, “What is that on your head?” and she answered, “Filth!” (He asked,) “And where are you going?” (She answered,) “To a certain place,” . He asked her, “Where are you from?” She answered, “From Bethlehem.” He said to her, “Is there no place closer to Bethlehem to throw your garbage?” She answered, “We have a tradition that anyone who brings his garbage to a certain (in Jerusalem) place is fulfilling a commandment.” The appointee said to himself, “This is certainly the place!” He commanded the people to remove the garbage from that place which had turned into a dung heap. Beneath it, he revealed the holy place. He went and told King Suliman and the King was very happy. The King commanded his appointee to oversee the cleaning of the site and to wash the wall with rose water and there they made a place of prayer, causing God again to dwell in this site. The people came when it was built and the Divine Presence dwelled there again. See how evil has befallen us from our enemies. For the woman who spoke to Suliman’s appointee was an Aramean (a non-Jew), and her intention was to desecrate the Holy Temple and cause God’s presence to depart from it, God forbid. It was for this reason that King David said, “from the refuse piles, He raises the destitute…” It should be understood plainly: They made the place of holiness a garbage dump and from there they raised the destitute (the Divine Presence).

Paragraph 4

<b>בְּצֵאת יִשְׂרָאֵל</b> <b>“When Israel's went out of Egypt.”</b> When <i>Beit Ya’akov</i> and <i>Beit Yisrael</i> are mentioned together, <i>Beit Yisrael</i> refers to the Jewish men and <i>Beit Ya’akov</i> refers to the Jewish women, as Scripture states, “Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob and declare to the children of Israel…” (Ex. 19:3) as Rashi writes.<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 19:3 Rashi - “To the house of Jacob:” This denotes the women — to them you shall speak in gentle language “And tell the children (sons) of Israel:” explain to the men the punishments and the details of the commandments in words that are as hard (distasteful) as wormwood.” In Rabbinic literature <i>Bayit</i>, house, is often used to refer to one’s wife.</i> When the Israelites left Egypt the other nations said, “Are the offspring really related to the house of Jacob? If the Egyptians ruled over the men, how much more so (did they rule over) the women? It was as if, God needed to prove the Israelites were of proper lineage, as is stated, “the tribes of <i>Yah</i> gave testimony for Israel,” (Ps. 122:4) <i>Yah</i>, God, testified about them that they were the children of (Israelite) fathers, as is written, “Enochites…. Pelluites…” (Nu. 26:5) That which is stated, “When Israel left Egypt…” The House of Jacob, the women, left Egypt when the non-Jews were spreading rumors that they were the illegitimate children of a foreign nation. The women of Israel were righteous and closed their door (to everyone but) their husbands, as is written, “ A garden locked is my own, my bride, a fountain locked, a sealed-up spring.” (Song 4:12) There was but one among them and Scripture publicized it!<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. 23:10-12</i> The (faithfulness of the Israelite women) caused the elevation of the Divine Presence, so to speak, because all the commandments which Israel performs adds to the power of might above, as is written, “With God we shall create might.” (Ps. 60:14) Thus the Psalm continues, “Judah became His holy one.” (Psalm 114:2) If it was speaking about the tribe of Judah it should have said, “Judah was…” Rather, Judah is a combination of the two names of God: the tetragrammaton (<i>Havayah</i>) and <i>Adonai</i>. The letter <i>dalet</i> alludes to the four letters of <i>Adonai. I</i>t is called<i> dalet</i> because it is needy and has no powers of its own, like the moon which has no light of its own except for the light it receives from the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">This expression is commonly used in Kabbalah to describe <i>Malchut</i> or <i>Shechinah</i>.</i> “When Israel left Egypt,” then the <i>Shechinah</i> also left with them and She was their holy place for she was sanctified.
<b>יִ֝שְׂרָאֵ֗ל מַמְשְׁלוֹתָֽיו :</b> “<b>Israel, God's dominion.”</b> (Ps. 114:2) The Sages of Truth say that Israel and Jacob are single pillar; from the middle up is Israel and from the middle down is Jacob. Similarly, Rachel and Leah are called humility <i>(anavah</i>) and fear/awe (<i>yirah</i>). Leah is above and Rachel is below her. Regarding this the sages said, “That which wisdom- <i>Chochmah (</i>is complete wisdom<i>) is</i> made as a crown for its <i>head</i>-Rosh-<b>ראש</b>, humility- <i>Anavah</i> made as a heel-<i>Ekev</i>-<b>עקב</b> for its sandal,”<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Shaarei Orah</i> Joseph GIkatilah, Ninth Gate, Second <i>Sefirah:</i> https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Orah%2C_Ninth_Gate%2C_Second_Sefirah.62?vhe=Shaarei_Orah,_grimoar&amp;lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en . The quote continues in the text: “All this is included in the secret of these two <i>Sefirot</i>, Crown-<i>Keter</i> and Wisdom-<i>Chochmah</i>, both of which are included in the secret of the <i>Yod</i>-י, which includes both Humility-<i>Anavah</i> and Wisdom- <i>Chochmah</i>, with fear-<i>Yirah</i>-<i>יראה</i> adhering to both, fear-<i>Yirah-יראה</i> being the place of their bonding and adhesion.” It would appear that Israel refers to keter and Chochma and is parallel to Leah.</i> (“The effect of humility is fear of <i>HaShem</i>,”) (Pro. 22:4) And it is also written, “ The beginning of wisdom is the fear of <i>HaShem</i>.” (Ps. 111:10) It would appear that below is parallel to <i>Ya'akov</i>, but not above which is parallel to <i>Yisrael.</i> In an hour of favor Rachel rises up to Israel. That is what is stated here, “”When Judah became His holy one, ” (Ps. 114:2) referring to Rachel, together they are sanctified. She ascends until “Israel” becomes her “dominion,” instead of Jacob. 
Then, “The sea saw them and fled.” (Ps. 114:3) The sea is an epithet for the husks<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">The husks is a reference to the powers of evil in Lurianic Kabbalah.</i> whose waves roar (in their desire) to overturn the world, but when holiness comes and overtakes them they flee before her and go down to the depths of the netherworld. “The Jordan River ran backward…. The Mountains, skipping like rams…” (Ps. 114:3-4) These are the four gifts of the husks , all of which shattered because of the strength of the Holiness. <br><b>ואולם.</b> However, according to the plain meaning of the text one must explain why it says, “The sea saw them and fled,” in the past tense but, “the Jordan River will run backwards,” in the future tense. Further, how is it that, “The mountains skipped like rams, hills like sheep?” Since it is known that at the time of the splitting of the sea it was necessary for Moses to raise his hands over the sea, as is stated, “And you lift up your rod and hold out your arm over the sea and split it…” (Ex. 14:16) it would seem that the main disagreement between Moses and the sea was that the sea did not want to split as we wrote above. It was necessary for him to force it to split against the sea’s will. Only then did the Jordan River conclude that it could not refuse completely. Rather Israel immediately gathered on the shore and the <i>Kohanim,</i> the bearers of the ark, immersed their feet in its waters and continued to go down until they had passed through. And so it happened. And because they received this upon themselves at the time of the splitting of the Reed Sea, therefore the Jordan River drew back, as if when the sea saw and fled, certainly the Jordan River also would also draw back. The Psalmist said that the river flowed back until it reached the place of the Jordan crossing…<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">The last part of this passage is not clear to me - readers are invited to aid in the translation.</i>
<b>הֶ֭הָרִים רָקְד֣וּ כְאֵילִ֑ים</b> <b>“The mountains skipped like rams.”</b> (Ps. 114:4) This statement is made about the two mountains which were found at the Arnon River crossing at which the Amorites hid and they traveled from one site to the other like the rams which would butt one another. <sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 21:24 Arnon is first mentioned in Num. 21:24 as the border between Moab and the Amorites.

<b>גְּ֝בָע֗וֹת כִּבְנֵי־צֹֽאן</b> <b>“The hills like sheep.”</b> (Ps. 114:4) It is the nature of sheep to hop about and run a little and then to return to their mother.

<b>מַה־לְּךָ֣ הַ֭יָּם כִּ֣י תָנ֑וּס</b> <b>“What alarmed you, O sea, that you fled…”</b> (Ps. 114:5) The Sages state in the <i>Midrash</i>, when Moses went to the sea and told it to split its waters so that Israel could pass through, it said, “I don’t want to!” Moses turned to God and said, “The sea doesn’t want to split its waters.” What did the Holy One do? God placed His right hand on the right hand of Moses and showed it to the sea. Immediately upon seeing this, the sea fled before God. Moses then said, “What alarmed you, O sea, that you fled?” The sea answered, “It is not because of you but because of the God of Jacob!” At first glance it might appear that Moses was mocking the sea. Heaven forbid that a person like Moses was speaking harshly to any creature in the world. Further, what other reason is there to say, “Jordan, that you ran backward…” <br><b>אמנם</b>: However, it is fitting to note that two holy names (of God) are connected here at the sea. The first is the name of 72 letters which is derived from three verses: <b>וַיַּסַּ֨ע</b> (Ex 14:19) <sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">“The angel of God, who had been going ahead of the Israelite army, now moved and followed behind them; and the pillar of cloud shifted from in front of them and took up a place behind them,”</i>, <b>וַיָּבֹ֞א</b> (Ex. 14:22)<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">“And it came between the army of the Egyptians and the army of Israel. Thus there was the cloud with the darkness, and it cast a spell upon the night, so that one could not come near the other all through the night.”</i>, <b>וַיֵּט֩</b> (Ex. 14:27)<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">“Moses held out his arm over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state, and the Egyptians fled at its approach. But <i>HaShem</i> hurled the Egyptians into the sea.”</i>. And the second is the name of 42 letters that were inscribed on the staff of God that was in the hand of Moses through whose power he brought the plagues on the Egyptians in Egypt. The mnemonics of the plagues was <i>Detza”kh, Ada”sh Ba’acha”v</i>. In Gematria their small number (<i>Mispar katan</i>) is 42.<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">Mispar Katan (Heb: מספר קטן) is the value of the letters but without the zeros after large numbers. (ex. "Yud" is 1 instead of 10, "Tav" is 4 instead of 400).</i> The staff was in the right hand of Moses. When Moses told the sea to split and to let the Israelites pass through, it refused, as was mentioned. Moses didn’t want to command the sea as Pinchas ben Yair commanded the River Ginai to split its waters,<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">BT Hulin 7a</i> out of respect for Israel. Moses wanted the sea to respond honorably and part for them according to the commandment. Then, Moses went to God and said to Him, the water refuses to part. What did the Holy One do? God placed His right hand, which is the name of 72 letters, the name of <i>Hesed</i> (lovingkindness) on the name of 42 letters which was the right hand of Moses, and when the sea saw this it fled before it. Moses wanted to publicize how great the power of these names was, causing the sea to split. Therefore he asked, “What alarmed you, O sea, that you fled.” The sea answered, “It is the God of Jacob <b>אֱל֣וֹהַּ יַעֲקֹֽב</b>.” <i>Eloah</i> <b>אֱל֣וֹהַּ</b> in <i>Gematria</i> is forty two to teach us that the great name of God… For God separates one thing from another just as happened in creation; with his power the waters were separated , half of them above and half below. Similarly when a person does the body and soul are separated and differentiated. God then gives each wings with this name as a means of merit. A sign of this, “Each of them had six wings:” (Is 6:2) Each name is made up of six letters. The psalm says <i>Eloah Ya’akov</i> and not <i>eloah Israel</i> because <i>eloah ya’akov</i> counting the words is seventy two<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear to me what system of Gematria he is using here to reach the number 72. Possibly this is based on the Mispar Siddur in which each letter is given a value from 1 to 22 - <i>eloah</i> Yaakov then comes to 71 place the words if we add one is 72 or 73. See Explanations of Gematria Methods with Charts</i> when combined with the words and it was to save Israel because it represents <i>Hesed.</i> It is found that the two names together are on the right side. Regarding this Scripture states, “Your right hand, <i>HaShem</i>, glorious in power, Your right hand, <i>HaShem</i>, shatters the foe!” (Ex 15:6)

Second Cup of Wine



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה</b> <b>“Praised are you…”</b> Even though we already acknowledged that God “Granted us life and sustenance and permitted us to reach this season,” over a separate cup (of wine), the sages saw fit to decree this cup as well. The second cup is meant to arouse God’s compassion to bring us back a second time and redeem us as God promised. That which is stated,<b>“bring us to other appointed times and holidays that will come to greet us in peace,”</b> is nor referring to Shavuot or Sukkot which come after Passover. Rather it refers to the future redemption when the Exodus from Egypt will be secondary and the gathering of the exiles will become essential. It says, <b>“When it comes to greet us,”</b> because each day we come closer to the end time. <b>“Joyful in the building of Your city,”</b> in which God will place a wall of fire about it. <b>“And happy in Your worship.”</b> Joy will not be a result of going from sorrow to happiness, that is, we went forth to relief and took pleasure in all the promises which were made to us. Rather the essence (of the joy) will be that we merited to worship God upon returning, enjoying it without fear of other nations who might try to stop us. Thus, the passage goes on to say, <b>“We will rejoice <i>(Semeichim</i>) and be happy <i>(Sassim</i>) in You.”</b><sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Why does it say <i>Semeichim</i> and <i>Sassim?</i></i> “In You” - in Your salvation and in you - Your <i>Torah</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">Added to Rabbi Foa’s text: "This is based on Rabbi Foa’s version and the Version of the Prayers as found in <i>Shaar HaShamayim.”</i></i> The renewal of the Holy Temple which will come down from heaven, completed and rebuilt, there “<b>We shall eat from the offerings</b>” - with complete satisfaction, <b>“ and from the Passover sacrifices,” -</b> in the plural because then recalling the Passover story will not be enough; then we will also eat the Passover sacrifice as our ancestors did in Egypt, and afterwards over the generations, the Passover sacrifice of the generations. For this will be a second Exodus. God will pass over our houses and enlighten us as the One did originally and without limit. God will do this until he places us beneath His Holy Spirit and we will know how to sing a new song. It won’t be like the song our ancestors who were redeemed from Egypt sang but a song more praiseworthy…. “a new song upon our redemption from subjugation to the nations, and the restoration of our souls from subjugation to the evil inclination so that it cannot incite us as we wrote regarding the four questions <i>Mah Nishtana</i>.

Hallel

Songs of Praise and Thanks



Paragraph 1

<i>Since I did not merit writing new insights into the Seder after the meal except for the Psalm which is called Hallel HaGadol (Ps. 136) I debated whether I should include it with the Haggadah or not. Afterwards, I said, since it is a passage pertaining to the event, I will give thanks with my whole heart and I will speak of God’s kindness, for they are forever. Rabbi Foa</i> <br><b>הוֹדוּ לַיי כִּי טוֹב</b> <b>“Give thanks to <i>HaShem</i> for God is good...”</b> (Ps. 136) The Sages call this psalm <i>Hallel HaGadol</i> since in it one praises God who feeds, sustains and maintains the world according to a <i>Torah</i> of living-kindness for 26 generations<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">There are 26 praises in Hallel HaGadol, for the twenty six generations.</i> from the creation until the giving of the <i>Torah.</i> Actually, according to (the principles of) justice God should have turned the world back to chaos after Adam and Cain sinned. But the Exodus from Egypt was essential to the receiving of the <i>Torah</i>, as is stated, “And when you have freed the people from Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain,” (Ex. 3:12) and the essence of this psalm is about the loving-kindness that God showed to maintain the world even without the <i>Torah,</i> we continue to praise and celebrate how God took us out of Egypt. At the proper time, one should praise God with this song of praise. <br><b>ואולם.</b> However, one should note the connection between these praises and the 26 generations (between creation and Sinai). Even though the numbers (of verses and generations) are the same, I might have thought that the 26 generations was referring (to the generations) from the birth of Peretz to (King) Tzidkiyahu during which God watched over Israel with a <i>Torah</i> of loving-kindness and did not pour out wrath upon them, casting them out, even though they rebelled against from the time that Jacob’s sons died and Egypt enslaved them. In every generation the people angered God. <br><b>אמנם</b> However, the Psalms are true and their words are true, and one should not part from their words, for, “The mysteries of <i>HaShem</i> are for those who fear Him; to them He makes known His covenant.” (Ex. 25:14) For one cannot say that the Holy Spirit was on the tongue of King David, (and his words) refers to the generations from Peretz to King Tzidkiyahu, for then the world would have returned to chaos, and there was more loving-kindness from that time forward because God did not wipe them out. It is better to say that the verses of this Psalm were for the 26 generations in which there was no <i>Torah</i> yet. From that time forward, loving-kindness was unnecessary because <i>Torah</i> helped maintain the world.  <br>God performed many acts of loving-kindness in the world besides those that are mentioned in Scripture such as, the <i>manna</i>, the well and above all of them the giving of the <i>Torah</i>. It is fitting to give a reason why it mentions these events as opposed to others. <b>נ"ל</b> Each of the verses (of Psalm 136) refers to one of the 26 generations which preceded the giving of the <i>Torah.</i> King David wished to praise God in the name of the Jewish people and thank <i>HaShem</i> for the acts of Kindness performed for them. (King David) begins with the creation of the world because God created the world for them, as Scripture states, “In the beginning <i>(b’reishit</i>) God created,” (meaning) ‘For the sake of Israel, who are called <i>Reishit</i>, God created…’ God suffered the world for 26 generations even though none of them were unfit, since in the end Israel would receive the <i>Torah.</i> The first verse is for the generation of Adam. He said, <b>“Praise (<i>hodu</i>) <i>HaShem</i>; for He is good,”</b> (Ps. 136:1) David praises God who forgave <b>Adam</b>’s sin. This is what the <i>Midrash</i> states; The Sabbath defended Adam, keeping him from dying. As a result Adam said, “A psalm. A song; for the Sabbath day.” (Ps 92:1) The Sabbath then said to him, “It is good to praise (<i>lihodot) HaShem</i>…” (Ps. 92:2) And so he did.<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Midrash Tehilim/Shochar Tov</i> Psalm 92</i> Further, the sages asked in a <i>Midrash</i> , “What is the meaning of: “Give thanks to the Lord for He is good” (Ps. 136:1)? It means giving thanks to <i>HaShem</i>’s who exacts one’s debt, (the punishment for a person’s sins and wickedness,) in accordance with the goodness of each individual. God punishes each person based on his means. He punishes a wealthy person by taking his ox, and He punishes a poor person by means of his sheep. He punishes the orphan by taking away his egg, and He punishes the widow by means of her chicken…” <sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">See BT <i>Pesachim</i> 118a The translation is taken from Sefaria.</i> The rich person is the first human being, Adam, had the strength to bear the punishment which was meted out to him because Adam was fastidious and enjoyed all the pleasures in the Garden of Eden. When Adam went out from the Garden to work the land with his hands and suffer greatly before he could eat - it is a wonder he didn’t die. But Adam developed great strength from all of this suffering. That is why he was called, “the rich person who paid with “bulls with horns and hooves.” (Ps. 69:32) <br>
<b>ה֭וֹדוּ לֵאלֹהֵ֣י הָאֱלֹהִ֑ים</b> <b>“Praise the God of gods…” (Ps. 136:2)</b> This is for the generation of <b>Seth</b> who didn’t live in the generation of idolatry. The whole world knew that <i>Hashem</i> was the “God of gods.” This was not the case in the time of Enosh; they began to call to God by other names rather than pray to God with the name of <i>HaShem</i>. Therefore, it says for him, <b>“Praise the Lord of lords,” (Ps. 136:3)</b> because at that time they had to acknowledge that <i>HaShem</i> was “the Lord,” and Patron of all below. God inundated them with the sea and drowned a third of them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 38:10</i> But in his loving kindness, he let the rest (of humanity) live even though they weren’t worthy.

In Lamekh’s generation men began giving their wives a sterility potion so that they wouldn’t get pregnant and so their beauty would not be diminished. Rashi gives a reason for the names Ada and Tzilah. Tzilah was so called because she sat in the shadow of an adorned house like a bride while Ada was wrapped in a cloak like a mourner who was about to give birth. <br>It is well known that the Holy one does not give the key to childbirth over to human beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">See BT Ta’anit 2a, Though Rabbi Foa lists the reference to the first chapter of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>.</i> Even though Tzilah was barren because of the infertility potion which Lamekh gave her, still she gave birth to a child.

He wrote about this on tablets of marble in order to publicize it to the world. As a result many people turned from the idols that they worshipped. That is why he was called Mahalalel. It was a way of saying that it is fitting and obligatory for us to praise God, the master of loving-kindness, who performs kind deeds for us so as not to bring a flood upon us in our time. Regarding this, King David, of blessed memory, wrote the verse, “Who made the heavens with wisdom…” (Ps. 136:5) It was to remove from their hearts their first assumption, that God had left the world and allowed it to be ruled over by angels. (Some believed) that the heavens were watched over by them and not by God. Rather God made the heavens , so that God constantly creates and sustains them and watches over them.
<b>לְרֹקַ֣ע הָ֭אָרֶץ עַל־הַמָּ֑יִם “Who spread the earth over the waters…” (Ps. 136:6)</b> Refers to the generation of <b>Yered</b> the world became diminished from what it was. This was so because they added anger to their sins. It was in his generation that Uza and Azel came down from heaven and went astray by pursuing the daughters of human beings.<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 6:1ff</i> Despite God the Holy Blessed One treated them with kindness and did not punish the generation.
<b>לְ֭עֹשֵׂה אוֹרִ֣ים גְּדֹלִ֑ים “Who made the great light.” (Ps. 136:7)</b> This refers to the generation of <b>Enoch</b> who became an angel, greater than all the other angels… whose face was brighter than the illumination of the firmament and whose light extended to great distance. This is referred to in the expression “Who made the great light.”
<b>אֶת־הַ֭שֶּׁמֶשׁ לְמֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת בַּיּ֑וֹם “The sun which dominates the day.” (Ps. 136: 8)</b> Refers to the generation of the righteous person,<b>Methuselah</b>. When he died, the flood came and the lights no longer served (the world). It was as if the sun descended when it still should have been bringing light. Therefore the day was called the time that the sun dominates. Because all the time that he was in the world, he did not see the darkness of suffering.
<b>אֶת־הַיָּרֵ֣חַ וְ֭כוֹכָבִים לְמֶמְשְׁל֣וֹת בַּלָּ֑יְלָה</b> <b>“The moon and the stars to dominate the night,” (Ps. 136:9)</b> This refers to the generation of <b>Lemech</b> since he too was a righteous man. After he died (God brought) the great flood so that he wouldn’t have to see his children drowned. Despite this, in comparison with his father he was like the moon next to the light of the sun. The stars were like Noah and his sons that ruled by night; that is in the ark in which there was no light.
<b>לְמַכֵּ֣ה מִ֭צְרַיִם בִּבְכוֹרֵיהֶ֑ם</b> <b>“Who struck Egypt through their first born.” (Ps. 136:10)</b> This refers to the generation of <b>Noah</b> in whose time God smote all life with the waters of the flood. The Psalm states, “Their firstborn;” because, just as God smote the Egyptians by way of their firstborn, since it is not the way of ethics for a child to strike his parent (be the cause of his parents punishment), so too in the generation of the flood God smote all the animals, as the verse states, “That same day Noah and Noah’s sons… went into the ark…” (Gen. 7:13) They were not like the rest of the world whose fear and terror did not occur until that last moment.
<b>וַיּוֹצֵ֣א יִ֭שְׂרָאֵל מִתּוֹכָ֑ם</b> <b>“God brought Israel out of their midst.” (Ps. 136:11)</b> This refers to the generation of <b>Shem</b>, from whom Israel was descended. The word <i>Vayotzei</i> - God brought out - is a reference to the generation of Noah and his sons who went out of the ark. Ham and Canaan immediately sinned (as soon as they left the ark). This was the judgment of their generations and yet in God’s loving-kindness God continued to sustain them.
<b>בְּיָ֣ד חֲ֭זָקָה</b> <b>“With a strong hand...” (Ps. 136:12)</b> This refers to the generation of <i>Arpachshad</i>. I did not find any <i>Midrashim</i> regarding his life, even though I had heard that in one book they wrote great things about him but I did not merit to find it. Therefore, I was not able to find any references to this verse. Similarly, with regard to the verse, <b>לְגֹזֵ֣ר יַם־ס֭וּף לִגְזָרִ֑ים “Who split apart the Sea of Reeds,” (Ps. 136: 13)</b> which refers to the generation of <i>Shelah</i>.
<b>וְהֶעֱבִ֣יר יִשְׂרָאֵ֣ל בְּתוֹכ֑וֹ “And made Israel pass through it.” (Ps. 136:14)</b> This refers to the generation of <i>Eber</i> because the word <i>Liha’avir</i> is spelled <i>Eber Yud, Hay Vav.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">I am not certain how he understands this.</i> He was called Eber because he served <i>HaShem</i>, a great and awesome God. He was the absolute leader to our forefather Israel and to the rest of the nations. When Scripture states, “Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem,” (Ex. 12:6) it means that he went to the home of Eber as we wrote in <i>Parshat Lech Lecha</i> but the other people of his generation did not do so. Therefore that generation was worthy of destruction but the Holy One sustained them according to the <i>Torah</i> of loving kindness.
<b>וְנִ֘עֵ֤ר פַּרְעֹ֣ה וְחֵיל֣וֹ בְיַם־ס֑וּף</b> <b>“Who hurled Pharaoh and his Army into the Sea of Reeds.” (Ps. 136:15)</b> This refers to the generation of <b>Peleg.</b> In his time the earth was divided but God shook them up and sustained them.
<b>לְמוֹלִ֣יךְ עַ֭מּוֹ בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר “Who led His people through the wilderness,” (Ps. 136:16)</b> This refers to the generation of <b>Reu.</b> Just as God shepherded (<i>Ro’eh</i>) the people through the wilderness for forty years, so God shepherded the generation of Reu with loving- kindness - that is why he was called Reu. Or it could be from the word Reiyah, grazing; in his generation there was a famine.
<b>לְ֭מַכֵּה מְלָכִ֣ים גְּדֹלִ֑ים</b> <b>“Who struck down great kings.,” (Ps. 136:17)</b> refers to the generation of Serug. It was at that time that the nations began to fight with one another - that is why he was called Serug, like the verse, “Imposed upon my neck,” (Lam. 1:14) This is an expression of confusion.
<b>וַֽ֭יַּהֲרֹג מְלָכִ֣ים אַדִּירִ֑ים “God slew mighty kings.” (Ps. 136: 18)</b> refers to the generation of <b>Nachor</b>. In his days Nimrod ruled who caused the whole world to rebel against God. He brought anger upon the world, and therefore he was called Nachor, the same letters of <i>Haron</i>.
<b>לְ֭סִיחוֹן מֶ֣לֶךְ הָאֱמֹרִ֑י</b> <b>“Sichon, the king of Amorites,” (Ps. 136:19)</b> refers to the generation of <b>Terach</b>, father of Abraham. He was a chief minister of Nimrod as is written in the book of <i>Divrei Hayamim</i>. Just as Sichon was the doorway to the land of Canaan because everyone trusted his might, so too, everyone trusted the might of Terach. He was a great man and was referred to as the King of the Amorites, from the word Amirah, speaking. This was because he spoke libel against his son Abraham to Nimrod.
<b>וּ֭לְעוֹג מֶ֣לֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֑ן</b> <b>“Or king of Bashan,” (Ps.136:20)</b> refers to <b>Abraham</b> because it was in his time, Sihon was the refugee who came and told Abraham that his brother’s son was being held hostage. They debated matters of astronomy and theology.
<b>וְנָתַ֣ן אַרְצָ֣ם לְנַחֲלָ֑ה “God gave their land as a heritage” (Ps. 136:21)</b> refers to Isaac, for the land was given to him as an inheritance to be mainly for him and his offspring, the seed of Abraham.
<b>נַ֭חֲלָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵ֣ל עַבְדּ֑וֹ “A heritage to his servant, Israel,” (Ps. 136:22)</b> refers to the generation of <b>Jacob</b>. For the land was given to Jacob as an inheritance because he served God with all his heart.
<b>שֶׁ֭בְּשִׁפְלֵנוּ זָ֣כַר לָ֑נוּ “God took note of our degradation.” (Ps. 136:23)</b> this refers to <b>Kehat</b>, for our enemies blunted (<i>hikhu</i>) their teeth with idolatry.
<b>וַיִּפְרְקֵ֥נוּ מִצָּרֵ֑ינוּ</b> <b>“God rescued us from our enemies,” (Ps. 136:24)</b> <b>נֹתֵ֣ן לֶ֭חֶם לְכׇל־בָּשָׂ֑ר</b> <b>“Who gives bread to all flesh,” (Ps. 136:25</b>) This is the generation of <b>Amram</b>. For he was like an Omer of grain that was sufficient to sustain many people, so great was his merit to feed the entire world. For he was a completely righteous person who was pure as an Omer of grain and without sin. This is what the sages stated, the serpent died in his time.
<b>ה֭וֹדוּ לְאֵ֣ל הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם “Praise the God of heaven,” (Ps. 136:26)</b> refers to the generation of <b>Moses,</b> for the word <i>Shamayim</i> is <i>Moshe</i> (Moses) <i>Mi</i> (Who). This name alludes to the fact that Moses merited to reach fifty gates of understanding (). It is fitting, therefore, to give thanks to God for the Kindness that he performed in the world. Further, because, the Psalm, “It is good to praise <i>HaShem</i>…” (Ps. 92:2) is one of the Psalms which he wrote. Therefore, it states here, “Praise the God of heaven.” We only praise God. For this is something which he constantly warned Israel about. If we say that Adam said this, they forgot about it. Moses returned and said this, a type of praise that David returned to with the Holy Spirit and said it.
<b>אלו כ''ו דורות</b> These are the 26 generations during which the Holy One fed the world with laws of kindness because the leaders of the generations were all righteous. Even Terah the seller of idols was a righteous man because he knew that real fear is of God. And in his abundant piety of God, he gave his son over to martyrdom in order to sanctify the awesome name of God. And when he knew the truth, they turned in repentance even though their generation was wicked. For that which was taught, “there were ten generations from Adam to Noah,” and, “There were ten generations from Noah to Abraham,” all of which continued to anger God, yet the Holy One continued to sustain them with the law of kindness until the Torah was given which maintains the existence of the world. <br><b>תם ונשלם</b>
