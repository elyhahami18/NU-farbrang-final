The Jonathan Sacks Haggadah

The Seder

The word seder means “order,” and it is central to the Jewish concept of freedom. We become God’s “partners in the work of creation” when we create order in society – an order that honors all persons as the image of God. If God’s presence is to be found not just in rare moments of ecstasy, but in the daily transactions of society as a whole, then it must have a seder, a set of rules we all honor. Order turns individuals into a community and communities into a people. The seder night reflects the order that binds us to other Jews throughout the world and in previous generations.
At the same time, the seder leaves room for spontaneity. No two seder nights are the same. Ideally each family, each year, adds new insights as we reflect on our birth as a people and relate it to the present. “The more one tells…the more admirable it is.” Pesaḥ is a fine example of the Jewish counterpoint between structure and spontaneity. We all tell the same story in the same words, but we each add something uniquely ours. The rules are the same, but the commentaries and interpretations are always different. That is how an ancient story stays young.
<b><small>THE SEDER PLATE</small></b><br>In ancient times, seder participants used to recline on couches, and each had a table. Nowadays, though we still recline to drink the wine, eat the matza, and tell the story, we group the ingredients of the seder on a single plate, often made and decorated specially for the occasion.
Its elements are these:
1. <i>Matza</i> – three matzot, representing the double portion of bread always eaten on Sabbaths and festivals, together with a third to represent the special duty of eating matza tonight.
2. <i>Zeroa</i> – a roasted shankbone, recalling the Paschal offering. The bone itself symbolizes the “outstretched arm” with which God rescued the Israelites.
3. <i>Beitza</i> – a roasted egg, reminding us of the <i>ḥagiga</i>, the other festive offering eaten on Pesaḥ.
4. <i>Maror</i> – the bitter herbs, recalling the bitterness of slavery in Egypt. Nowadays this usually takes two forms. (a) In the time of the Mishna, the food eaten as maror was usually lettuce (<i>ḥazeret</i>). Although this does not always taste bitter to our palates, lettuce begins by being sweet and ends by becoming bitter and hard. It thus epitomizes the experience of the Israelites in Egypt. Usually romaine lettuce is used. (b) The other form, horseradish, was the form of bitter herbs most readily available in Eastern Europe. Some have the custom to place both on the seder plate, eating both in combination, or using the lettuce for the first maror and the horseradish for the sandwich with matza.
5. <i>Ḥaroset</i> – a mixture of fruit and spices in which the maror is dipped. The custom of using <i>ḥaroset</i> on Pesaḥ dates back to mishnaic times, but since it is a custom, not an obligation, we do not say a blessing over it. There are two reasons for the <i>ḥaroset</i>. It recalls the mortar with which the Israelites made bricks when they were slaves. But it also recalls the verse from the Song of Songs, “Beneath the apple tree I woke you” (8:5), which the sages applied to the love between God and Israel that led to redemption. Thus the custom has developed of making <i>ḥaroset</i> with the various fruits mentioned in the Song of Songs – apples, pomegranates, figs, nuts, and dates – together with ground spices (cinnamon and ginger are the most common), which recall the grinding of straw in those days. Wine is added to the mixture until it has the consistency of mortar.
6. <i>Karpas</i> – the vegetable we dip in salt water at the beginning of the seder to arouse the interest of a child. The original karpas was probably celery, but other vegetables have been used by different communities at various times. A common custom today is to use parsley.
7. <i>Salt water</i> – in which the karpas is dipped, recalling the tears of the Israelites in Egypt.
<b><small>THE ORDER</small></b><br>We owe to French Tosafist (sage of the school of Rashi, twelfth to thirteenth centuries) Rabbi Shmuel of Falaise the fifteen-word summary of the seder service:
1. <i>Kadesh</i> – the recitation of Kiddush
2. <i>Urḥatz</i> – washing before karpas
3. <i>Karpas</i> – eating a vegetable dipped in salt water
4. <i>Yaḥatz</i> – splitting the middle matza
5. <i>Maggid</i> – telling the story of the Exodus, set in motion by questions asked by a child
6. <i>Raḥtza</i> – washing the hands before the meal
7. <i>Motzi</i> – the blessing over food
8. <i>Matza</i> – the special blessing over matza
9. <i>Maror</i> – eating the bitter herbs
10. <i>Korekh</i> – (lit., wrapping) the sandwich of matza and maror
11. <i>Shulḥan Orekh</i> – the “set table,” the meal
12. <i>Tzafun</i> – the “hidden” matza, or <i>afikoman</i>, the last food to be eaten
13. <i>Barekh</i> – grace after the meal
14. <i>Hallel</i> – concluding Hallel along with other songs of praise
15. <i>Nirtza</i> – parting prayer that our seder be accepted by God and become a prelude to future redemption
These fifteen stages echo other “fifteens” – the fifteen Psalms headed “A Song of Degrees,” the fifteen steps between the Women’s Court and the Court of the Israelites on which, in Temple times, the Levites would stand and sing praises, and the fifteen occasions of God’s kindness to the Jewish people recounted in the song <i>Dayeinu</i>.
<b><small>PESAḤ AND THE HOME</small></b><br>It is no coincidence that this, the oldest of Jewish rituals, takes place, as it did in Egypt, in the home. Judaism attaches immense significance to the family. The Book of Genesis is entirely devoted to families: Adam and Eve, Noah and his family, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob, Rachel and Leah, and their children. The family is the birthplace of a free society. It is where we learn the reciprocity on which the moral life depends. It is where, sharing our vulnerabilities, we discover strength. Through the bonds it creates, we learn <i>ḥesed</i>, the duty that flows from love. Above all it is where we learn <i>who we are</i>, where we came from, and what our story is.
Significantly, in the only place where the Torah explains why Abraham was chosen to carry the promise of the covenant, the reason is given in terms of parenthood: “For I have chosen him so that he will instruct his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the LORD, doing what is right and just” (Gen. 18:19). Abraham was chosen <i>in order to be a parent</i>. He was also chosen to be an educator. The two concepts, so different in many societies, including our own, are in Judaism inseparable.
Fatherhood and motherhood are two distinct phenomena, and Judaism attaches equal importance to both. A child derives its biological identity as part of the Jewish people from its mother. The Hebrew word for compassion, <i>raḥamim</i>, derives from <i>reḥem</i>, “womb.” A mother, more than a father, is bound to a child through unconditional love.
Fatherhood, by contrast, is a social construct. It belongs to culture rather than nature. There are animals – including primates, genetically close to human beings – in which fathers do not even recognize their children after a few months. Fatherhood, like fidelity, is not a constant across cultures. The supreme challenge of any civilization, said the anthropologist Margaret Mead, is to socialize males and persuade them to invest their energies in the home, the family, and children.
This was one of Judaism’s greatest achievements through the ages. The Hebrew word for male, <i>zakhar</i>, is closely related to the word for memory, <i>zakhor</i>. It is the task of fathers to hand on to their children the memories of the past. For we are related to the past not just biologically but also culturally, through the stories we tell and the history we relate (see “History and Memory”). That is what we do on Pesaḥ. Thus Pesaḥ, the festival of Jewish memory, is celebrated in the home, the birthplace of memory.
Families are a source of immense strength, but they can also be the source of narrowness, nepotism, and indifference to the world outside. There is a potential conflict between the family and the wider concerns that are needed to build a society of justice and compassion. For that reason a Jewish home must always be open – to the hungry, the lonely, and visitors. Abraham and Sarah, waiting at their tent to provide food and shelter to passersby, are an enduring symbol of this Jewish value. “Greater is hospitality,” said the sages, “than welcoming the Divine Presence” (Shabbat 127a). The Hebrew letter <i>beit</i>, whose name also means “house,” is open at one side, to show that a Jewish home must always be open to the needy. Thus the seder night begins with an invitation, “Let all who are hungry come in and eat.” In fact, in all ages, Jews celebrating Pesaḥ sought guests long before the meal began. The invitation, at this point, is simply to remind us that a free society exists only where families share their warmth with others.

Kadesh



Paragraph 1

<b><small>KADESH / KIDDUSH</small></b><br><i>We begin the seder</i> by the formal act of sanctifying the day. The Kiddush tonight is the same as for other festivals. Nonetheless Kiddush as such has a particular connection with Pesaḥ, since the command to establish the calendar was first given to the Israelites in Egypt prior to the Exodus: “This month shall mark for you the beginning of the months; it shall be the first of the months of the year for you” (Ex. 12:2). This was the first command given to Israel as a people.<br>Rabbi Avraham Pam explained this in the following way: the difference between a slave and a free human being does not lie in how long or hard each works. Free people often work long hours doing arduous tasks. The difference lies in who controls time. A slave works until he or she is allowed to stop. A free person decides when to begin and end. Control over time is the essential difference between slavery and freedom. Control over the calendar gave the Israelites the power to determine when the New Moon occurred, and thus when the festivals occur. They were given authority over time. The first command to the Israelites was thus an essential prelude to freedom. It said: learn how to value time and make it holy. “Teach us rightly to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom” (Ps. 90:12).

Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3

<b><small>WHEN PESAḤ FALLS ON SHABBAT</small></b><br><i>The two forms of holiness –</i> Shabbat and festivals – are different. Shabbat represents <i>creation</i>. The festivals represent <i>redemption</i>. Shabbat is about the presence of God in nature. The festivals are about the presence of God in history. Accordingly Shabbat was declared holy by God Himself at the culmination of creation. God “blessed the seventh day and declared it holy” (Gen. 2:3). The festivals, by contrast, are sanctified by the Jewish people through their determination of the calendar – just as redemption takes place in history when we act in partnership with God. Thus on Shabbat we end the Kiddush by saying <i>Mekadesh haShabbat</i>, meaning that it is God who sanctifies Shabbat; but on festivals we say <i>Mekadesh Yisrael vehazemanim</i>, meaning, “God sanctifies Israel, and Israel in turn sanctifies time.” Shabbat is holiness “from above to below.” The festivals are holiness “from below to above.”<br>When Yom Tov falls on Shabbat, Shabbat takes priority. This is because the sanctity of Shabbat is of a higher order. Its prohibitions are more extensive and the penalties for violating them are more severe. The primacy of Shabbat also exemplifies the general rule in Judaism that “When a frequent obligation coincides with a rare one, the more frequent one takes precedence” (<i>Berakhot</i> 51b). This is in itself an expression of Jewish values. In many faiths, a sense of holiness and spirituality belongs to moments that are rare, unusual, exceptional. In Judaism what is holy is the texture of everyday life itself. Judaism is not poetry but prose. It is the religious drama of daily deeds, words, and relationships. God is not distant but in the here and now – if we create space in our hearts for His presence.

Paragraph 4



Paragraph 5



Paragraph 6

<b><small>WHO HAS CHOSEN US FROM AMONG ALL PEOPLES, RAISED US ABOVE ALL TONGUES, AND MADE US HOLY THROUGH HIS COMMANDMENTS</small></b><br><i>Chosenness is not a privilege</i> but a responsibility. Jews are different not because of what we are but because of what we are called on to be: not because of the hardware of the Jewish people, but because of the software. God chose us not because of any innate superiority but in order to “make us holy through His commandments.” When we are true to that vocation, we bring blessing not just to ourselves but to the world.

Urchatz



Paragraph 1

<b><small>URḤATZ / WASHING</small></b><br><i>In the time of the Mishna</i>, many people were careful to wash their hands before eating moist foods. Nowadays the custom is not widely observed except on seder night, when it is done for the karpas, which is dipped in liquid. To signal the difference between this washing, which is customary, and the washing before eating bread, which is obligatory, no blessing is said.

Karpas



Paragraph 1

<b><small>KARPAS</small></b><br><i>Dipping karpas in salt water</i> or vinegar is one of the things we do on the seder night to arouse the curiosity of children so they will ask, “What makes this night unlike all other nights?” It is one of the two acts referred to in the question “every other night we do not dip [our food] at all, but tonight we will dip it twice.” The other, just before the meal, is the dipping of maror in <i>ḥaroset</i>.<br>There is symbolic significance in these two acts. The Exodus began and ended with acts of dipping. It began when Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery. They dipped his robe in the blood of a slaughtered goat (Gen. 37:31) and brought it to Jacob to persuade him that Joseph had been attacked and killed by a wild animal. The sale of Joseph into slavery in Egypt was the beginning of the long process through which the entire family of Jacob traveled to Egypt and eventually became slaves.<br>The exile ended with the Israelites’ taking bunches of hyssop, dipping them in the blood of the Paschal offering, and daubing them on the door-frames of their houses (Ex. 12:22). God “passed over” these houses during the final plague, after which they went free.<br>The two dippings recall these events. The karpas, itself sweet, is dipped in salt and becomes sour. The maror, itself bitter, is dipped in the sweet <i>ḥaroset</i> and has some of the bitterness removed. These two acts remind us that freedom, which is sweet, becomes sour when we use it to mistreat others. Slavery, which is bitter, is sweetened when collective suffering becomes human solidarity and thus a prelude to freedom.

Yachatz



Paragraph 1

<b><small>YAḤATZ / SPLITTING THE MIDDLE MATZA</small></b><br><i>Of the three matzot</i>, the upper and lower represent the <i>leḥem mishneh</i>, the double portion of manna that fell before Sabbaths and festivals in the wilderness so the Israelites would not have to gather food on the holy day itself. The third – the middle matza<i> –</i> represents the special duty to eat unleavened bread on Pesaḥ.<br>There are two reasons we break it in half. The first is that it is described as “the bread of oppression” or, as the sages interpreted it, “the bread of a poor person.” One who is so poor that he does not know where his next meal is coming from does not eat all his food at once. He divides it into two, saving half for later.<br>The second is that, with the destruction of the Temple, matza takes the place of the Paschal offering. Just as that lamb was eaten at the end of the meal – so as to be experienced as holy food, not just food eaten to satisfy hunger – so we reserve half the matza (the <i>afikoman</i>) to be eaten at the end of the meal. The custom that children hide the <i>afikoman</i> is part of the spirit of the seder service, which contains many elements designed to attract and sustain the interest of a child.<br>However, there is also a third significance to breaking the middle matza. Matza represents two apparently contradictory ideas. At the beginning of the seder we describe it as “the bread of oppression our fathers ate in the land of Egypt.” Ibn Ezra explains that slaves were given unleavened bread because, being hard, it takes longer to digest. It removes hunger for longer than ordinary bread. Later in the seder, we describe it as the bread the Israelites ate as they were leaving Egypt, in too much of a hurry to allow the dough to rise. We divide the matza, therefore, to show that it has two symbolisms. Now, at the beginning of the seder, it is the bread of oppression. Later, once we have relived the Exodus, it becomes the bread of freedom. The difference between freedom and slavery lies not in the quality of bread we eat, but in the state of mind in which we eat it.

Magid

Ha Lachma Anya



Paragraph 1

<b><small>MAGGID / TELLING</small></b><br><i>This is the beginning of the seder narrative</i>, known as <i>Maggid</i>, from the word <i>haggada</i>, “relate,” “recount,” “declare,” “proclaim.” The story of the Exodus is known as the Haggada because of the verse “You shall tell (<i>vehigadeta</i>) your child on that day, ‘[I do this] because of what the LORD did for me when I went out of Egypt’” (Ex. 13:8). However, the word <i>haggada</i> derives from a verb that also means “bind,” “join,” “connect.” The story of the Exodus is more than a recounting (<i>sipur</i>) of things that happened long ago. It binds the present to the past and future. It connects one generation to the next. It joins us to our children. Jewish continuity means that each successive generation commits itself to continuing the story. Our past lives on in us.

Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3

<b><small>THIS IS THE BREAD OF OPPRESSION</small></b><br><i>This is a strange invitation:</i> “This is the bread of oppression our fathers ate in the land of Egypt. Let all who are hungry come in and eat.” What hospitality is it to offer the hungry the taste of suffering? In fact, though, this is a profound insight into the nature of slavery and freedom. As noted, matza represents two things: it is the food of slaves, and also the bread eaten by the Israelites as they left Egypt in liberty. What transforms the bread of oppression into the bread of freedom is <i>the willingness to share it with others</i>.<br>Primo Levi survived Auschwitz. In his book, <i>If This Is a Man</i>, he describes his experiences there. According to Levi, the worst time of all was when the Nazis left in January 1945, fearing the Russian advance. All prisoners who could walk were taken on the brutal “death marches.” The only people left in the camp were those too ill to move. For ten days they were left alone with only scraps of food and fuel. Levi describes how he worked to light a fire and bring some warmth to his fellow prisoners, many of them dying. He then writes:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">When the broken window was repaired and the stove began to spread its heat, something seemed to relax in everyone, and at that moment Towarowski (a Franco-Pole of twenty-three, typhus) proposed to the others that each of them offer a slice of bread to us three who had been working. And so it was agreed.<br>Only a day before a similar event would have been inconceivable. The law of the Lager [concentration camps] said: “eat your own bread, and if you can, that of your neighbor,” and left no room for gratitude. It really meant that the law of the Lager was dead.<br>It was the first human gesture that occurred among us. I believe that that moment can be dated as the beginning of the change by which we who had not died slowly changed from <i>Haftlinge</i> [prisoners] to men again.</span><br>Sharing food is the first act through which slaves become free human beings. One who fears tomorrow does not offer his bread to others. But one who is willing to divide his food with a stranger has already shown himself capable of fellowship and faith, the two things from which hope is born. That is why we begin the seder by inviting others to join us. Bread shared is no longer the bread of oppression. Reaching out to others, giving help to the needy and companionship to those who are alone, we bring freedom into the world, and with freedom, God.
<b><small>NOW WE ARE HERE; NEXT YEAR IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL</small></b><br><i>At the very moment that we gather to remember the past</i>, we speak about the future. The seder brings together the three dimensions of time. Before the meal we tell the story of redemption in the past. During the meal we experience it in the present. After the meal, as we conclude Hallel and say, “Next year in Jerusalem rebuilt,” we look forward to redemption in the future.<br>What is distinctive about Jewish time is that we experience the present not as an isolated moment, but as a link in a chain connecting past and future. The very fact that they had been liberated in the days of Moses gave our ancestors confidence that they would be liberated again. The Jewish people would return to the land of Israel. Here we see one of the most profound instincts of the Jewish mind: <i>memory is the guardian of hope</i>. Those who forget the past become prisoners of the present. Those who remember the past have faith in the future. We can face it without fear, because we have been there before.
<b><small>NOW – SLAVES; NEXT YEAR WE SHALL BE FREE</small></b><br><i>There are two words for freedom</i> in Hebrew, <i>ḥofesh</i> and <i>ḥerut</i>. <i>Ḥofesh</i> is “freedom from.” <i>Ḥerut</i> is “freedom to.” <i>Ḥofesh</i> is what a slave acquires when released from slavery. He or she is free from being subject to someone else’s will. But this kind of liberty is not enough to create a free society. A world in which everyone is free to do what he or she likes begins in anarchy and ends in tyranny. That is why <i>ḥofesh</i> is only the beginning of freedom, not its ultimate destination. <i>Ḥerut</i> is collective freedom, a society in which my freedom respects yours. A free society is always a moral achievement. It rests on self-restraint and regard for others. The ultimate aim of the Torah is to fashion a society on the foundations of justice and compassion, both of which depend on recognizing the sovereignty of God and the integrity of creation. Thus we say, “Next year we shall be <i>benei ḥorin</i>,” invoking <i>ḥerut</i>, not <i>ḥofesh</i>. This statement is an aspiration; “May we be free in a way that honors the freedom of all.”

Four Questions



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>WHAT MAKES THIS NIGHT UNLIKE ALL OTHER NIGHTS?</small></b><br><i>The Torah speaks of children asking questions on Pesaḥ.</i> “And if your children should ask you, ‘What is this service to you?’ you shall say…” (Ex. 12:26). From this, tradition inferred that the story of the Exodus from Egypt must be told, wherever possible, in response to the questions asked by a child.<br>The Torah has two words for inheritance, <i>yerusha</i> and <i>naḥala</i>, and they represent the two different ways in which a heritage is passed on across the generations. The word <i>naḥala</i> comes from the root <i>naḥal</i>, which also means “river.” It represents an inheritance that is merely handed down, without any work on the part of the recipient, as water flows in a river. <i>Yerusha</i>, by contrast, means active inheritance. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch pointed out that <i>lareshet</i>, the verbal form of <i>yerusha</i>, sometimes means “conquer” or “capture.” It means actively taking hold of what one has been promised. An inheritance for which one has worked is always more secure than one for which one has not. That is why Judaism encourages children to ask questions. When a child asks, he or she has already begun the work of preparing to receive. Torah is a <i>yerusha</i>, not a <i>naḥala</i>. It needs work on behalf of the child if it is to be passed on across the generations.
<b><small>WHAT MAKES THIS NIGHT UNLIKE ALL OTHER NIGHTS?</small></b><br><i>The history of Ma Nishtana is fascinating.</i> The text itself goes back some two thousand years. It is recorded in the Mishna and was almost certainly the form of words used in Second Temple times. Everything else about it, though, was different. It was said not before the meal but afterward. It was said not by the child but by the parent. And it was not a set of questions but a set of statements. How so?<br>In Temple times the meal was eaten first. The sanctity of the moment was palpable. Families had traveled from all parts of Israel to bring their sacrifice to the Temple and eat their meal in the precincts of Jerusalem. The questions of the child arose naturally from acts done that night that were done at no other point in the year. If the child was too young to ask, the father would prompt him by saying, <i>Ma nishtana halayla hazeh</i>, meaning not “What makes this night different?” but “See how different this night is from all other nights.” He would then enumerate the differences, encouraging the child to ask, “Why?”<br>One of the most remarkable achievements of the sages was to preserve the continuity of Jewish life through a series of tragedies – the destruction of the Temple, the end of the Paschal sacrifice, and the loss of the entire atmosphere of collective celebration in Jerusalem. The narrative was moved from after the meal to before it, so that words would do the work of place: the Jewish people no longer had Jerusalem, but we still had the story. And instead of children asking spontaneously, each in his or her own words (the “four sons” of the Haggada), the <i>Ma Nishtana</i> became a standard formula that every child could learn. Old words took on a new function. A ritual once celebrated in the vicinity of the Temple became a ceremony that could be observed throughout the world without losing its original character. Everywhere Jews gathered to celebrate Pesaḥ became a fragment of Jerusalem. The city, the land, and the sacrificial order lay in ruins, but the words remained.<br>One thing achieved by turning <i>Ma Nishtana</i> into a formula was that now there was no division of children into the wise, the wicked, the simple, and the child unable to ask. In a beautiful and deeply characteristic gesture, custom ordained that every child should ask in the same way, using the same words, so as not to put any child to shame. All Jewish children are precious and we do not distinguish between them.
<b><small>WHAT MAKES THIS NIGHT UNLIKE ALL OTHER NIGHTS?</small></b><br><i>The four questions correspond to the “four sons” of the Haggada.</i> The wise child turns immediately to the central symbol of Pesaḥ, the matza. His question is profound. Matza is the “bread of oppression” but Pesaḥ is the “festival of freedom.” Why, then, do we eat only matza? The “wicked son” asks about the maror because, being bitter toward Judaism, he tastes only the bitterness of Jewish life, not the sweetness. The simple-natured child asks about the dipping, the act done precisely to provoke a question on the part of a child. The one who does not know how to ask asks why people are reclining. His attention is not on the seder service at all but on the people gathered around the table.

We Were Slaves in Egypt



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>WE WERE SLAVES TO PHARAOH IN EGYPT</small></b><br><i>The Mishna states that in telling the story</i> of the Exodus we must “Begin with the shame and end with the praise” (Mishna <i>Pesaḥim</i> 10:4). A Jewish story begins in sadness and ends in joy.<br>What, specifically, does this mean on Pesaḥ? The Talmud records two views, those of Rav and Shmuel, two sages of the third century. According to Shmuel it means saying, “We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the LORD our God brought us out.” According to Rav it means saying, “In the beginning, our ancestors were idol worshippers. But now the Omnipresent has drawn us close in His service.” Out of respect for these two views, we say them both, beginning with the answer according to Shmuel.<br>The two opinions reflect different approaches to the Exodus. According to Shmuel the central fact is physical redemption. Our ancestors were slaves who were liberated by God. According to Rav the essential theme is spiritual redemption. Our ancestors were idolators who found, and were found by, God.<br>There is a difference, too, in their approach to history. Shmuel focuses on the immediate event of Egypt, slavery and redemption. Rav places the event in a wider context – the whole history of the Jewish people from Abraham to Joshua and the conquest of the land. For Rav, Pesaḥ is part of a larger drama, from founding father to the birth of a nation in its own land.<br>Maimonides draws a third distinction. There are two elements to the seder service: there is the story we tell our children, and the story we tell ourselves. Shmuel focuses on the story as told to a child. Rav speaks of the story as an adult reflection. Children can understand the drama of slavery and freedom together with the many miracles that were involved. It takes an adult to understand the journey from polytheism to monotheism, from myth to faith.
<b><small>SLAVERY AND FREEDOM</small></b><br><i>In the Kovno ghetto in the early 1940s</i> an extraordinary scene took place one morning in the makeshift synagogue. The Jews in the ghetto had begun to realize the fate that lay in store for them. They knew that none of them would escape, that the work camps to which they would be transported were in fact factories of death. And at the morning service, the leader of prayer, an old and pious Jew, could finally say the words no longer. He had come to the blessing in which we thank God for not making us slaves. He turned to the congregation and said: “‘I cannot say this prayer. How can I thank God for my freedom when I am now a prisoner facing death? Only a madman could say this prayer now.”<br>Some members of the congregation turned to the rabbi for advice. Could a Jew in the Kovno ghetto pronounce the blessing thanking God for not having made him a slave? The rabbi replied very simply. “Heaven forbid that we should abolish the blessing now. Our enemies wish to make us their slaves. But though they control our bodies they do not own our souls. By saying this blessing we show that even here we still see ourselves as free men, temporarily in captivity, awaiting God’s redemption.”<br>The hardest question for faith today is: Where was God in Auschwitz? Where was God when His faithful servants were being turned to ashes and dying as martyrs in their millions? Where was redemption when the Jews of Europe were gassed and burned and God was silent? That question haunts us on the night of Pesaḥ, because on this night we remember that slavery in Egypt was not the only, or even the worst, chapter of Jewish suffering. There have been pharaohs in every generation. And not only Jews have been their victims. There are peoples today who live under the threat of genocide. If God redeems – not in heaven but here on earth – where is His redemption?<br>The greatest prophets asked this question and received no answer. Nonetheless there is a fragment of an answer, and it was given by the rabbi in the Kovno ghetto. God has chosen only one dwelling place in this finite, physical universe and that is the human heart. Whenever we banish God from the heart, tragic things happen. When rulers set themselves in place of God, they begin by taking other people’s freedom and end by taking other people’s lives. There is a direct line from tyranny to idolatry to bloodshed. Our greatest defense is the knowledge that above all earthly powers is the supreme King of kings, God Himself, who has endowed all human beings with His image. No absolute ruler has ever succeeded in extinguishing that spark in the souls of a people, which expresses itself in a passion for freedom. That is why all tyrannies have failed and always will.<br>Where was God in the Kovno ghetto? In the hearts of those who, though they were prisoners in the valley of the shadow of death, insisted on pronouncing a blessing as free human beings. Their story has no simple happy ending, but they left us an immortal legacy: the knowledge that the human spirit cannot be killed, and that therefore freedom will always win the final battle.
<b><small>AND IF THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, HAD NOT BROUGHT OUR FATHERS OUT OF EGYPT</small></b><br><i>One rule of telling the story on Pesaḥ</i> is that each person must see himself or herself as if he or she had personally left Egypt. History becomes memory. The past becomes the present. At this stage, therefore, we speak of the continuing consequences of the past. Had the Exodus not happened and the Israelites stayed in Egypt, none of the subsequent events of Jewish history would have occurred. What and where we are now is the result of what happened then.
<b><small>EVEN WERE WE ALL WISE</small></b><br><i>There is a fundamental difference between knowing</i> and telling the story. We do not tell the narrative of the Exodus to know what happened in the past. We do so because each telling engraves that event more thoroughly in the memory, and because each year adds its own insights and interpretations. Judaism is a constant dialogue between past and present, and since the present always changes, there is always a new juxtaposition, a new facet of the story. The sages said, “There is no house of study without <i>ḥiddush</i> [some new interpretation]” (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 3a). The story of Pesaḥ never grows old, because the struggle for freedom never ends, and therefore each generation adds its own commentary to the old-new story.

The Four Sons



Paragraph 1

<b><small>THE FOUR SONS</small></b><br><i>This famous passage is based on the fact</i> that the Torah speaks in four places about the dialogue between parents and children:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">1. And if your children should ask you, “What is this rite you perform?” you shall say, “It is a Pesaḥ offering for the LORD, for He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt while He struck the Egyptians, but saved those in our houses” (Ex. 12:26–27).<br>2. And you shall tell your child on that day, “It is because of what the LORD did for me when I went out of Egypt” (ibid. 13:8).<br>3. If in that time your child should ask you, “What is this?” you shall say to him, “With a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the grip of slavery” (ibid. 13:14).<br>4. When, in time to come, your children ask you, “What are the testimonies, statutes, and laws that the LORD our God commanded you?” You shall say to your child, “We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand” (Deut. 6:20–21).</span><br>Rather than seeing them as restatements of the same idea, the sages detected, in the different ways the verses are phrased, four distinctive personalities – thus, four kinds of children.
<b><small>THE FOUR SONS</small></b><br><i>It may be that the “four sons” are not different people</i> but successive stages in the development of a child. We begin by being unable to ask. We accept the world as given. The next stage in intellectual growth is curiosity (the child “with a simple nature”). We ask questions with no ulterior motive. We simply want to learn. This is often followed by a period of testing and challenging the values we have received (the “wicked” child, or the adolescent). The Hebrew word for adolescent, <i>na’ar</i>, also means “shake off.” The teenage years are ones where we develop our own identity by putting received values to the test. This can sometimes lead to rebellion as a form of self-exploration. The culmination of cognitive growth is “wisdom,” the point at which we have internalized the values of our heritage and are sufficiently mature to see their objective merits. Although the Haggada uses the word “wise,” rabbinic tradition preferred the phrase <i>talmid ḥakham</i>, a “wise disciple.” Wisdom, in Judaism, is not a state, but a process of constant learning. That is why it lies as much in the questions one asks as in the answers. Every answer is itself the prelude to a deeper question, and thus there is constant growth as we move to new levels of understanding.
<b><small>THE FOUR SONS</small></b><br><i>The four sons are a vignette of the Jewish people.</i> One asks because he wants to hear the answer. A second asks because he does <i>not</i> want to hear the answer. A third asks because he does not understand. The fourth does not ask because he doesn’t understand that he doesn’t understand. Ours has never been a monolithic people.<br>Yet there is a message of hope in this family portrait. Though they disagree, they sit around the same table, telling the same story. Though they differ, they stay together. They are part of a single family. Even the rebel is there, although part of him does not want to be. This too is who we are.<br>The Jewish people is an extended family. We argue, we differ, sometimes we are deeply divided. Yet we are part of the same story. We share the same memories. At difficult times we can count on one another. We feel each other’s pain. Out of this multiplicity of voices comes something none of us could achieve alone. Sitting next to the wise child, the rebel is not fated to remain a rebel. Sitting next to the rebel, the wise child may share his wisdom rather than keep it to himself. The one who cannot ask will in time learn how. The simple child will learn complexity. The wise child will learn simplicity. Each draws strength from the others, as we draw strength from belonging to a people.

Paragraph 2

<b><small>THE WISE SON</small></b><br><i>The three other children appear in the Book of Exodus</i>, at the time of the going out of Egypt itself. The question of the wise son appears in the Book of Deuteronomy, forty years later. Historical understanding takes time. In the midst of events we are too close to see their significance, even to ask the right questions. As a hasidic sage said: “It took one day to take the Israelites out of Egypt. It took forty years to take Egypt out of the Israelites.”
<b><small>THE WISE SON</small></b><br><i>The wise son shows his wisdom</i> by distinguishing three kinds of commandment, understanding that Judaism is a complex system in which not every law has the same purpose.<br><i>Edot</i>, testimonies, are commands like those of Shabbat and the festivals, which remind us of the presence of God in nature and history.<br><i>Ḥukkim</i>, statutes, are commands like the prohibition of mixing milk and meat, which have no obvious reason. Some Jewish thinkers believed that <i>ḥukkim</i> were commands without a reason. Sa’adia Gaon said they were commanded to confer on us a reward for pure obedience. Maimonides, in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>, argued that each of the <i>ḥukkim</i> had a reason, though it became clear only after long investigation. Nahmanides and Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch held that <i>ḥukkim</i> were ecological commands, rules respecting the integrity of nature and the distinctness of different species and forms of life.<br><i>Mishpatim</i> are laws of social justice. Biblical Hebrew has two words for justice, <i>tzedek</i> and <i>mishpat</i>.<br><i>Mishpat</i> refers to the principles of the rule of law, impartiality, and retributive justice (“measure for measure”). <i>Tzedek</i> refers to equity and distributive justice. The word <i>tzedaka</i> does not mean, as it is usually translated, “charity.” Instead it means justice in this broader sense. It comes from the idea, fundamental to Judaism, that what we possess we do not ultimately own. We hold it in trust from God, and one condition of that trust is that we share part of what we have with others in need.<br>One way of expressing the difference between the three types of command is that through <i>edot</i> we fulfill our duty to the past, through <i>mishpatim</i> our duty to others, and through <i>ḥukkim</i> our duty to the natural world.<br>Alternatively: though each essentially involves action, in the case of <i>mishpatim</i> it is the act itself that is the purpose of the command. It creates justice. In <i>edot</i>, the point of the action is the belief or attitude to which it gives rise. On Shabbat we focus on creation, on Pesaḥ on redemption, on Shavuot on revelation. In the case of <i>ḥukkim</i> the ultimate purpose is to shape character, train dispositions and emotions, and create “habits of the heart.”

Paragraph 3

<b><small>THE WICKED SON</small></b><br><i>There are many explanations given by the commentators</i> as to why this particular question should be seen as a sign of rebellion. The simplest answer is that, whereas other children are spoken of as <i>asking</i>, in this case the verse speaks of children <i>saying</i>. This is a child who does not seek an answer; he seeks only to make a statement.<br>Another possibility is his use of the word <i>avoda</i>, service. The Torah uses the same word <i>avoda</i> to describe both slavery to Pharaoh and service to God. The wicked son is in effect asking: what did our people gain by leaving Egypt? They merely exchanged one <i>avoda</i> for another. Then they were servants to Pharaoh, now they have become servants to God. But in both cases they had a master; in neither case were they free. The rebellious child understands freedom to mean having no master at all. He has not yet understood that freedom is not the ability to do what you like; it is the ability to do what you ought. A society in which “each person did what was right in his own eyes” (Judges 21:25) does not have freedom, but anarchy. Without the sovereignty of God and law (the Torah and its commands), the strong rule the weak, and the powerful take advantage of the powerless. The difference between serving Pharaoh and serving God makes all the difference in the world: between injustice and justice, slavery and freedom, a society where people are used as means and one where they are respected as ends in themselves.
<b><small>WHEN HE SETS HIMSELF APART FROM THE COMMUNITY, HE DENIES THE VERY CORE OF OUR BELIEFS</small></b><br><i>What principle is the wicked son denying?</i> The answer is that though the rebellious child denies none of the thirteen principles of faith enumerated by Maimonides, he does deny something else. Maimonides explains: “One who separates himself from the community, even if he does not commit a transgression but only holds aloof from the congregation of Israel, does not fulfill religious precepts in common with his people, shows himself indifferent when they are in distress, does not observe their fasts, but goes his own way as if he were one of the nations and did not belong to the Jewish people – such a person has no share in the World to Come” (<i>Hilkhot Teshuva</i> 3:11).<br>The mere fact that an individual fails to identify with the collective fate of the Jewish people – even though he observes the commandments – is a denial of one of the principles of Judaism, namely that ours is a <i>collective</i> faith. Martin Buber was wrong when he called his great work on faith <i>I and Thou</i>. In Judaism the primary relationship is <i>We and Thou</i>. Despite its insistence on individual responsibility (“If I am not for myself, who will be for me?”), Judaism is equally insistent on collective responsibility (“And if I am only for myself, what am I?”). Long before Moses encountered God, he “went out to his own people and watched them at their hard labor” (Ex. 2:11). This was the birth of his active identity as a Jew. Though many Jews in the modern age found it difficult to believe, they identified with the Jewish people, fought its cause, and gave it their support. <i>Belonging is the first step to believing</i>. What makes the wicked son wicked, according to the Haggada, is not that he fails to believe, but that he fails to identify with the people of whom he is a part.

Paragraph 4



Paragraph 5

<b><small>AND THE ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK YOU MUST OPEN FOR HIM</small></b><br><i>What is the significance of the phrase</i> “You must open for him”? It is said that Rebbe Menaḥem Mendel of Kotzk once asked his disciples, “Where does God live?” The disciples were perplexed. “What does the rebbe mean: Where does God live? Where does God not live? Surely we have been taught that no place is devoid of His presence? He fills the heavens and the earth.” The rebbe replied, “You have not understood. God lives <i>where we let Him in</i>.”<br>On another occasion he asked, “Why does it say in the <i>Shema</i>: ‘These words shall be on your heart’? Why ‘on’ and not ‘in’?” He answered: “The heart is not always open. Therefore the Torah says: Lay these words <i>on</i> your heart, so that when your heart opens, they will be there, ready to fall in.” In Judaism, spirituality means openness. To one who is open, God is closer than we are to ourselves. To one who is closed, He is farther away than the most distant galaxies. The task of education is to teach a child to be open – to the voice of God and the miracle of existence. A question, asked with sincerity, is an opening in the soul.

Paragraph 1

<b><small>ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THIS MEANT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH</small></b><br><i>Just as in Egypt, so now, the preparation for Pesaḥ</i> begins well in advance of the day itself. One might have thought the story could be told from the moment preparations begin. The Torah, however, establishes a fundamental rule about how to pass your values on to the next generation: <i>tell the story while you are doing the deed</i>, when “matza and bitter herbs are there before you.” Values are caught, not taught. They are communicated by what we do more than by what we say. That is why the story of the Exodus must be told at the time we reenact it. Living it ourselves is the best way of ensuring that it will live on in the imagination of a child.

First Fruits Declaration



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>GO [TO THE VERSE] AND LEARN</small></b><br><i>We now come to the exposition of the four verses</i> (Deut. 26:5–8) that, according to the Mishna, constitute the core of the Haggada. These were originally part of the “confession” made when bringing firstfruits to Jerusalem, usually on the festival of Shavuot. Most scholars take the view that this text was chosen because it would have been well known to most Jews in Temple times and subsequently, before texts of the Haggada, written or printed, were freely available.<br>Another reason is that the confession was preceded by the words “I declare (<i>higadeti</i>) today.” The verb is from the same root as the word <i>haggada</i>, and thus tradition may have seen in this coincidence of terminology a suggestion that it was this passage that should be recited on the night of Pesaḥ, when we are commanded to “declare” to our children (<i>Vehigadeta levinkha</i>). The four verses summarize the main events of the exile and exodus. To each phrase is added a passage of midrash, rabbinic commentary, either clarifying the meaning or connecting it to other biblical passages.
<b><small>GO [TO THE VERSE] AND LEARN WHAT LABAN THE ARAMEAN SOUGHT TO DO TO OUR FATHER JACOB</small></b><br><i>As commentators have noted, this is a strange passage</i> with which to begin the exposition. The plain sense of the words <i>Arami oved avi</i> is “My father was a wandering Aramean” (meaning Abraham, according to Rashbam; or Jacob, according to Ibn Ezra and Sforno). The interpretation of the Haggada – “An Aramean sought my father’s death” – is not the plain sense. Then there is no clear evidence in the Torah that Laban did try to destroy Jacob. He pursued him, and God appeared to him at night, telling him to do Jacob no harm, but we are not told what his intentions were. Most significantly, the interpretation seems to cut across the whole theme of the Haggada, which is about slavery in Egypt. It is strange indeed to begin by saying that what Pharaoh did was bad, but Laban was worse. However, Rabbi Z. H. Ferber offered the following explanation.<br>The sun and the wind were once arguing as to which was stronger. The sun said, “I am stronger, because I give light and warmth to the whole world.” The wind said, “I am stronger, because nothing can stand in my way.” Just then a farmer began plowing his field. The sun said to the wind, “Let us settle the matter once and for all. Let us see which of us can remove the jacket from the man. That will prove which is the stronger.” The wind accepted the challenge and began to blow. But the harder it blew, the more tightly the farmer clung to his jacket, until the wind gave up, exhausted. Then the sun began to shine. As soon as the farmer felt its heat, he took his jacket off. Warmth is more powerful than wind.<br>So it was in Israel. Pharaoh and his people afflicted the Israelites, but “The more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread” (Ex. 1:12). Laban did not afflict Jacob. To the contrary, while he was with Laban, Jacob grew rich. The danger was that he would remain with Laban and forget who he was. So it has been throughout Jewish history. The more Jews suffered, the more they prayed, studied, and kept the commands. The paradox is that the danger to Jewish continuity has been not slavery and suffering, but affluence and freedom.<br>So Moses warned at the end of his life: “Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God…. Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery” (Deut. 8:11–14).<br>Interpreted this way the passage contains a powerful message: Do not think that the story of Pesaḥ ends with the Exodus. It only begins there. It is one thing to believe in God when you need His help. It is another when you have already received it. Affluence, no less than slavery, can make us forget who we are and why.

Paragraph 3

<b><small>AND HE WENT DOWN…COMPELLED BY WHAT HAD BEEN SPOKEN</small></b><br><i>Jacob, having heard that his son Joseph was still alive</i>, prepared to travel to Egypt to see him. He then received a vision of God at night, telling him: “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there” (Gen. 46:3). We are not told what fear Jacob had that led to this divine reassurance, but the text implies that Jacob already had a presentiment of the slavery and suffering his descendants would ultimately face as a result of this journey. He went, “compelled by what had been spoken.” Thus the prophecy granted to Abraham two generations earlier, that his children would become strangers in a foreign land, began to be fulfilled.
<b><small>NOT TO BE ABSORBED INTO EGYPT</small></b><br><i>Jacob’s dying request</i> was to be buried in what would later become the land of Israel. So too Joseph, at the end of his life, gathered his family and told them, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land He promised in oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (Gen. 50:24). His last recorded words were: “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place” (v. 25). This charge was eventually carried out by Moses himself.<br>Wherever Jews were scattered, they saw their condition as <i>galut</i>, “exile,” rather than mere dispersion, <i>tefutzot</i>. There were places like Germany, where they had lived for a thousand years. There were others, like Babylonia, in which there was continuous Jewish settlement for two and a half thousand years. Yet Jews saw themselves, and were seen by others, as being <i>here</i> but belonging <i>elsewhere</i>. This did not mean, as their critics claimed, that they had dual loyalties. Few groups were as loyal to their societies and non-Jewish rulers as were the Jews. They made significant contributions to the nations in which they lived, and whenever possible, added vastly to the arts, sciences, medicine, and the economy.<br>Since the days of Jeremiah they remembered his instruction to “Seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile; pray to the LORD for it, for in its peace you will find peace” (Jer. 29:7). But they knew that, at some date in the future, the Jewish people would return home. They never mistook the immediate for the ultimate. It was this more than anything that preserved their identity as a distinctive people, and sustained hope during the long centuries of exile and expulsion. It preserved Jews against the internal decay that has beset every other civilization. Forgetfulness of the past, heedlessness of the long-term future, and a loss of moral purpose in the pursuit of the here and now has been the beginning of the decline of other cultures. The sense of <i>galut</i> was the Jewish immune system. It meant that the past and future were as real as the present. This saved Jews from the ravages of time.

Paragraph 4

<b><small>A HANDFUL OF SOULS</small></b><br><i>The rapid population growth of the Israelites in Egypt</i> was mirrored in modern times. It has been estimated that by the end of the eighteenth century, the world Jewish population was no more than 1.5 million. By the outbreak of the Second World War it was close to 18 million.<br>Jews, though, have never measured their strength in numerical terms. The American writer Milton Himmelfarb wrote: “The number of Jews in the world is smaller than a small statistical error in the Chinese census. Yet we remain bigger than our numbers. Big things seem to happen around us and to us” (“In Light of Israel’s Victory”).<br>The Torah indicates (Ex. 30:12) that it is dangerous to count Jews. Instead, in biblical times, they were each to donate a half-shekel to the maintenance of the sanctuary, and by counting up the donations one could calculate the population. The lesson is this. Nations usually undertake censuses to know their strength, military or economic. If the Jewish people ever believed that strength lay in numbers, it would be in danger of despair. The Jewish people is small. It always has been. Moses said, “The LORD did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you are the fewest of all peoples” (Deut. 7:7). Instead the Torah tells us not to count Jews but to <i>count their contributions.</i> And our contributions, to the world and to one another, have been vast.

Paragraph 5

<b><small>THERE HE BECAME A NATION</small></b><br><i>The Vilna Gaon explains</i> that the word <i>goy</i>, “nation,” is related to the word <i>geviya</i>, “body.” A group of individuals becomes a nation when it becomes like a single body. Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai taught, “Israel is like one body with a single soul. When one is injured, all feel the pain.”<br>The late Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, in his essay <i>Kol Dodi Dofek</i>, spoke of the two covenants that bind Jews to one another: <i>brit goral</i>, the “covenant of fate,” and <i>brit ye’ud</i>, the “covenant of destiny.” The first arises out of shared suffering in the past, the second out of a collective vision of the future. In Egypt the Israelites entered into the covenant of fate. They were united by suffering. A midrash states: “In Egypt the Israelites gathered to dwell as a group, all of them becoming as one, and they covenanted to act with loving-kindness toward one another” (<i>Tanna deVei Eliyahu</i>). That is how they first became a nation.
<b><small>FROM THIS, LEARN THAT ISRAEL WAS DISTINCT THERE</small></b><br><i>They did not assimilate.</i> According to the sages, the Israelites preserved their identity in four ways: they did not change their names, their language, or their customs, and they did not betray one another.<br>The Hebrew word for distinct, <i>metzuyan</i>, is derived from the same word as Zion. In modern Hebrew it means “excellent.” It signifies something that stands out from its surroundings. The word <i>tziyun</i> means “signpost.” The prophet Jeremiah told the Jews of his generation who were going into exile that they should set up signposts (<i>tziyunim</i>) so that they would not forget the way back to Israel. The sages interpreted this to mean that they should not abandon Judaism. “Even though I exile you from the land, remain distinctive (<i>metzuyanim</i>) by your performance of the commands” (<i>Sifrei, Ekev</i>).<br>Zion is not just a place. It is a way of life. Jews are called to moral excellence, to have the courage to stand out from their surroundings, to be different and to be a signpost in the wilderness from whom others get their bearing and sense of direction. Zionism is a matter of not only <i>where</i> we live, but also <i>how</i> we live.<br>Judaism is the great countervoice in the conversation of mankind. To be a Jew is to be willing to think and act differently, to swim against the tide. It is to be <i>part</i> of society but also <i>apart</i> from it, to live not only in the “now” but with the wisdom of the past and a vision of the future. Matthew Arnold once wrote: “As long as the world lasts, all who want to make progress in righteousness will come to Israel for inspiration, as to the people who have had the sense for righteousness most glowing and strongest” (<i>Literature and Dogma</i>).
<b><small>FROM THIS, LEARN THAT ISRAEL WAS DISTINCT THERE</small></b><br><i>“It is told of Baron Nathaniel Rothschild that</i>, after winning his battle of many years to have the disabilities to members of the Jewish faith removed from the House of Lords, he slipped away from the hierarchy of Britain congratulating him on the achievement and was to be found prostrate in prayer in a small synagogue in the Whitechapel ghetto of East London, his lips murmuring, ‘Would that this freedom shall not mean the diminution of our faith.’” (Yaacov Herzog, <i>A People that Dwells Alone</i>)

Paragraph 6



Paragraph 7

<b><small>THE EGYPTIANS DEALT CRUELLY WITH US – AS IT IS SAID: “WE MUST ACT WISELY AGAINST [THIS PEOPLE]”</small></b><br><i>It is likely that the Haggada interprets the verb</i> as “befriended us” (from <i>re’a</i>, “neighbor”) rather than “ill-treated us” (from <i>ra</i>, “evil”). According to the midrash, the “wise dealing” of Pharaoh consisted of inflicting slavery slowly and by degrees, so the Israelites became accustomed to it rather than trying to flee. First Pharaoh issued a proclamation calling on all Egyptians and Israelites to work on his construction projects for pay. Pharaoh himself joined them. After a month, the Egyptians gradually withdrew, leaving the Israelites working alone. Then they stopped being paid. By then the Israelites had become slaves and the Egyptians their taskmasters. Gradualism later became part of the Nazi program of genocide.

Paragraph 8



Paragraph 9



Paragraph 10

<b><small>THE EGYPTIANS ENSLAVED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WITH HEAVY LABOR</small></b><br>The sages defined “heavy labor” as “work that has no time limit,” such as ordering someone to dig “until I return.” There are two aspects of slavery, physical and psychological, and Jewish law recognized that the psychological effects can sometimes be worse than the physical exhaustion of backbreaking labor. “Heavy labor” is work designed to crush the spirit of slaves by depriving them of the freedom to make decisions and subjecting them to someone else’s will. In Judaism, what is essential to our humanity is our will – our ability to make free choices and thereby choose the good, though it is difficult, over the bad, though it is attractive. What is morally unacceptable about slavery, therefore, is its attempt to destroy the independent will of the slave.

Paragraph 11



Paragraph 12

<b><small>AND WE CRIED OUT TO THE LORD, GOD OF OUR ANCESTORS</small></b><br><i>Sometimes the deepest truths are told through jokes.</i> The story is told of a highly assimilated Jewish couple in the nineteenth century. They had joined the aristocracy and become a count and countess. The countess was expecting a child. Labor began and the nurses arrived. Meanwhile the count remained in his study, playing cards with a friend. Cries began to come from the bedroom: “<i>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>” “Should you not go up to your wife?” said the friend. “She is giving birth!” The count replied, “Now is not the time.” Louder cries were heard: “My God! My God!” The friend looked at the count, but he shrugged and said, “Now is not the time.” Then a third cry was heard: “<i>Gevalt!</i>” The count rose. “<i>Now</i> is the time.”<br>When we cry, the masks slip away until eventually we reach the core of who we are. The proof text cited here (Ex. 2:23) uses three verbs: “The Israelites groaned (<i>vaye’anḥu</i>) in their slavery and cried out (<i>vayizaku</i>), and their cry for help (<i>shavatam</i>) because of their slavery went up to God.” Initially their cries were mere complaints. Then they became anguish. Finally they turned to God. It was then that God knew the time had come.<br>Another explanation: When Pharaoh’s daughter was bathing in the Nile and saw the ark containing Moses, we read, “She opened it and saw the baby (<i>yeled</i>) and behold the youth (<i>na’ar</i>) was crying” (Ex. 2:5). The verse begins by calling Moses a baby and ends by calling him a youth. Rashi explains that “he cried in an adult way.” On this, Rabbi Meir Shapiro of Lublin commented: “There are two ways of crying. A child cries when it is in pain. An adult cries when it sees someone else in pain.” Already the princess felt in Moses a sensitivity to the suffering of others. “We cried” speaks of collective tears. When the Israelites moved beyond their own pain and cried on behalf of their fellows, God in return responded to their cry.

Paragraph 13

<b><small>AND THE LORD HEARD</small></b><br><i>In the Torah the word</i> Shema<i> means more than</i> “<i>hear.</i>” It means “listen, pay attention, and act accordingly.” This explains an unusual feature of biblical Hebrew, namely that it has no word that means “obey.” The word used by the Torah is <i>shema</i>, which means “listen attentively and act accordingly.” Judaism does not demand blind obedience. To the contrary, it asks us, as far as possible, to understand the reasons for the commandments, though their full wisdom will always be beyond our understanding. Obedience in Judaism is a form of active listening. Premodern English used the word “hearken” to convey this, but there is now no word in common usage that has this precise sense. “The LORD heard” means “He attended to the cries of the Israelites and set it in the context of the promise He had given the patriarchs that He would bring their children safely out of slavery and back to the land of Israel. He therefore knew He had to act.”

Paragraph 14

<b><small>“AND HE SAW OUR OPPRESSION” – THE SEPARATION OF HUSBAND FROM WIFE</small></b><br><i>In the previous verse, this “affliction” was interpreted as</i> the burden of hard labor. Here, therefore, another kind of suffering must be referred to. We are commanded on Yom Kippur to “afflict ourselves,” and the sages interpreted this phrase to mean, among other things, that sexual relations are forbidden on this day (<i>Yoma</i> 77a). The Talmud derives this understanding from Laban’s warning to Jacob not to “afflict my daughters” (Gen. 31:50), meaning, “Do not deprive them of their conjugal rights.”<br>The Egyptians, fearing the population increase of the Israelites, tried to separate man and wife. One way they did this was to make the men work and sleep in the fields, while the women remained in the cities.<br>Rabbinic tradition gives a moving account of how the Israelite women frustrated this plan.<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta said: What did the women do? They would bring water from the Nile. God arranged that, along with the water, they would catch fish. Some they cooked. Others they sold, and with the money bought wine. Then they went out to the fields and gave food and drink to their husbands. The women would then take out their bronze mirrors and make themselves attractive. Thus family life continued, and the Israelites multiplied and grew. Later, when the Israelites were in the desert and God commanded Moses to make the Tabernacle, some brought gifts of gold, others of silver. The women said, “What do we have to contribute?” They brought their bronze mirrors. At first Moses was angry and refused to accept them. But God said to him, “Moses, do you despise this gift? Because of these mirrors all these multitudes were born in Egypt. Take them and make them into the bronze basin with which the priests will purify themselves.” (Tanḥuma,<i> Pekudei</i> 9)</span>
<b><small>AND GOD SAW THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND GOD KNEW</small></b><br><i>The verb “know” in Hebrew means something</i> quite different from its meaning in Greek and subsequent Western thought. Knowledge, for the Greeks, was a form of cognition, a detached appraisal of facts. In the Torah, knowledge is a form of moral relationship, a commitment. Thus Adam “knew” his wife (Gen. 4:1) – meaning he joined himself to her, physically, emotionally, and morally. God says about Abraham, “I have known him” (Gen. 18:19), meaning, “I have chosen him, set My love on him, made a covenant with him.” In the Torah, knowledge is not simply an intellectual attribute. It also has consequences for emotion and action. In this case, “and God knew” means that He not only saw the suffering of the Israelites. He was pained by it, and determined to act to redeem them.

Paragraph 15

<b><small>“OUR LABOR” – [THE KILLING OF] THE SONS</small></b><br><i>The sages are here echoing a verse from the Book of Job (5:7):</i> “Man is born to labor (<i>le’amal</i>).” This evocation adds to our sense of pathos at the plight of the male children condemned to death. The Book of Job is a meditation on the suffering of the innocent. The sages were reflecting on the still greater innocence of the children condemned by Egypt to death. This reflection reverberates even more strongly after the Holocaust, during which one and a half million Jewish children were murdered.

Paragraph 16

<b><small>“AND SLAVERY” – THE FORCED LABOR</small></b><br><i>The sages are translating biblical Hebrew</i> (<i>laḥatz</i>) into rabbinic Hebrew (<i>deḥak</i>).

Paragraph 17



Paragraph 18

<b><small>NOT THROUGH AN ANGEL, NOT THROUGH A SERAPH, NOT THROUGH ANY EMISSARY</small></b><br><i>The Haggada is striking for its almost complete omission</i> of any reference to Moses and his part in the redemption. The emphasis throughout is on the saving acts of God.<br>To understand this we have to remember the worldview of ancient Egypt. The pharaohs were regarded as incarnate gods, usually of the sun. The Torah was the first document in history to insist on the complete separation between God, nature, and mankind. God is absolutely transcendent. He cannot be identified either with a phenomenon of nature or with a human being, however exalted. This apparently infinite distance nonetheless creates a possibility of communication. God speaks to mankind. Mankind speaks to God. Between them lies the bond of language.<br>In the world of myth there was no need for revelation. The gods constantly revealed themselves, in the rising and setting sun, the rain that fell, the wind that blew. In Judaism, revelation is both necessary and possible, and takes place not through a show of power but through the communication of meaning, namely words, promises, commands, and prayers. Language becomes invested with holiness. In the Torah, God speaks to us. In prayer, we speak to God. Because God is God, man can become man. Because He is absolutely transcendent, He leaves space for free human action, whose highest form is to become “a partner with the Holy One, blessed be He, in the work of creation” (<i>Shabbat</i> 10a). This was an utterly new form of religious consciousness, and remains only incompletely understood today.<br>The drama of the plagues is a twofold confrontation. At one level, it is a battle between Pharaoh and Moses, two human beings. At another it is a contest between the man who believes he is a god and God Himself. The Egyptians worshipped nature – the combination of sun and water that made the Nile delta at that time one of the most fertile places on earth. Each of the first nine plagues is designed to show both the Israelites and the Egyptians that nature is not the ultimate reality. It can be a blessing; it can also be a curse. One by one the familiar features of the Egyptian ecology are overturned – to teach the Egyptians that one cannot worship nature at the cost of subjugating man.<br>It was essential for both the Israelites and the Egyptians to understand that this was the work not of man, but of God. Hence the emphasis throughout the seder on the intervention of God Himself, as if to say Moses was not a Jewish equivalent of Pharaoh, a man-god, a doer of mighty deeds with the forces of nature at his command. The active agent throughout the redemption process was God Himself.

Paragraph 19

<b><small>THE PLAGUES</small></b><br><i>The account of the ten plagues is the nearest the Hebrew Bible</i> comes to Greek tragedy. Pharaoh’s hubris leads to nemesis. By repeatedly refusing to let the Israelites go, he brings disaster on himself and his country. It is one of the great confrontations – between the quasi-divine leader of the greatest empire of the ancient world, and the God who intervenes on behalf of a helpless group of slaves.<br>In their first encounter, Pharaoh dismisses Moses with contempt. “Who is the LORD that I should obey Him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go” (Ex. 5:2). At this point, Pharaoh’s reaction is understandable. Within his worldview, the God of Moses is no more than a tribal deity, whose powerlessness is shown by the fact that his people are slaves. As the plagues gather momentum, and the awesome power of God emerges, Pharaoh’s obstinacy rises to tragic proportions. During the first five plagues he “hardens his heart.” Thereafter God is spoken of as “hardening his heart,” meaning that by now Pharaoh has become a prisoner of his own pride. It is not only the Israelites who are slaves. Pharaoh too has become a slave to his moral blindness. By the eighth plague Pharaoh’s own advisers are begging him to relent: “Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?” (Ex. 10:7) However, having closed his ears to Moses’ pleas, by now Pharaoh can no longer hear the anguish of his own people.<br>The plagues themselves occupy the borderline, so common to the Torah, between the natural and the supernatural. Commentators have been divided between those who emphasize their miraculous character and others who have sought to provide a scientific account of the disasters in terms of a series of chain reactions to an initial ecological disaster, possibly the appearance of algae in the Nile, which turned the water red and caused the fish to die. Which view speaks more compellingly to us will depend on whether we understand the word “miracle” as a suspension of the laws of nature, or an event that occurs within nature but that, by happening when and to whom it does, reveals a providential pattern in history.<br>The Torah is ambiguous about this, as about so many other things, which is why it communicates at so many levels. Certainly the plagues are events of a kind not unknown in that part of the world. What is more significant – a fact emphasized by the Torah – is that, as signs of God, they speak the language of the Egyptians. The Egyptians worshipped nature, and now nature was turning against them. The message the plagues conveyed was twofold. If nature was a force, it was in turn controlled by a higher force, and this higher power was a moral one. Nowhere is this more vividly in evidence than in the first plague. The Egyptians had drowned Israelite children in the Nile, and now its waters were turning red. We catch an echo here of God’s words to Cain after the first recorded murder: “Your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground” (Gen. 4:10).<br>No less important is the Torah’s ironic mocking of human pretensions to defy God. So the Egyptian magicians replicate the first two plagues, blood and frogs, apparently mindless of the fact that they are making things worse, not better. The plague that defeats them is lice. This is a sardonic comment on the monumental scale of Egyptian architecture. The Egyptians believed the gods were to be found in things that are big. God shows them His presence in something so small as to be almost invisible (compare T. S. Eliot’s “I will show you fear in a handful of dust” [“The Waste Land”]). The irony recurs in the division of the Red Sea, where Pharaoh’s greatest military asset, the chariots, prove to be his undoing, as their wheels sink into the mud. The key to the plagues – as in God’s covenant with Noah – is the principle of reciprocity: As you do, so shall you be done to. Those who harm others will themselves be harmed. Nations that begin by depriving others of their liberty in the end destroy themselves. Historically, this was so. Egypt never again recovered the greatness it had enjoyed in the earlier part of Ramses II’s rule.
<b><small>THE PLAGUES AS “JUDGMENT ON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT”</small></b><br><i>Several times in the Torah, God is spoken of as executing judgment</i> against the gods of Egypt. The ninth plague, darkness, seems to break the sequence of the previous eight, which until then have grown steadily more severe. A period of darkness seems no more than a discomfort. Its significance lies in the fact that Ra or Re, the sun god, was the greatest in the pantheon of Egyptian deities. The ninth plague, which blotted out the light of the sun, may have been directed not against the Egyptians but against their object of worship. This is probably also the significance of the first plague, the turning of the Nile into blood. The river, too, was worshipped by the Egyptians, in the form of Hapi, the Nile god. A similar motif may also be present in the second plague. The Egyptians knew of a frog goddess, Heqt, who was thought to assist women in childbirth. The overrunning of Egypt by frogs may have been interpreted by them as a sign of judgment against the slaughter of newborn Israelite children. The Torah does not dwell in any detail on these symbolisms because they were directed at the Egyptians. It is they, rather than the Israelites, who would have understood their message.

<b><small>RABBI YEHUDA GROUPED THESE UNDER ACRONYMS</small></b><br><i>Rabbi Yehuda groups the plagues into threes</i> because, with the exception of the last, they occurred in a threefold pattern. The first three were performed by Aaron, the second three by Moses, and the third three by Moses “stretching out his hand.” In each group, the first was preceded by a warning “in the morning,” the second by a warning whose time is not specified, and the third came without warning.
<b><small>SPILLING WINE</small></b><br>Our custom is to spill a drop of wine at the words “Blood,” “Fire,” and “Pillars of smoke”; at the mention of each of the plagues; and at the three words of Rabbi Yehuda’s mnemonic. Many explanations have been offered. The most beautiful is that of Abudraham, who interprets it in accordance with the verse in Proverbs, “Do not rejoice when your enemy falls” (24:17). Even as we give thanks for the miracle of the plagues, as a result of which our ancestors gained their freedom, we also shed a symbolic tear for those who suffered. According to some commentators, that is why the Torah does not mention the word <i>simḥa</i>, “rejoicing,” in connection with Pesaḥ, unlike the other festivals. A talmudic passage (<i>Megilla</i> 10b) states that when the waters of the sea returned and trapped the pursuing Egyptian army, the angels wished to sing a song of praise. God silenced them with the words, “My creatures are drowning in the sea, and you wish to sing a song?” God does not rejoice in the downfall of the wicked.<br>Moral maturity involves an ability to live with complex situations and emotions. We may be uplifted by an event because it represents the triumph of justice, while at the same time identifying with the suffering of the victims. One of the glories of Judaism is that it reflects the complexity of the moral life without retreating into skepticism or relativism. The heroes of the Torah are rarely without their faults, nor are the villains wholly without virtues. This does not prevent us from making moral judgments, any more than gray refutes the existence of black and white. But it should protect us against the kind of attitude that grew up among the sectarians of the Dead Sea Scrolls, who divided humanity into the “children of light” and the “children of darkness.” Judaism forbids <i>schadenfreude</i>, malicious joy in the discomfort of others. It was the first faith in history to teach the unity of mankind under the universal fatherhood of God. Tears, therefore, are a universal language, and sympathy should know no religious or national borders.

Paragraph 18

<b><small>RABBI YOSSEI HAGELILI SAYS</small></b><br><i>This dialogue, between Rabbi Yossei, Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Akiva,</i> was included here as an example of the kind of conversation that kept the sages up all night in Benei Brak. Behind it is the serious point that the miracle at the Red Sea was greater than the ten plagues. It exemplified the principle of “measure for measure” – the Egyptians had drowned Israelite children and now they too were drowned. It also marked the decisive boundary between slavery and freedom. Once the Israelites had crossed the sea, they could not go back. They were no longer within territory commanded by Pharaoh. They had become God’s people in a way they could immediately sense. This is why we recite the Song at the Sea every day, but only on Pesaḥ do we recount the Ten Plagues.
<b><small>THE PEOPLE…BELIEVED IN THE LORD AND IN HIS SERVANT MOSES</small></b><br><i>This incidental reference is the only mention of Moses on the seder night.</i> Nothing more strikingly conveys the difference between Moses and Pharaoh, and the value systems they represented. Pharaoh was the sun god made manifest. In Judaism no human being is a god or godlike, but everyone is in the image of God. The Exodus was the prelude to a political-religious order in which we are equal citizens under the sovereignty of God and in which no one needs an intermediary – a god, priest, or holy person – to approach Him. Only under the sacred canopy of faith does an entire society, as opposed to rare individuals, achieve its full stature and freedom.

Dayenu



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR US</small></b><br><i>This series of praises, with the refrain</i> “<i>Dayeinu,</i>” enumerates the kindnesses of God to His people on the long journey from slavery to freedom. The number fifteen – the acts the poem enumerates – has a deep association with thanksgiving, reminding us of the fifteen Psalms that bear the title <i>Shir Ha-Ma’alot</i>, “A Song of Degrees,” and the fifteen steps in the Temple on which the Levites stood as they sang to God.<br>The word <i>dai</i>, meaning “enough,” echoes the phrase from Malachi (3:10), recited as part of the haftara for the Shabbat before Pesaḥ, “I will pour you out a blessing <i>ad bli dai</i>,” which the sages translated as “until your lips are exhausted through saying, ‘Enough’” (<i>Ta’anit</i> 9a).<br>This song is a <i>tikun</i>, a making-right, for the ingratitude of the Israelites in the wilderness. At almost every stage of the way they complained: about the water, the food, the difficulties of the journey, the challenge of conquering the land. It is as if the poet were saying: Where they complained, let us give thanks. Each stage was a miracle. Each would have been enough to convince us that there is a Providence at work in our fate.<br>As Hegel points out, slavery gives rise to a culture of <i>ressentiment</i>, a generalized discontent; and the Israelites were newly released slaves. One sign of freedom is the capacity for gratitude. Only a free person can thank with a full heart.

Paragraph 5



Paragraph 6

<b><small>HAD HE GIVEN US THEIR WEALTH</small></b><br><i>Before the Israelites left Egypt they were commanded</i> to ask of their neighbors silver and gold and other precious objects. The morality of this has long been a source of perplexity. The key to understanding it lies in the later law to which it gave rise. When you let a slave go free, commands the Torah, “you must not send him away empty-handed. You must give to him of your flock, your granary and your winevat; you shall give him of all that the LORD your God has blessed you with. And you shall remember that you were once a slave in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you; this is why, today, I command you thus” (Deut. 15:13–15).<br>Slavery is an insult to the human condition, and it leaves a legacy of bitterness that itself prevents an ex-slave from being fully free of the past. Freedom involves more than just releasing a slave. It means furnishing him or her with the means to begin an independent life. It also involves tangible recognition of the work he or she did while a slave. Without this a slave continues to resent his former owner. With it, they can face one another in mutual dignity and respect. Payment is restitution in the deepest sense of the word, not only financial but also psychological.<br>Benno Jacob (quoted in Chief Rabbi J. H. Hertz’s commentary on the Torah) suggests that the phrase “and you shall despoil the Egyptians” (Ex. 3:22) is a mistranslation. The verb <i>venitzaltem</i> means not “you shall despoil” but “you shall save” – meaning, “You shall <i>save the reputation</i> of the Egyptians and their standing in your eyes.” The Torah did not want the Israelites to harbor ill will toward the Egyptians. Indeed it forbids resentment: “You shall not despise an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in his land” (Deut. 23:8). Only when justice has been done – when a slave receives compensation for his or her slavery – can one let go of the past and shape a new society without lingering animosities.

Paragraph 12

<b><small>HAD HE GIVEN US SHABBAT</small></b><br><i>Shabbat is the ultimate expression of a free society,</i> the antithesis of slavery in Egypt. On this day, all relationships of dominance and subordination are suspended. We may not work, or command others to work, “so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do” (Deut. 5:15). At many times in history, people have dreamed of an ideal world. The name given to such visions is “utopia,” meaning “no place,” because at no time or place have these dreams been realized on a society-wide basis. Shabbat is the sole successful utopian experiment in history. It is based on the simple idea that utopia (in Judaism, the messianic age) is not solely in the future. It is something we can experience in the midst of time, one day in seven. Shabbat became the weekly rehearsal of an ideal world, one not yet reached but still lived as a goal, of a world at peace with itself, recognizing the createdness, and thus the integrity, of all people and all forms of life. If Egypt meant slavery, Shabbat is collective freedom, a “foretaste of the World to Come.”

Paragraph 13

<b><small>HAD HE DRAWN US CLOSE AROUND MOUNT SINAI WITHOUT GIVING US THE TORAH</small></b><br><i>Maimonides writes (Hilkhot Yesodei haTorah 8:1)</i> that the Israelites did not believe in Moses because of the miracles he performed. Miracles always leave open the possibility of skepticism: perhaps it was magic, illusion, chance, or luck. Even when the Israelites “believed in the LORD and in Moses His servant” (Ex. 14:31) at the Red Sea, their belief was only temporary. What persuaded them of the truth of Moses and his prophecy was the revelation of God on Mount Sinai – the only occasion in history in which God appeared not to a prophet or holy person, but to an entire people. Thus, had God appeared at Sinai, even without giving us the Torah, it would still have established Jewish faith in the existence of God and His involvement in history on the basis of the direct experience of an entire nation, not the testimony of a prophet.

Paragraph 14



Paragraph 15

<b><small>WITHOUT BUILDING FOR US THE HOUSE HE CHOSE</small></b><br><i>The Bible connects the Exodus and the Temple.</i> The building of the Temple by Solomon, begun “in the four hundred eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt” (I Kings 6:1), is the only event in the history of Israel to be dated by reference to the Exodus. In the song the Israelites sang as they crossed the Red Sea they ended by looking forward to the building of the Temple:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">You will bring them and plant them on the mountain of Your heritage – The place, LORD, You have made for Your dwelling, The sanctuary, LORD, Your hands established. (Ex. 15:17)</span><br>The building of the Temple was thus the final act in the drama begun by the Exodus, and brought it to closure. The Temple was the symbol of the presence of God among a people that had established itself as a sovereign power in its own land. The Temple was the spiritual center of national life.

Rabban Gamliel's Three Things



Paragraph 1

<b><small>RABBAN GAMLIEL WOULD SAY: ANYONE WHO DOES NOT SAY THESE THREE THINGS</small></b><br><i>This is a requirement peculiar to Pesaḥ.</i> Normally commands are fulfilled by performing the requisite act with the intention of observing the commandment. To fulfill the duty of <i>sukka</i>, for example, we do not have to tell the story of the wandering of the Israelites in the desert. However, in the case of Pesaḥ two commands coincide: the first, to eat the festive meal; the second, to tell the story. Rabban Gamliel argues that the two are connected. The story explains the food; the food allows us to relive the story.<br>The Torah states: “When you enter the land which the LORD shall give you as He promised, you shall observe this rite. And if your children should ask you, ‘What is this service you observe?’ you shall say, ‘It is a Pesaḥ offering to the LORD, for He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt while He struck down the Egyptians, but saved those in our homes’” (Ex. 12:25–27). Thus, from the very outset eating, asking, and explaining were connected, and it is this connection on which Rabban Gamliel bases his view that all three elements of the Passover meal must be explained.
<b><small>PESAḤ, MATZA, AND BITTER HERBS</small></b><br>The Pesaḥ lamb symbolizes freedom. The bitter herbs represent slavery. Matza combines both. It was the bread the Israelites ate in Egypt as slaves. It was also the bread they ate when leaving Egypt as free people. Why do the symbols of freedom precede the bitter herbs of slavery? Surely slavery preceded freedom? The hasidic masters answered: only to a free human being does slavery taste bitter. Had the Israelites forgotten freedom, they would have grown used to slavery. “The worst exile is to forget you are in exile.”

Paragraph 2

<b><small>THE PESAḤ</small></b><br><i>Unlike the other two foods,</i> we do not lift or point at the roasted bone on the seder plate, lest this gesture be misinterpreted as dedicating it as a sacrifice. Even after the destruction of the Temple it was not unknown for individuals in Israel and outside to eat meat prepared to resemble the Paschal lamb. The sages took exception to this, and we are therefore careful to avoid any act that might look as if we were bestowing special status on the object symbolizing the Paschal offering.

Paragraph 3



Paragraph 4

<b><small>MATZA</small></b><br><i>In the Torah the festival we call Pesaḥ</i> is consistently described as <i>Ḥag haMatzot</i>, the festival of unleavened bread (<i>Ḥag haPesaḥ</i>, in the Torah, is confined to the fourteenth of Nisan, the day prior to the seder, when the Paschal sacrifice was brought). Rabbi Levi Yitzḥak of Berdichev gave a beautiful explanation for this dual terminology. The name Pesaḥ signifies the greatness of God, who “passed over” the houses of the Israelites. The name <i>Ḥag haMatzot</i> suggests the greatness of the Israelites, who followed God into the desert without any provisions. In the Torah God calls the festival <i>Ḥag haMatzot</i> in praise of Israel. The Jewish people, though, calls the festival Pesaḥ in praise of God.
<b><small>MATZA</small></b><br><i>In the German concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen</i> in 1944, the Jewish prisoners had no matza. The rabbis in the camp allowed them to eat bread on Pesaḥ, since without it they would certainly die. They composed the following benediction:<br><span class="“poetry">Our Father in heaven, behold it is evident and known to You that it is our desire to do Your will and to celebrate the festival of Passover by eating matza and by observing the prohibition of leavened food. But our heart is pained that the enslavement prevents us and we are in danger of our lives. Behold we are prepared and ready to fulfill Your commandment: “‘Live by them’ [Lev. 18:5] – and do not die by them” [<i>Yoma</i> 85b]. We pray to You to keep us alive and preserve us and redeem us speedily so that we may observe Your statutes and do Your will and serve You with a perfect heart. Amen. (<i>Critical Documents of Jewish History, A Sourcebook)</i></span>
<b><small>MATZA…[BECAUSE THEY] COULD NOT DELAY</small></b><br><i>The Hebrew terminology echoes the description</i> of Lot, who “delayed” when told to escape from Sodom. God brought it about that the Israelites were “cast out” by the Egyptians. Had they delayed, they might never have left. Slaves, as Rousseau and Marx said, get used to their chains.

Paragraph 5



Paragraph 6

<b><small>BITTER HERBS</small></b><br><i>A Jew was sent to Siberia by the communist government</i> for illegally maintaining a network of Jewish education during the years when Judaism was suppressed. When he finally obtained his freedom he told his friends, “It was difficult to observe Pesaḥ in the labor camp. One year we had no matzot. Another year we had no wine. But of bitter herbs, we were never short.” This was told to me by his son.

Paragraph 7

<b><small>GENERATION BY GENERATION</small></b><br><i>Most texts of the Haggada reproduce</i> the language of the Mishna: “Generation by generation, each person must <i>see</i> (<i>lirot</i>) himself as if he himself had come out of Egypt.” Maimonides, however, writes that each individual should <i>show</i> (<i>leharot</i>) himself as if he had left. This is because Maimonides holds that there are two separate commands of reciting the Haggada: (1) to tell ourselves the story, (2) to tell our children the story. Seeing is part of the first mitzva, showing is part of the second. For us to feel the full impact of the drama, we have to internalize it. For us to show it to others, we have to externalize it by, for example, reclining as we drink the wine. In general, Judaism reverses the usual order of emotion and action. In other cultures, feeling leads to doing. In Judaism, doing leads to feeling. We are commanded to act in certain ways in order eventually to feel in certain ways. Thus, <i>showing</i> our freedom to others is one of the best ways of coming to <i>see</i> it ourselves.

First Half of Hallel



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>THEREFORE IT IS OUR DUTY TO THANK</small></b><br><i>This is one of the transitional moments of the Haggada,</i> when we move from story to song, from prose to poetry, from recitation (<i>Maggid</i>) to praise (Hallel). We have told the story of the Exodus. Now, like the Israelites 3,300 years ago, we sing a song of praise. We lift the cup at this point, fulfilling the words of the Psalm, “I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of God” (Ps. 116:13).<br>Song plays a vital part in Judaism. At the end of his life Moses gave the Israelites the last of the commands – that in every generation we should write a new <i>Sefer Torah</i>. On that occasion he used an unusual word. He called the Torah a “song” (Deut. 31:19). Words are the language of the mind. Music is the language of the soul. Whenever speech is invested with deep emotion it aspires to the condition of song. Thus we do not say our prayers; we sing them. We do not read the Torah; we chant it. We do not study Talmud; we intone it. Each kind of text, and each period of the Jewish year, has its own melody. Thus Moses was saying: to transmit Torah across the generations as a living faith, it must be not just a code of law, but also the song of the Jewish people.

Paragraph 3

<b><small>HALLEL</small></b><br><i>Hallel (Psalms 113–118) is the great song of deliverance</i> that, according to the Talmud, was sung at all the great triumphs of Jewish history. In our day we have added two new occasions when we say it: on Yom haAtzmaut, Israel’s Independence Day, and Yom Yerushalayim, Jerusalem Day.<br>The late Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik asked an interesting question about the recitation of Hallel at the seder table. The Talmud states that we do not say Hallel on Purim because “the reading of the Megilla is equivalent to saying Hallel” (<i>Megilla</i> 14a). Why do we not apply the same reasoning to seder night? We have recited the Haggada, the counterpart of the Megilla on Purim. Surely, then, the recital of Hallel is superfluous.<br>The answer I would give is that there are two different commands to say Hallel (this is the view of <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the Netziv). The first is at the time of a miracle. The second is as a form of remembrance on the anniversary of the miracle. Thus, at the time of Ḥanukka, the Maccabees said Hallel at the moment of victory. The next year they established it as an annual obligation. The two forms of Hallel arise from different psychological states. The first is expressive, the second evocative. The first gives voice to an emotion we already feel. The second creates that emotion by an act of memory, recalling an event that occurred in the past.<br>Telling the story of a miracle, as we do on Purim, is equivalent to the second form of Hallel. It is an act of memory. On Pesaḥ, however, we do not merely tell the story. We relive it. We eat the bread of oppression and the bitter herbs. We taste the wine of freedom. We recline as free people. “Generation by generation, each person must see himself as if he himself had come out of Egypt.” The Hallel we say on the seder night is therefore of the first kind, not the second. It arises out of the emotions we feel having lived through the event again. It is a “new song.” This kind of Hallel is not cancelled by telling the story.
<b><small>SERVANTS OF THE LORD, GIVE PRAISE</small></b><br><i>The sages commented,</i> “and not the servants of Pharaoh.” The transition from being an <i>eved</i> (slave/servant) owned by a human being to being an <i>eved</i> to God is not a move from one form of servitude to another. It is the move from slavery to freedom. Only under the sovereignty of God can we be free in such a way that our freedom does not injure the freedom of others.
<b><small>FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS SETTING</small></b><br><i>The prophet Malachi says</i> in the name of God: “From where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honored among the nations” (1:11). The God of Israel is the God of all humanity.
<b><small>HIGH IS THE LORD ABOVE ALL NATIONS… HE RAISES THE POOR FROM THE DUST</small></b><br><i>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</i> “Wherever you find God’s greatness, there you find His humility” (<i>Megilla</i> 31a). The greatness of God lies in His concern for the poor, the weak, the marginal, and the disenfranchised. Moral as opposed to physical power is shown in the regard we have for the powerless.
<b><small>HE RAISES THE POOR FROM THE DUST</small></b><br>These lines echo Hannah’s prayer at the birth of her child, Samuel:<br><span class="“poetry">While the childless woman births seven children, the mother of so many sons falls desolate… The LORD makes destitute, enriches, debases; He raises – He lifts the poor out of the dust, and raises abject men from the dunghills, to sit them up there with princes, to bequeath them chairs of honor. (I Sam. 2:5–8)</span><br>In Judaism, religion is not “the opium of the people,” the defense of the established <i>order</i>. It is a constant call for the established order to be tested against the template of justice and compassion. In Judaism there is no “divine right of kings.” The greatest ruler, if evil, is brought low. The lowliest human being, if righteous, is raised high.

Paragraph 4

<b><small>WHEN ISRAEL CAME OUT OF EGYPT</small></b><br>“<i>One of the finest lyrics in literature.</i> Nowhere do we find a more exquisite picture of the liberation from Egypt, or a more poetic representation of the birth of Israel. In inimitably vivid manner, it sketches the three most wonderful events in Israel’s history: the Exodus, the Revelation, and Israel’s sustenance in the wilderness.” (J. H. Hertz)<br>On this magnificent climax, we bring the first part of the seder to a close. We have told the story, sung the song, and made our people’s past live again.

Second Cup of Wine



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>BLESSED ARE YOU</small></b><br>This, a blessing over the past and a prayer for the future, was composed by two great scholars of the mishnaic age. The first part was written by Rabbi Tarfon, the second by Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva was the guardian of hope at one of the darkest times of Jewish history. The Talmud (<i>Makot</i> 24b) tells of an occasion when he and other sages were walking on Mount Scopus when they saw a fox walking through the Holy of Holies amid the ruins of the Temple. The others wept, but Rabbi Akiva comforted them, saying, “Since the prophecies of destruction have come true, the prophecies of consolation will also come true. The day will come when, in Zechariah’s words, ‘Once again men and women of a ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem…and the city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there’ [Zech. 8:4].” It took nearly two thousand years, but it has happened in our lifetime. It was Akiva’s hope – expressed here in the vision of “days that are coming to meet us in peace” – that sustained the Jewish people in exile.

Motzi Matzah



Paragraph 1

<b><small>MOTZI MATZA</small></b><br><i>We say two blessings over the matza.</i> The first, <i>hamotzi</i>, is over the bread as such. It is one of the <i>birkot hanehenin</i>, blessings we say over eating and drinking. The second, <i>asher kideshanu</i>, is a different kind of blessing, one of the <i>birkot hamitzvot</i>, the blessings we say over commanded acts.<br>For the first blessing, all the matzot should be raised. For the second, where we draw attention to the broken middle matza, which is unique to the seder, we put down the bottom matza and make the blessing only over the top and middle matzot.<br>A portion of both the top and middle matzot is distributed to everyone around the table. Each should eat an “olive’s bulk” – approximately two-thirds of a machine-made matza. Since the amount distributed from the top and middle matzot will not be sufficient, each should complete the minimum quantity by eating from other matza on the table.<br>The Ashkenazi custom is not to put salt on the matza. Maharal explains that this is because of our special love for the taste of matza on the seder night. We do not diminish its impact by adding any other taste. One should recline while eating the matza, since this is one of the primary expressions of freedom tonight.

Paragraph 2



Paragraph 3



Paragraph 4

<b><small>MAROR / BITTER HERBS</small></b><br><i>The maror is dipped in ḥaroset</i> and the blessing over the mitzva, <i>al akhilat maror</i>, is said. The reason we do not say a further blessing, <i>borei pri ha’adama</i>, is that we have already said it for the karpas. There are differing customs as to which vegetables are to be used for maror. In the time of the Mishna, lettuce (<i>ḥazeret</i>) was most commonly used. In northern and eastern Europe, where this was difficult to obtain, the custom developed to use horseradish (<i>ḥrein</i>). Nowadays many use both, choosing romaine lettuce where maror is eaten on its own, and horseradish for the “Hillel sandwich.” An olive-size bulk (1.1 fluid ounces) should be eaten. We do not recline for the maror, since it is a symbol not of freedom but of slavery.

Korech



Paragraph 1

<b><small>KOREKH / WRAPPING</small></b><br><i>The bottom matza is now taken.</i> Each participant takes two pieces and between them places maror that has been dipped in <i>ḥaroset</i>. No blessing is said, since we have already said the blessings over the matza and maror separately.<br>It appears that there was a difference of opinion between Hillel and his contemporaries as to whether the matza and maror should be eaten separately or together. The view that they should be eaten separately holds that these are distinctive commands, neither of which should diminish or detract from the other. Matza symbolizes freedom; maror represents slavery. They have different tastes. They are opposite experiences. They do not belong together.<br>Hillel, however, thought otherwise, and out of respect for his opinion we do as he did as well. Hillel was guided by his understanding of the biblical verse that one should eat the Paschal offering “with matzot and bitter herbs” (Num. 9:11), suggesting that all three be eaten together. Perhaps, too, he was reminding us of the Jewish experience of history. Within the bitterness of slavery there was also the hope and promise of freedom. Within freedom, we are also commanded each year never to forget the taste of slavery, so that we should not take liberty for granted, or forget those who are still afflicted.

Tzafun



Paragraph 1

<b><small>TZAFUN / HIDDEN</small></b><br><i>At the end of the meal</i> we eat the other half of the broken matza. This symbolizes the Paschal offering, which in Temple times was eaten at the end of the meal. It should be eaten before midnight.<br>Tradition has given the name <i>afikoman</i> to this matza. It derives from the Mishna – cited in answer to the “wise” son – that we do not conclude with anything after the <i>afikoman</i>. Most scholars conjecture that the origin of the word is the Greek <i>epikomon</i>, which meant a drinking party. The Greeks would often end a festive meal by visiting friends and engaging in a night of drinking and conversation. Plato describes such an event in <i>The Symposium</i>. The sages ruled that such social activities were forbidden on Pesaḥ. One should finish the evening with the taste of holy food in one’s mouth. Hence the last part of the matza became the Jewish <i>afikoman</i>, a sign of the difference between Jewish and Greek culture, between holiness and hedonism. It is no coincidence that whereas Greek culture rapidly disintegrated after the days of Alexander the Great, Judaism sustained its spiritual and moral energies throughout the many crises of its history.

Barech

Birkat Hamazon



Paragraph 1

<b><small>BAREKH / BLESSING</small></b><br><i>Grace after meals is one of the elements of Jewish liturgy</i> already specified in the Bible. It is commanded in the verse, “You will eat and be satisfied, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land He has given you” (Deut. 8:10). Eating is a biological function. That is why Judaism – with its emphasis on sanctifying the physical – is particularly concerned to turn the act of eating into a moment of spiritual affirmation.<br>It is said that Abraham and Sarah drew people into the service of the One God by extending them hospitality. After their guests had eaten, they would turn to thank their hosts. Abraham would reply, “Thank not us but God, who provides food for all.” “How shall we thank God?” “Say: Blessed is the LORD, who is blessed. Blessed be He who gives bread and food to all that lives.” (Tanḥuma,<i> Lekh Lekha</i> 12). This is more than a beautiful tradition. It is a basic theme of Judaism. It is in the physical that we find the spiritual. God made the world; therefore it is in the world that we find God.<br>The commentators ask why it is that the grace after meals is a biblical command, whereas the grace <i>before</i> meals is only a rabbinic injunction. Their answer is that to thank God when we are hungry is natural. To thank him when we are sated is more difficult. It is precisely when we are most likely to forget that we need reminding – that what we have, we have from God, creator and sustainer of all.
<b><small>BIRKAT HAMAZON / GRACE AFTER THE MEAL</small></b><br><i>The first three blessings – the original form of the grace –</i> represent three concentric circles of holiness. The first blessing is for the world, the second for the land of Israel, the third for Jerusalem, home of the Divine Presence. In the first we thank God for sustaining all humanity. In the second we thank Him for His special providence over the land of Israel. In the third we acknowledge His presence in the holy city of Jerusalem, the one place from which, according to the sages, the Divine Presence was never exiled.<br>The order of these blessings represents the threefold nature of Jewish identity. First, we are citizens of the world, descendants of Noah and heirs to his covenant with God. We are part of the collective project of mankind. Second, we are Jews, faithful to our people, engaged – as our ancestors have been since the days of Abraham and Sarah – in the long journey to the land of Israel. Whether we live there or in the Diaspora we pray for it and share in its crises and achievements. Third, there is a part of us that belongs to Jerusalem. When the Temple was destroyed, said the sages, a fragment of its stones entered the hearts of the Jewish people. It remained and still remains the focus of the Jewish imagination, the home of future redemption. As we say the three blessings, therefore, we journey inward from the universal to the particular elements of Jewish identity.

<b><small>HAVE COMPASSION…ON JERUSALEM YOUR CITY</small></b><br><i>Whenever we mention Jerusalem in our prayers,</i> we associate it with the word <i>raḥamim</i>, compassion. The concept of mercy or compassion in Judaism is not abstract. The word <i>raḥamim</i> comes from the word <i>reḥem</i>, womb. The deepest and most unconditional love in creation is that of a mother for her child. Throughout nature, mothers are willing to risk their lives to protect their offspring. That and more is the nature of God’s love for His children: “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast? Can she lack compassion for the child she has borne? Though they may forget, I will not forget you” (Is. 49:15). Jerusalem is the womb, the matrix, of God’s connection with the Jewish people. It was there that He first tested Abraham’s love, in the binding of Isaac. It was there that He built His home in the form of the Temple. Thus it is the home of God’s mercy, the birthplace of the covenant, the one place on earth where the presence of God – creator of the universe – is most tangible.

Paragraph 19



Paragraph 20



Paragraph 21



Paragraph 22

<b><small>BLESSED ARE YOU</small></b><br><i>This, the fourth blessing of the Grace after Meals,</i> was added during the period of the <i>Tannai</i>’<i>m</i> in the second century CE. The Talmud relates it to the period after the defeat of the Bar Kokhba rebellion, at Beitar. It represents a moment of thanksgiving in one of the darkest periods of Jewish history, when the Roman army gave permission to the Jewish community to bury its dead. Over time, the grace after meals grew with the addition of further praises and prayers.

Paragraph 23

<b><small>ONCE I WAS YOUNG, AND NOW I AM OLD, YET I HAVE NEVER WATCHED A RIGHTEOUS MAN FORSAKEN OR HIS CHILDREN BEGGING FOR BREAD</small></b><br><i>This line, from Psalms 37:25,</i> has often raised questions. Surely throughout history there were times when the righteous were forsaken? Indeed this is one of the questions that, according to the Talmud, Moses asked God: “Why do the righteous suffer?” (<i>Berakhot</i> 7a) The English writer Edmond Blunden wrote a poem, “Report on Experience,” on this theme:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">I have been young, and now am not too old; And I have seen the righteous forsaken, His health, his honor, and his quality taken. This is not what we were formerly told.</span><br>I once heard a beautiful explanation from Rabbi Moses Feuerstein of Boston. The key phrase of the verse is <i>lo ra’iti</i>, standardly translated as “I have not seen.” The verb <i>ra’iti</i>, though, occurs twice in the Book of Esther with a quite different meaning. “How can I bear to watch (<i>eikhakha ukhal vera’iti</i>) the disaster that will befall my people? And how can I bear to watch the destruction of my family?” (Est. 8:6). The verb here does not mean “see.” It means “stand by and watch, be a passive witness, a disengaged spectator.” <i>Ra’iti</i> in this sense means seeing and doing nothing to help. That, for Esther as for the Psalmist, is a moral impossibility. We may not “stand idly by the blood of our neighbor” (Lev. 19:16). We <i>are</i> our brother’s keeper.<br>Translated thus, the verse states: “I was young and now am old and I have not merely stood still and watched when the righteous was forsaken and his children forced to beg for bread.” Read this way, not only does it make sense. It also emerges from the core of Jewish sensibility. It ends the grace after meals with a moral commitment. Yes, we have eaten and are satisfied. But that has not made us indifferent to the needs of others.<br>The conclusion of the meal, so understood, echoes the opening of the seder service with its invitation to “all who are needy – come and eat.” Maimonides writes about the command to rejoice on the festivals: “And while one eats and drinks himself, it is a duty to feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor and unfortunate people, for he who locks the doors of his courtyard and eats and drinks with his wife and family, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and bitter in soul – his meal is not a rejoicing in a divine commandment but a rejoicing in his own stomach…. Rejoicing of this kind is a disgrace to those who indulge in it” (<i>Hilkhot Yom Tov</i> 6:18).

Pour Out Thy Wrath



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>POUR OUT YOUR RAGE UPON THE NATIONS</small></b><br><i>This passage, not part of the earliest Haggadot,</i> was added during the Middle Ages, during one of the darkest periods of anti-Jewish persecution. It began with the First Crusade (1096), in which, on their way to the Holy Land, the Crusaders stopped to massacre Jewish communities in Worms, Speyer, and Mainz. It was the beginning of centuries of persecution, often in the name of religion.<br>One of the recurring events that made Pesaḥ in particular a time of fear was the blood libel. This originated in Norwich in 1144 and eventually spread throughout Europe. It is one of the few cases where persecution has left its mark on Jewish law. Several authorities ruled that though, preferably, the wine drunk on Pesaḥ should be red, in communities where there is risk of a blood libel, white wine may be used instead.<br>What is notable about this addition to the Haggada is its restraint. For centuries, Jews suffered a series of devastating blows – massacres, pogroms, forced conversions, inquisitions, confinement to ghettos, punitive taxation, and expulsions, culminating, in the very heart of “enlightened” Europe, in the Holocaust. Yet these verses – two from Psalms, one from the Book of Lamentations – are almost the only trace left by this experience on the Haggada, the night we recall our past.<br>Albert Einstein once spoke of the “almost fanatical love of justice” as one of the “features of the Jewish tradition which make me thank my stars that I belong to it” (<i>The World as I See It</i>). Judaism is a religion of justice. It is also a religion of love, compassion, forgiveness, generosity, and peace. But from the beginning it has wrestled with the question of how to bring the Divine Presence down to earth, in the structures and institutions of society. The precondition is justice. Once that exists, there is room for the many other virtues that humanize our world. But without justice, something fundamental is missing. “Pour out Your rage” is not a call for vengeance. It is not a call to human action at all. It is, rather, a prayer for divine justice.<br>At this point in the seder, as we turn from the past to the future, we reflect on the tragedy of the Jewish people in the past, the many thousands and millions of our people who were murdered, sometimes in the name of the God of love. We ask God to reveal to us, at the end of days, the meaning of all this suffering. These verses are a cry of pain coming to us from one of the dark nights of the Jewish soul, as if to say: “Let us understand, one day if not now, the justice of Your world, O Judge of all the earth.”
<b><small>POUR OUT YOUR RAGE UPON THE NATIONS</small></b><br><i>In one manuscript from Worms,</i> 1521, there is a unique addition to the Haggada alongside “Pour out Your rage.” It is a prayer of thanks for the righteous gentiles throughout history who, rather than persecuting Jews, befriended them and protected them at times of danger:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">Pour out Your love on the nations who have known You,<br>And on the kingdoms who call upon Your name.<br>For they show loving-kindness to the seed of Jacob,<br>And they defend Your people Israel from those<br>Who would devour them alive.<br>May they live to see the <i>sukka</i> of peace spread over Your chosen ones,<br>And to participate in the joy of Your nations.</span>
<b><small>POUR OUT YOUR RAGE UPON THE NATIONS</small></b><br><i>Some add, at this point,</i> the following prayer in memory of the victims of the Holocaust and the courage of those in the Warsaw ghetto who, on the eve of Pesaḥ 1943, rose up against the Nazis who had planned to destroy the ghetto and kill all its inhabitants on the first day of Pesaḥ:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">On this night of the seder we remember with reverence and love the six million of our people of the European exile who perished at the hands of a tyrant more wicked than the Pharaoh who enslaved our forefathers in Egypt. Come, he said to his minions, let us cut them off from being a people, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.<br>And they slew the blameless and pure, men and women and little ones, with poisonous gas, and burned them with fire. But we abstain from dwelling on the deeds of the evil ones, lest we defame the image of God in which man was created.<br>Now, the remnants of our people who were left in the ghettos and camps of annihilation rose up against the wicked ones for the sanctification of the Name, and slew many of them before they died. On the first day of Passover the remnants in the ghetto of Warsaw rose up against the adversary, even as in the days of Judah the Maccabee. They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their deaths they were not divided, and they brought redemption to the name of Israel throughout the world.<br>And from the depths of their affliction the martyrs lifted up their voices in a song of faith in the coming of the Messiah, when justice and brotherhood will reign among mankind.</span><br>[All sing:] <i>Ani ma’amin be’emuna shelema bevi’at hamashiaḥ. Ve’af al pi sheyitmahme’a im kol zeh aḥakeh lo…sheyavo.</i> [I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah. And even though he delays, I wait…for his coming.]

Paragraph 2

<b><small>THE PESAḤ SERVICE IS FINISHED</small></b><br><i>This passage, concluding the seder</i> and praying that we may celebrate it again in the future, is taken from a liturgical poem (<i>kerova</i>) composed by Rabbi Joseph Tov Elem in the eleventh century ce. Originally it was said in the synagogue on <i>Shabbat haGadol</i>, the Shabbat preceding Pesaḥ, to conclude a detailing of the laws of Pesaḥ, and it was transferred to the Haggada in the fourteenth century.

Paragraph 1

<b><small>NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM REBUILT</small></b><br><i>As at the conclusion of Yom Kippur,</i> so here – at the two supreme moments of the Jewish year – we pray <i>Leshana haba’a biYerushalayim habenuya</i>, “Next year in Jerusalem rebuilt.” Nothing in the imaginative life of peoples throughout the world quite compares to the Jewish love for, and attachment to, Jerusalem. A Psalm records, in unforgettable words, the feelings of the Jewish exiles in Babylonia two and a half thousand years ago: “By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept as we remembered Zion…. How can we sing the LORD’s song on foreign soil? If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem above my highest joy” (Ps. 137:1–6).<br>Wherever Jews were, they preserved the memory of Jerusalem. They prayed toward it. They spoke of it continually. At weddings they broke a glass in its memory. On Tisha B’Av they sat and mourned its destruction as if it were a recent tragedy. They longed for it with an everlasting love.<br>The French historian Chateaubriand, visiting Jerusalem in the early nineteenth century, was overcome with emotion as he saw for the first time the small Jewish community there, waiting patiently for the Messiah. “This people,” he wrote, “has seen Jerusalem destroyed seventeen times, yet there exists nothing in the world which can discourage it or prevent it from raising its eyes to Zion. He who beholds the Jews dispersed over the face of the earth, in keeping with the Word of God, lingers and marvels. But he will be struck with amazement, as at a miracle, who finds them still in Jerusalem and perceives even, who in law and justice are the masters of Judea, to exist as slaves and strangers in their own land; how despite all abuses they await the king who is to deliver them.” <br>Noting how this “small nation” had survived while the great empires who sought its destruction had vanished, he added, “If there is anything among the nations of the world marked with the stamp of the miraculous, this, in our opinion, is that miracle.”<br>It is said that Napoleon, passing a synagogue on Tisha B’Av, was struck by the sounds of lament coming from the building. “What,” he asked one of his officers, “are the Jews crying for?” “For Jerusalem,” came the reply. “How long ago did they lose Jerusalem?” “More than seventeen hundred years ago.” Napoleon was silent for a moment and then said, “A people that can remember Jerusalem for so long will one day have it restored to them.” So it has come to pass in our time.

And It Happened at Midnight



Paragraph 1



Paragraph 2

<b><small>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT</small></b><br><i>Yannai, who wrote this hymn,</i> was one of the earliest and most influential of Judaism’s liturgical poets. Much of his work has been rediscovered in the twentieth century through findings such as the Cairo Geniza. He lived during or before the sixth century ce.<br>Since the seder service is one of the few rituals to take place at night, Yannai enumerates other salvations that took place at night. Abraham won his battle against the four kings (Gen. 14:15). Avimelekh, king of Gerar, was told by God that by taking Sarah he was stealing Abraham’s wife (ibid. 20:2–3). Laban was visited by God in a dream and told not to harm his son-in-law Jacob (ibid. 31:29). Jacob wrestled with an angel (ibid. 32:25). Sisera, the Canaanite general, was defeated by Deborah and Barak (Judges 5). Sennacherib, king of Assyria, withdrew from his threatened assault on Hezekiah when a large part of his army died mysteriously at night (II Kings 19). Daniel was granted a revelation of the meaning of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, and was rescued from the lion’s den (Dan. 2:19, 6:20). Belshazar, who removed the vessels from the Temple, died (ibid. 5:30). Aḥashverosh, unable to sleep, had his servant read to him from the royal chronicles and remembered that Mordekhai had saved his life (Esther 6:1) – the beginning of the events that led to the downfall of Haman and the deliverance we recall on Purim. These are the many echoes of <i>leil shimurim</i>, the “night of God’s protection.”

Zevach Pesach



Paragraph 1

<b><small>TELL [YOUR CHILDREN]: “THIS IS THE PESAḤ”</small></b><br><i>This poem, read on the second night</i>, was written by Yannai’s disciple, the poet Elazar Kalir. The refrain is taken from Exodus 12:27: when your child asks you to explain the Pesaḥ rituals, “you shall say, ‘This is the Pesaḥ offering.’”<br>Kalir gathers together the many events that, according to tradition, took place on Pesaḥ. At the Covenant between the Pieces, Abraham foresaw that his descendants would suffer exile and affliction (Gen. 15:12–21). He was visited by the angels who told him Sarah would have a child (ibid. 18). Lot, too, was visited by the angels who rescued him from the destruction of Sodom (ibid. 19). God protected the Israelites and devastated the Egyptians during the last plague, the death of the firstborn (Ex. 12:29–32). Jericho was besieged and destroyed by Joshua after the Israelites had celebrated Pesaḥ (Josh. 5–6). Gideon defeated the Midianites (Judges 6–7), and Sennacherib, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians all suffered setbacks at this time of the year. Esther fasted and Haman was hanged on Pesaḥ.<br>Pesaḥ is thus the time not of one deliverance, but of many. It is characteristic of the rabbinic sense of time to combine the recollection of many events into a single day. Thus Tisha B’Av became the time when we recall the many tragedies of  Jewish history. Pesaḥ is a moment to remember many liberations. In this way time itself is woven into a text whose theme – exile, suffering, redemption, freedom, return – is written into the structure of Jewish history and becomes the master narrative through which we understand who we are and the story of which we are a part.

Ki Lo Na'e



Paragraph 1

<b><small>YOURS AND YOURS</small></b><br><i>This poem, which, like the others that follow,</i> has no specific connection to Pesaḥ, may have been composed by Rabbi Jacob Ḥazan of London. It appears in his work <i>Etz Ḥayim</i>, and may therefore be the one British contribution to the Haggada. It is built around the word <i>Lekha</i>, “Yours” – as in such biblical phrases as “Day is Yours, and Yours the night” (Ps. 74:16), “The heavens are Yours, and also the earth” (ibid. 89:12), “Yours, LORD, is the greatness and the power” (I Chr. 19:11), “To You is it due” (Jer. 10:7). According to Abrabanel, the sevenfold repetition of <i>Lekha</i> represents the seven heavens, the seven constellations, and the seven days of the week. It may also be a reference to the seven occasions in the Bible where the word <i>Lekha</i> is used to state that to God alone belong strength and praise. The opening words, <i>Adir bimelukha</i>, “Mighty in kingship,” may have suggested a link with Pesaḥ, for it was then, with the defeat of Pharaoh, that the sovereignty of God over all human powers was first demonstrated and established as a principle of faith.

Paragraph 1

<b><small>HE IS MAJESTIC</small></b><br><i>This song, sung in medieval Avignon on all festivals,</i> entered the Haggada in the fourteenth century. It expresses the tradition that, though the First and Second Temples were built by human hands and were later destroyed, the Third will be built by God Himself and will endure forever.

Echad Mi Yodea



Paragraph 1

<b><small>WHO KNOWS ONE?</small></b><br><i>This song, like “One Little Goat,”</i> appears for the first time in the Prague Haggada of 1590, though there is evidence that it was known and sung several centuries earlier. In medieval Avignon it was sung on the festival of Sukkot. In Cochin it was sung at weddings, probably having been brought to India by Spanish or Portuguese Jewish merchants. In this, as in so many other medieval additions to the Haggada, we can trace the spread of customs from one part of the Jewish world to others – testimony to the fact that though they were dispersed at an age when international travel was rare and hazardous, Jews throughout the world maintained contact with one another and saw themselves as a global people.<br>“Who Knows One?” is almost certainly a song that comes originally from the schoolroom, and evokes the remarkable world of Jewish education at a time when the rest of Europe was largely sunk in ignorance and illiteracy. Wherever they went, Jews built schools, often supported by communal levies, to ensure that every child had an education. In the early Middle Ages a pupil of the great Christian thinker Abelard observed: “A Jew, however poor, if he has ten sons, will put them all to letters, not for gain as the Christians do, but for the understanding of God’s law – and not only his sons but his daughters too.”<br>The history of Jewish education is unique. More than a thousand years before the Common Era, in the period of the judges, we read of how Gideon spoke to a young man he met in the town of Sukkot and asked him to write down the names of the town’s elders. He did so, producing a list of seventy-seven names (Judges 8:14). The episode suggests that already three thousand years ago universal literacy was normal among Jews. It did not become a feature of Europe until the late nineteenth century.<br>“Who Knows One?” is probably the song through which Jewish children were taught to count, and suggests that even secular instruction, such as arithmetic, was infused with religious meaning. The numbers each had their significance in the spiritual life of Judaism. A lovely description has survived from medieval Ashkenaz, where this song was composed, of how a Jewish child was brought for his first day at school:<br><span class="poetry indentAll">They write the letters of the Hebrew alphabet on a board for him; and they wash him and dress him in clean garments, and they knead him three loaves of fine wheat in honey…. And they boil him three eggs and bring him apples and other kinds of fruit, and seek a worthy sage to conduct him to the schoolhouse. He covers him with a prayer shawl and brings him to the synagogue, where they feed him with the loaves of honey and the eggs and fruit; and they read him the letters. After that they cover the board with honey and tell him to lick it. Then they lead him back to his mother. (<i>Maḥzor Vitri</i>, 508)</span><br>The ceremony graphically conveyed to the child that learning was sweet, that the entire community rejoiced in the start of his studies, and that by so doing he was entering a life that would eventually see him charged with responsibility for continuing the tradition and passing it on, in turn, to his children. No other civilization has invested the life of learning with such simple beauty and high religious drama. When a young child was first brought to school, it was said in those times, “It is as though they brought him to Mount Sinai.”

Paragraph 1

<b><small>ONE LITTLE GOAT</small></b><br><i>That we end one of Judaism’s most sacred rituals</i> with a children’s song tells us much about what sustained Judaism as a faith for longer, under more arduous circumstances, than any other heritage in the West. The Jewish love of children means that Jews look forward to the future even more than we look back to the past. Just as we began the seder with the questions of a child, so we conclude it with a nursery rhyme, reminding ourselves that what sustains a faith is not strength or power, but its ability to inspire successive generations of children to add their voices to their people’s song.<br>The song itself, disarming in its simplicity, teaches the great truth of Jewish hope: that though many nations (symbolized by the cat, the dog, and so on) attacked Israel (the “goat”), each in turn has vanished into oblivion. At the end of days God will vanquish the angel of death and inaugurate a world of life and peace, the two great Jewish loves.<br>Perhaps, too, there is deeper symbolism. The kid eaten by the cat reminds us of the story of Joseph, sold into slavery. His brothers then slaughtered a kid, dipped Joseph’s coat in its blood, and showed it to their father to persuade him that Joseph had been killed by a wild animal. Outwardly, Jacob accepted their story. However, the Torah says that “he refused to be comforted” (Gen. 37:35). Jewish law states that there is a limit to the period of mourning. Why, then, did Jacob say he would <i>never</i> be comforted? A profound rabbinic commentary explains that there is a time limit to mourning only when one is sure someone has died. Jacob, however, never gave up believing there was a chance, however slim, that Joseph was still alive. His refusal to be comforted was a refusal to give up hope, and in the end it was justified. Joseph <i>was</i> still alive, and he and his father were eventually reunited.<br><i>Ḥad Gadya</i> expresses the Jewish refusal to give up hope. Though history is full of man’s inhumanity to man – dog bites cat, stick hits dog – that is not the final verse. The Haggada ends with the death of death in eternal life, a fitting end for the story of a people dedicated to Moses’ great command, “Choose life” (Deut. 30:19).
