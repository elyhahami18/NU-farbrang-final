Pesach Haggadah

Kadesh

<i>The first cup of wine is poured. Lift the cup with the right hand and say the following:</i>
KADESH / KIDDUSH
<i>On Shabbat add:</i>
<i>quietly:</i> And it was evening, and it was morning –<br>יוֹם הַשִּׁשִּׁי the sixth day.<br>Then the heavens and the earth were completed,<br>and all their array.<br>With the seventh day, God completed the work He had done.<br>He ceased on the seventh day from all the work He had done.<br>God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy,<br>because on it<br>He ceased from all His work He had created to do.
<i>On other evenings Kiddush starts here:</i>
<i>When saying Kiddush for others, add:</i><br>Please pay attention, my masters.<br>Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God, King of the Universe,<br>who creates the fruit of the vine.
<i>On Shabbat, add the words in parentheses.</i><br>בָּרוּךְ Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>King of the Universe,<br>who has chosen us from among all peoples,<br>raised us above all tongues, and made us holy<br>through His commandments.<br>You have given us,<br>L<small>ORD</small> our God, in love<br>(Sabbaths for rest),<br>festivals for rejoicing,<br>holy days and seasons for joy,<br>(this Sabbath day and)<br>this day of the festival of Matzot,<br>the time of our freedom<br>(with love), a holy assembly in memory<br>of the Exodus from Egypt.<br>For You have chosen us<br>and sanctified us<br>above all peoples,<br>and given us as our heritage<br>(Your holy Sabbath in love and favor and)<br>Your holy festivals for joy and gladness.
Blessed are you, L<small>ORD</small>,<br>who sanctifies (the Sabbath,) Israel and the festivals.
<i>On Motza'ei Shabbat, the following Havdala is added:</i>
בָּרוּךְ Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>King of the Universe,<br>who creates the lights of fire.<br>Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>King of the Universe,<br>who distinguishes between sacred and secular,<br>between light and darkness,<br>between Israel and the nations,<br>between the seventh day and the six days of work.<br>You have made a distinction<br>between the holiness of the Sabbath<br>and the holiness of festivals,<br>and have sanctified<br>the seventh day above the six days of work.<br>You have distinguished and sanctified<br>Your people Israel with Your holiness.
Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small>,<br>who distinguishes between sacred and sacred.
בָּרוּךְ Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>King of the Universe,<br>who has given us life, sustained us,<br>and brought us to this time.
<i>Drink while reclining to the left.</i>

Urchatz

URHATZ / WASHING
<i>Water is brought to the leader.</i>

Karpas

KARPAS
<i>The participants wash their hands but do not say a blessing.</i><br><i>A small quantity of radish, greens, or roots of parsley is dipped in salt water.</i><br><i>Say the following over the karpas,<br>with the intent to include the maror in the blessing:</i>
בָּרוּךְ Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God,<br>King of the Universe,<br>who creates the fruit of the ground.<br><i>Eat without reclining.</i>

Yachatz

YAHATZ / SPLITTING
<i>The middle matza is broken in two.</i><br><i>The bigger portion is then hidden away to serve as the afikoman<br>with which the meal is later concluded.</i><br><i>The smaller portion is placed between the two whole matzot.</i>

Magid

Ha Lachma Anya

MAGGID / TELLING
<i>During the recital of this paragraph<br>the seder plate is held up<br>and the middle matza is displayed to the company.</i>
הָא לַחְמָא עַנְיָא THIS<br>IS THE BREAD OF OPPRESSION<br>our fathers ate<br>in the land of Egypt.<br>Let all who are hungry<br>come in and eat;<br>let all who are in need<br>come and join us for the Pesaḥ.<br>Now we are here;<br>next year in the land of Israel.<br>Now – slaves;<br>next year we shall be free.

Four Questions

<i>The seder plate and the matzot are now covered and the second cup of wine is poured.<br>The youngest child asks the following questions:</i>
מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה WHAT MAKES<br>THIS NIGHT UNLIKE ALL OTHER NIGHTS,<br>so that every other night we eat either bread or matza,<br>but tonight there is only matza?<br>And that every other night we eat many different greens,<br>but tonight we will eat bitter herbs?<br>And that every other night we do not dip [our food] at all,<br>but tonight we will dip it twice?<br>And that every other night some sit to eat and some recline,<br>but tonight we are all reclining?

We Were Slaves in Egypt

<i>The seder plate and the matzot are uncovered.</i>
עֲבָדִים הָיִינוּ WE WERE SLAVES<br>to Pharaoh in Egypt,<br>and the L<small>ORD</small> our God brought us out of there<br>with a strong hand and an outstretched arm.<br>And if the Holy One, blessed be He,<br>had not brought our fathers out of Egypt –<br>then we, and our children, and the children of our children,<br>would still be enslaved to Pharaoh in Egypt.<br>And even were we all wise, all intelligent,<br>all aged and all knowledgeable in the Torah,<br>still the command would be upon us<br>to tell of the coming out of Egypt;<br>and the more one tells of the coming out of Egypt,<br>the more admirable it is.

Story of the Five Rabbis

מַעֲשֶׁה ONCE,<br>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria<br>and Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon<br>reclined [for the seder] in Benei Brak.<br>And they told of the Exodus from Egypt all that night;<br>until their students came in and said,<br>“Teachers –<br>the time for saying the <i>Shema</i> of the morning has come.”
Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria said:<br>I am almost seventy years old,<br>and never have I merited to find the command<br>to speak of the Exodus from Egypt at night –<br>until Ben Zoma interpreted:<br>It is written,<br>“SO THAT YOU REMEMBER<br>THE DAY OF YOUR EXODUS FROM EGYPT<br>ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE.”<br>“The days of your life” would mean in the days;<br>“all the days of your life” includes the nights.<br>But the sages say,<br>“The days of your life” would mean only in this world;<br>“all the days of your life” brings in the time of the Messiah.

The Four Sons

בָּרוּךְ הַמָּקוֹם  Blessed is the Omnipresent –<br>blessed is He.<br>Blessed is the One<br>who gave His people Israel, the Torah –<br>blessed is He.<br>כְּנֶגֶד אַרְבָּעָה בָּנִים The Torah relates<br>to four types of sons –<br>one who is wise,<br>one who is wicked,<br>one with a simple nature,<br>and one who does not know how to ask.
The<br>WISE SON<br>what does he say?<br>“What are the testimonies, the statutes and laws,<br>that the L<small>ORD</small> our God commanded you?”<br>And you must tell him the laws of Pesaḥ:<br>“After eating the Pesaḥ offering<br>one does not eat anything more.”
The<br>WICKED SON<br>what does he say?<br>“What is this service to you?”<br>“To you,” he says, not to him.<br>When he sets himself apart from the community,<br>he denies the very core of our beliefs.<br>And you must set his teeth on edge and tell him,<br>“Because of this<br>the L<small>ORD</small> acted for me when I came out of Egypt.”<br>“For me,” and not for <i>him;</i><br>had he been there he would not have been redeemed.
The<br>SIMPLE-NATURED SON<br>what does he say?<br>“What is this?”<br>And you must tell him,<br>“With a strong hand the L<small>ORD</small><br>brought us out of Egypt,<br>from the grip of slavery.”
And the<br>ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW<br>HOW TO ASK<br>you must open [the story] for him,<br>as it is said:<br>“And you shall tell your child<br>on that day,<br>‘Because of this the L<small>ORD</small> acted for me<br>when I came out of Egypt.’”

Yechol Me'rosh Chodesh

וְהִגַּדְתָּ לְבִנְךָ “AND YOU SHALL TELL YOUR CHILD” –<br>One might have thought<br>this meant from the beginning of the month.<br>And so it says, “on that day.”<br>Had it said only “on that day,”<br>one might have thought [the obligation] applied during the day.<br>And so it also says, “Because of this” –<br>“because of <i>this”</i> can only be said<br>when matza and bitter herbs are there before you.

In the Beginning Our Fathers Were Idol Worshipers

מִתְּחִלָּה IN THE BEGINNING,<br>our ancestors were idol worshippers.<br>BUT NOW<br>the Omnipresent has drawn us close in His service;<br>as it is said:<br>“Joshua said to all the people,<br>‘This is what the L<small>ORD</small> God of Israel has said:<br>Beyond the river your ancestors always dwelled –<br>Terah the father of Abraham, the father of Nahor –<br>and they served other gods.
But I took your father Abraham from beyond the river,<br>and I led him all the way across the land of Canaan,<br>and I multiplied his offspring and gave him Isaac.<br>And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau,<br>and I gave Esau Mount Seir as an inheritance,<br>WHILE JACOB AND HIS CHILDREN WENT DOWN TO EGYPT.”’
BLESSED IS THE ONE<br>WHO HAS KEPT HIS PROMISE<br>TO ISRAEL –<br>blessed is He.<br>For the Holy One calculated the end<br>and fulfilled what He had spoken<br>to our father Abraham<br>in the Covenant between the Pieces.<br>As it is said:<br>“He said to Abram,<br>‘Know that your descendants<br>will be strangers in a land not their own,<br>and they will be enslaved<br>and oppressed for four hundred years;<br>but know that I shall judge the nation that enslaves them,<br>AND THEN THEY WILL LEAVE<br>WITH GREAT WEALTH.’”
<i>The matzot are covered and the wine cup is raised.</i>
וְהִיא שֶׁעָמְדָה AND THIS<br>[promise] is what has stood<br>by our ancestors and us;<br>for it was not only one man who rose up to destroy us:<br>in every single generation people rise up to destroy us –<br>BUT THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE,<br>SAVES US<br>FROM THEIR HANDS.

First Fruits Declaration

<i>The wine cup is put down and the matzot are uncovered.</i>
צֵא וּלְמַד GO [to the verse]<br>AND LEARN<br>what Laban the Aramean<br>sought to do to our father Jacob:<br>Pharaoh condemned only the boys to death,<br>but Laban sought to uproot everything,<br>as it is written:<br>“AN ARAMEAN SOUGHT MY FATHER'S DEATH,<br>AND HE WENT DOWN TO EGYPT<br>AND RESIDED THERE,<br>JUST A HANDFUL OF SOULS;<br>AND THERE HE BECAME A NATION –<br>LARGE, MIGHTY, AND GREAT.”
“AND HE WENT DOWN TO EGYPT” –<br>Compelled by what had been spoken.<br>“AND RESIDED THERE” –<br>From this, learn that our father Jacob went down<br>not to be absorbed into Egypt,<br>but only to reside there for a time.<br>As it is said:<br>“They said to Pharaoh,<br>‘We have come to <i>reside</i> in this land,<br>for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks,<br>for the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan;<br>and now, if you please,<br>let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.’”
“JUST A HANDFUL OF SOULS” –<br>As it is said:<br>“Your ancestors were but seventy souls<br>when they went down to Egypt –<br>and now the L<small>ORD</small> has made you<br>as many as the sky has stars.”
“AND THERE HE BECAME A NATION” –<br>From this, learn that Israel was distinct there.<br>“LARGE, MIGHTY” –<br>As it is said:<br>“And the children of Israel were fertile,<br>and they swarmed,<br>and grew <i>more and more numerous</i><br>and strong, and the land was filled with them.”
“AND GREAT” –<br>As it is said:<br>“I let you <i>grow wild</i> like meadow plants,<br>and you grew and matured and came forth in all your glory,<br>your breasts full and your hair grown,<br>and you were naked and exposed.”<br><i>Some add:</i><br>“And I passed by you<br>and saw you wallowing in your own blood –<br>and I said to you, ‘In your blood, live!’<br>and I said, ‘In your blood, live!’”
“AND THE EGYPTIANS DEALT CRUELLY WITH US<br>AND OPPRESSED US,<br>AND IMPOSED HARD LABOR ON US.”<br>“THE EGYPTIANS DEALT CRUELLY WITH US” –<br>As it is said:<br>“We must act wisely against [this people],<br>in case it grows great,<br>and when we are called to war<br>they may join our enemies,<br>fight against us,<br>and rise up to leave the land.”
“AND OPPRESSED US” –<br>As it is said:<br>“They placed taskmasters over [the people]<br>to <i>oppress</i> them under their burdens;<br>they built store cities for Pharaoh:<br>Pithom and Raamses.”
“AND IMPOSED HARD LABOR ON us” –<br>As it is said:<br><i>“The Egyptians enslaved the children of Israel</i><br>with <i>heavy labor.”</i>
---
“AND WE CRIED OUT TO THE LORD,<br>GOD OF OUR ANCESTORS,<br>AND THE LORD HEARD OUR VOICE,<br>AND HE SAW OUR OPPRESSION<br>AND OUR LABOR AND SLAVERY.”
“AND WE CRIED OUT TO THE LORD,<br>GOD OF OUR ANCESTORS” –<br>As it is said:<br>“It came to be, as a long time passed,<br>that the king of Egypt died,<br>and the children of Israel<br>groaned under the burden of work,<br>and they <i>cried out,</i><br>and their plea rose to God from amid the work.”
“AND THE LORD HEARD OUR VOICE” –<br>As it is said:<br>“And God <i>heard</i> their groans,<br>and God remembered His covenant<br>with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
“AND HE SAW OUR OPPRESSION” –<br>The separation of husband from wife,<br>as it is said:<br>“And God saw the children of Israel,<br>and God knew.”
“AND OUR LABOR” –<br>[The killing of] the sons,<br>as it is said:<br>“Throw every boy who is born into the river,<br>and the girls let live.”
“AND SLAVERY” –<br>The forced labor that was pressed down on them,<br>as it is said:<br>“I have seen the <i>slavery</i><br>that Egypt forced upon you.”
“AND THE LORD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT<br>WITH A STRONG HAND AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM,<br>IN AN AWESOME HAPPENING,<br>WITH SIGNS AND WITH WONDERS.”
“AND THE LORD BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT” –<br>Not through an angel,<br>not through a seraph,<br>not through any emissary.<br>No, it was the Holy One, His glory, His own presence.<br>As it is said:<br>“I shall pass through the land of Egypt on that night;<br>I shall kill every firstborn son in the land of Egypt,<br>man and beast,<br>and I shall pass judgment on all the gods of Egypt:<br>I am the LORD.”
“I shall pass through<br>the land of Egypt on that night” – I and no angel.<br>“I shall kill every firstborn son in<br>the land of Egypt” – I and no seraph.<br>“And I shall pass judgment on all<br>the gods of Egypt” – I and no emissary.<br>“I am the L<small>ORD</small>” – It is I and no other.
“WITH A STRONG HAND” –<br>This refers to the pestilence,<br>as it is said:<br>“You shall see the <i>hand</i> of the L<small>ORD</small><br>among your cattle in the field,<br>among your horses and donkeys and camels,<br>in the herd and in the flock,<br>bringing harsh, heavy pestilence.”
“AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM” –<br>This refers to the sword,<br>as it is said:<br>“And His sword was drawn in His hand,<br><i>stretched out</i> over Jerusalem.”
“IN AN AWESOME HAPPENING” –<br>This refers to the revelation of His Presence,<br>as it is said:<br>“Has any god ever tried to come<br>and take a nation out of the midst of another,<br>with trials<br>and with signs<br>and wonders,<br>in war<br>and with a strong hand,<br>with an outstretched arm,<br>inspiring <i>great awe,</i><br>as the L<small>ORD</small> your God has done all this<br>for you in Egypt,<br>before your eyes?”
“WITH SIGNS” –<br>This refers to the staff,<br>as it is said:<br>“Take this staff in your hand,<br>and with it you shall perform the <i>signs</i>.”
“AND WITH WONDERS” –<br>This refers to the blood,<br>as it is said:<br>“I shall make <i>wonders</i><br>in the sky and on the earth –

The Ten Plagues

<i>A drop of wine is spilled from the cup as each wonder is mentioned:</i>
BLOOD, AND FIRE,<br>AND PILLARS OF SMOKE.”
---
דָּבָר אַחֵר Another interpretation:<br>“With a strong hand” – Two.<br>“And an outstretched arm” – Two.<br>“In an awesome happening” – Two.<br>“With signs” – Two.<br>“And with wonders” – Two.
THESE WERE THE TEN PLAGUES<br>that the Holy One brought<br>upon Egypt,<br>and these are they –
<i>A drop of wine is spilled from the cup as each plague, and each of the acronyms,<br>Detzakh, Adash and Be’ahav, is mentioned:</i>
BLOOD 
FROGS 
LICE
WILD ANIMALS  
PESTILENCE
BOILS
HAIL 
LOCUSTS 
DARKNESS
THE STRIKING DOWN OF THE FIRSTBORN.
Rabbi Yehuda grouped these under acronyms –<br>DETZAKH, ADASH, BEAḤAV.
רַבִּי יוֹסֵי הַגְּלִילִי RABBI Yossei HaGelili says: How can you know<br>that the Egyptians were struck with ten plagues in Egypt<br>and another fifty at the sea?<br>For in Egypt it is said,<br>“The astrologers said to Pharaoh, ‘This is the <i>finger</i> of God,’”<br>while at the sea it is said,<br>“When Israel saw the great <i>hand</i><br>the L<small>ORD</small> raised against the Egyptians,<br>the people feared the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>and they believed in the L<small>ORD</small> and in His servant Moses.”<br>If a finger struck them with ten plagues,<br>conclude from this that<br>THEY WERE STRUCK WITH TEN PLAGUES IN EGYPT<br>AND WITH FIFTY PLAGUES AT THE SEA.
Rabbi Eliezer says: How can you know<br>that each and every plague<br>the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt<br>was in fact made up of four plagues?<br>For it is said,<br>“His fury was sent down upon them,<br>great anger, rage, and distress,<br>a company of messengers of destruction.”<br>“Great anger” – one,<br>“rage” – two,<br>“distress” – three,<br>“a company of messengers of destruction” – four.<br>Conclude from this that<br>THEY WERE STRUCK WITH FORTY PLAGUES IN EGYPT<br>AND WITH TWO HUNDRED PLAGUES AT THE SEA.
Rabbi Akiva says: How can you know<br>that each and every plague<br>the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt<br>was in fact made up of five plagues?<br>For it is said,<br>“His fury was sent down upon them,<br>great anger, rage, and distress,<br>a company of messengers of destruction.”<br>“His fury” – one,<br>“great anger” – two,<br>“rage” – three,<br>“distress” – four,<br>“a company of messengers of destruction” – five.<br>Conclude from this that<br>THEY WERE STRUCK WITH FIFTY PLAGUES IN EGYPT<br>AND WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLAGUES<br>AT THE SEA.

כַּמָּה מַעֲלוֹת טוֹבוֹת HOW MUCH GOOD,<br>LAYER UPON LAYER,<br>THE OMNIPRESENT HAS DONE FOR US:
Had He brought us out of Egypt<br>without bringing judgment upon<br>[our oppressors],<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He brought judgment upon them<br>but not upon their gods,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He brought judgment upon their gods<br>without killing their firstborn sons,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He killed their firstborn sons<br>without giving us their wealth,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He given us their wealth<br>without splitting the sea for us,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He split the sea for us<br>but not brought us through it dry,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He brought us through [the sea] dry<br>without drowning our enemies in it,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He drowned our enemies in it<br>without providing for our needs<br>for forty years in the desert,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He provided for our needs<br>for forty years in the desert,<br>without feeding us with manna,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He fed us with manna<br>without giving us Shabbat,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He given us Shabbat<br>without drawing us close<br>around Mount Sinai,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He drawn us close around Mount Sinai<br>without giving us the Torah,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He given us the Torah<br>without bringing us to the land of Israel,<br>that would have been enough for us.
Had He brought us to the land of Israel<br>without building for us<br>the House He chose<br>that would have been enough for us.
עַל אַחַת כַּמָּה וְכַמָּה HOW MANY<br>AND MANIFOLD THEN,<br>THE OMNIPRESENT’S KINDNESSES<br>ARE TO US –<br>for He brought us out of Egypt<br>and brought judgment upon<br>[our oppressors]<br>and upon their gods,<br>and He killed their firstborn sons<br>and gave us their wealth,<br>and He split the sea for us<br>and brought us through it on dry land<br>and drowned our enemies there,<br>and He provided for our needs<br>for forty years in the desert<br>and fed us manna,<br>and He gave us Shabbat,<br>and He drew us close<br>around Mount Sinai<br>and gave us the Torah,<br>and He brought us to the land of Israel<br>and built for us the House He chose,<br>SO WE<br>COULD FIND<br>ATONEMENT [THERE]<br>FOR ALL OUR SINS.

Rabban Gamliel's Three Things

רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל Rabban Gamliel would say:<br>Anyone who does not say these three things on Pesaḥ<br>has not fulfilled his obligation, and these are they:<br>PESAḤ, MATZA, AND BITTER HERBS.
The<br>PESAḤ<br>is what our ancestors would eat while the Temple stood:<br>and what does it recall?<br>It recalls the Holy One’s<br>passing over (<i>Pasah</i>) the houses of our ancestors in Egypt,<br>as it is said:<br>“You shall say:<br>‘It is a Pesaḥ offering for the L<small>ORD</small>,<br>for He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt<br>while He struck the Egyptians,<br>but saved those in our homes’ –<br>and the people bowed and prostrated themselves.”
<i>The matzot are now lifted:</i>
THIS MATZA<br>that we eat:<br>what does it recall?<br>It recalls the dough of our ancestors,<br>which did not have time to rise<br>before the King, King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He,<br>revealed Himself and redeemed them,<br>as it is said:<br>“They baked the dough that they had brought out of Egypt<br>into unleavened cakes, for it had not risen,<br>for they were cast out of Egypt and could not delay,<br>and they made no provision for the way.”
<i>The bitter herbs are now lifted:</i>
THESE BITTER HERBS<br>that we eat:<br>what do they recall?<br>They recall the bitterness that the Egyptians imposed<br>on the lives of our ancestors in Egypt,<br>as it is said:<br>“They embittered their lives with hard labor,<br>with clay and with bricks<br>and with all field labors, with all the work<br>with which they enslaved them – hard labor.”
בְּכָָל דּוֹר וָדוֹר GENERATION BY GENERATION,<br>each person must see himself<br>as if he himself had come out of Egypt,<br>as it is said:<br>“And you shall tell your child on that day,<br>‘Because of this the L<small>ORD</small> acted for me<br>when I came out of Egypt.’”<br>It was not only our ancestors<br>whom the Holy One redeemed;<br>He redeemed us too along with them,<br>as it is said:<br>“He took us out of there,<br>to bring us to the land<br>He promised our ancestors and to give it to us.”

First Half of Hallel

<i>The matzot are covered and the cup is raised.</i>
לְפִיכָךְ Therefore it is our duty<br>to thank, praise, laud,<br>glorify, exalt, honor,<br>bless, raise high, and acclaim<br>the One who has performed all these miracles<br>for our ancestors and for us;<br>who has brought us out from slavery to freedom,<br>from sorrow to joy, from grief to celebration;<br>from darkness to great light<br>and from enslavement to redemption;<br>and so we shall sing a new song before Him.<br>HALLELUYA!<br><i>The cup is put down.</i>
הַלְלוּיָהּ HALLELUYA!<br>Servants of the L<small>ORD</small>, give praise;<br>praise the name of the L<small>ORD</small>.<br>Blessed be the name of the L<small>ORD</small><br>now and for evermore.<br>From the rising of the sun to its setting,<br>may the L<small>ORD</small>’S name be praised.<br>High is the L<small>ORD</small> above all nations;<br>His glory is above the heavens.<br>Who is like the L<small>ORD</small> our God, who sits enthroned so high,<br>yet turns so low to see the heavens and the earth?<br>He raises the poor from the dust<br>and the needy from the refuse heap,<br>giving them a place alongside princes,<br>the princes of His people.<br>He makes the woman in a childless house<br>a happy mother of children.<br>HALLELUYA!
בְּצֵאת When Israel came out of Egypt,<br>the house ofJacob from a people of foreign tongue,<br>Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.<br>The sea saw and fled; the Jordan turned back.<br>The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.<br>Why was it, sea, that you fled? Jordan, why did you turn back?<br>Why, mountains, did you skip like rams,<br>and you, hills, like lambs?<br>It was at the presence of the L<small>ORD</small>, Creator of the earth,<br>at the presence of the God of Jacob,<br>who turned the rock into a pool of water,<br>flint into a flowing spring.

Second Cup of Wine

<i>The cup is raised.</i>
בָּרוּךְ Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small> our God, King of the Universe,<br>who has redeemed us<br>and redeemed our ancestors from Egypt,<br>and brought us to this night to eat matza and bitter herbs.<br>So may the L<small>ORD</small> our God bring us in peace<br>to other seasons and festivals that are coming to us,<br>happy in the building of Your city<br>and rejoicing in Your service;<br>and there we shall eat of sacrifices and Pesaḥ offerings<br><i>[On Motzaei Shabbat:</i> of Pesaḥ offerings and sacrifices],<br>of which the blood will reach<br>the side of Your altar to be accepted.<br>And we shall thank You in a new song<br>for our redemption and for our lives’ salvation.<br>Blessed are You, L<small>ORD</small>, Redeemer of Israel.

NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM REBUILT!

And It Happened at Midnight

<i>Outside Israel, this poem is recited on the first night of the festival only.</i>
וּבְכֵן וַיְהִי בַּחֲצִי הַלַּיְלָה AND so – IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
Many were the miracles You performed long ago, at night.
At the beginning of the watch, on this night,<br>You won [Abraham]’s battle, when [his men were] split, and the night<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
You judged the king of Gerar in his dream at night.<br>You put dread into [Laban] the Aramean’s heart that night.
And Israel struggled with an angel and overcame him at night<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
You crushed the firstborns of Patros [Egypt] in the middle of the night.<br>They could not find their strength, when they rose up<br>[against Israel] at night.<br>You flung [Sisera] the commander of Haroshet<br>off course with the stars of night<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
[Sennacherib] the blasphemer thought to raise his hand<br>against the beloved [city]; but You dried up the bodies<br>of his fallen in the night.<br>You overthrew Bel, idol and pedestal together, in the dead of night.<br>To [Daniel] the beloved man were revealed<br>the secrets of that vision of the night<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
[Belshazzar], who drank himself merry<br>from the holy vessels, was killed on that same night.<br>[Daniel] was brought out unharmed from the<br>lions’ den; he who had explained those terrors of the night.<br>[Haman] the Agagite bore his hatred and wrote his orders at night<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
You awakened Your might against him, disturbing<br>[King Ahashverosh’s] sleep at night.<br>You shall tread the winepress of [Se’ir],<br>who asks anxiously, “What of the night?”<br>You will cry out like the watchman, calling,<br>“Morning is come, and also night”<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.
Draw near the day that will be neither day nor night.<br>Highest One, make known that day is Yours and also night.<br>Appoint watchmen [to guard] Your city all day long and all night,<br>Light up like daylight the darkness of night<br>IT HAPPENED AT MIDNIGHT.

Zevach Pesach

<i>Outside Israel, this poem is recited on the second night of the festival only.</i>
וּבְכֵן וַאֲמַרְתֶּם זֶבַח פֶּסַח TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”<br>You showed Your immense power in wonders on Pesaḥ;<br>to the head of all seasons You have raised up Pesaḥ.<br>You revealed to [Abraham] the Ezrahi what would come<br>at midnight on Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
You knocked at his doors in the heat of the day on Pesaḥ;<br>he gave Your shining [messengers] unleavened cakes to eat on Pesaḥ;<br>and he ran to the herd, hinting at the ox in the Torah reading of Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
The men of Sodom raged and burned in fire on Pesaḥ.<br>Lot was saved; he baked matzot at the end of Pesaḥ.<br>You swept bare the land of Mof and Nof [Egypt]<br>in Your great rage on Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
The firstborns of [Egypt’s] vigor You crushed, L<small>ORD</small>,<br>on the night of guarding, on Pesaḥ.<br>[But,] Mighty One, You passed over Your firstborn son<br>when You saw the blood of the Pesaḥ,<br>allowing no destruction through my doors on Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
The walled city [ofJericho] was closed [for fear] when it was Pesaḥ.<br>Midian was destroyed in the din, [after a dream of]<br>Omer barley on Pesaḥ.<br>The fat ones of [Assyria; of] Pul and Lud were<br>burned away in fires on Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
This day [Sennacherib] halted at Nob [and laid siege]<br>until the time of Pesaḥ.<br>A hand wrote Babylonia’s doom on the wall at Pesaḥ:<br>the lamp was lit, the table was laid on Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
Hadassa gathered the people to fast three days at Pesaḥ;<br>You crushed [Haman,] the head of that evil family,<br>on a gallows fifty cubits high on Pesaḥ.<br>[Loss and widowhood -] You will bring these two<br>in a moment to [Edom, which rules us now,] on Pesaḥ.<br>Strengthen Your hand, raise Your right hand,<br>as on the night first sanctified as Pesaḥ.<br>TELL [your children]: “THIS IS THE PESAH.”
