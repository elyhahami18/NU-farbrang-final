Akdamut Milin



Piyyut 1

An introduction of words and the beginning of speech,
Firstly, I take authorization and permission;
In two or three gates (units, stanzas), which I shall commence in trembling,
With permission from Him, Who created [man] and bears [his guilt] till senescence.
Eternal mighty acts are His, and there is no sufficient enumeration [for them],
[And] were the skies parchment, reed [pen]s all the forests;
Were the seas ink and all the assembled waters,
The inhabitants of the earth scribes, and writers of rəšūyōṯ (panegyrical hymns);
The glory of the Master of heaven and Ruler over the dry land,
Who set up the world single-handedly, and holds it in subjugation;
And without weariness completed it, and without feebleness,
And with a light letter (the letter He), which has no substance (contact between the articulators);
He prepared all his work in those six days,
The splendor of his honor He elevated onto His throne of fire.
A force of millions and myriads [of angels] to serve [Him],
They sprout anew in the mornings, abundant is [His] faithfulness;
More blazing [than them] are the Seraphim, adorned with six wings,
Till they are given a command, they remain silent in stillness;
They receive [the command] from one another simultaneously, without delay,
The honor of Him Who fills the entire earth to triple in sanctification;
Like a voice from the Almighty, like the sound of many waters,
Cherubs opposite Ophanim exalt in clamor;
To see before [their] face, an appearance like arrows of a bow,
Wherever they are sent, they [go] swiftly, in anxiousness;
They bless “Blessed be His honor,” in all tongues of incantation,
“From the location of the dwelling of His Presence,” which needs no searching;
The heavenly hosts roar, acclaim in apprehension,
“His reign shines for all generations, in perpetuity;”
[When] His sanctification is arranged, and when the hour passes,
[That is] the permanent end [of their duty], [which they do not resume] even after seven [years].
The lot of the honor of His estate (the Jewish people) is dear [to Him], for they regularly, 
Single him out, at [sun]rise and [sun]set;
They are set aside as His portion, to do His will,
His wondrous praise they proclaim in speech;
He wishes, covets, and desires for them to exert themselves in [His] toil,
He therefore accepts their prayer, and [their] plea is effective;
It is bound unto the Eternal under oath as a diadem,
Opposite His honored frontlet (the head phylactery), it sits in firmness;
In which is written with wisdom and knowledge,
The greatness of Israel, [who] read in the teachings;
The praise of the Master of the universe, a likewise saying:
I thought it good to relate it before the kingdoms.
[The nations] come and gather, [their] appearance [is] like that of waves,
They wonder and ask her about the matter of the signs (wonders);
“Whence and who is your Beloved, O fair in appearance?
For due to Him, you are killed [in] the lion’s den (the exile);
You are honorable and beautiful, if you mingle into [our] dominions,
We will do your will in all places;”
In wisdom she replies to them, to make known the end,
“[If] you knew Him, in recognition [of His omnipotence];
Would your greatness be significant vis-à-vis that glory?
The greatness He will grant me, when salvation arrives;
When light comes to me, and shame will cover you,
When His honor is revealed, in strength and pride;
He enacts retribution on the foes and the isles,
Justice for a beloved people, abounding with merits;
Perfect joy, when [the exilees] come [in] neat garments,
When He gathers the exiles [to] the city of Jerusalem,
He casts His honor on it, day and night,
To make His canopy in it, crowned with praise;
The splendor of the clouds beautifies the veil,
According to [each one’s] work are the booths made [for them];
On foldstools of fine gold, with seven tiers;
Are the righteous demarcated before Him of the many acts;
Their appearance resembles the seven types of joy,
The sky in its splendor, and the splendid stars;
A glory that lips cannot detail,
And which has not been heard nor seen by the prophets [in their] visions;
In [a place] that no eye has gazed upon,0 inside the Garden of Eden,
They walk in a circle-dance along with the [Divine] Presence;
To Him they point, [saying:] “This is Him,” though in awe,
“In Him we placed our hope in our captivity, with strong faith;”
He leads us in eternity, [we] are compared (in vigor) to maidens,
[As] our portion from the Beginning He set aside as a heave;
The playful Leviathan and the proud mountain bull (Behemoth),
And when they are embroiled with each other and do battle;
With His horns, Behemoth gores in greatness,
Opposite him, the fish (Leviathan) leaps with his fins in might;
His creator pulls him closer with His sword in magnificence,
A banquet for the righteous He prepares [from them] and a meal;
They recline around Him with tables of carbuncle and precious stones,
Drawn out before them are rivers of balsam;
And they delight and sate themselves with  intoxicating cups,
Sweet wine, guarded in the vat since the Beginning.”
O meritorious [ones], just as you heard the praise of this song,
So will you have a fixed place in those fellowships (of the righteous in the world to come);
And you will merit to sit in the uppermost rank,
When you heed His words, uttered in glory;
Exalted is God, in the beginning and the end,
He took pleasure in us and wanted us, and taught us the Torah.
