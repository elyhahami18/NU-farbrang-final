 וְעַל הַמְּדִינוֹת בּוֹ יֵאָמֵר אֵיזוֹ לַחֶרֶב, וְאֵיזוֹ לַשָּׁלוֹם, אֵיזוֹ לָרָעָב, וְאֵיזוֹ לָשּׂבַע, וּבְרִיּוֹת בּוֹ יִפָּקֵדוּ לְהַזְכִּירָם לְחַיִּים וְלַמָּוֶת.










You were revealed in Your cloud of glory, to Your holy people, to speak to them. From the heavens, You let them hear Your voice, and revealed Yourself to them in pure clouds. So too, the entire world quivered before You, and the works of creation trembled before You, when You, our King revealed Yourself upon Mount Sinai to teach Your people Torah and mitzvos. You let them hear the majestic splendor of Your voice, and Your holy words from flames of fire; amidst thunder and lightning You revealed Yourself to them, and with the sound of a shofar, You appeared to them. And it is said: All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the blare of the horn and the mountain smoking. (Exodus 20:15)
