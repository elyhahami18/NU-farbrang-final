LeShem Yichud



Tikkun Rachel


By the rivers (Psalm 137) of Bavel, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Żiyyon. We hung our lyres upon the willows in its midst. For there they who carried us away captive asked us for a song; and they who spoiled us asked us for mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Żiyyon. How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land? If I forget thee, O Yerushalayim, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I do not set Yerushalayim above my highest joy. Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom the day of Yerushalayim, when they said, Rase it, rase it, to its very foundations. O daughter of Bavel, marked for devastation; happy is he who shall repay thee thy recompense for what thou hast done to us. Happy is he who shall seize and dash thy little ones against the rock.

Tikkun Leah


To the chief Musician, A Maskil, for the sons of Qoraĥ. 2As the hart pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after Thee, O God. 3My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 4My tears have been my bread day and night, while they say to me all the day, Where is thy God? 5When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: how I was wont to pass on with the throng, leading them in procession to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a crowd keeping holiday. 6Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou moan within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. 7O my God, my soul is cast down within me: because I remember Thee from the land of Yarden and the hills of Ḥermon, from the mount Miż῾ar. 8Deep calls to deep at the noise of Thy cataracts: all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me. 9Yet the Lord will command his steadfast love in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, a prayer to the God of my life. 10I will say to God my rock, Why hast Thou forgotten me? why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy? 11Like a deadly wound in my bones, my enemies taunt me; while they say daily to me, Where is thy God? 12Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
