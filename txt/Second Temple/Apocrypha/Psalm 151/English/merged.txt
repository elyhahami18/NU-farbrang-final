Psalm 151

A psalm of David, after he battled Goliath.
Young I was in the midst of my brothers, and a lad in my father’s house.
A shepherd of my father’s flock, driving his herd in the wilderness.
My hands performed upon a lute, my fingers worked a lyre.
And who can tell Adonai? Adonai – He will hear.
He sent His messenger, and took me from after my father’s flock.
And He anointed me with anointing oil, and appointed me a prince of my people.
My brothers are good and strong, but them Adonai did not desire.
He took me out towards the Philistine, who cursed me through his idols.
And I tore off his sword, and cut off his head, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
