Esther



Chapter 1

And it was in the days of Ahasuerus;—he is Khshayaarshaa who reigned from India to Nubia, a hundred and twenty-seven province[s]:
In those days;—when the King Ahasuerus sat on [the] throne of his empire, which was in Shushan the fortress.
In year three of his reign, he made a feast, for all his governors and his servants;—[the] regiment of Persian and Media, the nobles, and the governors of the provinces before him.
In his displaying the wealth of the glory of his empire, and the value of the splendour of his greatness;—many days, a hundred and eighty days.
And at the consummation of these days, the King made, for the whole people who were found in Shushan the fortress from great to small, a feast of seven days;—in the courtyard of the King's palace garden.
White [cloth], green and turquoise [wool], caught by byssuscloth-straps and magenta [wool], on rods of silver and posts of marble;—sticks of gold and silver, on a floor of poryphyry-and-marble and nacre and tile.
And [the guests were] embeveraged in vessels of gold, and vessels from different vessel [design]s;—and wine of kingship, abundant as the hand of the King [can achieve].
And the drinking [went] as the rule of no coercion;—for such had the King established over all [the] abundance of his house, to do as the will of each man.
¶Also Washti the Queen made a feast of women;—[in the] house of the royalty, which [was belonging] to the King Ahasuerus.
On the seventh day, when the King's heart was good with the wine;—he said to Muhumaan, Bizzethaa, Qharbhonaa, Bighthaa and Abhaghthaa, Zethar and Karkas, the seven officials who ministered the face of the King Ahasuerus;
to bring Washti the Queen before the King in [only a] crown of royalty;— to show the peoples and the governors her beauty, for she was good of appearance.
And the Queen Washti refused to come at the word of the King, which was in the hand of the officers;—and the King raged very [much], and his seethe burned in him.
And the King said, to sages [who were] knowers of the procedures—as such was the thing [i.e. way] of the King before all knowers of rule and vertict—
And [to] those close to him, Karshenaa, Shethaar, Athmaathaa, Tarshish; Meres, Marsenaa, Memukhaan;—[the] seven governors of Persia and Media, [who were] viewers of the face of the King, [and] who sat foremost in royalty;
[he spoke] as [to the] rule what to do about the Queen Washti;—over what she didn't do, [i.e.] the statement of the King Ahasuerus, in the hand of the officials.
§ And Memukhan said before the King and the governors, "not over the King alone, did Washti the Queen subvert;—really over all the governors and over all the peoples, which are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.
"When word of the Queen emerges over all the women, to desdain their husbands in their eyes;—in their saying [that] the King Ahasuerus said to bring Washti the Queen before him and [she] didn't come.
"And this day, the Ladies of Persia and Media who heard the word [regarding] the Queen Washti, will say to all the King's governors;—and [there would be more than] enough distain and anger.
"If it is good upon the King, a royal word shall emerge from before him, and be written in rule[s] of Persia and Media and not be transgressed;—[that] which Washti did not come before the King Ahasuerus, and her royalty shall the King give to her fellow [woman], the [one] better than her.
"And the execution of the King which he will do in all his empire will be heard, for it is grand;—and all the women will give esteem to their husbands, from great to small."
And the thing [became] good, in the eyes of the King and the governors;—and the King did like the word of Memukhaan.
And he sent books to all the provinces of the King, to each province [written] like its script, and to each people [read] like its language;—[for] each man to be [the] governor in his house, and to speak like the language of his people.
