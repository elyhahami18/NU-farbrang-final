Chapter 12

Then Iyyov raised his voice and said:
	True, you are the people [and its princes] and wisdom will perish with you.
	[But] I, too, have a heart as you do. I am not lesser than you; and who does not [know these things just] as these [i.e., just as you do]?
	I am [one] who has become a laughingstock to his friend, and calls out to G d, who answers him [(that in return for this He will give him)] the true laughter of the righteous one.
	[(And I also know, just as you, that)] the torch of [the] shame [of Gehinnom awaits] him who is at ease in [his] thoughts, [saying: "I shall be at peace," and that] he is prepared [to join the ranks of] "those whose foot slips."
	[(And I also know, just as you, that for many days [until their ultimate destruction])] the tents of robbers are at peace, and those who anger G d dwell secure, [and that with all] that G d has brought [to the evildoer, the "hour" plays into] his hand.
	Ask [even] the beasts and they will teach [these things to] you, and the birds of heaven will tell you.
	Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will tell you.
	Who would not know by all these that the hand of the L rd has wrought this?
	That in His hand is the spirit of all living things and the spirit of all mortal flesh?
	Will not the ear [which hears what He has wrought] not discern [the implications of these] words just as the palate tastes food?
	There is wisdom in the old and understanding in the long-lived
	[to know that] with Him is wisdom and strength; with Him is counsel and understanding.
	When He destroys, none can rebuild. When He imprisons a man, none can free him.
	When He holds back the waters, the land is dry; when He sends them forth [(as He did in the generation of Enosh, when He flooded a third of the world)], they overturn the earth.
	He is the source of strength and weakness. His is the strayer and the one who causes [men] to stray [i.e., the Satan].
	He leads counselors into folly and makes judges foolish.
	He unties the bonds of kings [e.g., Nevuchadnezzar] just as He buckles the belt on their thighs [(to "gird" them into kingship)].
	He leads princes away with folly and twists the mighty.
	He [sometimes] removes speech [even] from the faithful [(viz., e.g., Genesis 15:6, followed by 8] and takes the acumen of the elders.
	He spills contempt upon the lordly and loosens the buckler of the mighty.
	He reveals [to man] what is profounder than darkness and brings shadows to light.
	He raises nations and destroys them [(through their pride)], spreads nations out [(over the earth)] and leads them [(into exile)].
	He removes the wisdom of the leaders of the people, and they lead them into a void that is not a path.
	They feel in the darkness and not in light and He leads them astray as drunkards.

For a few more years will pass and I will journey the path from which I shall not return.
