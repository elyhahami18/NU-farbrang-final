"He follows her suddenly, like an ox going to the slaughter, and like a (dog) bound, towards the commands of a fool." [Targum: like a dog to its chains. The term 'כְעֶכֶס' can imply a collar or anklet, symbolizing binding. Rashi explains, to the venom of a snake; meaning the snake is drawn inescapably toward the prodding of its charmer and releases its poison in anger.]
