And David and all of Israel went to Jerusalem, that is Jebus, and there were the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. 
And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not come here," and David captured the citadel of Zion, that is the City of David. 
And David said, "Whoever smites the Jebusites first will be a chief and an officer," and Joab the son of Zeruiah ascended first and became a chief. 
And David dwelt in the citadel; therefore they called it the City of David. 
And he built the city from around, from the Millo until the surrounding area, and Joab restored the rest of the city. 
And David waxed constantly greater, and the Lord of Hosts was with him.

Chapter 21

























And David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred. 
And David built an altar there to the Lord, and he offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and he called out to the Lord, and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of the burnt offerings. 
And the Lord commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath. 
At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. 
And the Tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of the burnt offerings at that time were in the high place in Gibeon. 
But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was frightened by the sword of the angel of the Lord.
