Song of Songs



Chapter 1





I am black but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem! Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

Chapter 2







I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, that you neither awaken nor arouse the love while it is desirous.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Chapter 5







The watchmen who patrol the city found me; they smote me and wounded me; the watchmen of the walls took my jewelry off me.
