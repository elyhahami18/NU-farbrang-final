Chapter 19

And God spoke to Moses saying;
Speak to all the people of Israel and tell them you shall be holy for I your God am holy;
A man should be in awe of his parent and observe my Sabbaths for I am God;
Do not turn to idols and make molten gods for I am your God;
And when you sacrifice a shlamim sacrifice  to God do it willfully;
On the day you make the sacrifice it shall be eaten and on the day after but on the third day it shall be burned in the holy flames;
And if a man eats the defiled meat is eaten on the third day;
He shall be banished for he has desecrated God's holiness.
And when you harvest your field you shall not harvest its corners nor will you harvest the wheat that has fallen to the ground;
And you will not pick the small bunches of grapes in your vineyard nor the solitary grapes that fall down you shall leave these for the poor and the stranger for I am your God
You shall not steal or deny a crime or lie to anyone;
You shall not swear falsely in my name and desecrate my name for I am your God;
You shall not steal from your fellow with or without their knowledge and you will not deny salaries of those who work under you until the morning;
You shall not curse a deaf person and put a stumbling block before the blind and you should fear your for I am your God;
You shall not judge unfairly in a trial do not push down the small and push up the big you shall judge your fellow Israelites in justice;
You shall not tell tales about people not present and you shall not stand idly by while one of your fellow Israelites is being hurt for I am your God;
You shall not hate your fellow Israelite in your heart  you shall chasten your fellow Israelite but you shall not sin against him;
Do not seek revenge on your fellow Israelite and you shall love your fellow as yourself for I am God;
You shall live by my laws you shall not breed hybrids with your livestock nor will you put two types of produce in one field and an article of clothing that is made of two different types of strands shall not be on you.
If a man who had child-bearing sex with one of his female slaves who is betrothed to another doesn't set the slave free then they shall not be killed for she is not free;
To atone for such a sin one must go to the temple and sacrifice a ram;
The priest shall take the ram and sacrifice it to God to atone for the man's sins and the man will be forgiven for his sins;
And when you have come to the Land and planted fruit trees you shall not eat their fruits for three years;
And in the fourth year all its fruits will be sacred to God;
and in the fifth year you shall eat its fruits and it shall add its produce to yours;

Chapter 20













13. Any man who shall lie along with another male in forced sexual intercourses with a woman, both of them (the men) have done an abomination; these (two men) shall surely die, their bloodguilt upon them.
