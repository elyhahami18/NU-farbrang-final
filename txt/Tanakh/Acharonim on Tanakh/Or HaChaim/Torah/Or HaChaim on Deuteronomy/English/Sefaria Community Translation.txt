You may ask why he [Moses] omitted the reason for the Sabbath that God said in the first instance of the Ten Commandments, "that in six days..." [and on the seventh day of creation God rested] (Exodus 20). This reason is the essential reason for this commandment, not the reason of the obligation [given in this verse]. Moses said this reason [based on] faith in the reason for the commandment. According to what our sages said and wrote elsewhere, the Exodus from Egypt illuminates faith in creation of the world. He [Moses] wrote saying "Remember...and God took you out...with a strong hand and an outstretched arm..." since there you will see that He is the Master of All and from there it will be evident to you the reason stated in the first instance of the Ten Commandments, "that in six days...".

This is the intention of this section here, according to the commandment of a city that is rejected, that this whole city [that rejected G-d] be killed by sword, and even their animals. This act will give rise to the nature of cruelty in the heart of man, as the Ishmaelites told us in the king's article that they have a great desire to kill a person and uproot them. The promise of God is that He'll give them mercy, even though nature will give birth to cruelty. The source of mercy [G-d] will affect the power of mercy [within you] to negate the cruelty that was born by virtue of the act [of killing out the city]. And it says about this city [that was killed out] as long as a man has a cruel nature, G-d will behave with him the same way, that G-d is not merciful [on the cruel-natured man], but compassionate.

The explanation is, obviously [he must obey] that selfsame ruling, but rather even other rulings that are based on that verdict, for many judgments branch from the detail of a single judgment.

He (G-d) said to (Israel) to be to Him a treasured nation, that even if another nation were to come along and improve their deeds and to try to cleave to the divine presence, nevertheless, they will never achieve the level of the Jewish people, and it is this aspect of the Jewish people that is referred to as ‘treasured’, and this is the greatness of the Jewish nation…

Something deeper hinted to in the meaning of the words <b>you all standing...</b> is that all those who are distant from holiness (transgressors), their 'standing' is lowly and their heads are sullen; however for THIS it is written 'you all standing...' to be standing in front of Hashem--to be before Hashem...[even they] should stand and raise their heads!
