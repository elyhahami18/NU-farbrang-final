(Not an exact translation)
The re-establishment of the Jews as a "strong fortress" will happen in 3 parts: 1) Those who were exiled from Yehuda and Binyamin will begin to return to Tzion; 2) There will be a "small government" like Bnei Yisrael had before their first monarchy, led by shoftim; 3) There will be the establishment of malchut beit David, when Mashiach will rule. Malchut beit David will be revealed in stages, the first of which is only at the level of a shofeit, and then it will slowly rise to the point that HaShem will have malchut.
