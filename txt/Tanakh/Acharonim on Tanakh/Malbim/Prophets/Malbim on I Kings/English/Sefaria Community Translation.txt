<b>Until when</b> Meaning to say how long will you worship Baal and when things are going bad call out to Hashem in the manner of what is written, "in the time of your evil they will say rise and save us", because you swerve between two ideas and do not know who you worship and this is impossible since there is no middle ground. If Hashem is God there is no substance to Baal [who Hashem commanded us] to cut down and consider disgusting. And if there's no substance to Baal you have no part in Hashem. <b>And they did not answer</b> because the people were satisfied as they were.
