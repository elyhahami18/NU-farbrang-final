<b>Zion</b> – This begins a new section now that the prophet has finished the prophecy which he spoke about Yehudah and Jerusalem from the beginning of the book until now. If you look carefully you will see that the rebuke which he delivered from the beginning of the book until the twenty first verse, which is the prophecy that particularly concerns Yehudah, was about acts between the people and Gd – sacrifices, repentance and prayer. Then most of the rebuke which he gives from the verse “How has she become a harlot…” (Isaiah 1:21) is dealing with matters between people like forgery, fraud and the perversion of justice. This is because sins against Gd were more common among the people of Yehudah who lived outside of Jerusalem, but in the capitol city of Jerusalem sins between people were more common because of the amount of business and trade done there. Now the seer closed his words by saying that each one will find his reparation through the sin he himself committed, and by fixing his crookedness he will return to his place. 
<b>Zion</b> – The capitol city which sinned through perverting justice. <b>Shall be redeemed through justice</b> – the moment you repent and do justice, you will be saved and redeemed. 
<b>And her penitent through righteousness</b> – This is referring to the tribe of Yehudah who returned to Zion from the exile, whose sin was in perverting righteousness between man and Gd. <b>They will be redeemed through righteousness</b> – by showing the righteousness of their actions before their Maker and Creator.

Verse 3






Out of Zion – There the Sanhedrin sat, with the High Priest and the king of the House of David. 
Shall the Torah come forth – To the whole world, as it is written “If a matter eludes you in judgment… then you shall rise and go up to the place the Lord, your God, chooses.” (Devarim 17:8) This occurs only in Zion. 
And the word of the Lord – This refers to words of prophecy. 
From Jerusalem – Because there the prophets gathered and drew the spirit of Gd from throughout the city, because the prophets did not sit in the Court of Hewn stones (with the Sanhedrin). All these are the words which the nations said to one another.

Verse 4

And he will judge – That is to say - just as they request, so it will be in truth because the judge at that time will be the messiah and he will judge, instruct and rebuke: between nations – because the need for the means of war is due to two things 1) between two peoples who do not have a shared religion the sword is necessary to judge and decide between them, 2) guarding the government and order within a particular country, that people not rebel and throw off the yoke of rule. In response to this it says that in that time these reasons will be nullified, because he will judge and rebuke in the matters that cause conflict between nations, and rebuke will be sufficient to stop many peoples from transgressing the law. Then, since they no longer need to wage war, perforce the will ‘beat their swords into plowshares’ and no more learn the ways of war:

O herald of Zion – The verse describes it as if Zion herself will be the herald, and so too Jerusalem. It says ‘you, Zion the herald, go up onto a high mountain and you Jerusalem the herald lift up your voice with strength, don’t be afraid that what you herald will not come to be because of course it will come.’ Not only this, but you should also say to the cities of Yehudah ‘behold your Gd’ as if you were pointing with your finger at a thing which has already come to be. (I have already explained in many places that Zion was where the king and the Sanhedrin dwelled and the place of the Sanctuary, while Jerusalem was the dwelling place of the masses. Zion will announce that the Divine Presence has returned to Zion, as well as the kingship and the priesthood. This is why the prophet told it to go up on the high mountain. Jerusalem will announce the ingathering of the exiles, therefore the prophet told her to lift up her voice with strength in order that the ones driven away hear and gather from the four corners of the heavens.)

And I placed – Have I not placed the words of My promise in your mouth, that I promised to save you? And until the salvation comes of necessity I have covered you unceasingly with the shadow of My hand, in order to uphold that which I promised. The verse then explains the words which I placed in your mouth – to plant the heavens, to found the earth and to say to Zion. That is to say that even if you should imagine that this thing, the redemption of Zion, should be as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea – I have placed My words in your mouth. This too I will do: plant new heavens and a new earth and to say to Zion ‘you are My people.’ Even if one should say that the laws of heaven and earth and the ways of nature would prevent Me from doing this, then I will nullify their laws and found a new heaven and earth, so long as I fulfill My words which I have placed in your mouth ‘to say to Zion that you are My people.’ Therefore I say to you:

Verse 17

"Awake, awake" You. In response to what you said to Me, 'Awaken, awaken, dress yourself with strength, O arm of the Lord' (Is.51:9) I say 
"Awaken, awaken, arise, Jerusalem" because the things depends on you

Chapter 52



Verse 1

"Awaken, awaken" (this is also said in response to what is written above, "Awaken, awaken, dress yourself with strength, O arm of the Lord" And He responds - you awake, upon you the thing depends, dress yourself with strength Zion, as was explained above)
"put on your strength, O Zion" In the stronghold of Zion, the City of David, there resided the Holy Temple, the priesthood, the Sanhedrin and the kingship which are the inner strength. In reference to this the verse says 'put on your strength, O Zion.' But in Jerusalem, which is the wholeness of the city, resided the outer garments - the clothes of glory which are wealth and a populous people and are physical success. In reference to this it says
"put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem the Holy City, for no longer shall there come into you the uncircumcised" into Jerusalem
"and the unclean" into Zion

"Poor one" After the prophet already prophesied that the barren one would have many children, which is a allegory for the ingathering of the exiles, he described that at that time Zion will still not be rebuilt on her hill. This poor one, who is Zion, will still storm in the rage of her spirit because she has not been comforted (so to he interpreted above in chapter 49 'behold these shall come from afar...and Zion will say the Lord has abandoned me...' He also interpreted that as saying that Zion would sit in ruins at the time of the ingathering, as I explained there.)

And a redeemer shall come to Zion – The redeemer will come to Zion to return the crown of Zion, the Holy Temple and the Sandhedrin. He will also come to those of Yaakov who turn from sin, to the children of exile who will then repent through the distress which presses down upon them. And if you say ‘how will the people survive until that time, isn’t there still a long wait?’ The next verse replies:

"come bending unto you" The idolators who oppressed you with hard oppression will come to bending over in order to appease you. And your abusers who did not oppress you but rather only insulted and disparaged you, because you were not worthy of consideration in their eyes (and they will not need to appease you), will bow down at your feet now from the greatness of your importance. And they will call you now
"the city of the Lord" This will be Jerusalem, and there
"Zion" they will call
"the Zion of the Holy One of Israel" because there Gd will be revealed with the greatest intensity through the pouring out of His holy spirit according to the holiness of Israel and their actions (because this is what divides between Gd and the holiness of Israel in every place):

Chapter 62



Verse 1

"for Zion's sake" He came back to speak of two matters which he recalled in the previous section. 1. The righteousness which Gd desires to reveal, the righteousness of Israel and the truth of their Torah and their faith. 2. The salvation which Gd desires to bring to them. Zion represents the righteousness of Israel because Zion was the location of the Sanhedrin and the Holy Temple, and Jerusalem represents the salvation of Israel because there the masses dwelt and to there the scattered ones were gathered, as it is written "...put on your strength, O Zion; put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem..." (Is. 52:1) Zion will clothe herself with inner might, the spiritual successes, and Jerusalem external garments - the physical successes. In order to clarify the righteousness of Israel and the truth of their Torah one must argue with words and claims, and on this it says - 
"for Zion's sake I will not hold my peace" I will not cease from arguing and proving her truth. To bring the salvation of Israel out of their exile requires practical action, and on this it says - 
"for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest" I will not sit at ease without doing a thing, rather I will be diligent to save them...
