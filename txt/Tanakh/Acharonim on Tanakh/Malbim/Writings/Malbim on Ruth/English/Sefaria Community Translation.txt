Malbim on Ruth



Chapter 1



Verse 1

Questions:                                                                                                 1. Why does the verse tell us it was "In the days of "Shofet Hashoftim", it should've made known to us the identity of the Judge (Shofet)?                                                                                          [2.] Why is "And a man went from "Bais Lechem Yehuda", "Ephradites from Bais Lechem Yehuda" repeated                         [3.] Why does the verse add "And they reached the fields of Moab, and they were there"?                                                      [4.] Why does it say "the husband of No'omi"?                                         [5] and what is the novelty that she (No'omi) and her sons were left ''over'' there?

Verse 9

<b>May He grant:</b> And beyond that which He shall do kindness to you that you have coming, He should grant you a gift (even if it is not payment from the angle of a previous deed), "that you find security in the house of a husband." This is parallel to that which she said (in the previous verse), "return each of you to her mother’s house." As widows that do not want to remarry will make their own homes, like a woman who is the master of her own domain. But a widow who wants to marry will return to her father's house. However with idolaters who do not have pedigree from the father, she returns to her mother's house until she goes and marries a man. About this, she blessed them that they should find security, each woman in  the house of her husband; that they should know no more bereavement and widowhood. Rather they should dwell with peaceful security; and that would be a gift from God. <b>And she kissed them:</b> A kiss of parting.

How are they judging you here? To your merit! Therefore, do not go to reap in another field, where the owner might not be willing to let you. And do not go away from here, even among my fields (for Boaz had many fields), where the men might hate you. More so, stay close to my girls, because on this field there are men on one side, and women on another. Stay on the side of the women.

Verse 1

My daughter, I will not ask you, RL have already been three months of distinction, and now it is not incumbent upon me to ask you to rest. That is, you shall have a husband as it is written, "And rest is a woman in the house of a woman, who is better for you. A Torah observant and a mitzva that would not be better for her in the spiritual well, as Chazal says in the woman who bore the mukhsin and who tied the knot with him, and I will ask you to be better off in this rest in the true good:
