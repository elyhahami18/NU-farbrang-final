<b>And the king of Egypt said:</b> According to the straightforward understanding, he spoke to Egyptian women who were <b>delivering the Jewish women.</b> And there were two types of midwives: 1) One who would deal with the one sitting on the travailing chair, to deliver the newborn; and the second to deal with the newborn, to cut his umbilical cord and to take care of his needs. <b>One was called Shifrah and the second was called Puah.</b>. And the understanding is not that there were only two midwives; for behold they were a large people. So it only means that there were two types of midwives. Or it is like Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, that two women were the ministers over all of them; and likewise did Rabbi Yitzchak Abarbanel explain. And that which it states, "And the king of Egypt said," and it does not explain what he said, is understood as referring to what is above, when it stated at the beginning (Exodus 1:9), "And he said to his people, 'Look, the Israelite people are more and stronger.'" So he now said this to the midwives and also took counsel with them about what to do, lest they multiply. And after he presented his concern and his worry, then...

<b>Questions</b>: <br> Why did it tell that her young women walked by the Y'or? And what is it written <b>"the baby [crying] - and behold, it was a youth"</b> (Shemot 2:6)? And why did she [Miryam] say to her [bat Par'oh] that she would call for a wetnurse specifically from the Hebrews?
<b>And she went down</b> (Shemot 2:5). Now, the reasons for which God presented him that he would be saved will be told: that he would be "reared in purple" (Eicha 4:5) in the king's house, but despite all this his people and his tribe would recognise him. <br> 1. God invited bat Par'oh - regarding whom, "all the glory of the king's daughter is within" (Tehillim 45:13) - and <b>"she went down"</b> from her height <b>"to wash in the Y'or"</b>, in an open place and a public thoroughfare. For if it weren't, his sister [Miryam] wouldn't have been able to reach her. <br>2. That her young women weren't directly with her - she would have been afraid before them to transgress her father's commandment and save those given to death. <br>3. <b>"And she saw the ark"</b> (Shemot 2:5) and wasn't it also that God may They be blessed was within the reeds, concealed and covered by the reeds.<br> 4. That she took it by means of her slavegirl - the lesser one, that she wasn't embarassed to do anything she wanted in front of her. And there's a difference between young women [<i>ne'arot</i>] and slavegirls [<i>amahot</i>]: young women are given to her as a staff and they're honoured and the daughters of dignitaries, and slavegirls are lesser and stand in her service.

<b>Questions:</b><br> Why did it ennumerate all these deeds when there was no need? And why was it specific that "he went out to his kin... [he saw an Egyptian] striking... one of his kin..." (Shemot 2:11)? Why did he get involved in a dispute of the shepherds when they had a clear fix, i.e., not to water their flocks until all the herds were gathered, like the shepherds of Charan?
<b>And he turned</b> (Shemot 2:12), tells us that he was driven on by a Divine spirit (c.f. Yeshayahu 59:19) to break the arm of the wicked one and to release those destined for death. And so that you shouldn't say that he did this without consulting his reason, only from sudden anger, which is not praiseworthy - regarding this I say, that he <b>"turned this way and that to see if there was anyone around"</b> (Shemot 2:12) - for he did it premeditatedly and with consulting his reason. For he knew it was a dangerous thing to do if anyone knew, and so he killed him - to save the life of his kinsman. And the opinion of our sages of blessed memory in Sanhedrin 58b is that the Mitzri was liable for the death penalty, as an Egyptian who strikes a Jew is liable for the death penalty. And the Rambam in Hilchot Melachim 10:6 is of the opinion that [the Mitzri] is only liable at the hands of heaven. And regarding this the Midrash says that he consulted with the heavenly entourage. <b>"And he saw that there was no man around"</b> (Shemot 2:12) - but angels he saw, and he consulted with them. And by means of allusion, that he saw himself - that he himself was no man, only joined to the angels. And he struck him with the spiritual power that was within him, and regarding this our sages of blessed memory said that he struck him with the Explicit Name. (Shemot Rabbah 1:30)

<b>And God saw that he had turned to see</b> since the level of 'through a glass, darkly' which he had prophesied at up until now needed no preparation. And the vision he saw now was allegorical and by means of a riddle, and from the midst of the strength of this metaphor, his soul didn't need to extend out from his body. For his bodily powers hadn't failed, at this moment - for he was prepared in his nature, from his fathers, for this prophecy. But after he turned to look, and the soul extended out of his body - for then he grasped at the level of 'an illuminated glass', and through this it may be that, since he turned to see, through an illuminated glass - "no human may see Me and live" (Shemot 33:20). And for this reason <b>"God called to him... and said Moshe, Moshe"</b> (Shemot 3:4). Our sages of blessed memory have already explained that every "saying" is preceded by a "calling", and it's said in Sifra 61:3/section 3 that Moshe Moshe, Avraham Avraham, etc., are the language of affection and encouragement. Another take: he was Moshe before he had spoken with Them, he is Moshe now that he has spoken with Them. And I explained there that in the beginning They said her name, that They doubled the calling, did it twice - the calling itself teaches of encouragement, and the doubling of the calling teaches of affection. And again it gives a reason for the distinction between calling Moshe Moshe - for no separating trope note had come between the ruler of the names [?] and Avraham. And so with every two names that come next to each other - there's always a separating trope note between them.  Regarding this I say an alternative: he was Moshe before he spoke with Them, etc - means to say, for all the prophets who were unprepared in their natures for prophecy needed one calling to awaken their material selves and to prepare them for the extending of the soul out of them, and the second calling was to the weak houses of the soul. And for this reason there is a separating trope note for them. But for Moshe, whose materiality was already prepared for this extending in its nature, didn't tremple or quake from it, and so there's no separating trope mark between them, for the callings had begun immediately to the innermost soul. And regarding this it is said in the Midrash that God stopped [הפסיק, same word as separating trope mark] speaking to all the prophets, but to Moshe he didn't stop. It means to say that Moshe always stood ready for the Word with no break, and this is why God said to him, Moshe Moshe, to awaken hem in this because he was prepared by means of his nature. And Moshe said "Here I am", meaning to say he was ready and prepared for the Divine Word.

<b>But they did not listen to Moses on account of their weakened spirit.</b> Spirit designates inner spirit. And there is [also] an enduring spirit, which is someone who can hold down his feelings and tolerate grief, pain and hurt. And its opposite is a diminished spirit, as I have written in the commentary on Proverbs. So someone who has a weakened spirit but does not have hard work, or who has hard work but he has an enduring spirit, can rein in his grief and listen to [words of] consolation and to good news. However, they had hard work, and their depressed spirits were too weak to bear and tolerate [that work]; that is why the words of Moses did not make an impression on them.

<b>And he said</b>. And then <b>God said to Moshe, see, I have set you as a god to Par'oh</b> (Shemot 7:1). That is what is written <b>And God spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, and commanded them to the children of Yisrael and to Par'oh.</b> (Shemot 6:13) - that God made Aharon a partner with Moshe. Earlier the text was concise and didn't mention the details of what God said, but here they are mentioned, for since <b>God said to Moshe, see, I have set you as a god to Par'oh</b> - meaning to say that Paroh will hold/strengthen you as though you were God who visits and commands. And just as God doesn't bring a matter to action except by way of Their prophets and emissaries, since God visits and Their emissaries bring the matter to action - so too, <b>Aharon your brother will be your prophet</b> (Shemot 7:1) - he will be your prophet, for by his hand you will decree and he will fulfil it for you. And it is explained.

<b>And each man cast down his staff</b> This relates to the sages and magicians, that they cast down their staffs. <b>And they became serpents</b>, this relates to <b>the sorcerers of Mitzrayim</b>, that they became serpents at the moment that the sages and magicians cast down their staffs. They were wrapped in serpentskin and it seemed that it was because of the staffs that they became serpents, <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed up their staffs</b>. Regarding this, the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 9:7) relates that "the Holy Blessed One said: If the serpent swallows their serpents, that would be the ordinary way of their world, that serpent swallows serpent. Rather, it should return to its form and then swallow their serpents. What is <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed their staffs</b>? Rabbi Elazar says, a miracle within a miracle: it teaches that Aharon's staff returned to its form and swallowed them. When Par'oh saw this, he was surprised and said, what if the staff swallows Paroh and his throne? Now it will swallow him!" Here ends the Midrash quotation. And what is written, What is <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed their serpents</b>, has no explanation, for it has already explained that it returned to being a staff and then swallowed it - so what's the novelty of Rabbi Elazar? It seems that in the beginning it explains what is written, <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed</b>, that it returned to staffhood and after that swallowed. Regarding this it is asked, What is <b>and Aharon's staff swallowed their serpents</b>? Meaning to say that it should have said, and Aharon's staff swallowed <i>their serpents</i>, for their serpents didn't return to their original form! Regarding this Rabbi Elazar says it's a miracle within a miracle, for after Aharon's staff returned to be a staff as its original form was, <b>it swallowed them</b>, meaning to say, it swallowed <i>the sorcerers themselves</i>! For since the sorcerers were serpents wrapped in serpentskin, and they with the staffs were concealed below the skin, the staff of Aharon swallowed the "serpents" with the sorcerers and staffs concealed beneath them. And if it had said, and Aharon's staff swallowed their serpents, I would have thought that only the serpents' bodies were swallowed and not the sorcerers. But since it said that it swallowed their staffs, that they were concealed below the serpents, from this we know that they were swallowed with the sorcerers. And regarding this it's said that Paroh said that it was capable of swallowing him and his throne just as it swallowed the sorcerers. <b>And Paroh's heart was hardened</b>, that he was also visibly scared to be swallowed alive as the sorcerers had been swallowed - and with all this, he [still] hardened his heart!

<b>Who will go</b>. Par'oh and all ancient idol worshippers thought that there was a force of good and a force of evil, and would serve the force of good in order that it would do good for them, and serve the force of evil to appease it so that it would not do evil to them, and their service would be different. For the force of good they wouldn't slaughter animals, for it didn't want blood and the murder of flock and herd. It was only that they came before it with their wives and children and infants, to celebrate with drum and tambourine, as it desired good and joy. And for the force of evil they served it with slaughter and sacrifice, to appease its anger with blood. Infants and children would not come, lest it injure them with its evil or wish that they be slaughtered on its alter, for it desired human sacrifice. And regarding this Par'oh asked, <b>who will go</b> - for if their service was to the good force, infants and women also went, but they wouldn't take herds and flocks, and if they served the evil entity the herds and flocks would go and not the women and infants.

"And Jethro rejoiced".  The verse is saying the happiness of Jethro was because of the goodness to the Jews, and not because of the bad done to the Egyptians.  It is based on this idea that the Sages say (quoted by Rashi) that 'his flesh became fulled with prickles, [presumably there is a distinction between Chedva and other languages that also depict happiness.  Chedva paints a specific type of inner, spiritual happiness that overpowers an external sadness.  This nuanced definition of Chedva is evident in the verse from Nechamia (8:10) "Do not be sad for the Chedva of Hashem is your strength".

(2) Why does it say "they encamped" and then "Israel encamped?" (3) First he called, then he went up [and yet the verse reverses the order]?

(5) Why does it repeat "And Moses brought back the words of the people," "And Moses reported the words of the people?"

"Do not make with Me" – According to the commentator’s view, the phrase "gods of silver" is connected with the preceding clause, "Do not make gods of silver." However, this is not the view of the one who set the cantillation marks, who placed the pause (etnachta) on the word "Me." Therefore, the sages (Chazal) explained that you should not make an image of anything that exists with Me in heaven. And because it is written, "and You will hear in heaven, Your dwelling place," and "heaven" includes everything from the curve of the lunar sphere and above, it follows that this command includes not making an image of the sun and moon, nor the image of ministering angels, nor the image of the four faces in the chariot together, as Abaye said (Rosh Hashanah 24b) and as Tosafot stated in Yoma (54). This is the intent of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Natan added that one should not make any form resembling a human image, as this too is found with Him, as it is written: "and on the throne was a likeness like the appearance of a man." And it is said in Bereishit Rabbah, "Great is the power of created beings who liken the form to its Creator." And in Rosh Hashanah it says concerning this, "Do not make Me," because in the case of the forms of the heavenly creatures and the chariot, only the four faces together are forbidden, but a human image by itself is forbidden. And it has already warned, "Do not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness." Here it adds that it is forbidden to make these forms even for decoration, as the halachic authorities wrote. Rabbi Akiva says this includes a warning against the belief of dualists, who would say there is a force for good and a force for evil, and they would make a unique image for the force of evil. When good came to them, they would praise the force of good, and when bad came to them, they would curse the force of evil. But Israel believes that no evil descends from heaven, and that hardships and suffering are ultimately for the purpose of good, as is elaborated on in the Mechilta. Therefore, they praise for the bad as they do for the good.
“Gods of silver and gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.” This seems redundant, so why specify silver and gold in particular when making idols from any material is prohibited? We also have a principle that when Scripture mentions two items, the second always adds something beyond the first, as stated in Tosefet Meforshim on Leviticus (Section 312). The Sages explained that because the Torah permits making cherubs from gold, it warns here not to make them from silver, as this would make them like “gods of silver.” Furthermore, it adds that even from gold, one may only make what the Torah specifies: two cherubs, no more. This, then, adds to what is meant by “gods of gold.” As for the additional cherubs made by Solomon, this was done according to a prophet, as written elsewhere. However, the prohibition against making replicas of the vessels of the Temple is learned from “you shall not make with Me,” which includes not making anything that is found with Him, whether in the great Temple in the heavens or in His earthly Temple and Presence. It then says, “you shall not make for yourselves,” using the plural to warn against making them even in synagogues, which are themselves a “small sanctuary.” Some say this is phrased in the plural to prohibit even in communities, to avoid the suggestion that the prohibition against making these forms for decoration is due to suspicion of idolatry, since there is no suspicion when it is public. As it says in Rosh Hashanah (24) regarding the case of Rabban Gamliel, therefore it says that even the public is warned about this.

It also teaches the people to know about the matter of governance, that just like the two tablets in the ark, one tablet had the five commandments between man and the Omnipresent written on it, and on the second tablet it had the commandments between a man and his fellow written on it, so too were there two types of governors in Israel: The king and his ministers who were appointed from God to preserve justice and to destroy all those doing evil between man and his fellow. And there was the high priest and the teachers of religion who were appointed to teach the people and to oversee the service of God and the commandments between man and the Omnipresent. And corresponding to them stood the two cherubs: One would hover its wings over the one side of the ark with the tablet warning about the commandments between man and his fellow, whereas the second one would hover with its wings on the second side of the ark that had the tablet warning about the commandments between man and the Omnipresent. And hence they both stood on the cover which was above the tablets more generally. And it was necessary that both of the cherubs spread their wings above, such that they do everything for the sake of Heaven and raise themselves up over all matters of physicality and the desires for it, and that they be hovering over the cover and protecting over the commandments of God, each one according to his service. And He commanded that they have <i>their faces, each one towards the other</i> (Exodus 25:20), such that the king and the high priest should help one another, not like it was in the days of the evil kings of the second temple, who would denigrate the honor of the priesthood and as is written, <i>Remove the turban and lift up the crown</i> (Ezekiel 21:31),, as I explained there; nor like the evil priests who created a revolt and lifted their hands against the honor of the monarchy. Rather, their faces should be each one towards the other, and as it is written, <i>and harmonious understanding shall prevail between them</i> (Zechariah 6:13). And their faces — meaning the intentions of their faces — are to be towards the cover, to strengthen the pillars of the faith and the fear of God, and to instill justice and righteousness in the land.

Verse 2

<b>And you shall make sacred garments:</b> Behold, the garments that He commanded to make were ostensibly outer garments, such that their makeup is discussed - how the craftsmen are to make them with their work. But they really indicate inner clothes that the priests of God should make - to clothe their souls with thoughts and traits and proper tendencies, which are the clothes of the soul; and the craftsmen did not make those garments. But God commanded Moses that he should make these sacred garments - meaning to teach them how to refine their souls and traits, in such a way they will wear majesty and splendor upon their internal souls. And the explanation of "And you shall make sacred garments for glory," is that it is understood by us that every place that the soul of a man is called glory (as in Psalms 30:13, "In order that my glory sings"), you shall make sacred garments for the glory - meaning the soul - and I have already explained in my commentary to in Isiah (Chapter 5) that there is a distinction between glory and beauty, for a man is glorified also by his natural traits but is beautified only be his traits of volition.  Corresponding to the spirituality within the soul naturally sourced in its depths is called glory, and corresponding to the light and splendor which one merits through divine service and its holiness is called beauty.  And these two levels clothe in the holy garments that Moshe made, which is to say that he [Moshe] taught and aided them to merit to be garbed in precious garments and splendor and through this they "made holy garments" for the soul - which is called glory - and the soul - which is called beauty.  
Hints within the holy garments
We have already said that just like the external body is clothed, which is like clothing for the soul and it's external clothing, so too one should clothe the inner soul with it's internal garments and become enriched by them.   And just like we call external clothing with the word "measure" (מד), for they are made to the specific measurements of each person, so too the garments of the soul are called "measurements" (מדות), for the attributes (מדות) of a person and his qualities garb the soul, and through them [one's traits] it's [the soul's] powers and greatness will be expressed.  And when [Moshe is] commanded on the external garments of the priests, the essence of the intention was to teach them knowledge of how to dress their souls again in the attributes and qualities of purity and holiness.  And Chazal say:  The tunic [ketonet] atones for bloodshed,  The trousers atone for forbidden sexual relations, the mitre atones for the arrogant, the belt atones for thought of the heart, the breastplate of the High Priest atones for improper judgments, the ephod of the High Priest atones for idol worship, the robe of the High Priest atones for malicious speech, the frontplate of the High Priest atones for an act of brazenness'.  And we will explain them in what seems a clarifying light these garments of the soul in the order of their donning.  Behold the first garments are the ones through which the soul being an animalistic soul are covered, i.e. the power of lustful and of anger, and so come the trousers train and to clothe (immature) people to stop the lustful force to cover one's sexual organs, and the tunic which is an undergarment will remind him to squelch the power of anger, from which comes bloodshed.  And a hint to this is (the verse brought in the Gemara) "...and dipped the tunic [ketonet] in the blood", for they dipped the inner tunic in the blood of anger and the vengeance came forth from the angry impulse which overpowered them.  And it is known that of the imagery of the soul many are embarrassingly evil, and they are naturally imprinted in the depths of the soul, and at the time when these tendencies rise up to the heart a person thinks thoughts of evil, and about this it is said (Chronicles 1 29:18) "...keep this forever, even the imagery of the thoughts of the heart of Your people", for these are the imagery of the thoughts which come up from the depths of the soul to the heart. And on this is hinted the belt, which constricts around the heart to submerge the evil imagery in the bottom of the depths of the soul, and as such the length of it was 32 (ל"ב) Amos, like the number for heart (לב), and this act of embroidery alludes to the imagery that is made in it.  And on this it's written [in the Gemara] that the belt atones for thought of the heart.   And they said [in Pirkei Avos 4:28] "Jealousy, lust, and honor remove a person from the world", and after one's soul has become purified from jealousy which arises from the impulse of anger, and lust from the impulse of lust, then one must humble oneself from the attribute of arrogance.  For it [arrogance] is the source of seeking honor, and through it comes the mitre to cover one's head because it's said the Shechinah [Divine presence] is above one's head, as it says [Talmud Shabbat 156b] "Cover your head so that the fear of Heaven will be upon you".  For if one thinks that Hashem and all of His Holiness with him is above his own head, he will dress in humility and he "will be like dirt and ashes" in front of the honor of The King.  And for this reason the mitre was 16 Amos, for the divine chariot which is above his head had 4 animals each with 4 faces, which is 16.  And the mitre of the High Priest was even longer, because corresponding to his greatness he needed to surrender more and to recognize even more the greatness of his creator and his own lowliness, and this is what it [the Gemara] says 'mitre atones for the arrogant'.  And all of these garments are equal for the High Priest and a normal priest, for they are garments of the (lower) animal soul, regarding which every human being is equal.  However the High Priest in comparison to his brothers had another four garments to clothe his (upper) speaking &amp; intellectual soul.  For the first [garment] is that he should guard his speech and what comes out of his lips should. be nothing but Torah and Awe of Hashem, and he shouldn't increase idle chatter...

Verse 3

<b>And you shall speak:</b> However, the outer garments which hint to the inner garments - make this with craftsmen expert in their craft. Nevertheless, even these craftsmen must be wise-hearted. For I have already clarified in [my] commentary on Proverbs1 that wise-hearted is a very high level. As a wise one is one who acts according to the laws of wisdom; yet he still has an inner war with his impulse. But one who is wise-hearted is one whose wisdom is acquired by his soul and fills all the chambers of his soul. And about this it states, "that I have filled him with a spirit of wisdom': It is an explanation of "to the wise-hearted" - one who has a spirit of wisdom that fills all of his heart, and there is no place found in his heart that is empty for desire, [an evil] impulse and thoughts that are counter to wisdom. And [it is] these wise-hearted ones that shall make Aaron's clothes to sanctify him; as they will understand to what these garments hint...

<b>"And he shall atone [...] once a year"</b> on Yom Kippur "with blood of the sin offering of purification" - the blood of the bull and the goat. And I have explained that which it repeats, "once a year he shall atone," in the commentary on the Sifra (Achrei Mot 84). And on the homiletical level, [this verse] means that Aaron was the root and source of the entire priesthood until the end of all the generations. For all of the descendants of Aharon merited the priesthood in his merit. And the procedure of the high priest on Yom Kippur is called by the name, Aaron - as it is written (Leviticus 16:3), "With this shall Aaron come to the Holy," and so too, always. [That is] because all of the high priests after him entered from his agency and from his merit. Accordingly, the explanation of, "and Aaron shall atone upon its horns," is meaning to say that every priest that atones is called by the name of Aaron. And the explanation of the reason is, because "with blood of the sin offering of purification, once a year he shall atone upon it (or, for him) throughout the ages" - since the atonement of Aaron will endure for eternal generations, "because it/he is most holy to the Lord" - meaning to say that Aaron is most holy, as it is written (I Chronicles 23:13), "And Aaron was separated, to be consecrated as most holy." And so he is the cause of the atonement for [all future] generations, through the service that he performed in the sanctuary on the first Yom Kippur. For this remained as a conduit [for], and to impact upon, the atonements that will be in the [future].

<b><i>And the Lord said</i>:</b> Then He informed him about the part [of this information] that is partly incomprehensible and partly comprehensible. And that is how finite existence emerged out of the Ein Sof [the Unlimited One], who is limitless, and how multiplicity came out of unity and how the place that encompasses all of the worlds came to exist from One who is above place, time, limit, or any change. As the sages of secrets received the secret of contraction [<i>tzimtzum</i>] about this quandary: And it is written at the beginning of the Etz Chaim(1:2), "At the beginning, all of existence was simple light, referred to as the light of the Ein Sof, and there was no empty space or void [...] And when it arose in His will to emanate the emanated and to create the created, etc., He contracted Himself in the middle of His light at the central point[...]. And an empty space remained in between [...] and this place, an empty, circular space [is the place for all the worlds that He made], etc." And the explanation is that to bring out the limited and finite worlds and to establish them in one place from One who is unlimited, it was necessary to formulate Himself in a finite way, together with all the finite worlds, so that they could be set up in a place. Since He is unlimited and has within His power everything that is possible without limit, He also has the possibility of having worlds exist that are limited and finite. So, in order to make this exist, He left his unlimited way. This is represented as contracting Himself and removing His light from that place. Meaning that He removed His unlimited light from there, and empty space and a place were made, so that the limited creatures that needed a place to limit them could be made. Nevertheless, even this contraction is found in His unlimited power. For it is about this that He said, <i>See, there is a place with Me</i>. As since He is the Ein Sof and unlimited, it is necessary that the possibility of contraction also be in His power. And that place was the center in which all of the creation stood. And about that, He said, <i>and position yourself on the rock [tzur]</i>: That with the revelation of this contraction and the empty space, all of the creation that He had wanted to create could be measured and fathomed. And it is already written in the Guide for the Perplexed, Part I, that the word, <i>tzur</i>, indicates the entirety of existence that He formed [<i>yatzar</i>]. That is why He is called the <i>Tzur</i> of the worlds. This means that with this understanding, he was in a position to understand all of the creation that was made in this place
