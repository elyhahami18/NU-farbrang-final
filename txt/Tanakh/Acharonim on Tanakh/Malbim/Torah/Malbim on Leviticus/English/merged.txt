<b>And you shall love your neighbor as yourself:</b>... And the philosophers have already explained that the primary axiom which is the root of moral philosophy is that one should will that everything that he does be a universal axiom (<i>chok kollel</i>). This means that that if he should want that evil occur to his fellow so that he will benefit, he must evaluate it to see if he would want it to be a universal axiom, such that this axiom would be that everyone may cause damage to their fellows when it brings benefit to themselves. And this will certainly not be acceptable to him, that damage should be caused to him in order that benefit come to his fellows. And through this, he too will desist from doing it to his fellow. And likewise if he is able to benefit his fellow and he desists from it, he must evaluate it to see if he would want this to be a universal axiom, such that all people would desist from benefitting him. And this is [the meaning of] that which Rabbi Akiva said, that it is the great principle (<i>klal gadol</i>) of the Torah. However the critical philosophers questioned this maxim, since this axiom is still not universal. For according to this, everyone would act on the basis of the benefit to themselves, whereas it is fitting that all of their actions be on account of axioms of sublime universal reason without any admixture of personal benefit. And for this reason, Ben Azzai elevated the axiom to a more sublime matter when he based [it] on "This is the book of the generations of man." For all men are bound together like one body. All of them were created in the image of God to complete the highest image and form which contains the souls of all mankind. All of them are like one single person, and like one body which is composed of different members... According to this theory, the words of Rabbi Akiva follow his own understanding (<i>leshitato</i>), since he expounds (Sifra Behar 5:43, Bava Metzia 62a), "Your life comes before that of your fellow."

And when you reap: this is already written in Parshat Kedoshim. And there the commentaries came (to interpret) why this matter is doubled (see there). But there is still the question of teh reason that this is written in the middle of the laws of the Festivals? And Rabbi Avordimas said that one of the intentions and purposes of the Festivals and holidays was to sustain the priests of Hashem and the poor - that both of these are dependant on the table of the Almighty to be sustained, like it always says, "you and the Levi and the stranger and the orphan etc". He said that also after the Festival it is commanded upon you to sustain the poor from the gifts of the harvest. And this is one of the benefits of the sacrifices of Hashem on the Festival - that from them the priests would be sustained, as it says, "the fire-offerings of Hashem and His inheritance they will eat" - and this is customary all year and even when the Beit HaMikdash is destroyed. And one who does not take out the portion of the poor is compared as if he refrains from bringing his sacrifices in the Chosen House.

 The land shall have a Shabbat of complete rest (<i>shabbaton</i>), a Shabbat of the Lord: The expression, "Shabbat," is only [otherwise] found with the Shabbat of creation (the seventh day of each week) and on Yom Kippur (as with all of the [other] holidays, it stated, "<i>shabbaton</i>"). And even on Yom Kippur, it stated, "it shall be a Shabbat of <i>shabbaton</i> for you." But the expression, "a Shabbat to the Lord," is only found with Shabbat and with the sabbatical year. For they are testimony that God rested on the seventh [day] and made known the creation of the world. As after the commandment of Shabbat was commanded 'in order that your ox and your donkey and all that you have may rest,' it was fitting that the land also rest and not grow its fruits on the Shabbat day. However, 'the world follows its way' and nature exerts itself and works in its fashion. And so He chose the sabbatical year of the land once in seven years to make up the resting of Shabbat of the six [other] years through them. And it is for this reason that the command of Shabbat was placed adjacent to the prohibition of the sabbatical year in Parshat Mishpatim. As the sabbatical year comes to make up the resting of the Shabbat days. And this [is the meaning of] that which is written, "Six years you may sow your field... But in the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath of complete rest." It means to say after six consecutive years that you plant and you gather and the land does not rest on Shabbat; hence on the seventh year, [it shall be] "a Shabbat of complete rest," to make up the Shabbat days of the six years. Then it explains, "Shabbat of the Lord" - precisely. That is the Shabbat of creation upon which He rested and was refreshed. And it is about this that it stated in the rebuke (Leviticus 26:34), "all the days of desolation, it shall rest what it did not rest on your Shabbats" - meaning to say on the Shabbat [days] of the six years. And it is well-known that the word, day, rests upon one rotation of the sun [over twenty-four hours] from east to west. And it is well known that the movements [around] the sun itself (as opposed to the earth's rotation just described with regards to the day) from west to east is one rotation each year. And, if so, there are two types of days (since a day represents a complete rotation): a day of the daily rotation and a day of the yearly rotation. (As the term, days, also appears about the year - "[a year of] days shall be its redemption" (Leviticus 25:29). As a year also completes the rotation of the planet; so [years] are called, "the days of the Earth," as it is written (Genesis 8:22), "Still all the days of the Earth." For the days of man are counted by the rotation of the planet from east to west, whereas the days of the Earth are counted by the rotation of the paths of the sun in its sphere from west to east. And behold the days of man are gathered into a year when the yearly rotation is finished in 365 days. But the days of the Earth are counted by a year of fifty years, which is called, "forever (<i>olam</i>)," as it is written (Exodus 21:6), "and he is to serve him forever." And because of this, fields return to their owners and 'you shall grant a redemption to the world' [on the fiftieth year]. And there is a hint to this in that which it wrote (Leviticus 25:10), "That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you," meaning to say the fiftieth year, in general, shall be considered a year for the years of the Earth. And the days of man before the flood were 120 years, as it is written (Genesis 6:3), "let their days be then a hundred and twenty years." And likewise were the days of the Earth, as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 97a), "The world will be for six thousand years, and will be in ruins for one." There are 120 jubilees in 6,000 years, and then there will be the 'sabbatical year," hinted to in the Shabbat of the creation with the days of the Holy One, blessed be He. As they said, "The day of the Holy One, blessed be He, is 1,000 years." And that [is the meaning of] that which they said, "Just like it is said about the Shabbat of creation, etc."; and see Ramban. And that which they said, "'Your field' - all of your work, etc.," - it has already been explained (Paragraph 3) that it is an <i>asmakhta</i> (loosely connected teaching).

And I will walk among you, and I will be your God - there are two levels here. (1) Holiness will be inside you, really, in your divine soul, and through holiness the divine soul will again be the master in [your] reality. This is similar to the righteous being described as tenants who are partners to a king in the orchard: even though the garden is not their possession, they are partners with him in their work, by fixing and fencing and trimming the grapevines, so too the righteous are tenants with God, that keep the great garden which is the world, maintaining the world that was created through Ten Sayings through Torah and mitzvot. They stroll with the king through the work, they are partners with the Holy One of Blessing in the works of creation by keeping the great garden with Torah and mitzvot. I [God] say to them - behold I am like you [Sifra, above in this source sheet] because they with their actions sake the lines of judgment and through their decisions they make the world go through lovingkindness and punishment, as the sages say in various places "who rules over Me? The righteous. And  from a second perspective (2) "I will be your God" from the side that God behaves with the righteous according to God's will, for good, and God's reverence will be with them in their recognizing of God's greatness and majesty. And regarding those two aspects it is said "I will place My Sanctuary among them forever.  My Presence shall rest over them; I will be their God and they shall be My people." (Ezekiel 37:26-27). And those are two levels, the tabernacle among them and the Presence in them and above them. And there (Ezekiel 37:28) "And when My Sanctuary abides among them forever, the nations shall know that I, Ad-nai, do sanctify Israel" since once the Presence is in them, and they control all their actions, it is made known to idolaters that Israel is holy and beyond nature.
