Menot HaLevi on Esther

Preface



<b>A commentary</b> on the Scroll of Esther have I understood, composed, established and completed - I, Shlomo HaLevi ben Elkabetz. It is brought as a present to my honorable and glorious father-in-law, the master who has become famous and praised as one who pursues charity and kindness, the wise honorable rabbi, Yitzchak, and he is a priest to the most high God. It is since delightful country has fallen to my lot; lovely indeed is his daughter as my estate, and she has become my wife. And instead of that which is sent by the young men on the day of Purim, I have sent this commentary to him. And I call its name:
<b>The Portion of the Levite, and this is in the year [1529].</b>
